overview disappointing chinese april data spurred speculation that more stimulus will be forthcoming and bolsters hopes that a trade deal with the us by the end of next month helped asian pacific equities advance for the first time this week indonesia which reported a record trade deficit on the back of collapsing exports 13 1 year over year in april nearly twice the decline expected after a 10 fall in march kept the pressure on its equity market at the same time though an unexpected rise in south korean unemployment 4 1 vs 3 8 heightened speculation of a near term rate cut while the equity market rose for the second consecutive session european and us equities have not followed suit the dow jones stoxx 600 has been unable to hold on to the initial gains after yesterday s 1 rise the most since early april while us shares are trading with a softer profile bond yields are mostly softer the us benchmark 10 year yield is slipping through 2 40 while the german benchmark yield is its lowest since 2016 negative 11 bp italy where league leader and deputy pm salvini probably campaigning for the european parliament elections said he would be willing to break the eu fiscal rules to cut the unemployment rate in half has seen its bond and stock underperform italy s bank index has fallen over 12 this month the dollar is mixed but it seems that its role is more like a fulcrum than a key mover the dollar bloc currencies and the scandis on the weaker side of the teeter totter and the yen swiss franc are on the other side with the euro and sterling firm but little changed unchanged unemployment at 14 7 despite calls for deterioration failed to lend the turkish lira much support as the government re imposed a 0 1 foreign exchange fee on some transactions to discourage speculation rather than raise funds asia pacific many observers are suspect of chinese economic data yet there seems to be an asymmetry there is greater disbelief expressed toward strong data than weak data that means that most are willing to accept at face value today s disappointing data industrial output fell to 5 4 from 8 5 in march and well below expectations retail sales slowed to 7 2 from 8 7 fixed asset investment slowed to 6 1 form 6 3 on the other hand unemployment fell to 5 0 from 5 2 and investment in property edged to 11 9 from 11 8 the slowdown does not appear to be the result of the trade shock and the latest escalation is not yet in effect we think china has the will and the resources to make good on what we have called its draghi moment willing to do whatever it takes to bolster the economy in the face of us pressure and the 70th anniversary of the communist revolution japan reported mixed data construction orders jumped 66 in march this follows a small decline in february after a nearly 20 rise in january orders rose by the most in q1 since q2 14 on the other hand preliminary machine tool orders for april slumped by a third 33 4 it is the sixth consecutive year over year decline separately we note that although the japanese yield curve through 10 year is negative the equity market is paying a rich yield the yield of the topix is near 2 5 according to bloomberg this is not only greater than the s p 500 dividend yield just below 2 but it is also above the us 10 year yield the dividend yield of the nikkei is near 2 2 australian wage growth in q1 matched the 0 5 increase in q4 18 but disappointed expectations slightly the weight on the australian dollar is coming from its role as proxy for china and growing speculation of a rate cut actually with today s moves it appears the market is discounting not one but two cuts this year and is leaning toward pricing in a third a strong employment report tomorrow could see the speculation tempered but unlikely to be reversed the dollar remains within monday s trading range against the yen it has not been above jpy110 10 for a week there is a 480 mln option struck at jpy110 that expires today

against the chinese yuan but the pboc operations appear to be resisting the weakness rather than driving it europe uk prime minister may is going to shrug off backbencher concerns when she meets with them tomorrow reports suggest that she will press on and resubmit the withdrawal bill in the first week in june the strategy apparently is counting on a poor showing in the eu parliamentary elections and what is expected to be a strong showing for farage s brexit party and the quick exit pledge while it appeared that parliament had made more remote the possibility of leaving without an agreement the risk of such an exit has perceived to have increased and this is part of the explanation for sterling s weakness german q1 gdp was spot on with expectations expanding 0 4 details are not available with the initial report but the government highlighted the consumer construction and equipment investment while recognizing trade was still a challenge the german economy grew 1 4 in 2018 but is expected to slow to around 0 5 this year pressure on italy is mounting the fissure lines in the government have been clear from the get go but they have been contained however circumstances are changing the attempt to arrange a private bailout of a troubled bank has faltered and it is possible that the unpleasant step to nationalize it may be necessary an adviser of the league s salvini has had to step down due to corruption charges the economy continues to struggle and this translates into a larger budget deficit arguably most importantly is that ahead of the eu parliament elections the league has seen its support wane a bit meanwhile the doom loop linking the banks to the sovereign remains strong the poor performance of italian sovereign bonds the 10 year yield is now with today s

this is an excerpt from regional security in the middle east sectors variables and issues get your free copy here the middle east as a region has been marked by colonial and neo imperial foreign intervention inter state conflict and sectarian violence historians and political scientists have demonstrated the importance of the region in terms of its resources and its strategic geopolitical significance for former german french and british imperial powers in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries as well as the united states in the twentieth and twenty first centuries vitalis 2002 mitchell 2013 the events following september 11 2001 the us invasion of afghanistan and iraq the 2011 arab spring the civil war in syria and the rise of the self proclaimed islamic state of iraq and syria isis have continued to shape both the international and domestic politics of the nation states and the regional organisations that make up the middle east in addition to the conflicts wreaking havoc in the region the water food energy nexus social and political developments and economic challenges have also severely impacted the middle east this chapter will explore the challenges this region faces in terms of its economic in security it will first provide an overview of the water food and energy challenges facing the region as a whole it will then examine the region s attempts at economic integration with a specific focus on the gulf states in the arabian peninsula economists james e rauch and scott kostyshak 2009 divide the middle east and north africa economies into three arab worlds the fuel endowed countries including the gulf countries iraq algeria and libya the arab mediterranean morocco tunisia egypt syria jordan morocco and sub saharan africa including yemen this chapter will focus primarily on the fuel endowed countries and those in the gulf cooperation council gcc the gulf monarchies bahrain kuwait oman qatar saudi arabia and the united arab emirates iraq iran and their attempts at economic integration this chapter will focus on the gcc because in terms of regional economic integration the gulf states have been the most successful at the same time the transboundary nature of the challenges facing the gcc are an excellent illustration of the lack of regional economic integration and economic insecurity in the middle east as the name of the category would suggest one of the primary sub regional commonalities among these fuel endowed countries is the predominance of oil and natural gas exports in their national economies indeed these nation states particularly the gulf kingdoms produce about 20 of the world s oil and contain 30 of the world s oil reserves gause 2015 similarities among these nation states extend not only to their economic dependency on the export of hydrocarbons but also include similar security and development concerns murden 2009 130 the latter sections of this chapter will thus address some of these common developments and security challenges continuing reliance on hydrocarbons increasing regional and national inequality and a growing number of unemployed young adults in conclusion this essay will also link the economic insecurity in the region to regional security regional economic overview this chapter will first briefly address the transregional economy of the middle east and north africa mena as is well known the economy of the mena region is dominated by a reliance on the extraction and export of hydrocarbons due to the predominance of oil and gas in several of the economies especially in the gcc this region has experienced rapid economic growth at the same time this economic growth is dependent particularly in the gcc countries on a rentier economy this specific economic model is based on government subsidised food medical services and energy through the wealth gained by the export of oil and gas mckee et al 2017 20 problematically the continued reliance on the rentier state model limits the creation of strong domestic industries in addition because the government is the primary actor that distributes the rents the private sector has very little room to thrive mckee et al 2017 20 the main rentier states and in turn the states with the highest gdp in the mena region are saudi arabia united arab emirates kuwait iraq qatar bahrain libya algeria the rest of the region is made up of both middle and low income states which lack the large hydrocarbon resources found in the fuel endowed states mckee et al 2017 the regional predominance of the rentier economic model thus also generates a regional inequality among mena states according to alvaredo and piketty 2014 this high inequality at the regional level can be traced back to high inequality per capita gnp for example some of the richest states in terms of gdp per capita belonging to the mena region such as qatar exist side by side with some of the lowest income states such as yemen and sudan alvaredo and piketty 2014 mckee et al 2017 21 as an illustration of regional inequality recent research has pointed to the labour market as an illuminating example specifically the movement of young professionals from states like egypt lebanon syria and the occupied palestinian territories to the gcc states in order to fill service jobs in medicine engineering education and business mckee et al 2017 23 this movement of young people thus limits the potential economic growth of the origin states thereby increasing regional inequality among states by extension the movement of young professionals into the higher paying jobs in the gcc is further exacerbated by the gap between the formal and informal job markets and the reliance on the public sector for job creation mckee et al 2017 24 in addition to the above transregional economic challenges the region also faces increasing insecurity in terms of food water and energy thus to further home in on economic problems facing this region and the gcc group this chapter will now specifically examine the water food energy security nexus that challenges most of the states within this region the water food energy nexus in the middle east before analysing economic in security in a specific sub region in the middle east i will first address problems that plague the middle east region as a whole namely water food energy insecurity and lack of crucial infrastructure as food water and energy demands remain unmet due to an increasing population economic growth and urbanisation conflict both within and between states become more likely according to sullivan 2013 this water food energy security nexus could drastically affect both food and water security in the future 11 the reasons behind water food and energy insecurity are manifold these problems range from the desert climate to the gross misuse of existing renewable fresh water resources climate change and conflict throughout the region also continues to threaten both food and water supplies undp 2011 an investigation into the land morphology of the region reveals that the region is one of the most arid in the world because of this arid desert climate the region suffers from a lack of rainfall and high evaporation rates the drier climate impacts both the availability of renewable water resources as well as the production of agricultural products according to a recent unesco report on water for a sustainable world three countries in the middle east iran turkey and iraq contain renewable water resources above 1 000 cubic meters per capita the renewable water resources in four additional countries lebanon morocco egypt and syria exceed 500 cubic meters but remain below 1 000 cubic meters per person per year the remaining countries in the mena region fall below the 500 cubic meter cut off wwdr 2015 on top of inadequate renewable surface water resources and weak institutional oversight a lack of water governance has resulted in increasing water insecurity throughout the region newer challenges such as decreasing water quality water misuse droughts and floods climate change and transboundary conflicts have all added further complexity to an already challenging water situation the water food energy nexus challenges in the gcc group provide an illuminating example the gulf monarchies have very little renewable surface and subsurface water resources on average in this sub region the per capita renewable water resource supply amounts to 92 cubic meters per capita kuwait for example can only provide seven cubic meters of fresh water per year saudi arabia contains about 874 cubic meters aidrous 2014 yet due to a surge in population growth and urbanisation the consumption of fresh water in the gulf states has spiked dramatically aidrous 2014 in response governments have become reliant on the extraction of non renewable fresh water from subsurface aquifers and the expensive desalination of sea water to meet demand the gcc economies now make up almost 50 of the global desalination capacity world bank 2017 while the world bank does concede that desalination could potentially alleviate some future water shortfalls it does come with a price world bank 2012 the desalination process requires a large energy input which is largely dependent on fossil fuel consumption the problem is that as the price of fossil fuels continues to fluctuate desalination becomes more and more expensive as long as it requires fossil fuels to operate efficiently world bank 2012 in fact a recent article reports that as the populations grow in the gcc states water will become a more expensive geostrategic resource than oil one ton of fresh water is already more expensive than a ton of oil aidrous 2014 despite the expense the price of water in this part of the world is heavily subsidised by the government and there is very little institutional oversight and control over its use these two factors in turn contribute to the over consumption and misuse of this scarce resource by wealthy citizens who build private pools golf courses and gardens in states like kuwait yet while government water subsidies primarily help the middle and wealthy classes people living in poverty in the gulf sub region gain little benefit undp 2011 droughts for example primarily affect those populations who live in rural areas beyond water and energy infrastructure and are thus dependent on wells which can dry up sullivan 2013 food insecurity in the gcc states reflects a similar disproportionate distribution it is a distribution that primarily benefits the wealthy and the middle classes but hurts poorer segments of the population the mena region is a large food importer in part due to the lack of arable land and declining water supply while the region continues to see a population boom and thus an increase in demand for food the local production of food cannot keep up world bank 2017 to ensure food security governments have expanded the production of agricultural crops that consume a large amount of fresh water yet while the agricultural sector consumes a large percentage of available water throughout the arabian peninsula in states like saudi arabia the agriculture sector only contributes five per cent of gdp but utilises 88 of fresh water resources aidrous 2014 the undp report argues that this water consumption is ultimately untenable as the region becomes more dependent on desalination the local production of food becomes unsustainable undp 2011 thus as water becomes scarcer and the price of hydrocarbons continues to fluctuate water and food insecurity could possibly lead to further conflict in the region undp 2011 a growing population and a concomitant increase in demand for both food and water will continue to put pressure on the gulf economies conflict between states for dwindling resources also contributes to increasing economic insecurity sullivan 2013 finally the lack of critical infrastructure for private and public investment throughout the region continues to stunt economic growth the central governments in the gcc states have neglected to develop their respective rural and peripheral areas the exclusion of these areas in general development programs has only continued to exacerbate inequality and poverty sika 2012 11 indeed the undp 2011 report notes that programs focused on the construction of infrastructure roads rural clinics affordable housing water supply networks are critical for sustained economic growth 100 furthermore important infrastructure like desalination plants and hydrocarbon production plants are vulnerable to conflict and war which could potentially disrupt gcc economies keeping the above regional problems in mind the rest of this chapter will now examine the economic in security of the gcc economies beginning with a short historical overview of middle eastern economic integration economic integration in the middle east although the middle east region does indeed share islamic and pan arab transnational ideas that have been co opted by political elites in an attempt to unify and integrate the region the post colonial middle east nonetheless remains a heterogeneous region caught between sunni and shi a tribal islam and the post colonial nation state as well as territorial disputes and the israel palestine struggle ahmed 2013 in the twentieth century political leaders like egyptian colonel gamal abdel nasser under the banner of pan arabism and anti imperialism sought to promote a regional identity in response to european imperialism and colonialism yet following the defeat of nasser in the 1967 war against israel the arab unity movement declined and left a fractured region made up of warring post colonial arab states hudson 1999 19 as put forward by cummings and hinnebusch 2013 the clash between regional pan islamic or pan arabic supranational structures e g islamic empires and the imposed european nation state poses a fundamental challenge to the legitimacy of the political elite in post colonial arab states 125 in the present regional cooperation in the mena region is ostensibly based on non intervention in each other s domestic affairs hudson 1999 13 as a result in contrast to more economically integrated regions like the european union eu the middle east is one of the least integrated areas in the world de albuquerque 2016 17 according to de albuquerque 2016 this lack of formal economic integration is in part due to two factors arab state driven nationalist economies and the fear of the political elite in smaller states that have concerns that countries like egypt under nasser or saudi arabia could potentially utilise regional organisations to dominate the region 18 yet that is not to argue that there have not been any attempts by the political elite in the middle east to establish more formal economic arrangements especially among the gulf kingdoms in the 1970s and the 1980s the political elite in the middle east embarked on major economic liberalisation privatisation and deregulation projects in their respective states in the past two decades further trade liberalisation continued as more states in the middle east joined the world trade organisation wto rauch and kostyshak 2009 point out that between 1970 and 2006 the three arab worlds in comparison to countries in latin america and southern europe gained considerably in the three categories that make up the human development index hdi life expectancy educational attainment and income between those decades both the arab mediterranean and the fuel endowed nation states outpaced southern europe in both life expectancy and income for example by 2006 life expectancy in the fuel endowed states was higher than in southern europe rauch and kostyshak 2009 in addition to the world trade organisation wto 23 states joined the greater arab free trade area gafta which encompasses a number of commodities states have attempted to cooperate in smaller sub regional organisations over the decades as well two sub regional organisations include states that are in geographical proximity to each other and have historical economic ties the arab maghreb union amu which includes tunisia morocco algeria libya and mauritania and the mashreq that includes five states egypt jordan syria iraq and libya the oldest and most successful economic and trading bloc within the gafta is the gulf cooperation council boughanmi al shammaki and antimiani 2016 in may 1981 six arab gulf states decided to form the gulf cooperation council gcc the six original member states bahrain kuwait oman qatar saudi arabia and the united arab emirates established the gcc in response to the fall of the shah in iran the resulting islamic revolution and the iran iraq war abdulla 1999 151 while the six member states have achieved some agreement over security policies especially in response to the 2011 arab spring the exact nature and goals of the gcc remains rather ambiguous abdulla 1999 160 the stated goals of the gcc according to its charter do not add more specificity to effect coordination integration and interconnection between member states charter of the gcc neither a strict security community a political alliance nor an economic integration venture the gcc remains a loose collaboration among nation states that share islam as a religion arabic as a common language a similar tribal heritage and a common economic dependence on the export of oil and natural gas abdulla 1999 160 the economic structure of the gcc has over the years undergone changes in an attempt to deepen the arrangement among its members in 1983 the gcc established a free trading zone that exempted local products and services from tariffs and taxes and since the end of 2008 member states have also established a common market in 2015 the gcc also put a customs union into effect karns et al 2015 232 these economic measures have resulted in some success according to an al jazeera report in 2013 the combined economies of gcc member states had an aggregate gdp of 1 62 trillion which made the sub region the twelfth largest economy in the world abdulqader 2015 the gcc was also the fourth largest exporter in the world after china the us and germany these exports consisted primary of crude oil natural gas and other petrochemical products abdulqader 2015 that said these economic accomplishments have been quickly overshadowed by a drop in world oil prices between 2014 and 2016 the civil war in syria the war in yemen and the conflict with the islamic state according to the world bank 2016 saw the growth of gcc economies slow to 1 6 as the problems of the oil sector affected other economic sectors world bank 2018 indeed the middle east as a region has experienced a growth rate of less than three per cent in the last five years this slower than expected growth rate may continue as the gcc economies face unstable global oil prices world bank 2018 indeed the long term economic outlook for this region will continue to deteriorate if the gulf oil producers do not further diversify their economies isa 2018 stevens 2016 the gcc nonetheless remains the most successful attempt at regional integration in the mena region other regional attempts beyond the gcc have largely failed the eu due to its proximity and historical connections to the mena region has also attempted to promote regional and economic integration in the middle east through various policy measures with non eu states in 1995 the eu and the mediterranean states algeria morocco the palestinian authority israel syria jordan malta lebanon tunisia greek cyprus and turkey established the euro mediterranean partnership emp which sought to promote economic integration and stability between the eu and the mena region the failure of the emp in part due to the collapse of the 2000 israeli palestinian peace process cleared the way for former french president sarkozy s proposed union for the mediterranean ufm envisioned as a continuation of the emp the ufm also floundered on the israeli palestinian conflict and therefore failed to further integrate the two regions yildiz 2012 122 in 2003 2004 renewed in 2011 the eu launched the european neighbourhood policy enp the goals outlined by the enp included promotion of the eu s normative agenda the spread of democracy human rights and good governance in the mena region del sarto 2016 218 yet even prior to the arab spring brussels worked with the authoritarian rulers in the mena periphery in an effort to stabilise and secure the region del sarto 2016 225 brussels initial failure to respond to the arab spring in 2011 only further highlights the ineffective and paradoxical nature of the enp yet despite the apparent successes of the gcc relative to other attempts at regional integration the sub regional institution remains divided by internal strife among its members the proposed common currency the gulf dinar remains in limbo after the uae rejected the common monetary project because of the plan to locate the central bank in the capital of saudi arabia riyadh instead of abu dhabi ulrichsen 2017 in another instance the monarchies in the gcc led by saudi arabia in a response to the events of the arab spring sought to establish thicker political and security ties with the monarchies in morocco and jordan in order to counter the protests and demonstrations that overthrew established dictators in egypt libya and tunisia sean yom 2014 argues that the eight monarchies that exist in the middle east represent an epistemic community ungirded by a pan royal identity which sees itself as under threat by these protests in 2011 saudi arabia s then king abdullah led the initiative by proclaiming that the gcc needed a gulf union with a regional integrated security and military policy yet despite yet two more gcc summit sessions in bahrain 2012 and kuwait 2013 king abdullah s envisioned integrated political union did not materialise ulrichsen 2017 while the gcc sub region is not as economically or politically integrated as some other regions in the world the nation states within this sub region face similar problems the rest of this essay will examine two problematic areas hydrocarbon dependence and the confluence of high inequality and increasing youth unemployment the decline of oil wealth in the middle east one of the enduring economic problems in this sub region is its economic dependence on the export of hydrocarbons the middle east contains half of the world s oil and gas reserves and thus has been and remains a crucial strategic and geopolitical region marked by foreign interventions which have sought to control the production of oil tagliapetra 2017 yet as the global energy market turns toward renewable energy sources oil reserves begin to dwindle and low carbon emission technologies gain popularity in response to climate change the economies of the primary oil exporting nation states in the gcc face a steep challenge this section will briefly go over the history of oil in the middle east and then detail the current challenges facing the region due to its reliance on the export of oil in the twentieth and twenty first centuries western european empires and later the united states helped transform the mena region into a key node in the global energy circuit during the latter half of the twentieth century and as british and french imperial power declined the united states power expanded throughout the middle east premised on partnerships between state power and western oil companies vitalis 2002 the turning point in the production of crude oil was the end of the second world war the meeting between franklin d roosevelt and the future founder of the kingdom of saudi arabia abd al aziz ibn saud onboard the uss quincy in 1945 sealed the fateful relationship between the united states and saudi arabia thereby cementing the role of the united states in the middle east jones 2012 vitalis 2002 from 1940 to the 1970s middle eastern states followed the general economic global trend that stressed a developmentalist model which emphasised what tarik yousef 2004 92 terms the interventionist redistributive model in this narrative it was the state s responsibility to intervene in the national economy to address social and economic ills important for oil exporting states in the middle east in terms of this model were the increasing oil revenues which allowed these states to sustain their welfare systems according to yousef 2004 95 for major oil producers like algeria iraq and saudi arabia oil revenues permitted the creation of vast welfare systems that served as mechanisms for the distribution of oil wealth to citizens the tremendous wealth generated by oil exports allowed at least between 1950 and 1970 for unprecedented levels of economic growth yousef 2004 96 this growth was in part caused by government investment in infrastructure education health and state owned businesses yet by 1980 a more competitive international economy weak oil prices and a reduction in the demand for migrant labour marked the roots of an economic crisis yousef 2004 to raise oil prices iran iraq kuwait saudi arabia and venezuela met in baghdad and established the organisation of petroleum exporting countries opec opec s importance would become clear following the 1973 october war in which egypt launched a surprise attack on the israeli military in order to capture the sinai peninsula as a response to the us s support of israel saudi arabia and other oil producers nationalised the oil production and pricing and enacted an embargo on oil export thereby driving up the price jones 2012 211 yet in the 1980s and 1990s the region underwent a period of economic trade liberalisation privatisation and deregulation under the supervision of international monetary institutions and structural adjustment policies in response to the 1980s debt crisis while as hanieh notes 2016 there were some protests against some of these austerity measures the neoliberal policies that were popular outside of this region were implemented by middle eastern governments throughout the region hanieh 2016 in the following decades further conflict among nation states in the middle east and foreign intervention damaged oil production infrastructure in the region the 1990 invasion of kuwait by iraq the 1990 1991 gulf war the 2003 invasion of iraq and the subsequent global war on terror allowed regimes throughout the middle east to both suppress dissent in the name of fighting terrorism and request more international resources to do so dahi 2011 more recently lower oil prices in 2014 from a high of 115 per barrel in 2013 to under 40 per barrel in 2014 as well as the conflicts currently enveloping the region have led to slower growth in all of the major oil exporting countries ghafar 2018 a recent world bank report forecast that the gcc s economy will grow by 2 7 in 2020 furthermore according to the same report iran the second largest economy in the region will grow by 4 3 by 2020 world bank 2018 despite the more optimistic report on gdp growth in the region the gcc s continued dependence on oil exports remains a problem as per a recent international strategic analysis report the wealthiest oil and gas exporting countries still account for 62 of the region s gdp isa 2018 thus because earlier attempts at diversifying their economies away from oil have failed the volatility of the global oil market nonetheless puts the gcc economies at risk in response to the decline in oil prices several of the gcc member states released economic strategic plans that outline economic diversification strategies generally these plans emphasise increased private investment in the economy the generation of jobs and the creation of more opportunities for education and innovation tagliapetra 2017 16 the crown prince mohammed bin salman of saudi arabia and his group of advisors recently released an example of one of these plans named the saudi vision 2030 this strategic plan focused on moving the saudi arabian economy away from its dependence on oil improving the life of its citizens and increasing the role of the private sector in the national economy in actuality the diversification of saudi arabia s economy is perhaps more difficult than perhaps suggested by the 2030 plan as ghafar 2018 points out about 90 of saudi arabia s export earnings and 42 of its gdp are still dependent on oil and oil related industries ghafar 2018 further argues that a weakness of the 2030 plan is its lack of consideration for the political costs of the plan on citizens these political costs become more apparent as the food water energy nexus is disrupted as demonstrated by the conflict in syria food and water insecurity can act as factors that can lead to civil war sullivan 2013 inequality and youth unemployment discontent with the ruling classes and authoritarian governments in the middle east came to a head in 2011 as the arab spring uprisings overthrew authoritarian leaders in egypt tunisia and libya while the arab spring uprisings primarily involved the autocrats of the arab republics who undertook economic reforms under the auspices of the imf and the world bank which boosted their economies but undermined their legitimacy the gcc group was largely spared two of its poorest members bahrain and oman also experienced demonstrations that protested pervasive corruption wealth inequality and limited political rights feiler 2013 112 this section will first examine how the gulf kingdoms avoided the same fate as their neighbours it will then examine the transregional economic problems specifically youth unemployment and inequality that continue to trouble the region according to galip daly 2017 the gulf monarchies were able to withstand the arab spring by employing a three pronged strategy aid packages and development crackdowns and a counter revolution in other words wealthy gcc members like saudi arabia increased their domestic social welfare packages in order to stave off uprisings this first strategy is just a more extreme version of what a 2011 un report on arab development challenges terms rent governance or put differently the social contract between the political elite and the citizens in the gulf monarchies is based on the exchange of certain political rights and freedoms for social welfare policies low or no taxation and healthcare undp 2011 in this economic model the state uses rent oil in this case to undergird the legitimacy of the ruling class through redistributive measures sika 2012 10 in addition to this domestic policy wealthy gcc members were also offered development packages worth billions of dollars to non gcc monarchies jordan and morocco so that these kingdoms could also prevent social unrest yom 2016 the second strategy consisted of cracking down on social media and political groups while concomitantly increasing welfare benefits the last part of the strategy involved the monarchs in saudi arabia and uae who attempted to launch a regional counter revolution against the arab spring uprising although the gulf kingdoms did avoid the uprisings that toppled the autocrats in egypt libya and tunisia the decline of this sub region s oil wealth may require this region to renew their social contract with their respective populations the gulf region faces several problems that may impact future policy decisions the middle east s extreme inequality in conjunction with a high number of unemployed youth continues to hurt this region economically according to the world inequality report 2018 the inequality in the middle east is the highest in the world the report claims that between 1990 and 2016 the top ten per cent in the region enjoyed 60 66 of the wealth in the region conversely the bottom 50 only accumulates 10 of the regional wealth alvaredo et al 2018 131 this report demonstrates the contradictory nature of the gcc economies while these economies are some of the richest in the world their levels of poverty and inequality are some of the highest among their respective poor citizens the origin of this high inequality lies in the ownership of oil and those who can transform it into wealth alvaredo et al 2018 131 during the growth period in the 1970s the gcc states never truly built a true developmentalist state instead dahi argues that such states are able to use public investment to create an economy characterised by a set of assets based on knowledge exploited by skilled labor with highly selective meritocratic recruitment dahi 2011 3 in other words the gulf kingdoms much like the other nation states in the mena region rely on a rentier state model in the gcc countries the economic systems are defined by high political control over the economy with informal connections between rulers and the business elite sika 2012 9 the gulf monarchies rely on corporatist and client networks that provide stability and political control for the monarchies who in return provide socio economic development for the rising business class sika 2012 yet as the wealth from oil resources continues to decline the current model of governance in the persian gulf states may change as the vision 2013 demonstrates the policy makers and monarchs of saudi arabia look to guide the economy away from its dependence on oil a chatham house report notes that if indeed the redistributive policies employed by the monarchy are limited in the future the ruling elite will need to reestablish its legitimacy in that report kinninmont 2017 argues that this search for a new foundation for its legitimacy could mean greater consultation and public involvement in decision making or perhaps more likely emphasise the importance of royal rule as a bulwark against insecurity terrorism and chaos while maintaining or intensifying an authoritarian mode of rule the uncertain economic future and the high inequality in the persian gulf also poses problems for the large number of youths in these countries much like in the countries that were at the centre of the arab spring the gulf monarchies have a high rate of youth unemployment feiler 2013 wary of the arab spring and the large number of youths who participated in the uprisings the governments in this region are increasingly aware of this predicament according to the 2016 un human development report youths between the ages of 15 and 29 comprise about 30 of the region s population or about 105 million people the report further notes that a rise in conflict political instability a lack of decent jobs and a decline in wages is forcing youth to temporarily or permanently leave their countries of origin undp 2016 although the gcc countries have the lowest unemployment in the middle east the gcc members have high unemployment among their respective national youth sika 2012 for instance the unemployment for people between the ages of 15 and 24 in saudi arabia is 30 problematically the predominance of the oil sector has resulted in a weak private sector that does not have enough available jobs to absorb the increasing number of unemployed al khatteeb 2015 moreover when youths do enter the job market they are marginalised by individuals who have connections to the political elite sika 2012 conclusion although strategic economic plans like the vision 2030 do acknowledge these problems it remains to be seen whether the gcc states can actually address increasing inequality unemployment and a decline in oil wealth while these problems do transcend national borders in the persian gulf region the gcc remains ineffective at addressing these economic issues moreover the water food energy security nexus and its challenges remain integral for both economic and national regional security throughout the region sullivan 2013 in sum economic insecurity both nationally and sub regionally in turn influences the security of the middle east as a whole most recently tensions between members of the gcc group saudi arabia bahrain and the united emirates on one side versus qatar on the other threaten the unity of the regional organisation ulrichsen 2017 reports that the standoff between qatar and its neighbours resulted from qatari leaders and the qatar based al jazeera s support of both the arab spring uprisings in syria yemen and north africa and of the muslim brotherhood and other islamist organisations qatar s support of the arab spring and organisations like the muslim brotherhood are problematic for saudi arabian policy makers who view islamist organisations and iran as regional security threats in response to qatar s support of terrorism the saudi led coalition which included bahrain egypt and the uae launched a land air and naval blockade of qatar ulrichsen 2017 as the qatar crisis continues possible economic and security unity continues to be questioned by the inability of the gcc to align the interest of its members geopolitical clashes among gcc states and its neighbours continue to be guided by national priorities rather than regional or transnational interests moreover conflicts increase economic insecurity which in turn make conflict both within and between states more likely that said a common thread in terms of regional security in the gcc states does exist the united states continues to play a vital role in the persian gulf region in terms of regime security of the gulf monarchies following the arab spring jones 2012 notes that the leaders of the closest allies of the us in the region saudi arabia oman and bahrain were more than willing to turn us purchased weapons on their own people indeed the us s continued support of these regimes and military domination in the region represents just another factor that continues to undermine any attempt at regional and economic integration whether the economic and regional security situation of the gcc states will improve in the future remains to be seen note note the world bank made this

that nearly one third of global oil production and nearly all of global spare capacity are in the middle east the oil market is very sensitive to any attacks on oil infrastructure in this region swiss bank ubs said adding it expected brent prices to rise toward us 75 in coming weeks the attacks took place against a backdrop of u s iranian tension following washington s decision this month to try to cut iran s oil exports to zero and to beef up its military presence in the gulf in response to what it said were iranian threats meanwhile the organization of the petroleum exporting countries said that world demand for its oil would be higher than expected this year as supply growth from rivals including u s shale producers slows that points to a tighter market if the exporter group refrains

on sunday the international monetary fund imf agreed in principle to support pakistan with a loan of 6 billion to be disbursed over 39 months the agreement was reached at the end of two weeks of discussion and dialogue between pakistani officials and an imf mission that was in islamabad from april 29 to may 11 the disbursements will commence after formal approval by the fund s management and its executive board this is the imf s 13th bailout package for pakistan in the last three decades while pakistan s economy typically witnesses a boom bust cycle over the last 10 years its need for financial support from the imf has coincided with the completion of a particular government s term advertisement the backsliding of pakistan s economy over the past year has been swift but it has not surprised many a sharp depreciation in the pakistani rupee and high fiscal deficits have resulted in higher inflation which acts like a tax on the common man and hurts the poor the most foreign exchange reserves have remained low below 10 billion for all weeks except three since the pakistan tehreek e insaf won the elections and imran khan was sworn in as prime minister on august 18 2018 imf loans almost always come with tough conditions and it will be difficult for khan to sell the bailout politically khan has expressed himself against seeking financial support from the fund in the past and in the run up to last year s elections he criticised the bailouts accepted by governments led by the pakistan people s party and the pakistan muslim league n advertisement in september 2013 within three months of being elected the nawaz sharif government accepted a 6 6 billion loan from the fund to be disbursed over three years earlier within a year of the ppp s yousaf raza gillani taking charge as the prime minister in march 2008 the imf extended a 7 6 billion loan to pakistan to be disbursed over 23 months despite the reservations he has had in the past imran khan had little choice but to negotiate with the imf advertisement also read pakistan s quest for imf bailout costs finance minister central bank governor and top revenue officer their jobs and what are the economic conditions in which pakistan entered into negotiations with the fund the size of pakistan s economy is 313 billion and it has averaged a growth of about 3 5 annually over the last 12 years after growing at a healthy 5 2 in fy 2018 july 1 2017 to june 30 2018 pakistan s real gdp growth is estimated to sharply power down to 3 4 in fy 2019 according to the world bank in 2019 20 the bank expects the economy to slow further to 2 7 inflation has more than doubled since the last year it ruled at 8 8 in april this year ahead of ramzan in the last financial year average consumer price inflation was 3 9 advertisement the country also stares at a twin deficit problem with both its fiscal and current account deficits set to worsen in fy 2019 from 6 6 of gdp in fy 2018 the fiscal deficit or excess of government expenditure over its revenues may breach the 7 of gdp mark in fy 2019 the current account deficit or excess of spending on imports over exports is expected to remain high at 5 5 of gdp in this fiscal albeit slightly lower than 6 1 of gdp in fy 2018 the pakistani rupee has been devalued multiple times since december 2017 and has lost almost 35 in the last 18 months so how urgent was this bailout for pakistan after coming to power khan has reached out to saudi arabia the united arab emirates uae and china for help riyadh pledged 3 billion in balance of payments support in october last year and the uae supported pakistan with another 3 billion in december in february this year china extended 3 5 billion in loans and grants to bolster pakistan s forex reserves advertisement china s president xi jinping and saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman pakistan s friends have extended financial support the new york times china s president xi jinping and saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman pakistan s friends have extended financial support the new york times but all this has not helped in addressing the problem which requires medium term structural overhaul for the week ended may 3 2019 the net forex reserves with the state bank of pakistan the country s central bank were 8 98 billion more than a billion dollars less than the 10 23 billion available with it on august 17 2018 the day before khan became pm these forex reserves are enough to finance only about two months of imports pakistan s imports in fy 2018 were 56 billion low forex reserves dent the confidence that the world has in a country s ability to meet its external obligations what kind of conditions has the imf put on pakistan the bailout conditions that the fund imposes are part of difficult structural reforms required to put an economy on a sustained growth path as the imf management proceeds with formally approving pakistan s bailout it will closely watch for signals to rein in the deficit in the budget for the next year advertisement the forthcoming budget for fy2019 20 is a first critical step in the authorities fiscal strategy the imf said in a statement issued may 12 after reaching an agreement to extend the 6 billion loan to pakistan broadly the imf will expect the government to expand the tax base do away with exemptions and curtail special treatments given that just about a million people out of the 208 million in pakistan pay taxes it will call for spending cuts and levying of user charges in the energy sector and reducing subsidies the imf will also expect pakistan to let the rupee float that is allow its value to be market determined and the state bank of pakistan to further increase policy rates to bring inflation under control is all of this expected to work pakistan s record in sticking to agreements with the imf is not encouraging it has often failed to meet conditions such as curtailing spending and selling government stake in state owned enterprises imf data suggest that pakistan did not withdraw the entire amount originally agreed upon in the earlier bailouts the last bailout of 6 6 billion in 2013 was however fully received by 2016 pakistan needs to take bold steps to fix its economy and as it moves in that direction ensure that its poor do not suffer from the austerity measures that are put in place
interview with dimitri speck given the massive intervention and monetary manipulation experiment by central banks over the last decade the amount of distortions created in the market as well as the record debt accumulation at all levels of the economy have given rise to considerable risks for investors for a more detailed understanding of these issues and for his outlook i turned to dimitri speck a renowned expert in the development of trading systems and in seasonal analysis whose experience and successful career spans over two decades mr speck founder and head analyst of seasonax also has valuable insights into the history of the gold market as illustrated in his book the gold cartel he therefore has a very unique perspective forged through his experience developing successful trading strategies combined with his knowledge and deep understanding of economics and the history of our monetary system claudio grass cg after a decade of aggressively expansionist policies by central banks it would seem we stand at an impasse central bankers cannot normalize their policies without risking a market crash and a toxic debt meltdown while their current overstretched position means they won t have enough ammunition to fight the next crisis how do you see this playing out the gold cartel gover d speck best price 9 16 buy new 44 67 as of 05 40 utc details dimitri speck ds in the short term low interest rates stimulate the economy in the long run however the persistent and aggressive manipulation keeping all interest rates at ultra low levels since 2008 has led to massive undesirable developments as the state s interest burden fell politicians wasted money that could have been used productively somewhere else in addition due to this overly accommodative environment inefficient companies stayed in the market reducing the resources and employees available to other more promising companies in theory the low interest rates could also have been used to repay and reduce debt in reality however they facilitated new borrowing and thus encouraged over indebtedness as a result bubbles developed in the stock and in the real estate markets which in turn led to further malinvestments in a nutshell the low interest rate policy weakened the real economy and at the same time increased debt that s the exact opposite effect of what would have been desirable overall it is typical of the hubris of central bankers who try to plan and control the economy to also try and stimulate it by cutting interest rates personally i even think that it is not the task of the central banks to set interest rates to begin with however there is one more tool that remained the printing press it will most probably be used heavily and excessively as well cg the federal reserve already reversed its plans and announced that there will be no interest rate hikes this year and its intentions to slow down its tightening and end it in september as it is currently facing increased pressure from president trump to cut rates and even to resume qe what is your assessment of this dovish policy direction and its expected impact on the economy ds the effect of interest rate cuts is often overestimated they do not prevent a bear market in stocks nor do they fend off a recession as shown in 2000 2008 and even in the 1930s it is about the usual sequence of boom crash and crisis supporters of a solid monetary system like myself strongly criticize the credit excesses of the boom phase and want to avoid them as we clearly see the inevitability of what will come next as it has time and time again nowadays however most politicians academics and journalists subscribe to the idea that it is crucial to combat a crisis by printing money afterwards this idea is naturally more popular than sound and responsible policies however in practice it only prolongs the credit excess and increases it as we can see since the financial crisis of 2008 anyone who wants to prevent a deflationary collapse like the one in the 1930s must prevent mass debt defaults immediately afterwards however the debt levels should be reduced but still it is much better to just avoid the credit excess in the first place on a global scale we are now so heavily indebted that it is unrealistic to hope for any meaningful debt reduction instead resorting to the printing press and strong inflation is a much more likely scenario cg europe appears to be particularly vulnerable with a stalled economy and an ailing banking sector with banks like deutsche bank and italian lenders in serious trouble as well as incredible amounts of public debt in the bloc what do you think the implications are for the outlook of the eurozone europe s main problem is the faulty design of the euro it stands too high for italy and france and too low for germany this has already caused damage amounting to some thousand billion euros however there are further vulnerabilities and risk factors in the euro area and those are as diverse as they are deeply entrenched in their respective member state economies overall the push towards further centralization and the entire idea of trying to forcibly integrate and fuse together economies of different speeds and wildly varying profiles has delivered questionable results and i expect it to continue to weigh down the bloc going forward combined with the dangerously high debt levels i believe europe s economic outlook is far from reassuring nevertheless it s not just europe that is problematic other regions have their own failures too japan is completely overindebted there is no historical comparison to its current state at all in china debt has risen by about one hundred percentage points of gdp in ten years the fastest increase in a larger economy in peacetime the us has record levels of public debt and a very high budget deficit it also carries the weight of the status of the us dollar as the world s reserve currency politicians love this status because it allows them to cheaply borrow money they typically waste for instance on an oversized military but the citizens are suffering from this reserve status of the currency it is overvalued for decades which has severely damaged the us export industry cg how do you interpret the steady gold accumulation by central banks in recent years e g russia china etc ds i believe that this was just the beginning in the end it will be very tempting for the us to get rid of its debts by devaluing its own currency many creditors are abroad especially central banks if the non american central banks notice the loss of the value of their assets they will buy much more gold then the historically unusual and economically fatal situation where central banks hold the bonds of mainly one country will finally come to an end this is one of the reasons i have an optimistic view of gold s performance in the months and years to come also given the global economic and political landscape that is troubling to say the least gold s appeal is bound to rise and not just among institutional investors cg how about silver s outlook do you think that because it has been dormant for so long many investors tend to overlook its potential silver should rise even more than gold its price is historically very low relative to gold as soon as the precious metal s bull market comes into gear silver traditionally rises faster the reason is that the above ground inventory in relation to consumption production is larger in the case of gold compared to silver this slows down the rise in the gold price more as some gold is sold out of these inventories silver on the other hand has relatively lower above ground inventories so it can rise even more cg you have extensively analyzed the history of manipulation in the gold market making a compelling case in your book the gold cartel based on your insights what the relevant effects and implications for investors and is this something they should also bear in mind today ds on august 5th 1993 some western central banks had begun to manipulate the price of gold one of the ways in which this was done back then was physical supply through sales and loans however since 2001 this has had no negative impact on the price anymore central banks reclaimed the gold they had lent which ultimately other central banks delivered through sales the price of gold rose there is no threat of physical supply in large quantities today as well the gold suppression through sales and loans is history the other way to suppress the price of gold was the selling of futures to demotivate investors this can still happen at any time but this method only has a long term effect if investors have alternative investments in an environment of low real interest rates these alternatives are rising stock prices that was the case after 2011 and a similar effect was seen in the mid 1970s however for the foreseeable future real interest rates will not rise due to over indebtedness and stocks are valued as high as they were in 2000 in terms of market capitalization to gdp so a long term rise of the stock market is very unlikely for these reasons the gold price manipulation will no longer work in the long term and thus no investor has to fear it cg overall given the truly grim prospects of stock markets and the economy at large how would you evaluate the importance of physical gold holdings as an insurance in the coming years ds the current monetary order is nearing its end the elimination of over indebtedness is inevitable which will reduce the monetary savings by at least 50 naturally this process will take years however in this scenario the price of gold could increase about tenfold at its peak reprinted with permission from

business in structured finance 5 2 capital markets also posted excellent business performance in credit fixed income forex underlying revenues of the retail banking in france division rose 1 3 with a volume effect offsetting the pressure on interest margins with interest rates again following a downward trend allowing for good growth in interest income year on year the asset servicing division also saw a substantial increase in revenues 3 6 driven by the growth of the business line and higher cash levels from customers by contrast the underlying revenues of the insurance division were relatively stable 0 2 compared to the first quarter of 2018 owing to the adoption of a cautious recognition of investment margin in life at the start of the year in an environment marked by a further decline in interest rates and a low tax rate this quarter on portfolio income in asset management underlying revenues declined slightly by 0 9 due to a sharp drop in performance fees which fell 32 million euros from the high level of first quarter 2018 52 million euros which strong management fees 0 9 were unable to offset retail banking in italy also recorded a decline in its underlying revenues 3 9 with solid growth in interest income in spite of persistently negative interest rates but which did not compensate for lower fees and other revenues impacted by developments on the financial markets since last year lastly consumer finance posted a decline in its revenues owing to a highly competitive environment which nevertheless was offset by the excellent performance turned in by its automotive partnerships recognised as a contribution from equity accounted entities the stability of revenues compared to the first quarter of 2018 goes hand in hand with that of underlying operating expenses excluding srf 0 1 in both cases this is confirmation of good cost control in all business lines offsetting natural inflation of 1 5 2 however the 4 million euro increase in expenses between the two periods conceals differing trends at each division as such the asset gathering division posted higher operating expenses excl srf 18 million euros 2 5 owing to investments in development and the integration of banca leonardo into the scope of consolidation the large customers division also recorded higher costs 37 million euros 4 7 linked to the development of its business this quarter offsetting this the retail banking and specialised financial services business lines saw their costs fall significantly respectively 23 million euros 2 2 and 15 million euros 4 2 thanks to the continuation of structural cost savings plans lastly the corporate centre cc benefited from continuing efforts to promote synergies between the support functions decrease of 14 million euros the underlying cost income ratio excluding srf came out to 63 3 which is a good level for a first quarter and which covers the bulk of the ifric21 expenses which are not spread out over the full year and is stable compared to the first quarter of 2018 the sharp increase in the contribution to the srf 13 9 nevertheless affects the growth in underlying gross operating income which declined 2 7 compared to first quarter 2018 including the srf expenses related to ifric21 reached 489 million euros in first quarter 2019 up 6 2 compared to first quarter 2018 it should be noted that the contribution to srf was increased by 11 million euros in the second quarter 2018 at 225 million euros the cost of credit risk was down 22 4 89 million euros compared to first quarter 2018 this drop is mainly attributable to the large customers division in particular corporate investment banking which recognised a provision reversal in the amount of 15 million euros this quarter versus an allocation of 65 million euros to provisions in the first quarter of 2018 the other business lines experienced more modest movements between the two quarters retail banks in france and in italy recorded respective decreases of 12 6 6 million euros and 15 1 12 million euros the cost of risk relative to outstandings represents 21 basis points versus 29 in first quarter 2018 and 23 in fourth quarter

million euros booked by the corporate centre 6 million euros in first quarter 2019 linked to the negative impact of the first time consolidation of the entity crédit agricole group infrastructure platform ca gip versus 18 million euros in first quarter 2018 associated with a real estate capital gain underlying pre tax income before discontinued operations and non controlling interests increased by 3 4 to 1 350 million euros the underlying effective tax rate was 32 3 versus 29 9 in first quarter 2018 an increase that is primarily attributable to the increase in the srf contribution which is not tax deductible this rate is significantly lower than the standard corporate income tax rate in france due to the generation of earnings in countries with a lower tax rate and the tax credit from additional tier 1 debt instruments interest payments are deducted directly from equity for 141 million euros in the first quarter in the light of the new debt issued in early march versus 131 million euros in first quarter 2018 the underlying tax expense therefore rose 12 8 to 409 million euros net income attributable to non controlling interests fell 5 6 to 146 million euros primarily concentrated in the corporate centre due to the change in the method of consolidation of a subsidiary which is now equity accounted consequently underlying net income rose by 1 0 compared to first quarter 2018 to 796 million euros but would have increased by 3 5 excluding the contribution to the srf at the end of march 2019 crédit agricole s a s solvency remained very solid with a common equity

with brent d griffiths the ticker american business may be howling about the trump administration s new tariffs on chinese imports but on k street the trade war is already proving a winner for the bottom line by more than doubling the duties on 200 billion worth of chinese goods and threatening to extend that 25 percent levy to everything imported from the country the trump administration has created a new crowd of companies desperate for relief and lining up to hire washington s most connected operators to help the hope to convince the u s trade representative to exclude their product from the new tariffs there s a lot of activity and a lot of concerned companies out there says ronald oleynik who leads the international trade practice at holland knight richard mojica who focuses on imports at miller chevalier said he is fielding an avalanche of inquiries from both existing clients and new clients who up until very recently have not had to deal with the tariffs or deal with them as urgently as they have to right now early rounds of trump s tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from around the world and mostly industrial products from china that end up in other finished goods fell heavily on american manufacturers but as the administration moves to broaden the levies to include everything imported from the country nicknamed the world s factory new classes of american businesses stand to feel a stronger pinch including toy makers big box retailers and apparel companies the record suggests there will be only so much even the best lawyers and lobbyists can do although companies seeking carve outs from steel and aluminum tariffs have racked up an impressive success rate winning exemptions for 42 percent of the more than 51 000 requests filed as of march those seeking relief from china tariffs have a considerably lower batting average rough calculations by christine mcdaniel and danielle parks of the mercatus center found as of march u s trade representative officials had approved only about 10 percent of nearly 11 000 requests for exclusion from the import taxes advertisement for those companies nevertheless eager to challenge the odds top trade hands for hire have some advice first any business seeking an exemption needs to marshal the best version of the facts supporting their case to present to ustr the trade office requires petitioners to prove the product they want exempted meets four standards it is not key to chinese industrial policy including its made in china 2025 plan it can t be produced elsewhere subjecting it to higher tariffs would cause severe damage to the company and customs officers need to be able to identify the product easily so they can enforce the exemption if you don t hit every one of these factors if you don t answer the question in a definitive way companies stand a vastly diminished shot at approval says stacy j ettinger who directs the trade policy practice at k l gates once the paperwork is in order it helps to have friends in your congressional delegation adding their names to the cause they do make better advocates than most people oleynik says when a senator calls the white house or ustr they get more attention using that leverage is helpful but they ve got to want to do it advertisement indeed tesla failed to win an exemption for the chinese built autopilot brain of its electric vehicles with ustr pointing to the technology s strategic importance to the made in china 2025 plan mojica says his firm couldn t win an exemption for a blender because 5 percent of them were made in brazil a fact ustr cited in rejecting the claim the device had to be made in china but he secured carve outs for other low tech products including ball bearings and a salad spinner given the dismal success rate for companies seeking exemptions from china tariffs so far oleynik also proposes a different path altogether companies can seek deductions to the valuation that customs officers place on their imports thereby shrinking the tab subject to the new tariffs shipping costs for example are deductible or the chinese exporter can set up a sales subsidiary in the u s and effectively claim a wholesale price for the product when it is imported before selling it to an american customer options for importers may range from bad to worse but lobbyists are still benefiting from all the increased action in the first quarter of this year alone 723 clients reported lobbying on trade matters following a record breaking year for trade lobbying in 2018 when nearly 1 300 clients worked federal officials on the issue according to the center for responsive politics advertisement it just doesn t seem to be a very fair process mcdaniel of the mercatus center says we talk to so many companies and it s heartbreaking they can t afford the k street lawyer not to mention the pr firm and the full court press on their senator or representative sometimes a company gets an exclusion granted but what about the hundreds of others who can t afford to try market movers stocks bounce back bloomberg s randall jensen and sarah ponczek u s stocks rebounded as moved to reassure markets that he ll clinch a trade deal with china the dollar rose and treasuries fell the s p 500 rose for the second time in three sessions after trump said he s talking with china the benchmark is

called the escalating trade fight between the united states and china a little squabble video the washington post photo jabin botsford the washington post trump s trade war is about 2020 is telling advisers and close allies that he has no intention of pulling back on his escalating trade war with china arguing that clashing with beijing is highly popular with his political base and will help him

anytime soon stephen moore a conservative economist who withdrew from consideration as a trump federal reserve board nominee amid an uproar told my colleagues it s a high risk strategy but it s not in his personality to back down this goes back to what he said that first time he came down the escalator at trump tower frustration inside the capitol as i mentioned yesterday republican lawmakers are running out of patience i m not sure if you talk to him face to face he hears everything you say senate finance committee chairman charles e grassley r iowa as i mentioned yesterday republican lawmakers are running out of patience i m not sure if you talk to him face to face he hears everything you say senate finance committee chairman charles e grassley r iowa told my colleagues damian paletta erica werner and taylor telford trump draws the fed in the fray the president tried to draw the independent federal reserve into the trade war by saying that low interest rates would help the u s win china will be pumping money into their system and probably reducing interest rates as always in order to make up for the business they are and will be losing if the federal reserve ever did a match it would be game over we win in any event china wants a deal donald j trump realdonaldtrump may 14 2019 china is not flinching the chinese foreign ministry had a message for the u s on tuesday don t underestimate us china doesn t want a trade war but we are not afraid of fighting one if someone brings the war to our doorstep we will fight to the end foreign ministry spokesperson geng shuang told reporters at his daily news conference china never succumbs to external pressure we have the resolve and capability to defend our lawful and legitimate rights and interests blankfein tariffs could work the former goldman sachs ceo took to twitter to argue trump s strategy could help him achieve his goal of bringing china to heel tariffs might be an effective negotiating tool saying it hurts us misses the point china relies more on trade and loses more as in a labor strike where mngmnt workers both get hurt the process may demonstrate relative strength resolve where compromise needs to happen lloyd blankfein lloydblankfein may 14 2019 as to who ultimately bears the tariffs cost us buyers may eventually switch their purchases to domestic or non chinese companies and pay a bit more than now chinese companies lose the revenues not great but part of the process to assert pressure to level the playing field lloyd blankfein lloydblankfein may 14 2019 yes china could dump treasuries bloomberg s liz mccormick and saleha mohsin write that the so called nuclear option for chinese retaliation is in fact on the table the idea that china would dump its 1 1 trillion of treasuries to retaliate against u s tariffs is often dismissed as improbable yet the tensions rippling through global financial markets could still lead beijing to reduce its stockpile in the 15 9 trillion treasuries market not to retaliate but to defend its currency if it goes into a free fall advertisement pocket change americans are running up credit card debt more than half of u s consumers in their twenties own a credit card as that number has increased in recent years so have delinquency rates bloomberg news s shelly hagan and marie patino report the move into serious delinquency rates for

stanley morgan stanley nabbed the biggest u s initial public offering of the past five years now it gets to field the second guessing after uber technologies inc tumbled 18 in its first two days of

luck including the abrupt flareup last week in u s china trade negotiations that drove markets down around the globe as well as the recent dismal performance of uber s main rival lyft inc there s also

with joanie greve and mariana alfaro with joanie greve and mariana alfaro the big idea marco rubio argues that the escalation in the trade war with china stems more from corporate chieftains selfishly

your intellectual property and eventually they re going to replace you but who cares you won t be ceo in 10 years when that happens rubio said trump s biggest problem right now is that chinese leaders are unaccustomed to a president going to the mat this way and have therefore miscalculated his resolve they have traditionally been able to unleash the american corporate class to march up to d c and pressure their policymakers to back down because so many of these companies have established a market presence in china that in the short term is very beneficial but in the long term is probably suicide for those companies rubio said that s what s happened in the past this is the first administration that has not backed down advertisement the senator s comments on china came as he uncorked a broader extended critique of american corporate culture rubio the chairman of the senate committee on small business and entrepreneurship faulted ceos for focusing too much on the next quarter and not enough on the next generation he blamed warped incentives from wall street and washington for driving this shift and he complained that the shareholder primacy theory which is taught at business schools and accepted as gospel in the c suites of most fortune 500 corporations has prompted too many business leaders to care more about returns for shareholders than the people who work for them rubio gave me the first look at a 37 page report he plans to release later today on the decline of business investment over the past several decades it details how nonfinancial corporations for the first time now consistently spend more on acquiring financial assets than on capital development at its core the problem is that beginning in the 1970s the primary objective for companies became maximizing return to shareholders and that came at the expense of investing in new capacities and in innovation rubio said in essence it s coming at the expense of the things that lead to growth in key industries that are critical to our national security and our national interests that s even more problematic he declined to name names as has become so fashionable among politicians of both parties during the trump era but rubio s unsparing rebuke of the business community more broadly was no less searing as a result advertisement what it s resulted in is that you can become a very profitable company that returns a lot of money to shareholders by taking your productive capacity and sending it to china or by turning over your intellectual property because they re allowing you market access which is generating new revenue he added that s great for the short to mid term your stock performance can be very good your shareholders are going to be very happy but it s devastating for american workers and in the long term it s devastating for america the senator will chair a hearing at 2 30 p m eastern to consider the reauthorization of the small business administration s innovation programs he ll question two administration officials and he s invited four outside witnesses to offer ideas for how government policy can spur additional business investment there is a growing recognition among elites across the ideological spectrum that capitalism itself is in trouble the 47 year old son of cuban immigrants said he wants to save the economic system that made america exceptional by paying more attention to its excesses our economy today is really not working the way free enterprise works at its best he explained i m an enormous supporter of free market capitalism because i ve seen and know that it s generated more prosperity than any other economic system in human history but when it stops working the way it s supposed to work it creates the structural imbalances that lead to many of the problems that we re seeing across not just the u s but across multiple developed western economies we are certainly doing well in the short to mid term in our growth but we also have an obligation to think about the structural challenges that will make it difficult to sustain that in the long term if we don t make additional changes advertisement to do that he wants more rewards for long term investments in workers and facilities we can t force companies to be innovative but we shouldn t have tax provisions or policy provisions that incentivize against it rubio said and we do the senator said he tried to push for things that would advance this aim during the debate over the gop s 2017 tax bill but he couldn t get them all the legislation made full expensing available to capital investment except facilities plus research and development expenses those provisions are scheduled to expire rubio wants to make them permanent as well as expand the full expensing to cover facilities he said he wanted to see the full refundability of the child tax credit because it would help workers if we re going to have preferences in our tax code and the tax code always has preferences they should be in favor of things that create strong and stable jobs he said returns to shareholders should be treated equally no matter which route you choose whether it s a buyback or a dividend advertisement as a political matter rubio has concluded that the gop focused too much in the past on catering to corporate executives at the expense of their consumers and their employees this year he s rolling out a series of proposals aimed at restoring the balance between businesses and their workers we have a free market but that free market operates under the conditions created for it by policymakers he said those conditions should reflect our national priorities and one of our top national priorities should be creating strong and stable jobs upon which strong families and strong communities can take root rubio s emerging pro work agenda as he calls it reflects the gop s broader embrace of populism during the trump era for others following this zeitgeist read my big idea from yesterday about freshman republican sen josh hawley from missouri rubio s new report and hawley s maiden speech which he ll deliver on the senate floor later today can be viewed against the backdrop of growing tensions between corporate america and the republican party the u s chamber of commerce and the political network led by the billionaire industrialist charles koch have both distanced themselves from the gop in the wake of trump s takeover which has made the party less supportive of free trade and expanded immigration in our interview rubio recounted how his unsuccessful bid for the gop nomination against trump in 2016 opened his eyes to the number of people being left behind by the changing economy especially in places like the industrial midwest advertisement heading into 2014 i started to become very interested in not the daily ups and downs or twists and turns of markets but the broader structural challenges he said and then i ran for president and it gave me the chance to travel the country and meet people and interact with people of various backgrounds which i had not been directly exposed to representing only florida someone working in an industrial city that s been hollowed out isn t necessarily going to move to silicon valley and work for a high tech firm and even if that transition eventually happens in the interim period these are real people and real communities that are left behind so that stark reality coming back to the senate led me to further explore this rubio added that he also came to understand why government must play a more muscular role in doing something we need to get back to a point where we don t solely analyze the american economy on traditional economic measures he said gdp growth is important but that alone doesn t tell us the full story it has to be not just growth that we care about but the kind of growth that creates stable jobs that allow strong families and strong communities to develop which are the backbone of a strong economy our public policy should reflect that bigger picture rubio lamented that americans in the modern era have become overly susceptible to the temptations connected to the pursuit of instant gratification we have a challenge that s developed in our culture writ large in that we seek immediate returns whether it s in our own lives or in corporate life and we oftentimes do so at the expense of long term development he said that is best encapsulated by what s happened in the private sector in this country advertisement defending trump s hard line approach toward china rubio said it s imperative to fight for a better balance in sino americans relations i believe that the imbalance that has developed between our countries on economics and geopolitics is dangerous he said it will leave us with a world in which china grows emboldened and aggressive and the u s will be forced to respond and it could lead to conflict it s already leading to trade conflict and it could lead to worse for the sake of global stability there has to be equilibrium in that relationship and we don t have it right now at its core this is very simple china is allowed to do anything they want in our economy and in western economies but our firms are allowed to do very little of anything and pay a tremendous price over there rubio acknowledges that the trade war with china is harmful to the american economy in the short term and that the tariffs increase costs for u s consumers but he says he believes it s worth it surrendering to china will be devastating rubio reasoned it will fundamentally alter our place in the world and the very nature of our economy for two generations or more over the past three decades president trump has clamored for trade wars and railed against trade deficits while calling for fair trade video the washington post the latest on the china standoff advertisement trump thinks his china tariffs will help him win reelection robert costa josh dawsey and sean sullivan report i don t see him crying uncle anytime soon said stephen moore a conservative economist who withdrew from consideration as a trump federal reserve board nominee amid an uproar it s a high risk strategy but it s not in his personality to back down this goes back to what he said that first time he came down the escalator at trump tower speaking to reporters tuesday before boarding marine one en route to louisiana trump insisted that he is in a very very strong position and called the stalled negotiations a little squabble but as trump expresses confidence there have been tensions inside the white house with some advisers uneasy with trump s strident nationalism and firm belief in tariffs as economic weapons some republican senators expressed fresh concern over the impact of the trade war on rural america damian paletta erica werner and taylor telford report i m not sure if you talk to him face to face he hears everything you say said senate finance committee chairman charles e grassley r iowa republican lawmakers are also looking for ways to provide a taxpayer bailout to farmers perhaps adding billions of dollars to a disaster bill that has languished in congress for weeks until last week many republican senators supported a tougher approach with china but with trump s decision to increase tariffs gop lawmakers are now fielding angry calls soybean farmers pork producers and a growing number of other agricultural interests across a range of states including cherry producers corn growers and lobstermen have complained that they are collateral damage caught in the middle of the escalating trade battle trump continues to insist china is paying for the tariffs but it does not feel that way for many americans david j lynch reports a pair of recent studies by two teams of economists from institutions such as the federal reserve bank of new york as well as princeton yale and columbia universities both concluded that americans are bearing nearly the entire cost of trump s tariffs if he opts to proceed and he took the first official step toward doing so on monday the economic impact will dwarf his previous levies on foreign washing machines solar panels industrial metals and about half of what the united states purchases each year from china once in place the tariffs would cost the typical family of four nearly 2 400 annually destroy 2 2 million jobs and shave more than 200 billion from the size of the economy according to a study for an anti tariff group by trade partnership worldwide a washington based consultancy advertisement despite blasting beijing s trade policies in the recent past democrats are not supporting trump s new tariffs on chinese imports politico s burgess everett and heather caygle report in interviews with a dozen house and senate democrats from the midwest and in leadership most lawmakers refused to back trump s offensive against china particularly as he s kept tariffs on u s allies even those most willing to praise trump on trade have been notably reserved nancy pelosi told reporters monday that trump s action toward beijing is in recognition that something needed to be done but she again criticized the president for antagonizing europe with a separate series of tariffs last year instead of trying to join with european union allies to pressure china i still hope he can reach an agreement but i don t know he s pretty unaware of the damage they re doing if they don t get an agreement soon said sen sherrod brown d ohio who has otherwise supported trump s tough on china approach trump continues to push a misleading narrative about his trade war fact checker glenn kessler reviewed some of the president s latest tweets he constantly claims that the united states has been ripped off by other countries for years but trump consistently gets two things wrong here first he overstates the trade deficit with china it was 378 billion in 2018 336 billion in 2017 and 308 billion in 2016 but for trump it s always been 500 billion even if one just focuses on trade in goods the deficit in 2018 was still not 500 billion but 419 billion given the rise in the trade deficit during his presidency perhaps one day trump will be right second countries do not lose money on trade deficits a trade deficit simply means that people in one country are buying more goods from another country than people in the second country are buying from the first country there s a new effort in congress to prevent chinese interests from gaining

clear the uptick in tensions has also rattled the state department s top officials in charge of diplomatic security who on tuesday postponed a major forum of regional security officers from most embassies and consulates worldwide the event was postponed because of increasing tensions with iran and the need for senior personnel to remain in the field to assess and respond to potential threats according to a state department memo obtained by the washington post the event is scheduled every three to four years and involves 300 plus people said a state department official who like others

question of russian interference during a news conference with pompeo who then delivered the warning trump had not you can see we have some disagreements on this issue pompeo told reporters i made clear to foreign minister lavrov as we ve made clear in the past months that interference in american elections is unacceptable if the russians were to engage in that in 2020 it would put our relationship in an even worse place than it has been and we encourage them not to do that we would not tolerate that during their meeting pompeo and putin were able to agree on only one thing many issues stand in the way of reconciliation anton adds after several hours of talks between pompeo and lavrov and another 90 minutes between pompeo and putin kremlin foreign policy adviser yury ushakov

prompting trump s other senior adviser stephen miller to interrupt at times and take over the conversation some gop senators left the meeting wondering whether kushner understood the issue the gop officials said though some appreciated his efforts they did not think his plan would advance anytime soon no senator has stepped forward yet to turn kushner s plan into legislation new photos show

claimed that he was just born to be in the presidential race he was made to fall like a rock trump said at an event designed to tout his energy policies at a liquefied natural gas plant in this southwestern louisiana town what happened to him the president s continued attacks on biden are worrying trump s allies who have expressed concern that the jabs will allow the former vice president to rise above a messy primary that would otherwise drag down his candidacy the times s jonathan martin and maggie haberman report the president though has told advisers he believes he can portray mr biden a longtime washington veteran as representative of an ossified political class the same way he did hillary clinton wounding him with enough attacks and put downs that mr biden will either stagger into the general election or collapse in the primary mr trump s attacks on mr biden have defied the pleadings of his own aides who think almost any other candidate would be easier to defeat and left republicans puzzled while delighting biden supporters biden s plan to address climate change which he plans to formally release this month could be an early test of whether his consensus building brand meshes with today s democratic party matt viser john wagner and david weigel report biden s approach represents a fundamental test of whether the democratic party has shifted out of his grasp in recent years to one that punches back hard against the trump controlled republican party with a sharply liberal agenda or whether it is one that wants a return to bipartisan bonhomie biden s

menafn dailyfx trade wars talking points following monday s escalations to the us china trade war the markets were looking to acclimate to the heightened state of anxiety speculative appetite is building behind the dow and s p 500 though growth political risks and other troubles should earn caution dollar has held anchored as fed officials talk down rate cuts while eurgbp reflects upon two currencies frozen due to anticipation what do the dailyfx analysts expect from the dollar euro equities oil and more through the 2q 2019 find our forecasts for the quarter in the dailyfx trading guides page a break in trade war retaliations isn t the ideal opportunity to buy dips following china s turn to retaliation in its escalating trade war with the united states tuesday and a distinct market response via risk trends the markets were left to acclimate to the new level of tension in the world there was no let up in action from the two sides even if their commentary may have leveled out somewhat in the aftermath of his tariff hike on 200 billion of chinese imports from a 10 percent to 25 percent rate friday and the warning that additional 325 billion in goods more than the balance was at risk in the foreseeable future president trump softened his language somewhat in social media and in televised statements he remarked that he had a great relationship with his counterpart president xi and that they could strike a deal as soon as tomorrow should the right agreements be made it would be a stretch to suggest these hedged sentiments are the source of the market s balance tuesday as we have seen wild oscillations in the administration s stance over the past months that seems to be well timed to the rise and fall in benchmark equity indices for china s part the aftermath of the response with a 25 percent tax hike on 60 billion in us imports was followed by some brief local statements for the public that suggested leadership would not back down the only definitive event on the timeline is the g20 meeting followed by a three to four weeks in which the us stated it will move on the additional goods instead we need to watch the headlines and reports that key officials responsible for the negotiations lighthizer mnuchin he are due to meet again chart of fxi china etf and china volatility index inverted daily with a temporary cap in the escalation of actions and rhetoric to the trade wars it was difficult to miss the bounce in risk leaning assets this past session the s p 500 and dow managed meaningful bullish gaps on the open but the move looked more of a counterbalance to the biggest drop to start the day for the latter in a decade there is little dispute that sentiment itself has paused in its tumble global equities halted their drop the eem emerging market etf gapped higher though offered no material follow through and yen crosses steadied after clearing support monday yet as wide as the balance seems there is not much in the way of conviction to draw from the effort there is a stark difference between a pause in a prevailing trend or the return to true commitment chart of s p 500 and opening gaps daily we can see this conflict readily in the s p 500 or dow both indices spent the first four months of the year climbing with the former actually earning a record high for the effort yet that advance was itself a reversal of the losses suffered in the fourth quarter and the ability to transition to recovery back to genuine extension of trend once record highs were clear was always in doubt that is especially true in the comparison of standings between us indices and most other risk benchmarks that isn t to say however that the previous few weeks slide is a full commitment to a long overdue swing in the bears favor commitment remains the missing quality of the market over fundamental charge or technical bearing the competition of political risks growth concerns and monetary policy limitations while the standoff between the us and china remains the most potent standing risk to the global financial markets it isn t the only spark that traders will need to keep track of when gauging the changing winds across the world it warrants constant reminding due to the threat it poses to financial stability and growth but president trump is due to make a decision on whether or not to place tariffs on autos and auto parts this coming saturday while the typical political call to keep pressure on without adding too much complication would be to take the option for an 180 day extension however traders should recognize the unorthodoxy of the current us administration by now and not hold unnecessary risk the fallout from shifting the trade war to developed world counterparts would be potentially severe and the payoff from pressing risk exposure for the opposite outcome minimal consider that lopsided equation meanwhile political risks are starting to crop up regularly in global financial headlines the threat that a growing impeachment fight between the legislative and executive branch in the united states likely keeps the infrastructure spending program that could charge us growth on ice the advance of nationalism into the eu parliamentary election and questions of a functional government in the uk are targeted concerns but the growing tensions between the us and iran have more international implications the nuclear treaty is quickly falling apart while the energy market is under pressure as efforts at sabotage on oil tankers off the uae coast and drone attacks on saudi pipelines seems to raise the threat of higher energy prices to threaten already wavering growth though crude prices have responded as expected growth trends will take a more substantial fundamental role through the immediate future the trade war s economic impact is a constant but targeted event risk like the japanese economic sentiment survey eco watchers will offer acute perspective especially with its disappointing turn ahead china s april economic figures will give a comprehensive overview which the market will consume with its customary grain of salt and the eurozone will release its preliminary for most second round gdp updates for the second quarter another theme of merit particularly for the fed is monetary policy when tensions are rising questions over the world s largest central banks to put out fires is stress tested no major central bank looks ready but the fed arguably has the largest capacity that said import and export inflation pressures eased this past session while a few fomc members argued that there was no legitimate case for a rate cut despite the market s speculation of just that before year s end i am particularly interested in george s comments that state unnecessary rate cuts could lead to market bubbles and eventually contribute to a recession further down the road eurusd eurgbp and oil ranges audusd and gold trends as we await the market s decision on certain fundamental themes there are certain markets that are more likely to chop and those that see better potential for establishing a trend with the right push in the former case the eurusd has every reason to struggle for commitment as has been the case for some weeks now beyond the greenback s struggles with its safe haven carry trade relative growth trade war instigator status the euro is itself pushing off its decision on a clear course there are issues through monetary policy and internal political strife all its own take a look at the italian german yield spread but the real issue is anticipation for the eu parliamentary elections which are due to start may 23rd the rise of anti eu and thereby anti euro interests is unmistakable transpose that euro anchor onto eurgbp where the long standing brexit uncertainty is keeping the pound from any material trend development and we have one of the more overburdened crosses this pair has advanced 7 straight trading days which matches the longest climb since january 2013 and retail traders are clearly confident in the weight of the range resistance we are now coming into contact with as their short interest has jump to the highest levels in many months chart of eurgbp and consecutive day moves daily in contrast to the more reliable extension of uncertainty due to fundamental overload for the likes of eurusd and eurbp crude oil s lack of bearing is not as dependable the demand side of the supply demand equation is far more important still with growth forecasts the principal motivator with trade wars a threat to that existential question yet supply side issues like the iran tensions could start to tip the balance itself there is more reason to believe that audusd is at risk of converting potential into kinetic energy there is aussie based event risk but the real application of force is through the currency s and pair s exposure to the us china trade war where china has a material influence over curbing the damage from the economic conflict the aussie dollar has no such offset watch audusd as it trades at the lowest levels in three years and retail traders grow disturbingly confident of a reversal as for gold the one sided lean is not as extreme nor is the speculative view as clear the precious metal s wedge break higher however could readily find fuel should the trade war revive risk aversion there are few true havens that represent an alternative to the traditional currencies and the markets they represent this makes gold a unique hedge and barometer we discuss all of this and

by simon black earlier this month the world gold council published its quarterly report and it shows that central banks and foreign governments from around the world are buying up gold at their fastest pace in six years this is pretty big news and it says a lot about the future of the dollar remember central banks and foreign governments hold literally trillions of dollars of reserves and traditionally they do this by buying us government debt it sounds strange but to big institutions banks etc us government debt is equivalent to cash they use it as a form of money more importantly they hold us dollars because that s the global standard the us dollar has been the world s primary international reserve currency for seventy five years so us debt is extremely liquid in fact the 22 trillion us debt market is the biggest and most liquid market in the world but foreign governments have started breaking with the tradition of buying treasuries as the world gold council s report showed us foreign governments and central banks have been buying a lot more gold than in previous years net gold purchases in q1 2019 among foreign governments and central banks was nearly 70 greater than q1 2018 and the highest rate of first quarter purchases in six years the chinese in particular have been stockpiling gold faster than ever while at the same time chinese ownership of us treasuries as a percentage of total holdings has been gradually declining over the past years and it s not just china russia turkey qatar and even colombia a long time ally of the us have been diversifying and buying a lot more gold there are a few obvious reasons behind that the debt of the us federal government recently reached 22 trillion and it isn t getting any better they add at least 1 trillion to the debt each year and the congressional budget office forecasts that the uncle sam will never again see an annual budget deficit of less than 1 trillion starting in 2021 that has serious impact on the ability of the us government to repay its obligations to foreign creditors and if the bolsheviks come to power next year and offer free goodies paid for with more debt to anyone with a pulse the debt burden will explode anyone who thinks owning 10 year us treasuries or even worse 30 year government bonds is risk free is completely insane the dollar s problems aren t limited to the us government s pitiful finances either even the federal reserve the central bank of the united states is close to insolvency according to its own financial statements and the fed s coffers are routinely plundered by congress in order to fund pet projects in washington we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us it s so ridiculous that in late 2015 congress passed a law to steal 53 3 billion from the federal reserve putting the central bank on the brink of insolvency then of course there s the looming prospect of escalating us trade wars and it s easy to see why so many foreign governments and central banks are diversifying out of the dollar and into gold history shows that reserve currencies come and go there was a time when the british pound was the dominant currency in the world and before that dutch guilders spanish pieces of eight reserve currencies go all the way back before the gold solidus coin of the byzantine empire today the us dollar is the dominant currency in the world this is unlikely to change in the near future but it would be equally foolish to assume that the dollar s dominance will last forever gold on the other hand has been a constant of wealth preservation for nearly all of human history it was first used as money more than 3 000 years ago and an ounce of gold continues to buy roughly the same amount of goods over time there are a number of reasons for that gold is scarce portable and it can stand the test of time without corroding today i own gold as an insurance policy it s a form of wealth with no counter party risk and one that has global demand virtually anywhere you can possibly go in the world gold has value and it s definitely worth your consideration one interesting benefit we re living in a time where nearly every other asset is at an all time high stocks bonds real estate etc a single troy ounce of gold sells for nearly 50 below its record price from 2011 given what s happening with central banks foreign governments and us debt it s clear that demand is rising but simultaneously the supply of gold is under a lot of pressure we ve discussed before that large mines have been closing and large producers haven t invested in new discoveries so there could be significant potential for rising gold prices in the future

grecaud paul adobe stock eur sits at one week low after gdp boost as trade risks weigh ing eyes 1 1260 as a range top as morgan stanley cuts forecasts j p morgan likes eur higher but contingent on economic recovery the euro was languishing at a one week low wednesday after official figures confirming a pickup in the economy during the first quarter failed to inspire a bid for the single currency with the data coming as major banks continue to downgrade their eur usd forecasts eurozone gdp growth was confirmed on wednesday at 0 4 for the first quarter with the expansion having been aided by a solid pickup in the german economy at the start of the new year german gdp growth rose to 0 4 during the quarter up from 0 at the end of 2018 gdp growth picked up in germany italy hungary bulgaria poland romania and slovakia during the recent quarter eurostat s second estimate of gdp growth shows although the most notable improvement is that in germany given the size of the economy the german economy came off to a pleasantly good start in 2019 after narrowly avoiding a technical recession in h2 2018 says florian hense an economist at berenberg bank after a subdued q2 0 2 qoq chances are that german growth can pick up on a more sustained basis throughout h2 0 4 on average amid recently escalating trade tensions the downside risks loom large though above contributions to german quarterly gdp growth source berenberg markets had feared a german recession late last year after growth turned negative in the third quarter of 2018 and the economy was left unchanged with 0 growth in the final quarter the u s china trade war fears over brexit and new eu rules impacting production at car manufacturers were behind the slump which came mainly from the industrial sector the domestic side of the economy held up well the european commission slashed its german 2019 gdp growth forecasts from 1 1 y y to 0 5 y y the year on year gdp growth forecasts of 0 5 is built on the following quarterly profile q1 0 2 q q q2 0 1 q q q3 0 3 q q q4 0 4 q q our economists believe these forecasts are too pessimistic remarks sue trinh asia head of fx strategy at rbc capital markets all of this matters for the euro because of what it might mean for european central bank ecb interest rate policy the ecb needs much faster economic growth if it is to have any hope of seeing the wage and inflation pressures that are necessary for it to lift its interest rate the ecb abandoned in march earlier guidance that had suggested it could lift interest rates in autumn this year and now says that eurozone borrowing costs will remain at their crisis levels at least through the end of 2019 above euro to dollar rate shown at 4 hour intervals if the weak recovery in the eurozone renewed

slower to recover previous losses to the dollar according to morgan stanley and j p morgan given the fresh economic risks posed by president donald trump s latest offensive in the so called trade war with china renewed us china trade tensions not only translates to renewed global downside risks that are constructive the usd but have specific read through to other us trade policy initiatives says daniel hui a strategist at j p morgan first is section 232 auto tariffs for which the nominal deadline for a decision by trump is may 18th presumably in light recent events and trump s own rhetoric the probability of a near term auto tariff announcement over a pass or a delay has come up materially president donald trump has until the end of friday to decide whether he will impose tariffs on cars imported into the u s which would impact the eurozone and japan if the proposed levies go ahead this would be another economic headache for germany and europe coming on top of the threat posed by the latest moves against china the white house has lifted from 10 to 25 the tariff levied on around 200 bn of annual imports from china and set the ball rolling on a process that could see a 25 tariff imposed on china s remaining 300 bn of exports to the u s china has since retaliated by lifting to 25 the tariff levied from around 60 bn of annual imports from the u s and rhetoric from both the u s and chinese governments toward one another is turning increasingly hostile stoking fears of a protracted trade conflict above eurozone imports and exports of financial capital source morgan stanley higher yields and better equity returns have prompted both foreign and domestic accounts to pivot their portfolios abroad meanwhile eur has become increasingly used as a funding currency given its low yields and muted growth prospects says hans redeker head of fx strategy at morgan stanley short term protectionist risks may give eurusd one final leg lower to 1 10 but we forecast a meaningful rebound from there rising to 1 16 by year end redeker says the chinese government is likely to continue attempting to stimulate its economy in 2019 and that this will be positive for the growth outlook in europe it was only after u s china tariffs were implented in the third quarter of 2018 that german and eurozone growth really began to weaken meanwhile the u s economy is seen slowing later in 2019 while stock markets are also projected to weaken as a strong dollar becomes an increasing headwind for earnings growth the greenback has been supported by flows into the u s stock market in recent quarters so a reversal could hurt the currency redeker and the morgan stanley team slashed their forecasts for eur usd in their mid year outlook last week knocking the year end projection down from 1 25 to just 1 16 after a disappointing start to the year for the single currency they re looking for the euro to reach only 1 13 by the end of september we expect a shallow medium term revival in the euro but to little more than the forward rate on a one year horizon predicated on the key assumption that the region s economy is capable of delivering sustained growth close to 1 5 through 2h says j p morgan s hui the precise timing and location of the inflexion point in eur will hinge on the ability or otherwise of the region s economy to get out of first gear hui also forecasts the euro to dollar rate will end the 2019 year at 1 16 after climbing to 1 14 by the end of september those forecasts are unchanged from one month ago although the bank has lifted its projection for the dollar index and now expects it to hit 97 80 in june before declining to 94 80 at year end
washington president donald trump s tariffs were initially seen as a cudgel to force other countries to drop their trade barriers but they increasingly look like a more permanent tool to shelter u s industry block imports and banish an undesirable trade deficit more than two years into the trump administration the united states has emerged as a nation with the highest tariff rate among developed countries outranking canada germany and france as well as china russia and turkey on tuesday the president continued to tout his trade war with china saying that the 25 tariffs he imposed on 250 billion worth of chinese goods would benefit the united states and that he was looking very strongly at imposing additional levies on nearly every chinese import i think it s going to turn out extremely well we re in a very strong position trump said in remarks from the white house lawn our economy is fantastic theirs is not so good we ve gone up trillions and trillions of dollars since the election they ve gone way down since my election he called the trade dispute a little squabble and suggested he was in no rush to end his fight though he held out the possibility an agreement could be reached saying they want to make a deal it could absolutely happen stock markets rebounded on tuesday after plunging on monday as china and the united states resumed their tariff war additional tariffs could be on the way trump faces a friday deadline to determine whether the united states will proceed with his threat to impose global auto tariffs a move that has been criticized by car companies and foreign policymakers and despite complaints by republican lawmakers and u s companies trump s global metal tariffs remain in place on canada mexico europe and other allies advertising the trade barriers are putting the united states previously a steadfast advocate of global free trade in an unfamiliar position the country has the highest overall trade weighted tariff rate at 4 2 higher than any of the group of 7 industrialized nations according to torsten slok the chief economist of deutsche bank securities that is more than twice as high as the rate for canada britain italy germany and france and higher than most emerging markets including russia turkey and even china slok said the shift is having consequences for an american economy that is dependent on global trade including multinational companies like boeing general motors apple caterpillar and other businesses that source components from abroad and want access to growing markets overseas while trade accounts for a smaller percentage of the american economy than in most other countries just 27 in 2017 compared with 38 for china and 87 for germany according to world bank data it is still a critical driver of jobs and economic growth for now the u s economy remains strong with rising wages and the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years but with less trade american jobs up and down the value chain that are seemingly unrelated to importing and exporting goods could suffer including research and development retail and marketing products douglas irwin a trade historian at dartmouth college said trump s tariff battle with china was bringing about a new status quo for the world economy if we do have this consensus that we want to isolate ourselves from china that s a big historic shift in u s trade policy irwin said we ve moved away from tariffs as a bargaining chip to get a better deal to tariffs as a means to an end to decoupling the economies advertising trump and his economic advisers say the administration s trade policy is aiding the u s economy companies and consumers and despite the tough approach the administration continues to insist its goal is to strike trade agreements that give american businesses better trade terms overseas at a briefing last week steven mnuchin the treasury secretary praised the president s trade policies for helping economic growth thus far and said the administration supports free and fair reciprocal trade but if the goal really is freer trade the administration has never been further from achieving that goal than it is today said chad bown a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics they re heading in the opposite direction bown said beyond a minor update to the u s agreement with south korea no other free trade deals have been finalized trump s revisions to the north american free trade agreement with canada and mexico still await passage in congress while trade talks with the european union and japan have been troubled from the start with governments squabbling over the scope of the agreement the easier explanation said michael strain the director of economic policy studies at the american enterprise institute is to take the president at his word that he is a protectionist those are the words they re using and those are the actions they re taking he said advertising in remarks this week trump said companies that did not want to pay the tariffs could shift production out of china and into the united states or another country that has not been hit with tariffs while there are signs this shift is happening it seems to be benefiting countries like mexico and vietnam rather than the united states it remains to be seen whether the president s actions will precipitate a broader shift away from global integration that might echo around the world and outlast the trump administration trump came into office fiercely critical of the failure of past administrations and global bodies like the world trade organization for failing to police china s unfair trade practices he withdrew the united states from multilateral efforts like the trans pacific partnership a multicountry trade deal negotiated by president barack obama and the paris climate accord that shift has created an opening for other countries to step forward as global leaders including europe japan and china despite its position as one of the world s most controversial economic actors on tuesday china submitted its proposals for overhauling the world trade organization including broadening the privileges of developed countries a status that china claims for itself advocates of free trade fear that governments in india china south africa and elsewhere might find trump s model of protectionism appealing and erect even higher barriers to foreign companies while the united states and china could still strike a trade deal that would roll back many of their tariffs that likelihood has appeared to diminish in recent weeks advertising progress toward a deal came to a sudden halt this month when china backtracked on certain commitments and trump threatened to move ahead with higher tariffs we had a deal that was very close and then they broke it he said tuesday the two sides continue to disagree over whether the deal s provisions must be enshrined in china s laws but they are also arguing over trump s tariffs which were intended to prod the chinese to agree to more favorable trade terms for the united states china insists those tariffs must come off once a deal is reached but the trump administration wants some to remain in place to ensure china abides by its commitments in an interview tuesday on cnbc sen marco rubio r fla supported the administration s tactics ideally you wouldn t have tariffs he said but the united states already faces all kinds of impediments to gaining access to the chinese marketplace including tariffs subsidization of industries and theft of intellectual property we already have a series of hundreds of billions of dollars of chinese penalties against the united states which are threatening our long term viability rubio said advertising canada and mexico have repeatedly pressed the administration to lift its tariffs on steel and aluminum now that negotiations over the nafta revision are done the three countries signed the united states mexico canada agreement in november but the pact awaits passage in all three legislatures the trump administration still views the tariffs as a source of leverage in case it needs to demand final changes to the deal from canada and mexico but canadian and mexican officials as well as many in congress say the levies are actually an impediment because all three legislatures will refuse to finalize the deal while they are in place a similar standoff could soon unfold with the eu which trump has accused of being a brutal trading partner and being tougher than china the president who wants europe to open its markets to american farmers and companies has already imposed tariffs on european metals and is threatening to levy a 25 tax on imports of european cars and car parts if the bloc does not give the united states better trade terms europe has absorbed trump s steel and aluminum tariffs without too much damage but car tariffs would strike the most important industry in germany which has the continent s biggest economy european officials would regard car tariffs as a breach of a truce they worked out last year with trump and they have said they would refuse to negotiate as long as car tariffs were in place cecilia malmstrom the european commissioner for trade repeated on monday that the eu had prepared a list of american products worth 22 5 billion including ketchup suitcases and tractors that would face immediate retaliatory tariffs advertising we re prepared for the worst malmstrom said in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper in germany european officials still hold out hope that trump will see them as allies and not geopolitical rivals like the chinese and he could ultimately delay the decision and extend the friday deadline for countries that are in trade talks with the united states but the president shows no signs of backing away from his stance that tariffs have helped the united states on tuesday morning trump posted on twitter that tariffs had rebuilt america s steel industry and were encouraging companies to leave china making it more competitive for buyers in the united states china buys much less from us than we buy from them by almost 500 billion dollars so we are in a fantastic position trump tweeted make your product at home in the usa and there is no tariff

the euro is at a crossroads as it turns 20 and some believe it might not make it to 30 as the single currency doesn t seem to benefit all its role was a main topic at the european economic forum reports jo harper at the european economic forum held this week in the southern polish town of katowice the future of the eurozone and the single european currency the euro featured centrally a view increasingly shared was that of brigitte granville professor of international economics at the university of london who stressed that the euro urgently needed further political integration among the currency union s 19 member states monetary union requires political union and that is what the common budget means she told an audience of european economists and policy advisers french president emmanuel macron in 2018 proposed driving ahead with european integration by establishing a single budget the next step after the creation of the european central bank ecb in 1998 allowed the establishment of a single monetary policy framework at the heart of macron s plan is strengthening the currency area s bailout fund the european stability mechanism esm brigitte granville told dw in an interview that she didn t believe macron s idea would be going very far but if it did happen it would be very dangerous further integration is a grave concern she says adding without political glue you don t have real union but at the same time the eurozone is slowing europe eurozone economic growth is expected to slow in 2019 and some even believe the currency area could even face recession in 2020 monetary union granville went on is just a fixed exchange rate which would always end in financial crisis it cannot be dismantled only by crisis and explosion what will catalyze this i don t know but i don t see it lasting for the next 10 years she says pointing to post tax incomes in italy down 5 and in france down 2 while germany is up 19 the big mistake of the euro is that it forces germany to cooperate with countries that need spending but germany doesn t need to lax monetary policy destroys pensions saving and the banking system so there is no monetary stimulus this is the euro welcome to the euro granville added while the euro is too weak for some eurozone countries it s too strong for others the imbalance is believed to be at the heart of the unemployment and payments crises in the currency bloc leading to much hardship image dapd drive on or turn back paris also wants banking union common rules and institutions governing the bloc s largest banks in addition to a common deposit insurance scheme and a backstop to be used to support the winding down of failing banks eu governments have agreed to set up the european stability mechanism esm a 500 billion 575 billion fund that is intended to absorb bond market turbulence but a deposit guarantee scheme was opposed in berlin however debate is still ongoing regarding a eurozone budget and a common system for security savings germany and other northern eurozone countries have been reluctant to go as far as macron would like to on this front former german finance minister wolfgang schäuble has also called for the eu to have more clout to set finance policy and ending the unanimity requirement in bloc wide decision making but some northern european countries are opposed to the idea citing the difference between their tight fiscal frameworks and the traditionally loose budget policies in southern europe finland denmark ireland latvia lithuania and the netherlands have adopted a common position on the budget arguing that participation in it should be voluntary as long as the funding is derived through intergovernmental agreements french president emanuel macron and german chancellor angela merkel are still putting brave faces to their differences over how political integration in the eurozone can be achieved image reuters m sohn strangling europe hans olaf henkel a staunch euro critic and mep with the european conservatives and reformers in the european parliament even believes the currency is destroying the european union until may 2010 i supported the euro but then the ecb and brussels broke the promises they gave to the german people when they agreed to give up the deutschmark namely that no country should have a debt ratio of over 3 of gdp if breached the ec said it would punish the culprits it was breached 160 time and the ec did nothing the former head of the association of german industrialists bdi adds henkel also said the euro had done much economic and political damage in europe even to germany which had benefited the most from the introduction of the currency nine eu countries are not in the euro of them only romania wants to adopt it why is that henkel asks rhetorically and notes that those countries have done much better most eurozone countries the euro is much too strong for the italians and france huge unemployment countries can t devalue some countries find it very difficult to reform including france but they can t devalue to stay competitive the euro is designed to push countries to change rather than vice versa read more brussels tells

on the importance of institutions as provider of stability and protection in an uncertain world speech by peter praet member of the executive board of the ecb steptoe brussels open conference series brussels 15 may 2019 uncertainty and economic developments the economic literature both theoretical and empirical finds a link between heightened uncertainty and lower economic activity in the short run there are usually fixed costs involved with investment from creating new capital such as building a factory to hiring new staff which cannot be recovered if the investment decision is reversed so faced with an increase in uncertainty businesses pare back investment plans similarly if households fear unemployment or lower income from employment in the future they may reduce consumption today chart 1 measures of euro area uncertainty sources baker bloom and davis and ecb calculations cepr for recession periods last observation refers to april 2019 the literature uses a number of different measures of uncertainty such measures usually move with each other and generally peak in recessions the indicator for euro area economic policy uncertainty still appears relatively elevated this measure counts how frequently newspaper articles cite uncertainty economy or similar and particular policy words such as deficit or regulation a number of recent events have sparked this rise in uncertainty world trade policy uncertainty resulting from the negotiations initiated by the us with its trading partners as illustrated by the indicator for us trade policy uncertainty the protracted process of withdrawal of the united kingdom from the eu and the policy uncertainty resulting from the rise of populism show how pervasive uncertainty is in today s world these recent bouts of political and policy uncertainty have come on top of the existing and more enduring sources of structural uncertainty about the economic outlook in advanced economies what do we really know about the impact of new technologies and innovation on tomorrow s economic landscape will secular stagnation be the new economic reality various authors have suggested that recent innovations have had only limited effect on productivity and growth in advanced economies others have expressed concern that these innovations may polarise societies still further and may even have negative effects on employment technology optimists meanwhile predict the advent of a bright future with the diffusion of innovation bringing about significant productivity increases and high levels of well being it is important for us economists to be humble when forecasting the future debating concepts such as secular stagnation may be fashionable now but we should remember only a decade ago it was fashionable to debate the great moderation uncertainty about the future has always been with us the incidence of natural disasters such as droughts floods and earthquakes the doubt of whether contractual promises will be honoured and the fear of your possessions being taken by force are all factors that can affect economic activity humankind over the millennia has put in place various mechanisms to help cope with uncertainty for example putting in place narratives to filter and process the vast array of information available and arrange it in order to guide people s expectations about an uncertain future thereby making it possible for societies to coordinate their efforts towards the common good in this respect building institutions has been key to providing economic stability as they can best create an environment of trust in the future by implementing policies reducing the impact of uncertainty on economic developments the importance of economic narratives following financial crises political uncertainty is often elevated according to a recent study votes for extreme parties can increase by on average 30 while government majorities shrink parliaments end up with a larger number of parties and become more fractionalised thus the political landscape becomes more gridlocked at precisely the moment when decisiveness is typically required this can delay necessary policy responses such as cleaning up the financial sector which prolongs the post crisis recovery and such uncertainty reflected in the media can gradually build a narrative of doom and gloom around the economy or around the existing institutions a seeping pessimism which over time alters investors and consumers expectations and thereby their behaviour robert schiller has elaborated on the epidemiology of narratives relevant to economic fluctuations ranging from the great depression of the 1930s to the great recession of 2007 2009 and today s climate of political uncertainty popular narratives can drive economic developments for example when people hear stories of declining prices and then postpone their purchases talking about deflation feeds deflation but the relationship is more than just one way actual events play some role in the development of popular narratives overall popular narratives act as a potent multiplier of economic shocks the animal spirits of keynes today s information and communication technologies have opened up a vast field of research into the role of narratives as determinants of economic developments these technologies have also greatly accelerated the diffusion of narratives in our societies it is surprising how easily fake news can flourish nowadays this is a serious matter the outcome of the uk referendum can be partly attributed to the decades long development and spread of negative popular narratives about european integration more generally the events i mentioned earlier are the culmination of a broader narrative against free trade that has gained traction in advanced economies as narratives often are key determinants of economic and political outcomes it is important to be wary of them the stabilising role of institutions institutions contribute to stability especially in times of uncertainty and help anchor expectations in times of political gridlock effective institutions are vital since they can deliver their mandates decisively and outside of the push and pull of the political process this in turn foreshortens the crisis and the self fulfilling cycle of weak economic performance and gloom and doom narratives for example while bank failures are always possible the existence of appropriate institutions can mitigate their impact a sound supervisory framework makes failures less likely while resolution plans contribute to seamless unwinding of failed institutions the move over recent decades to grant independence to central banks owes much to the problem of time consistency when monetary policy was under the control of governments there was always an incentive to cheat and deliver higher than expected inflation to temporarily increase output the existence of this incentive and the inability of governments to credibly commit to the right policy gave rise to de anchored inflation expectations independent central banks with a clear mandate to maintain price stability have been successful in anchoring inflation expectations having an explicit price stability objective provides its own stabilising narrative people can trust the central bank to deliver an inflation rate in line with their mandate and can therefore base their economic decisions on that expected inflation rate in recent years the ecb has been an anchor of stability creating an effective bulwark against deflationary narratives when they appeared in the euro area but institutions need to be strong in order to deliver in the face of shocks to put this in perspective consider how two periods of global economic integration have fared under different institutions global economic integration has fluctuated over time and is now higher than at any time in the past another period of high integration in the decades prior to world war i ended abruptly as a financial crisis of global proportions accompanied by a credit crunch broke apart bilateral arrangements and paved the way for several rounds of retaliatory tariff increases multilateralism has been a cornerstone of economic expansion since world war ii the current legal framework for world trade embodied in the multilateral world trade organization has proven much more robust to the recent global financial crisis it has played a key role in preventing the re emergence of protectionism in the aftermath of the great recession three stylised facts emerge from comparing the evolution of world trade in goods in the periods 1922 38 and 2001 16 first the pre crisis expansion was very similar in both eras second world trade collapsed in 1930 and 2009 immediately after the two shocks but the decline was sharper in 2009 even though the total decline in the 1930s was larger third the subsequent recovery has been noticeably stronger in the most recent episode chart 2 the evolution of world trade in goods during the great depression and the great recession volumes 1929 and 2008 100 respectively sources ecb staff calculations based on data in federico and tena junguito 2016 and cpb trade monitor data notes the year 0 on the horizontal axis is 1929 in the case of the great depression blue line and 2008 in the case of the great recession yellow line 1922 1938 trade flows are constructed using current country borders on both occasions falling output was the main driver of the trade collapse but protectionism after the great depression was largely due to the emergence of a new political constituency opposed to free trade which in many cases was able to develop convincing narratives for the continuation of protectionism even when the crisis was over the current multilateral framework has so far shielded us against the adverse consequences of protectionist pressures for economic prosperity institutions provide stability by their very nature of being hard to change but that inertia can lead them to lack the agility to deal with new challenges it is therefore essential for modern institutions to evaluate the impact of their policies and the effectiveness of their strategy on an ongoing basis there is also a chance for new institutions to be founded to improve on previous arrangements the federal deposit insurance corporation was created in the united states in 1933 to reduce the effect of failed banks on depositors following the recent financial crisis the international institutional architecture was strengthened with the inauguration of the g20 summits and the creation of the financial stability board in the euro area the establishment of the single supervisory mechanism and the single resolution mechanism has strengthened the financial system and made it more resilient to future shocks while the current multilateral framework has so far shielded us against protectionist headwinds this has not been acknowledged by a significant share of the population this can be attributed to the fact that the benefits of globalisation have not always been fairly shared which risks triggering a setback in economic integration this calls for further improvements in our institutions and our policy frameworks to manage and share the benefits of integration in particular progress towards a better european union is both necessary and welcome and being constructively critical of our actions and policies is certainly part of this process yet it is important to acknowledge the progress made so far to keep a sense of direction let me therefore take a few moments then to remind you of the successes of the post war institutions in europe the european union as provider of stability and protection the european union and the single market have successfully delivered decades of peace and growing prosperity throughout europe there has been a steady process of strengthening trade and economic links based on the foundations of democracy a strong social model and the rule of law these institutions are europe s answer to the questions posed by globalisation a democratic way to reap the benefits of economic integration while still protecting consumers and workers the single market is more than just a customs union or a dense network of free trade agreements between countries it is in fact an innovative forward step in economic evolution it provides the legal framework for trade between member states underpinned by the four fundamental freedoms free movement of goods services labour and capital this framework is vital to give companies confidence to invest and integrate across national borders for trade to flourish businesses need to be certain that contracts will be honoured competition rules will be fairly enforced property rights respected and standards adhered to in ensuring the rule of law the single market reduces barriers to trade labour mobility and competition and increases technological diffusion between countries this is not to say that the european union is perfect strong institutions should always strive to improve evaluate their strategies and make sure their policies bring more value to citizens we should also be clear about what european institutions are and what they are not there is a widespread narrative according to which brussels imposes its decisions on member states yet all regulations and directives adopted in brussels are decided according to a political process involving the governments of all member states which are all represented in the council and elected representatives of all european citizens the union has built over time a set of strong institutions for member states to decide together matters of common interest but it is important to recognise the tensions that exist between the individual priorities of nation states and the pooling of national sovereignty for mutual gain the regulations for the single market need to be strong enough to promote innovation but not so tight that they stifle it by the same token countries have to be able to pursue their own social agendas where these do not clearly clash with the principles of the single market the principle of subsidiarity is important conclusion the successful development of a strong rules based international order in the aftermath of world war ii and the existence of strong institutions at both national and international level should not lead to complacency history has proven that accidents are possible that protectionism can follow periods of free trade brexit proves that there is a possibility for european integration to go into reverse a more widespread reversal of european economic integration would durably jeopardise economic prosperity in times of global political and policy uncertainty when the foundations of multilateralism are being challenged and global economic powers are flexing their muscles it is indispensable for us to take european integration forward a stronger union is important to retain influence on global economic developments and to provide security to citizens it is therefore essential to debunk the narratives of the critics of the european union and to speak up loudly for the eu and its institutions
photo by photo by pepi stojanovski some ideas are crazy enough to work others are just crazy it is worth taking the time to consider where modern monetary theory falls on this spectrum in its simplest form mmt argues that countries like the united states that issue their own currencies in a fiat system cannot run out of money the way individuals or businesses might this means that the country issuing its own currency can never default on its debt therefore the theory goes governments can massively expand spending without damaging the broader economy the government can address any unintended consequences such as an overheating economy by adjusting tax rates spiking inflation no problem just raise taxes a simple explanation of mmt like the one above and those i have seen in most mainstream media coverage makes it sound like an obviously flawed dangerous idea however while researching this topic i was surprised to learn that the details of mmt get significantly more complex up close some of the theory s advocates argue that critics are attacking their own perception of mmt rather than the reality for instance while the claim that mmt supporters think deficits never matter is commonly repeated most of them readily acknowledge that extreme deficits can cause hyperinflation mmt generally also includes the idea of a job guarantee which would theoretically ensure full employment without requiring the central bank to manipulate interest rates this mechanism is mainly meant to keep wages from rising too fast not to inflate them as some critics claim certain mmt supporting economists have expressed frustration at the media or various politicians failed attempts to accurately describe their positions mmt is also a school of thought with many contributors some of whom depart from one another in the particulars further complicating matters mmt is not new but for a long time it remained outside the mainstream largely dismissed by most economists mmt recently entered the national conversation however largely due to a boost from a few prominent supporters rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y proposed increasing deficit spending in order to fund proposed actions designed to address climate change concerns rep bernie sanders of vermont has invoked mmt in discussions of medicare for all other politicians largely on the left have avoided embracing mmt fully but have expressed approval for certain components of the theory president donald trump while by no means an mmt booster has said in the past that the u s government can never default on its debt some prominent money managers and business analysts of varying political affiliations also have said they find the framework useful for each mmt fan many critics wait in the wings warren buffet carl icahn paul krugman and federal reserve chairman jerome powell are among the prominent investors and economists who have expressed skepticism or incredulity about this theory other observers concede that mmt or at least some aspects of the theory may represent a useful outlook when a country is stuck in deep recession but not under normal economic circumstances critics have identified several serious issues with mmt it relies on the assumption that politicians will rapidly institute unpopular policy when necessary which many observers find a shaky proposition at best raising taxes on constituents is a hard sell for most politicians at the best of times much less in a moment when inflation is rising sharply some mmt proponents acknowledging this problem suggest that fiscal policy and monetary policy should be coordinated ideally with automated controls based on economic conditions that would be a radical change to the way our government functions just because inflation has not been a problem for many years doesn t mean it could never come back what happens in the mmt advocates worldview if the country experiences a major inflation spike would the government need to abandon infrastructure social support programs and other programs mid stream abrupt major spending cuts are unlikely to be much more popular with voters than sudden and significant tax hikes in a worst case scenario where inflation is not checked fast enough the world could lose confidence in the dollar and the currency s value would collapse a plummeting exchange rate could cause a variety of serious problems from further increasing inflation to capital flowing out of the country to lower real wages as imports become much more expensive most economists agree that there is some upper limit to how much money we could introduce into the economy before the system falls apart but we do not know what that limit is in this sense mmt reminds me of the laffer curve developed by economist arthur laffer in the mid 1970s the laffer curve illustrates the relationship between the tax rates citizens pay and the total tax revenue the government collects as tax rates rise from zero revenue increases to an optimal point after that point the tax rate becomes too high discouraging workers revenue begins to decline revenue is zero at both a 0 and 100 tax rate and it is maximized somewhere in the middle in real life no one knows exactly where the laffer curve s peak is which is why policymakers differ on the ideal amount of tax to levy similarly there is likely some amount of optimal government debt both too much and too little hinders economic growth unfortunately we do not know what that optimal level is either erring on the conservative side could restrict growth but borrowing too aggressively introduces the risk of a system meltdown i think mmt has intoxicated certain liberals the same way that the idea that tax cuts are always beneficial and self funding intoxicates some conservatives much like the most extreme application of supply side economics mmt takes some valid ideas and inflates them into an unsustainable extreme both ideas are in their broadest sense easy to understand but neither allows for sufficient real world complexity reasonable people can disagree about the levels of government debt or taxation that best serve our society but just as families need to spend responsibly so do governments there is no magic wand that can fix all of our problems painlessly mmt ultimately serves as one more reminder that we need to stay grounded in reality when we discuss our nation s finances

foreign exchange translation 12 underlying ebita h1 fy19 301 for further detailed commentary please see segmental performance pages 7 to 11 as expected the decline in markets airlines h1 result reflects the knock on impact of the summer 2018 heatwave overcapacities in spain arising from the shift in demand to eastern mediterranean continued brexit uncertainty as well as particularly strong comparatives for nordics in h1 last year in addition the result includes the initial impact from the 737 max grounding which commenced in mid march and the later timing of easter this year our strong market positions in markets airlines are an important factor in the success of our integrated model with a strong customer base and leading market shares this is what helps to drive the high return on our investments in holiday experiences we remain focussed on delivering the benefits of efficiency and digitalisation across the group in holiday experiences our hotels resorts reflecting the non repeat of prior year disposal gains in riu cruises and destination experiences segments continue to perform well this is due to the investment we have made in recent years to expand our differentiated content and thanks to our integrated model which drives occupancies rate and yields in our hotels and cruise ships hotels resorts delivered a resilient performance in h1 the result reflects the non repeat of prior year disposal gains as well as the continued shift of demand from spain to turkey as turkey is primarily a summer destination and given that we have additional lease commitments in h1 2019 in order to secure additional capacity in that destination the benefit to the turkish hotels result will be h2 weighted cruises continues to deliver a strong performance taking into account additional dry dock and launch costs in h1 net debt as at 31 march 2019 was eur 1 964 m h1 2018 eur 576 m as expected net debt is returning to the normal seasonal pattern as we complete reinvestment of disposal proceeds received in recent years it also reflects the planned ongoing financing of our aircraft order book with more aircraft being brought into ownership and under finance leases based on our building blocks for h2 growth we therefore reiterate our updated fy19 underlying ebita guidance as per our ad hoc announcement of 29 march 2019 of approximately 17 assuming 737 max flight resumption mid july up to approximately 26 assuming measures taken in relation to the grounding are extended to end of summer 2019 compared with underlying ebita rebased in fy18 of eur 1 177 m1 please refer to page 5 for further detail on the 737 max grounding we believe that tui s unique integrated model delivers high returns and our strategic initiatives provide strong strategic positioning for future growth 1 based on constant currency fy19 comparative rebased in december 2018 to eur 1 187 m to take into account eur 40 m impact for revaluation of euro loan balance within turkish lira entities in fy18 and adjusted further to eur 1 177 m for retrospective application of ifrs 15 outlook and expected development holiday experiences despite the pressures faced by markets airlines holiday experiences continues to perform well taking into account the riu gains on disposals in hotels resorts in the previous year this is due to the investment we have made in recent years to expand our differentiated content and our integrated model in order to drive occupancies rates and yields in our hotels and cruise ships we have opened 58 own hotels since the merger with a pipeline of further openings to come in terms of destinations we have seen demand continue to shift from western mediterranean back to the eastern mediterranean and north africa in addition demand for mexico from us customers has softened as a result of border tensions and safety concerns our portfolio of destinations unique brands and strong distribution capability leave us well positioned to continue to deliver sector leading returns in hotels resorts in cruises we have launched three ships this year new mein schiff 2 marella explorer 2 and in may hanseatic nature and continue to see good demand for these and the rest of our fleet load factor and yield performance remain in line with our expectations in destination experiences we are on track to deliver the integration of our prior year acquisitions with continued growth in sales of excursions and activities markets airlines in markets airlines the weak demand environment persists as outlined in our quarterly statement q1 2019 resulting in significant yield and margin pressure this is driven by a number of factors reduced demand due to last year s extraordinary hot summer slowdown of consumer confidence brexit uncertainty shift in demand to the eastern mediterranean coupled with overcapacity of flights to spain as well as the 737 max grounding for summer 2019 59 of the total programme has been sold compared with 62 at this time last year bookings are down 3 with average selling price up 1 against strong comparatives1 the competitive pricing environment means that this average selling price increase is not at a sufficient level to cover cost inflation all markets are trading on lower margins then prior year given the weaker demand environment and oversupply to some destinations such as spain we have taken a disciplined approach to capacity which is flat compared with prior year at the same time enabling us to protect our strong market leading positions 1 these statistics are up to 5 may 2019 shown on a constant currency basis and relate to all customers whether risk or non risk four strategic initiatives we believe that tui s unique integrated model delivers superior returns and our strategic initiatives provide strong strategic positioning for future growth grow hotel cruise business with vertical integration to drive premium returns protect and where possible extend strong positions in markets airlines through revenue and cost base initiatives these are focussed on digitalisation mass individualisation and upselling airline efficiency procurement increased mobile distribution and efficiency and standardisation of processes add scale for own holiday experiences and expand into new markets with our new gdn ota global distribution network online travel agent platform and add scale in destination experience markets with our new tours and activities platform expected development we have clear building blocks to deliver growth in h2 in holiday experiences we will deliver growth from our investments in hotels cruises and destination experiences with the annualisation of investment benefits from last year plus new hotel openings and ship launches this year in addition we expect further recovery in demand for turkey and north africa and the timing benefit of the later easter as previously flagged these benefits will be offset by the one off costs relating to the 737 max grounding of around eur 200 m assuming grounding until mid july up to around eur 300 m assuming grounding until end of summer please refer to page 5 for further detail on the 737 max grounding tui has strong strategic positioning for future growth underpinned by our unique integrated model and strategic initiatives the lifting of the 737 max grounding and a cyclical recovery in markets airlines would support growth beyond fy19 which will be further enhanced by revenue opportunities and cost base improvements additional growth will be delivered by growth investments in hotels and cruise ships based on normalised run rate net capex and investments estimated to be around 3 5 of turnover and ring fenced investments by joint ventures as well as our scalable gdn ota and destination experiences platforms report on changes in expected development on 29 march 2019 we informed the markets via an ad hoc announcement that following the grounding of the 737 max aircraft tui has made arrangements in order to guarantee customers holidays the group is utilising spare aircraft of its fleet extending expiring leases for aircraft that were supposed to be replaced by 737 max aircraft as well as leasing in additional aircraft tui s fleet which comprises around 150 aircraft currently includes 15 grounded 737 max for the uk belgium the netherlands and sweden a further eight 737 max are scheduled for delivery after the lifting of the grounding assuming 737 max flight resumption latest by mid july the group currently expects to see a one off impact on underlying ebita of approximately eur 200 m in connection with the 737 max grounding this impact is especially attributable to costs related to the replacement of aircraft higher fuel costs other disruption costs and the anticipated impact on trading as a result of this one off impact the executive board of tui ag has updated the guidance and now expects an underlying ebita for fy19 of approximately minus 17 compared with fy18 of eur 1 177 m rebased1 as stated in the ad hoc announcement of 29 march 2019 the executive board of tui ag expects a further negative one off effect if it does not become sufficiently certain in the course of may that flying the 737 max will resume by mid july tui will then need to fully extend the measures until the end of the summer season tui confirms the expectation disclosed in the ad hoc notification of 29 march 2019 for this additional one of impact until 30 september 2019 of up to eur 100 m for this scenario the executive board of tui ag had also updated the guidance on underlying ebitafor fy19 to up to minus 26 compared with fy18 of eur 1 177 m rebased1 due to the application of ifrs 15 turnover for fy18 has been adjusted to eur 18 5 bn our guidance of around 3 turnover growth in fy192 remains unchanged 1 based on constant currency fy19 comparative rebased in december 2018 to eur 1 187 m to take into account eur 40 m impact for revaluation of euro loan balance within

by eur 37 m reflecting the non repeat of prior year disposal gains in riu totalling eur 38 m occupancy remained high at 77 average revenue per bed increased by 4 reflecting foreign exchange translation mainly due to strengthening of the us dollar in riu underlying ebita decreased compared with prior year due to the non repeat of disposal gains and driven by the continued shift of demand from western to eastern mediterranean in addition demand from us customers for mexico was softer as a result of border tensions and safety concerns although lower than prior year occupancy remains strong at 84 average rate increased by 1 reflecting foreign exchange translation the result for robinson was slightly below prior year as the result of a club closure for renovation during q1 and seasonal losses of newly opened clubs h1 occupancy grew by 5 points to 68 driven by increased demand for clubs in turkey and north africa as well as the build up of demand for new clubs which opened last year blue diamond delivered an increase in underlying ebita as a result of new hotel openings the increase in average rate is due to foreign exchange translation although demand for our turkish hotels continues to improve this is not so apparent from the h1 especially q2 result due to the summer weighted seasonality of these resorts and due to the additional lease commitments taken in order

cruises occupancy and average daily rate for h1 were in line with prior year a good performance given the significant increase in german cruise capacity this year the lower occupancy and slightly lower average daily rate in q2 reflect the earlier launch of new mein schiff 2 meaning that sales started relatively close to launch marella cruises underlying ebita increased due to the launch of

corporate governance code the executive board confirms that it considers it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the consolidated financial statements accounting and measurement methods the preparation of the interim financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported values of assets liabilities and contingent liabilities as at the balance sheet date and the reported values of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results may deviate from the estimates the accounting and measurement methods adopted in the preparation of the interim financial statements as at 31 march 2019 are materially consistent with those followed in preparing the previous consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended 30 september 2018 exceptions to this are the standards and interpretations applied for the first time in financial year 2019 in particular the standards on revenue recognition ifrs 15 and recognition of financial instruments ifrs 9 applied as at 1 october 2018 the income taxes were recorded based on the best estimate of the weighted average tax rate that is expected for the whole financial year newly applied standards since the beginning of the financial year 2019 the following standards and interpretations amended or newly issued by the iasb have been applied by tui for the first time either mandatorily or voluntarily new applied standards in financial year 2019 standard applicable from amendments impact on financial statements amendments to ifrs 2 classification and measurement of share based payment transactions 1 1 2018 the amendments clarify the accounting for certain share based payment transactions not material ifrs 9 financial instruments 1 1 2018 the new standard replaces the current guidance in ias 39 on classification and measurement of financial assets and introduces new rules for hedge accounting the existing impairment rules are being superseded by a new model based on expected credit losses the effects are explained below amendments to ifrs 9 prepayment features with negative compensation 1 1 2019 early adoption the amendments serve to enable entities applying ifrs 9 that hold debt instruments with a prepayment feature under which a party receives or pays a reasonable compensation in the event of early termination of the contract to measure these instruments at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income until the effective date of the amendments such instruments have to be measured at fair value through profit or loss not material ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers 1 1 2018 ifrs 15 combines and supersedes the guidance on revenue recognition comprised in various standards and interpretations so far it establishes a single comprehensive framework for revenue recognition to be applied across industries and for all categories of revenue transactions specifying which amount of revenue and at which point in time or over which time period revenue is to be recognised ifrs 15 replaces amongst others ias 18 and ias 11 the effects of ifrs 15 and the clarifications to ifrs 15 are explained below clarifications to ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers 1 1 2018 the amendments comprise clarifications of the guidance on identifying performance obligations the principal versus agent assessment as well as the accounting for revenue from licences at a point in time or over time in addition it introduces pract to simplify first time adoption amendments to ias 40 transfer of investment property 1 1 2018 the amendments set out the conditions according to which property under construction or development which was previously classified as inventory could be transferred to investment property in case of an evident change in use and reversal not material ifric 22 foreign currency transactions and advance consideration 1 1 2018 the interpretation clarifies the exchange rate to be used when an entity has received or paid advance consideration in a foreign currency the date of transaction for the purpose of determining the exchange rate to use on initial recognition of the related asset expense or income is the date on which the entity initally recognises the advance consideration no impact the amendments to ifrs 4 applying ifrs 9 financial instruments with ifrs 4 insurance contracts published on 12 september 2016 and effective for the first time in the financial year under review are not relevant for tui group ifrs 9 the first time application of ifrs 9 primarily has the following effects on tui financial assets were reclassified based on the relevant business models for managing the financial assets and the cash flows characteristics associated with the financial assets with the exception of the equity and debt instruments previously classified as financial assets available for sale under ias 39 see next item this reclassification did not result in any material changes in measurement categories based on our assessment all financial assets previously measured at amortised cost also meet the conditions for classification as measured at amortised cost under ifrs 9 all equity instruments held were irrevocably allocated to the new measurement category financial assets at fair value recognised in oci debt instruments previously classified in the measurement category financial assets available for sale are designated as measured at fair value through profit or loss under ifrs 9 the determination of the fair values of the investments measured at cost under ias 39 resulted in an overall increase in the carrying amount of eur 22 9 m due to the transition to ifrs 9 recognised in other comprehensive income in line with the transition requirements the classification of financial liabilities did not give rise to any changes in measurement categories tui does not apply the so called fair value option the transition from ias 39 to ifrs 9 therefore had no effect an impairment loss is recognised for financial assets measured at amortised cost the simplified approach is applied to trade receivables and all expected losses over the term of the contract are recognised upon initial recognition in this context tui uses historical loss rates adjusted for credit default swaps cds rates for all other financial assets within the scope of ifrs 9 such as touristic loans impairments are determined using the general approach tui calculates the expected credit losses on the basis of default probabilities determined on the basis of an internal rating model the cds rates are also used as forward looking element in the general approach of the impairment model if the default risk of the financial asset has not deteriorated significantly since initial recognition 12 month credit losses are calculated in the event of a significant deterioration in the default risk value adjustments are recognised in the amount of the expected credit losses over the term it is reviewed quarterly whether the credit risk has increased significantly the transition from the incurred loss model to the new expected credit loss model resulted in an overall increase in loan loss provisions of eur 21 8 million upon transition to ifrs 9 which was recognised directly in equity as a result the impairment loss changed from eur 96 6 million to eur 118 4 million tui group exercises the option to continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements of ias 39 under ifrs 9 in the retrospective first time application of ifrs 9 tui group exercises the option not to restate comparative periods but to continue presenting them in line with previous ias 39 rules the cumulative first time application effect from the transition to ifrs 9 is recognised in equity as at 1 october 2018 the table below shows the reconciliation of the categories and carrying amounts of the financial assets and the effects of

customers tui group applied ifrs 15 for the first time as at 1 october 2018 using the retrospective method under which the comparative period is presented in line with ifrs 15 as at 1 october 2017 the transition date the first time application of ifrs 15 resulted in a decrease in equity of eur 41 4 m after tax the application of ifrs 15 lead in particular to the following results the flights hotel nights and other services included in a package holiday are transformed into one product for customers within the meaning of ifrs 15 tui as a tour operator provides a significant service of integrating these services into a bundle so that a package holiday constitute a single performance obligation for tui tour operator revenue recognition depending on the specific terms and conditions of the relevant contract most tour operator revenue transactions were recognised on departure i e at a point in time under ias 18 according to ifrs 15 revenue is now recognised when tui performs the service for the customer i e over the duration of the holiday as customers consume their holidays over time compared with the rules of ias 18 this usually leads to a change of timing for recognition of revenues and costs to a later date change of presentation in the income statement due to the transition to ifrs 15 tui has presented some revenue from tour operation under certain business models previously shown on a gross basis under turnover and cost of sales on a net basis since this financial year this primarily affects passenger related taxes and charges as well as denied boarding compensation shown on a net basis under revenues under ifrs 15 the application of ifrs 15 for joint ventures and associates measured at equity also created effects impacting underlying ebita through the result from joint ventures and associates tui applies the practical expedient offered under ifrs 15 63 dispensing with accounting for existing financing components in contracts with a term of one year or less advance payments received from customers constitute contract liaibilities within the meaning of ifrs 15 the effects of the first time application of ifrs 15 on tui group s consolidated financial statements are summarised in the section on restatement of comparative periods the effects of the recognition of additional revenues and tourist expenses at the beginning of a financial year and lower revenues and tourism expenses at the end of a financial year driven by the new later revenue recognition under ifrs 15 compared with revenue recognition on departure i e at a point in time under ias 18 will almost completely offset one another on constant business volumes restatement of comparative periods tui group has retrospectively applied ifrs 15 and ifrs 9 as at 1 october 2018 as described in the section newly applied standards unlike ifrs 15 ifrs 9 was introduced without a restatement of prior year comparatives in order to improve the presentation and the comparability of the

ammon news ammonnews international monetary fund imf mission chief to jordan martin cerisola said there are many signs of improvement in economic performance though jordan is facing difficult circumstances and pressing challenges in an interview with jordan news agency petra cerisola in a telephone call from washington affirmed the improvement was reflected in higher exports increased tourism income and remittances of workers abroad simultaneous with the approval by the board of directors of the imf for the second review of the performance of the national economy he noted the situation is still difficult and there are challenges that require the jordanian government to proceed with the implementation of reforms agreed with the parliament last year adding 2018 was particularly difficult but in 2019 jordanians began to see positive signs of improvement in economic performance such as high revenues from the tourism sector expats remittances and exports to iraq and some gulf countries with the continued and consistent implementation of the necessary reforms living standards will improve enabling the government to redirect funds to priority sectors such as education health and social programs he pointed out noting the imf is working hard to urge the donor community to continue supporting jordan financially to help face the refugee crisis and its reform efforts on the completion of the second review of jordan s economic performance cerisola said jordan has an opportunity to focus on implementing reforms and policies that will help reduce public debt job opportunities for youth and women and achieve comprehensive growth the imf official stressed the importance of giving priority to measures to reduce tax evasion axe cost of employing jordanians increase employment opportunities and implement the roadmap for the reform of the national electricity company nepco to reduce the high electricity costs on companies moreover he underscored the importance of completing reforms with a good social protection program aimed at protecting the unprivileged and middle classes cerisola noted the board approved the extension of the current program extended facility for an additional period of 7 months ending in march 2020 where the kingdom will begin negotiations with the imf on a new program for which consultations have not begun and its terms are not yet clear the second review has been adopted especially since the kingdom has maintained stability in a complex economic environment and economic and political challenges said cerisola adding the outlook remains difficult because economic growth remains low unemployment is high and the region still suffers from complications cerisola noted 2019 is the year of implementation the year to return to reduce the budget deficit adding the new income tax law is applied effectively and if the government continues to do so it will pave the way to fight tax evasion and this not only helps to slash the deficit and public debt but also helps to spend on education and health in a bid to increase citizens living standards discussing the role of private sector cerisola said one of the most important challenges is the rise in the unemployment rate to high levels noting the high unemployment is due to the decline in the level of economic growth and the high cost of employment in companies especially small and medium which requires the government s efforts to reduce the cost and pay more attention to these firms to jobs the focus on these issues unemployment and labor market reform is gradually achieved with an improvement in external conditions including the increase of the level of jordanian exports to iraq and the arab gulf countries he pointed out the continuation of reforms which was agreed will contribute to improving economic performance in 2019 and next year also in the citizens living standards and conditions he noted commenting on the impact of the london conference on the jordanian economy cerisola said the event was an important success in ensuring that international investors commit themselves to invest in jordan and the imf has played a key role to bring together donors to provide support for jordan in 2019 and 2020 and to pledge to sustain the assistance in the future the conference witnessed the participation of the imf director general christine lagarde who played an important role in explaining the opportunities and procedures of the jordanian government and its future plans to ensure the necessary assistance to the kingdom the economic growth rate in the first quarter was in line with the imf s expectations he said adding we do not see any evidence that the economy is in a difficult situation indeed the indicators we have identified reflect the improvement in the environment and the decrease in inflation doesn t reflect a decline in demand but reflects the plunge in world prices including food i am not worried about the inflation rate although it is below the imf s expectations so we will continue to monitor inflation which we expect to pick up again he said discussing growth stimulation cerisola pointed to the factors that will help and support growth including opening the border with iraq reducing the cost of exports in terms of transport and low level of interest rates in emerging markets compared to the level of the end of last year all with the increase in the value of remittances of workers in other countries citizens can not continue to wait they must see tangible improvements these improvements will not only come from improving the environment and conditions which are beyond the kingdom s control but also from direct measures and reforms by the government he pointed out but if we want inputs to the economy nepco s and labor market reforms must be treated as important he said adding there are measures that through long delayed legislation such as the loan guarantee act the bankruptcy law and the inspection act help to stimulate the economy and help citizens feel a tangible improvement in the living standards cerisola praised the monetary policy that works well in maintaining the balance in supporting the economy and the interest rate

that a research project of a consortium which valoe belongs to has been selected for the european union s horizon 2020 funding the objective of the research project is to substantially improve the competitiveness of the eu pv manufacturing industry by developing manufacturing solutions for high performance and low cost modules with excellent environmental profiles the project duration is 36 months and the project s budget totals approximately eur 15 million the partners in the consortium include europe s leading research institutes specialising in solar energy and related solutions as well as the leading materials technology companies valoe is the only solar cell manufacturer in the project valoe s share in the project is approximately eur two million for which the eu would provide a grant of eur 1 4 million the project s preparation phase is expected to be completed during the last quarter of 2019 when the final project agreement will be signed although the profit and loss effects of the ethiopian project was removed from valoe s books during the financial year 2016 the ethiopian project is continued in terms of operations and the company will resume recognizing revenue based on percentage of completion when the performance obligations under the ias have been satisfied valoe sees that one of the most important requirements is the opening of a eur 9 5 million irrevocable letter of credit in a bank approved by valoe or a significant cash payment from the customer the company may need to pledge a security for cash payment as usual in export business valoe s asian customer has ongoing negotiations on arranging financing for a factory delivery in asia worth eur 26 5 million valoe will enter the order in its order book only after the customer has secured financing for the factory project however the financing negotiations are ongoing and the outcome is not yet known further valoe has ongoing sales negotiations for several other production plants the following financials include valoe group s operations the figures in brackets are comparison figures for the corresponding period in 2018 unless stated otherwise during the financial years 2017 and 2018 the company has not reported the discontinued operations in its profit and loss statement but there are liabilities related to the discontinued operations in the company s balance sheet january

report due to snowy winter valoe did not deliver any solar power plants during the first quarter of 2019 however the company s research and development operated at full capacity the development of the ibc cell with isc konstanz has begun and the modification of the equipment at the cell plant in vilnius lithuania for ibc cell production is proceeding as planned but slightly behind the schedule valoe s objective is to produce the first ibc cell in the new factory in 2019 the new chrystal module family is scheduled to be introduced in the market at the same time as the ibc cell the presale of the chrystal module has started well valoe has ongoing negotiations for several deliveries of power plants based on the new module model mainly for the year 2020 valoe s bifacial ibc technology will open new doors to both domestic and international markets the company conducts negotiations on reserving the capacity of the cell factory in vilnius and developing and delivering new applications based on the ibc cell based on the ongoing negotiations i am convinced that our strategic choices are proving to be the right ones and as soon as the new products are completed our technology platform is ready this creates good conditions for the company s growth valoe requires a significant amount of additional funding as previously disclosed first the company needs funding to pay for the remaining part of the purchase price of the lithuanian factory and construction costs and later in 2019 to meet the company s other strategic goals valoe is in financial negotiations which yet must be completed the sufficiency of working capital remains a challenge until the funding is secured valoe s strategy valoe operates in industries applying clean energy technology and provides products applications and services worldwide based on valoe s strategy the company has the following four service and product concepts 1 sales and supply of photovoltaic modules and systems sales of modules and small photovoltaic systems are valoe s most visible product group all valoe s pv modules are manufactured at the company s factory in mikkeli for the time being they are mainly delivered to the company s distributors and future manufacturing partners further the company sells and provides solar power plants and systems directly to its customers in finland and abroad valoe has enhanced the sale of its modules and solar systems in finland by building sales channels for its products systematically forus capital oy which specializes in the sales of electricity produced from renewable sources has been valoe s most important customer during 2018 and valoe has used a major part of its sales resources to support forus capital s sales to finnish property owners production companies and communities current capacity of the company s mikkeli factory is designed to annually produce pv modules worth max eur 6 8 million at the current market prices encouraged by good sales prospects valoe has taken action to increase its production capacity in mikkeli finland during 2018 valoe has commenced to develop flexible and ultra light odd form modules according to valoe s view there is significant market potential in such modules this kind of modules can be used for example to vehicles to anywhere energy needs of logistics chains or to aviation and aerospace applications in these environments energy supply problems have generally been solved in very expensive and less environmentally friendly ways and there is no normal competition in the market a solar power system must have very high efficiency combined with efficient space usage in order to succeed in this market valoe believes that the company s back contact technology and ibc cells provide valoe with good conditions for developing photovoltaic applications for these markets 2 development and sales of production lines and related components manufacturers operating in the developing markets like china are typical investors for new module manufacturing production lines these valoe s potential customers are now manufacturers of traditional h patterns modules according to the information available to valoe many of the manufacturers are going to start manufacturing next generation back contact modules in most cases these customers have use their own module manufacturing recipe and need only single equipment or production lines valoe estimates that typical price of single equipment or a production line for back contact modules is eur 4 8 million a single production equipment costs eur 0 3 1 0 million 3 manufacturing partner network the cornerstone of valoe s strategy is to sign manufacturing partnership agreements or technology licensing agreements with solar module manufacturers who as newcomers on the market would commit themselves to valoe s production technology and to using components designed for valoe s back contact technology valoe provides a partner with a turnkey delivery project secures availability of components for a partner either by manufacturing components by itself or by procuring required components from elsewhere and as a technology partner commits itself to minority shareholding in a manufacturing company manufacturing partners pursued by valoe operate mainly on developing markets and produce solar energy modules for local and nearby markets value of a typical turnkey plant delivery is more than ten million euros valoe signed its first manufacturing partnership agreement with ethiopian ls corp in 2016 however the technology delivery based on the agreement has not yet been executed as per the date of this interim report on the basis of the early stages of the ethiopian project valoe has gained valuable information on costs and profitability for future solar plant deliveries and projects valoe s manufacturing plant concept equipment technology and deliveries are standardized and with the experience gained in the first project the profitability of the following project deliveries can be expected to be good further each delivered manufacturing plant or production line generates to valoe continuous profitable business through component sales valoe s objective is that only valoe s components are used at the manufacturing plants and production lines valoe has delivered the product certificates valoe has applied for on behalf of a customer are valid only if the customer uses components approved by valoe based on valoe s experience the availability of the components is limited elsewhere for the moment valoe s growth strategy is based on signing new manufacturing partnership agreements valoe is aiming to sign at least 10 manufacturing partnership contracts after achieving this amount of partnerships valoe s partnership network is so wide that even the biggest solar module manufacturers will not remarkably benefit from the advantage of economies of scale e g in raw materials purchases compared to valoe s network 4 module components sales mainly to manufacturing partners special components mainly for valoe s manufacturing partners are the most important part in valoe s strategy and most remark able in terms of net sales potential valoe s first component is conductive back sheet cbs that has been developed by valoe and is one of the most important components in a module one normal size module production plant using back contact technology needs approximately 300 000 500 000 conductive back sheets in a year when operating at full capacity based on current estimation considering price level in the near future each production line will annually require back sheets worth approximately 5 11 million euros typically component deliveries to manufacturing partners can commence at the earliest about 12 months from the signing of the manufacturing partnership agreement in the future valoe plans to provide its manufacturing partners also with the company s solar cells based on the ibc technology as well as other special components according to the company s estimates a full sized module factory could buy valoe cells for about eur 18 25 million annually other components may include for example other manufacturers smart components components for energy storage and software for power management and electricity invoicing in the long run valoe will include technologies related to energy storages and fuel cells as well as technologies increasing general usage of solar electricity in the company s offering with regard to the expertise in these technologies valoe will cooperate with its technology partners market conditions the prices of solar modules collapsed and decreased by ca 70 percent during 2010 2012 the prices of low and middle priced modules decreased by ca 30 percent again in 2016 and 2017 intense price competition followed by decrease in production costs of solar energy and the fall in china s domestic sales volumes further decreased prices outside china which has led to a rapid increase in solar electricity production worldwide and thus generated strong growth in the solar business the competitiveness of the solar electricity compared to the fossil fuels and other renewable energy sources will continue increasing faster and faster the market share of the back contact module technology is now small but is estimated to grow strongly in the next few years already in 2018 the production cost of solar electricity was below the cost of traditional electricity production in some geographical areas valoe is prepared for its competitors introducing their own back contact modules and other innovations in the near future the companies that will succeed in price competition will continue decreasing the prices of their standard products based on sales volumes and increasing production capacity and will continue worldwide price war valoe believes that innovative companies capable of continuously developing new generation technologies will succeed in the future business environment valoe trusts it will be one of these companies according to valoe s view the prices of low end modules will unlikely rise thus valoe is focusing on developing production technology for next generation cells and modules in the high end price categories s price reduction has not been remarkable valoe views that the most favourable markets for the company are the markets with incomplete or malfunctioning electricity grid e g in africa but also in asia and south america valoe trusts that it has even better possibilities to succeed if it is a part of the solar electricity value chain including solar electricity storages and smart grids according to the information now available to valoe there is only one major automation manufacturer besides valoe in the market who provides its customers with turnkey production capacity for back contact modules valoe is aware that besides this automation manufacturer there are companies developing production capacity for a similar application however according to valoe s knowledge it is the only back contact manufacturer with major existing mass production capacity for the moment valoe provides production technology to all companies interested in back contact modules e g large and often national solar energy projects module subcontractors and or original equipment manufacturers valoe views that local production will increase significantly in the near future however valoe is not aiming at becoming a local manufacturer but always seeks for a local partner and an investor for a solar module factory project valoe is responsible for production technology product quality and development local investors and partners are responsible for project funding as well as marketing and product sales financing during the financial year 2018 valoe accelerated its product development and has continued to invest in the research and development during the reporting period too in order to proceed with the development projects valoe will require new funding valoe s current investment plan needs new funding of at least seven million euros to be materialized for which valoe has opened discussions with its major shareholders valoe has also entered into funding negotiations with capital investors and industrial companies one option is to arrange public offering either together with or separately from a directed share issue additionally the company has a product development loan from business finland prev tekes in the amount of eur 4 1 million out of which there is as per the date of this interim report a total of eur 0 8 million still to be withdrawn in case the company manages to collect the intended amount of new capital in the arrangements described above the company is able to perform its investment plan in march 2019 valoe disclosed to have been informed that a research project of a consortium which valoe belongs to has been selected for the european union s horizon 2020 funding the objective of the research project is to substantially improve the competitiveness of the eu pv manufacturing industry by developing manufacturing solutions for high performance and low cost modules

the trade war is back on this week china vowed to raise tariffs on 60 billion of us goods retaliating against tariffs the us government imposed on may 10 the white house is now threatening to levy 25 duties on all remaining chinese goods the us imports with both sides girding for battle it s worth taking stock of their respective weaponry the us buys huge quantities of stuff from china importing a record 540 billion worth of goods and services in 2018 despite the imposition of tariffs that year that limits us president donald trump to the fairly straightforward response of simply hiking tariff levels on chinese goods higher and higher but risking a backlash at home from consumers and businesses advertisement china s options are a bit more complicated china imports a relatively small volume of branded goods from the us but is still a huge market for us agricultural products and other commodities beijing does however have other less conventional weapons at its disposal that trump does not let s review some fire up the china propaganda machine the chinese communist party boasts the firepower of the planet s biggest propaganda machine as quartz described last year authorities can easily whip up anti us sentiment through the state run news broadcasts and newspapers that are the main source of information for most chinese citizens inspiring mass boycotts of us imports and american brands there are signs the propaganda apparatus is already swinging into action chinese state media were mysteriously quiet when trump threatened to raise tariffs again on may 5 but since then they ve come out swinging wielding 5 000 years of chinese history as a weapon to prove the nation can weather any dispute with the us in the trade war the us side fights because of greed and arrogance china is fighting back to protect its legitimate rights and interests declared an editorial in the official xinhua news agency and the communist party paper the people s daily may 13 this is a real people s war it concluded advertisement the purposefully belligerent global times also backed by beijing went further mocking the white house s tall tales on trade and calling trump an irrational gambler it is rare for beijing to mobilize chinese citizens in global conflicts and trade issues notes jorge guajardo former mexican ambassador to china and a consultant on trade in dc that they are doing so now means that they are gearing up for the long term and makes it less likely that chinese president xi jinping will make concessions to the us he said in an interview the sole fact that they are bringing it to the attention of domestic audiences means that they are at defcon 5 what a people s war looks like judging from recent history when beijing tell china s 1 4 billion citizens it s time for a people s war against another country the results can quickly show up in the bottom line of that country s companies japan has been a frequent target in 2012 the chinese government responded to a territorial spat over the senkaku diaoyu islands by igniting anti japanese propaganda sales of japanese branded cars plummeted by about half within weeks and hadn t fully recovered a year later advertisement the us tech hardware sector one of the few manufacturing sectors where the us remains the global leader appears to be the most exposed to china in an april report morgan stanley listed qualcomm broadcom texas instruments and micron technology as the us companies with the highest percentage of their sales in china us consumer brands have been investing in china for future growth but don t derive the bulk of their revenues from china yet general motors for example sold more cars in china last year than it did in the us but its profits are still mostly from north america that doesn t mean that a china boycott won t hurt of course apple and starbucks are among the s p 500 s biggest companies outside the tech sector that derive 20 of their sales from china advertisement it s not just the technology and consumer sectors beijing can pressure state owned enterprises which are the biggest importers of energy and agricultural commodities to cut their purchases of american goods this for example is what likely pushed down china s soybean imports from the us to zero in november and conversely what allowed them to rebound after trade tensions relaxed late last year like soybeans many of the imports that the government might target through state owned companies could impact states trump needs to win in 2020 including the liquified natural gas export hub of texas making it a particularly potent weapon beyond boycotts american companies have spent tens of billions of dollars in china in recent years on everything from building out regional headquarters to massive advertising campaigns to opening thousands of new stores even during the trade upheaval of 2018 us investment in china doubled beyond boycotts beijing can make things hard and expensive for american headquartered companies operating in china with bureaucratic foot dragging exercising its control over business licenses and initiating regulatory crackdowns advertisement this too has precedent after south korea s lotte group a massive conglomerate with a wide range of consumer businesses allowed the us to install an anti missile system on one of its golf courses near seoul beijing fined the company in china over its advertising practices and cracked down on lotte supermarkets in china for reasons like fire code violations chinese companies withdrew their products from its stores chinese protesters showed up outside some lotte businesses and hackers believed to be from china blocked lotte s chinese website after investing 9 6 billion in china lotte said in march it was exiting the country amid losses from the boycott however harassing foreign companies risk driving them out warns wei yao an economist at société générale beijing is already worried that more foreign owned manufacturing firms crucial to boosting its long term productivity growth and technological advancement will decamp for vietnam and other more peaceful places the most fearful aspect is that trade tensions could accelerate the offshoring of manufacturing companies or reduce foreign direct investment into china said yao in a recent note these could do long lasting damage to productivity advertisement clampdown on tourism to the us chinese visitors are vital to the us tourism industry and spend more money vacationing in america than people from any other country in the world overall tourism contributed to sales worth 7 8 of the us s gdp in 2018 according to the world travel and tourism council and supported 15 6 million jobs directly and indirectly beijing s ability to use its massive tourist spending power as a weapon isn t just a hypothetical threat when beijing targeted korea over its accommodation of the us s anti missile system in 2017 it instructed chinese tourism operators not to sell travel packages to south korea chinese tourists plunged more than 60 over the next six months in 2018 after growing by an average of more than 20 a year for the past decade the number of chinese travelers to the us was flat the council reported citing trade tensions for the decline advertisement sell off treasuries then there s the perennial threat of the nuclear option the notion that china will sell off its 1 1 trillion in us treasury bonds this is implausible for the simple reason that it s hard to manipulate the treasury market yao says if china s central bank sells too few nothing will happen says yao if it sells too much yields will rise and hurt the us as intended by pushing up corporate borrowing costs but it could backfire too higher us yields will suck foreign capital out of china pressuring the yuan to weaken said yao in an interview and while a little of that rebalancing would likely be welcome it would help offset some of the loss of chinese export competitiveness thanks to us tariffs depreciation can quickly spiral out of control of the central bank devalue the yuan if the nuclear option of bond sales is an empty threat china s real atomic artillery might be yuan devaluation the exchange rate is one of china s most powerful weapons in the trade war with the us says chen long economist at gavekal dragonomics a hong kong based financial services firm if the yuan weakened between 3 and 5 says chen fears would grow that the stuttering chinese economy was exporting deflation to the rest of the world and global markets and the us stock market in particular would likely take fright just as they did following china s devaluation in the second half of 2015 of course a market driven depreciation could have the same effect in the last year every time trade war tensions tighten the yuan loses value against the dollar it s since stabilized likely thanks in part to careful management by the authorities advertisement but fears about a slump in chinese exports not to mention a slowing economy that might result are already putting pressure on the yuan to weaken the central bank intervened in foreign exchange markets this week to offset depreciation but if things deteriorate a sharper drop is likely says freya beamish economist at pantheon macroeconomics a uk research firm f it becomes clear that the two sides are moving further apart markets seem likely to do the bulk of china s retaliation for it by sharply weakening the beamish wrote in a note yesterday china will lean against that depreciation but it won t and probably can t keep the currency stable in that context and indeed trump is so sensitive to declines in the us stock market that investors now talk about a trump put that is when the stock market drops enough like it did in the final months of 2018 the president s commitment to sign a trade deal with china suddenly revives advertisement while it s not clear how far shares must fall before trump re engages in deal making but as chen notes the president does seem to see fluctuations in the s p 500 and or the dow jones industrial average as real time measures of personal approval and the market seems unduly sensitive not just to the yuan but also to more general bad china news for example the markets yawned last week after trump blasted the chinese side for ruining the negotiations and raised tariff levels but the chinese announcement of much tinier duties caused market panic on monday morning a weaker yuan could cause more problems for the us of course than just stock price turbulence notably china s outsize role in asian supply chains means a weakening of the yuan will likely prompt its neighbors to let their currencies fall against the dollar too as brad setser economist at the council on foreign relations observes dollar strength between 2014 and 2015 proved brutal for factories in the us and is likely in part to blame for the stalling of us manufacturing exports since 2014 paywall the sector is already in somewhat shaky state last month the ism manufacturing index hit its lowest level since october 2016 and workers in manufacturing are as an important a part of trump s base as soybean farmers china is still in a tough spot clearly china has options but will they use them advertisement it certainly seems like china s propagandists are already starting to rile up nationalist ire that sort of thing is ugly hard to control and can definitely hurt a handful of companies china s leaders can act as if they re standing up to american imperialists something even more important than usual given that it s the the 70th anniversary of the nation s founding while not putting the negotiations at stake then again these things can easily backfire as andrew polk economist at trivium china a beijing based research firm points out the last thing they want to do is ratchet up tension remember they still want this trade war to go away or to make us companies start pulling out any and all of these retaliatory measures could weigh on chinese growth when china can least afford it in the past when the economy was growing faster the government might have been able to risk inflicting self harm to improve its bargaining position with the us knowing that it had the domestic policy tools to prop up the economy if it happened to slip now though the economy is already slipping companies are already pulling back investment something trade tensions will only exacerbate advertisement worse still china s leaders have built themselves into a nasty dilemma they have the political priority of keeping headline growth aloft while also trying to shrink the 30 plus trillion debt that they ve racked up in the process if both the us and china further escalate a trade war china could find its economy seriously out of balance

bengaluru in late march 2019 rahul gandhi the congress party president announced it would roll out an ambitious minimum income guarantee programme the nyuntam aay yojana nyay if voted to power we will wipe out poverty from the country he said adding that the scheme would target the poorest 20 the scheme promises to provide rs 72 000 annually or a flat uniform amount of rs 6 000 a month to the poorest 50 million indian families and entails a peak cost of rs 3 6 lakh crore 1 8 of india s gross domestic product gdp today wrote praveen chakravarty chairperson of the congress party s data analytics department in the economic times abhijit banerjee ford foundation international professor of economics at the massachusetts institute of technology was one of the economists consulted for formulating nyay financial viability is an issue he told indiaspend in an interview and suggested that many current schemes would have to be reviewed and shut down banerjee 58 co founded the abdul latif jameel poverty action lab or j pal a research organisation and is one of its directors he has been a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences and the econometric society and has been a guggenheim fellow and an alfred p sloan fellow he received the 2009 infosys prize for social sciences and economics and was named one of foreign policy magazine s top 100 global thinkers in 2011 he co authored poor economics with esther duflo which won the goldman sachs business book of the year award he served on the un secretary general s high level panel of eminent persons on the post 2015 development agenda in an interview with indiaspend banerjee spoke about the the financial viability of nyay the need for india to formulate a wealth tax and the quality of government data and interference in its estimation in january 2019 gdp for 2016 17 the year that saw demonetisation in november 2016 was revised upwards to 8 2 what is your assessment of the economy under the present government and how does it compare to the previous one these numbers have lost so much credibility i have no way of checking them and am not going to get into a debate about reading the tea leaves this is the tragedy of constantly revising data there are changes in definition and revisions but it somehow always seems that the growth in a particular year went up this process needs to stop no number is perfect but constantly tweaking the process where there is a potential for political interference does damage it creates suspicion about the quality of data you were one of the 108 signatories to a letter that red flagged data suppression and interference in data estimation by the current government have you witnessed government interference of this nature before and what must be done to resolve the matter there must be a committee of experts that has credibility to propose a stable methodology that can then be back cast say for a decade to reconstruct consistent gdp series for those years even in china there are are similar claims about data manipulation especially at the provincial level and there are many people there who are suspicious of the data i believe that some chinese government officials have even suggested that they look at non government numbers they seem be more open to this than we are in india there have long been discussions on why the gdp data is collected in a particular way or why the government does not invest more in the national sample survey it may be more true now that people are questioning political motives than before but the idea that the data collection agencies have failed is not new earlier the release of data was not so frequent and if there was clear opposition to the government s numbers the government had a set of experts who were established as being objective so it was a bit more process driven currently the niti aayog comes up with one number after the other whenever it wants when i speak to people in the financial world they say that they don t pay any attention to government data anymore we must invest money and effort to bring in experts from india and abroad and establish a process which is without interference and stick to it without any fiddling for say the next decade recently with reference to unemployment you wrote something will need to be done and it will probably eventually take the shape of a minimum income guarantee the congress has proposed nyay and the bharatiya janata party government has started implementing pm kisan announced in budget 2019 to offer income support to small and marginal farmers there have been questions about the financial viability of both particularly nyay your comments financial viability is an issue there is a long term problem we face i think we are not taxing the economy enough if nyay is implemented it will add urgency but even without it we need a series of fiscal intervention i have been saying this long before nyay was discussed i think we are under taxed we need to bring down our interest rates and give some semblance of balance to our budgets this will involve figuring out the subsidies that need to be cut and taxes to be increased or risk going back to high inflation we cannot afford the interest rates we have our share of government debt in gdp has been going up since 2014 and creditworthiness will eventually be hurt we do not want to get into such problems so whether or not we have nyay we will have to solve the problem praveen chakravarty chairperson of the congress party s data analytics department mentioned in an interview that around 939 schemes excluding 11 core schemes will have to be reviewed for financial rationalisation if nyay were implemented manmohan singh former prime minister and economist said that no new taxes on the middle class would be required to fund nyay and that 1 2 to 1 5 of gdp at the scheme s peak would be needed do you agree i do not think there is going to be enough money from just cutting the minor schemes but i do agree that schemes should be reviewed and many should be shut down there is money there which can be utilised both taxes and expenditure rationalisation are important i am all for more taxes on the rich maybe we can look at some version of a wealth tax there needs to be some thought on how much the wealthy population can be taxed have you made an assessment of the schemes that can be shut down to facilitate nyay the right way to think about nyay is that it is the opening step in creating an infrastructure for making money transfers possible rather than an entitlement for a particular good it is better to give people cash than a fertiliser subsidy or free power however the first step has to be to convince people that the subsidy delivery mechanism works this is what nyay can do so the major subsidy schemes cannot be removed before nyay is well established and in the short run there will definitely be some fiscal pressure you were consulted by the congress for nyay what sort of inputs did you provide how will a government go about targeting the poorest given that poverty data has not been collected since 2011 12 i think the hardest group to target would be those who are a bit further up beyond the bottom 20 the poorest 20 are relatively easy to identify and if they are willing to be inclusive even if it includes up to 22 25 the targeting should be not too bad in our research we find that there is relative agreement on who the poorest are even within villages so it should be possible to combine an updated version of the socio economic and caste census and some local community review mechanisms to come up with a targeting procedure it may not be perfect but the scheme has to be run in a way to ensure that the associated infrastructure works and people do not get excluded for random reasons i was consulted on matters relating to estimating beneficiaries for the scheme considering that exact numbers or data are not available economic inequality is high in india the nine richest indians now own wealth equivalent to the bottom 50 nearly 50 of the population is dependent on agriculture that contributes 14 of the gdp rural distress is a major issue what are the solutions is moving people out of agriculture the only viable alternative we do not have the urban infrastructure to move everybody out of agriculture it may be true that around 50 are dependent on agriculture but the share of their incomes from agriculture is actually less than 50 many people in agriculture have other jobs to supplement their incomes which often involve temporary migration to cities one of the things governments can do is to create low cost spaces for migrants to live in so that it is more viable to work in urban areas but this is unlikely to be a very big part of the story in the short run my prediction is that we will move towards cash transfer as many of these lives are only marginally viable especially among the younger more educated generation that does not want to do the same jobs or have the same lifestyles as their parents did we have this political problem that needs to be solved in a march 2019 paper you along with thomas piketty and amory gethin noted that voters seem to be less driven by straightforward economic interests than by sectarian interests and cultural priorities worldwide we have seen a rise in populist leaders is this trend a major worry for india given that the rise of religious divisions and the persistence of strong caste based cleavages is determining voters choices while education income and occupation play little role controlling for caste there should be more politics based on economic interests because those are aspects that we can deliver on without creating social divisions if voters come to believe that the state cannot offer anything useful in terms of economic benefits then they will be responsive to sectarian claims if people start caring about only sectarian issues then parties have an incentive to promote it and then we will end up in a totally fractured polity the advantage of economic interests is that they can often be addressed

weaker than expected data for brazil china japan korea nigeria and elsewhere lowering growth by 410 kb d versus our last report even so slower demand growth is likely to be short lived as we believe

prices importantly this assessment is a snapshot of the potential value of las chispas we have been exploring the las chispas district for only three years continued drilling success may add significant value to the project the resources used in the pea consists of 10 of 30 known veins drill tested near surface in the district we currently have 14 drill rigs running at las chispas of which 6 are focused on expanding the resource and testing new targets and 8 are completing infill drilling for re categorizing resources the new decline into area 51 is progressing well with an

of the mineral resources 10 the luigi vein is not included in the diluted resource incorporated in the mine plan of the pea this vein needs further review to justify economic viability process plant and metallurgy detailed metallurgical test work was completed from september 2018 to march 2019 to assess potential silver and gold recoveries for the las chispas project as announced in a news release dated april 18 2019 titled positive metallurgical recoveries for las chispas a 445 kilogram bulk sample was collected from 51 core hole and nine underground samples and compiled into 15 different samples based on geo metallurgical domains which were combined into three master composites low medium and high grade the best recoveries were generated from a process flowsheet that included a gravity recovery circuit with intensive cyanidation of the gravity concentrate and the gravity tails processed through standard leaching the pea assumes this is followed by a standard counter current decantation milling process with gold and silver recovered through a merrill crowe circuit the test work showed recoveries of 91 95 for silver and 98 99 for gold additional test work was completed on intensive leaching of gravity concentrates which showed recoveries of 99 for both gold and silver for the pea the company has limited the intensive leaching recovery to 90 until further optimization work is completed therefore an average recovery of 89 9 for silver and 94 4 for gold is used in the pea except during the six month start up period where the company further reduced the recovery by 5 the process plant has been designed at a nameplate capacity of 1 358 tpd with the production schedule assuming 8 downtime over the course of a year at 92 operating time the plant can support throughput of 456 000 tonnes per year or 1 250 tpd initial and sustaining capital cost estimates the pea estimates initial capital requirements of 100 5 million and cumulative

to enhance value several potential opportunities have been identified that may significantly enhance the economic return outlined in the pea including but not limited to the following exploration potential the diluted resource estimated for the pea is based on the february 2019 mineral resource estimate which includes 10 of 30 known veins on the project the company currently has 14 drill rigs on site with six 6 of those rigs dedicated to expanding resources and drill testing new targets for potential discoveries with success on further drilling there are several ways that expanded resources could improve the economics of the project including throughput expansion the mine plan for the pea is based on a 1 250 tpd throughput scenario which results in an 8 5 year mine life expanded resources have the potential to justify increased mine and mill throughput as part of the upcoming fs silvercrest will evaluate the potential costs to expand the process plant capacity to 1 500 2 000 tpd with potential benefits to unit costs for processing and g a with respect to economies of scale reduced development cost per ounce babicanora sur luigi granaditas including la blanquita have relatively high development costs per ounce of diluted resource expanding the diluted resource for these veins would spread the relatively high development capital over more ounces improving economics and reducing the aisc per ounce high grade discovery the grade profile for the las chispas project is heavily weighted towards the first four years of production a new high grade discovery could help smooth the decline in production that begins in year five by prioritizing development of a new high grade discovery and delaying the development of the lower grade veins while potentially adding economies of scale at the same time pea excluded resources the diluted resource that is incorporated into the mine plan for the pea excludes approximately 20 million oz ageq that were estimated in the february 2019 resource estimate specifically discrete mineralized zones in the babicanora fw babicanora norte and sur veins and all of the luigi vein resources have been excluded from adjacent designed mine stopes and discrete isolated zones which currently do not have enough critical mass to justify the added cost of underground development for production silvercrest is optimistic that by applying optimized stope designs and follow up drilling to expand discrete zones some excluded resources may be included in a future mine plan mining method the pea is based on 100 cut and fill underground mining with split blasting resue applied in those areas where vein widths drop to less than 1 5 metres there are known opportunities for the babicanora vein in particular to be mined using lower cost long hole and sub level mining methods in the areas where the vein averages over 3 0 metres in true width this could reduce mining and development costs at the beginning of the mine life metallurgy the results from our metallurgical test work suggested intensive leaching recoveries of 99 for both gold and silver gravity concentrates in the pea the intensive leaching recoveries is set at 90 which results in an implied recovery of 89 9 for silver and 94 4 for gold test work completed to date suggests potential for improved silver recoveries of 91 95 for silver and 98 99 for gold silvercrest intends to follow up these promising results with further test work to be completed and incorporated into the fs power line the pea assumes the use of onsite generated power using diesel fuel at 0 28 kwh and exposes the operation to fluctuations in the price of fuel the fs will be contemplating the connection of the site to the national grid via power available at an estimated cost of 0 09 kwh stockpiled material at start of production the mine schedule for the pea assumes that during the six month start up period of operations 100 of the mill throughput will be sourced from the current surface stockpiles with an estimated 175 000 tonnes grading 224 gpt ageq once silver and gold recoveries are optimized then processing of higher grade material would begin based on the ongoing construction of a new decline silvercrest plans on underground development in high grade mineralization starting in h2 2019 along with test mining and stockpiling material from area 51 this stockpiled material could be up to 20 000 tonnes for 2019 with additional tonnes before conceptual start up based on the possible early high performance of the mill high grade material could be processed in the first six months of operations with improved payback and npv feasibility study with the pea completed silvercrest is moving forward with a feasibility study for las chispas the company is targeting completion of the fs in h1 2020 and making a production decision following the release of a positive study of the 14 drill rigs currently working on site eight 8 of these rigs are focused on infill drilling in an effort to upgrade inferred resources into the indicated category for inclusion in the fs reserves on a related note the exploration decline into area 51 has been progressing smoothly ground conditions have been excellent which has allowed the company to advance the decline rapidly in less than three months the exploration decline has been advanced to over 420 metres with a target to intercept the high grade shoot 51 of the babicanora vein in q2 2019 once shoot 51 is intercepted 400 to 800 metres of mineralized development will be completed in h2 2019 this rapid access to high grade mineralization will allow us to conduct detailed feasibility work including further metallurgy assess geotechnical conditions reconcile underground grades with the resource model complete test mining to define the optimum mining method and determine more accurate development costs the recommended budget for the feasibility study field support for the study ongoing exploration work and exploration decline and development construction over the next 12 months is estimated at 17 5 million tetra tech s work to complete the pea demonstrates that the las chispas project has robust economic potential and recommends that silvercrest continue developing the project with emphasis on the exploration work required to improve confidence in inferred resources tetra tech recommends that the feasibility study evaluate alternate mining methods which could have lower costs than the cut and fill method considered in the pea qualified persons the independent qualified persons as defined

a pakistani dealer counts us dollars at a currency exchange shop in karachi pakistan and the imf have reached a new agreement securing a 6 billion bailout for the cash strapped country officials said sunday following months of painstaking negotiations between the two sides the agreement marks pakistan s 22nd bailout with the fund as the country struggles to stave off a looming balance of payments crisis while its economy teeters due to low growth soaring inflation and mounting debt the programme aims to support the authorities strategy for stronger and more balanced growth by reducing domestic and external imbalances improving the business environment strengthening institutions increasing transparency and protecting social spending said ramirez rigo head of the imf delegation in a statement released late sunday according to pakistan s finance advisor abdul hafeez sheikh the country is set to receive 6 billion from the imf in addition to 2 to 3 billion from the world bank and asian development bank over the next three years we have a 12 billion gap in our annual payments and we don t have the capacity to pay them sheik said in a televised address as he announced the new agreement with the fund analysts have warned that any fresh imf deal would likely come with myriad restrictions that could hobble prime minister imran khan s grand promises to build an islamic welfare state as the country is forced to tighten its purse strings battered economy pakistani stockbrokers monitor share prices during a trading session at the pakistan stock exchange psx in karachi the deal with the imf comes weeks after sheikh a former world bank official who was pakistan s finance minister from 2010 2013 was appointed as adviser on finance after finance minister asad umar resigned amid a wide ranging cabin reshuffle the abrupt resignation of umar one of khan s most powerful ministers was particularly shocking due to his perceived role in overseeing the vital negotiations with the imf over the long delayed bailout the announcement comes as discontent is already growing over measures khan s government has taken to fend off the crisis including devaluing the rupee by some 30 percent since january 2018 sending inflation to five year highs a government report published friday also noted that pakistan s growth rate is set to hit an eight year low with the country s gdp rate likely to sink to 3 3 percent against a projected target of 6 2 percent pakistan has had 21 bailouts since it joined the imf in 1950 its most recent loan was issued in 2013 worth 6 6 billion the united arab emirates pakistan s largest trading partner in the middle east and a major investment source recently offered 3 billion to support the battered economy islamabad also secured 6 billion in funding from saudi arabia and struck a 12 month deal for a cash lifeline during khan s visit to the kingdom in october a pakistani labourer pulls a loaded cart on a street in karachi however the influx of gulf cash failed to reverse the economic headwinds battering pakistan as high fuel prices low tax yields and rising inflation have kept the country off balance the crisis also comes as pakistan is facing possible sanctions from the financial action task force an anti money laundering monitor based in paris for failing to rein in terror financing the organisation will soon decide whether to add pakistan to a blacklist that would trigger automatic sanctions further weakening pakistan s already faltering economy to add to its woes the united states has also warned that it will be watching closely to ensure pakistan does not use imf money to repay debts to china which has poured billions into the country for infrastructure projects under its belt and road initiative us president donald trump has already proven to show little sympathy for pakistan after last year cutting 300 million in military aid that had been flowing over logistical assistance to us forces in afghanistan

there are no known legal political environmental or other risks that could materially affect the potential development of the mineral resources 10 the luigi vein is not included in the diluted resource incorporated in the mine plan of the pea this vein needs further review to justify economic viability process plant and metallurgy detailed metallurgical test work was completed from september 2018 to march 2019 to assess potential silver and gold recoveries for the las chispas project as announced in a news release dated april 18 2019 titled positive metallurgical recoveries for las chispas a 445 kilogram bulk sample was collected from 51 core hole and nine underground samples and compiled into 15 different samples based on geo metallurgical domains which were combined into three master composites low medium and high grade the best recoveries were generated from a process flowsheet that included a gravity recovery circuit with intensive cyanidation of the gravity concentrate and the gravity tails processed through standard leaching the pea assumes this is followed by a standard counter current decantation milling process with gold and silver recovered through a merrill crowe circuit the test work showed recoveries of 91 95 for silver and 98 99 for gold additional test work was completed on intensive leaching of gravity concentrates which showed recoveries of 99 for both gold and silver for the pea the company has limited the intensive leaching recovery to 90 until further optimization work is completed therefore an average recovery of 89 9 for silver and 94 4 for gold is used in the pea except during the six month start up period where the company further reduced the recovery by 5 the process plant has been designed at a nameplate capacity of 1 358 tpd with the production schedule assuming 8 downtime over the course of a year at 92 operating time the plant can support throughput of 456 000 tonnes per year or 1 250 tpd initial and sustaining

the taxable income generated from the mine to estimate the lom cash taxes payable las chispas opportunities to enhance value several potential opportunities have been identified that may significantly enhance the economic return outlined in the pea including but not limited to the following exploration potential the diluted resource estimated for the pea is based on the february 2019 mineral resource estimate which includes 10 of 30 known veins on the project the company currently has 14 drill rigs on site with six 6 of those rigs dedicated to expanding resources and drill testing new targets for potential discoveries with success on further drilling there are several ways that expanded resources could improve the economics of the project including throughput expansion the mine plan for the pea is based on a 1 250 tpd throughput scenario which results in an 8 5 year mine life expanded resources have the potential to justify increased mine and mill throughput as part of the upcoming fs silvercrest will evaluate the potential costs to expand the process plant capacity to 1 500 2 000 tpd with potential benefits to unit costs for processing and g a with respect to economies of scale reduced development cost per ounce babicanora sur luigi granaditas including la blanquita have relatively high development costs per ounce of diluted resource expanding the diluted resource for these veins would spread the relatively high development capital over more ounces improving economics and reducing the aisc per ounce high grade discovery the grade profile for the las chispas project is heavily weighted towards the first four years of production a new high grade discovery could help smooth the decline in production that begins in year five by prioritizing development of a new high grade discovery and delaying the development of the lower grade veins while potentially adding economies of scale at the same time pea excluded resources the diluted resource that is incorporated into the mine plan for the pea excludes approximately 20 million oz ageq that were estimated in the february 2019 resource estimate specifically discrete mineralized zones in the babicanora fw babicanora norte and sur veins and all of the luigi vein resources have been excluded from adjacent designed mine stopes and discrete isolated zones which currently do not have enough critical mass to justify the added cost of underground development for production silvercrest is optimistic that by applying optimized stope designs and follow up drilling to expand discrete zones some excluded resources may be included in a future mine plan mining method the pea is based on 100 cut and fill underground mining with split blasting resue applied in those areas where vein widths drop to less than 1 5 metres there are known opportunities for the babicanora vein in particular to be mined using lower cost long hole and sub level mining methods in the areas where the vein averages over 3 0 metres in true width this could reduce mining and development costs at the beginning of the mine life metallurgy the results from our metallurgical test work suggested intensive leaching recoveries of 99 for both gold and silver gravity concentrates in the pea the intensive leaching recoveries is set at 90 which results in an implied recovery of 89 9 for silver and 94 4 for gold test work completed to date suggests potential for improved silver recoveries of 91 95 for silver and 98 99 for gold silvercrest intends to follow up these promising results with further test work to be completed and incorporated into the fs power line the pea assumes the use of onsite generated power using diesel fuel at 0 28 kwh and exposes the operation to fluctuations in the price of fuel the fs will be contemplating the connection of the site to the national grid via power available at an estimated cost of 0 09 kwh stockpiled material at start of production the mine schedule for the pea assumes that during the six month start up period of operations 100 of the mill throughput will be sourced from the current surface stockpiles with an estimated 175 000 tonnes grading 224 gpt ageq once silver and gold recoveries are optimized then processing of higher grade material would begin based on the ongoing construction of a new decline silvercrest plans on underground development in high grade mineralization starting in h2 2019 along with test mining and stockpiling material from area 51 this stockpiled material could be up to 20 000 tonnes for 2019 with additional tonnes before conceptual start up based on the possible early high performance of the mill high grade material could be processed in the first six months of operations with improved payback and npv feasibility study with the pea completed silvercrest is moving forward with a feasibility study for las chispas the company is targeting completion of the fs in h1 2020 and making a production decision following the release of a positive study of the 14 drill rigs currently working on site eight 8 of these rigs are focused on infill drilling in an effort to upgrade inferred resources into the indicated category for inclusion in the fs reserves on a related note the exploration decline into area 51 has been progressing smoothly ground conditions have been excellent which has allowed the company to advance the decline rapidly in less than three months the exploration decline has been advanced to over 420 metres with a target to intercept the high grade shoot 51 of the babicanora vein in q2 2019 once shoot 51 is intercepted 400 to 800 metres of mineralized development will be completed in h2 2019 this rapid access to high grade mineralization will allow us to conduct detailed feasibility work including further metallurgy assess geotechnical conditions reconcile underground grades with the resource model complete test mining to define the optimum mining method and determine more accurate development costs the recommended budget for the feasibility study field support for the study ongoing exploration work and exploration decline and development construction over the next 12 months is estimated at 17 5 million tetra tech s work to complete the pea demonstrates that the las chispas project has robust economic potential and recommends that silvercrest continue developing the project with emphasis on the exploration work required to improve confidence in inferred resources tetra tech recommends that the feasibility study evaluate alternate mining methods which could have lower costs than the cut and fill method considered in the pea qualified persons the independent qualified persons as defined in ni 43 101 for the pea and who have reviewed and approved the

on 1 may japan welcomed a new emperor the ageing akihito 85 allowed his 59 year old son naruhito to take over a lineage reputed to be the oldest unbroken line of royals in the world compared to its european counterparts japan s imperial family is at once more unassuming and more withdrawn from the people it represents nowhere are the affairs and scandals that feed the media machine around the windsors the top gossip in recent years has been a potential marriage between a royal granddaughter and a law school student with a gasp indebted mother the incoming monarch yields little additional fodder he is a royal with a reputation for steadfast competence international curiosity and the incongruous desire never really to stand out his two year stint at oxford university resulted in a book on waterways bracingly titled the thames and i he even switched from the violin to the viola explaining that the larger instrument which typically supplies a support role rather than the melody is more appropriate for his tastes monarchists will have to be patient for the real pomp and circumstance as the enthronement rites won t take place until a more auspicious time in october but 1 may marked the beginning of new era quite literally the imperial calendar used in much bureaucratic and official business changed from the 31st year of heisei to the first year of reiwa at the same point a generation ago the future of japan could not have looked brighter when emperor akihito began his reign in 1989 the economy was the second largest in the world and the country was producing the most cutting edge consumer technology of the day pundits predicted and sometimes feared a new japan led era of global growth within months however the stock market crashed the economy flat lined and the country never recovered though japan remains economically more powerful than any country in europe it is now easy to forget that fact in the shadow of its much larger neighbour china many of the issues that japan faces today are not so different from those of another set of islands lying off the coast of a larger more powerful entity in the form of the eu japan is a sobering test case of just how obstinate a low yield economy can be the gdp has barely budged over the past 30 years and economic growth rarely breaks 2 per cent initially the government attempted to end the malaise through deregulation particularly of the labour market in the country once known for lifetime employment 40 per cent of the labour force now works on temporary contracts with widespread job security a thing of the past so are the generous pensions health coverage and unemployment insurance that came with lifetime employment the precarious future has driven marriage and fertility rates to record lows one

political dynasties his father was a former foreign minister his paternal grandfather an mp and his great uncle one of the longest serving prime ministers but the most conspicuous ornament in the family tree is his maternal grandfather nobusuke kishi who ran the brutal conscript labour system in japanese occupied manchuria held for war crimes he was released before trial in 1948 and eventually became prime minister calling unsuccessfully for revision of the constitution and the expansion of japan s military capabilities shinzo abe lacks the social skills of his extrovert grandfather whom he lauds in speeches indeed when abe took power in 2012 few expected him to last long or accomplish much they had seen him in the role before in 2006 when he held on for less than a year before resigning in the face of gaffes money scandals and parliamentary election losses and while suffering from poor health his second attempt however revealed a newfound sense of perseverance abe is set to become the country s longest serving prime minister distinguishing his first stint from his second is abenomics a powerful economic salvo that was to jolt the japanese economy back to life the combination of monetary easing fiscal stimulus and structural reform aimed to lift inflation to 2 per cent and produce a virtuous cycle of business expansion and consumer spending but instead the economy performed a dead cat bounce a small recovery then nothing the effect on the national debt has been far greater it now stands at an eyewatering 250 per cent of gdp a long planned sales tax hike meant to pay for the huge borrowing is likely to be delayed again in fear it will drag the fragile economy back into recession as in the uk economic stagnation has not been accompanied by mass unemployment in japan just mass underemployment if measured by what people have to live on though more than 97 per cent of people who want jobs are working inequality has grown substantially japan is now one of the most unequal countries among the 36 members of the organisation for economic co 0peration and development oecd with more than 1 5 million out of its 50 million households surviving on welfare and the future is not promising one in six japanese children lives in poverty still the meagre economic growth is remarkable when one considers the shrinking population which has been declining since 2008 the fertility rate in both japan and the uk 1 45 and 1 80 births per woman respectively are below replacement levels of 2 1 percent but in britain immigration helps maintain the population growth at a mild 0 6 per cent due to both the influx of people and their higher average birth rates japan is losing more than 400 000 people per year and the rate is accelerating as the baby boomers die off bureaucrats hope to sustain the total population at 100 million a fifth smaller than its present size but no one knows how this will work or how the pension and public health care systems will be kept afloat without significant immigration even as the government looks into robotics to plug some of the gaps it is clear that in many industries such as elderly care there are limits to how far machines can substitute for human services plus robots do not pay taxes or pension contributions nativists in the west may hail japan with its foreign population of around 2 per cent as a model to follow but on the edge of the pacific even arch conservatives realise the system is untenable abe has been expanding migration channels rather than closing them down in the past year the government was gratified to see foreign workers increase by nearly 15 per cent to 1 5 million a total that has tripled over the past decade and expects to attract 345 000 more foreign workers over the next five years this growth is not only from programmes to attract highly skilled workers the government now courts low and medium skilled foreign workers mostly from china the philippines and vietnam to fill labour gaps in agriculture construction manufacturing and care work it has even opened the way for settlement and family reunion options previously unavailable to low paid workers the conservative state is still hesitant to call the mix anything like immigration and japan is hardly a choice destination of migrants it ranks below estonia and taiwan on its ability to attract and develop talent the influx comes as japan re evaluates its place in a world where its significance is shrinking an exercise that post brexit britain will face as well during the cold war the choice was made for japan in the wake of the allied victory in the second world war the american occupying army ensured that economic ties with a communist china were not revived and that japan s economic lot was thrown in with the capitalist west its prime minister at the time yoshida shigeru gave his name to the system under which japan would hand over responsibility for its defence and foreign policy to the americans while focusing its efforts on economic growth which it did with remarkable success in the space of a decade japan s gdp doubled in return japan relinquished large swaths of the country to the american military the greatest surrender is in okinawa prefecture where us bases cover over 15 per cent of the main island locals have fervently resisted the foreign presence both at the ballot box and through spectacular demonstrations today around two dozen bases and 50 000 us soldiers remain in the country along with the us navy s seventh fleet its largest abroad japan pays for this too shouldering three quarters of the cost for the us to extend its military reach deep into asia the same pliability holds for the economy despite japan s reputation for playing hardball when americans began buying up japanese consumer products in the 1980s the japanese simply lent the dollars back by purchasing us debt this is a tactic that china has learned from perhaps too well in 2010 it overtook its neighbour to become the world s second biggest economy and though china is japan s largest trading partner the island nation still cleaves to the us after donald trump won the election abe raced to new york to become the first foreign leader to meet him since then he has found that the americans are not as reliable as they once were the us jumped ship on abe s treasured trans pacific partnership the everyone but china club japan has been shut out of meetings with north korea much to abe s chagrin and the most recent round of trade negotiations with the us has proceeded only haltingly if nationalist resurgence has rendered rapprochement with china south korea and taiwan tricky some in japan wonder if tagging along with the us is worth the cost of turning away from their economically important and geopolitically powerful neighbours the hype around abenomics has distracted attention from abe s more ominous policy successes within a year of election he sidestepped debate to pass a law that greatly expands the government s remit for designating information a state secret now even environmental and health information can be rendered virtually inaccessible to the public pundits quickly dubbed it an anti whistle blower law but the media seems unlikely to present much of a threat in december 2013 abe installed at the helm of the national broadcasting agency nhk one of his cronies who confirmed that the country s most watched television network would remain complacent if the government says right we won t say left he declared in the following year several of japan s top journalists and news hosts were ousted the un and reporters without borders have expressed concern about the erosion of press freedom in 2017 abe employed his hallmark legislative style ramming through acts by short circuiting debate and votes to pass a new anti terrorism bill he pitched the law which criminalises more than 250 actions as necessary to protect the country during the 2020 tokyo olympics the japan federation of bar associations has noted that many of the forbidden deeds such as sit in protests or copying music have not the remotest connection to terrorism and merely offer pretexts for squashing grass roots political movements but these are side stories to abe s main agenda which is to normalise japan shorthand for comprehensively revising the constitution and creating a standing army the japanese constitution written largely by american occupiers has been a bugbear of the political right since its inception abe s liberal democratic party ldp has hoped to replace it for more than 60 years but no prime minister has come as close as abe to achieving this ldp proposals call for rewriting nearly all of the 103 articles weakening the protection of individual rights strengthening the pre eminent importance of public order qualifying basic freedoms and underscoring the centrality of the emperor to the nation revising article 9 of the constitution with its ban on maintaining an army is central to this endeavour despite japan s self defence forces constituting the eighth largest military in the world the difference between a de facto and a de jure army leaves its former colonies china and the koreas on edge the americans by contrast fully support change they have worked for years to ensure that the japanese forces are interoperable with us counterparts for washington a well armed japan is both cheaper and more expedient especially as beijing expands its reach into the pacific abe s strongman approach might be seen as part of a broader global trend but unlike the waves of supporters who voted for jair bolsonaro trump narendra modi and rodrigo duterte voter turnout in japan has plummeted if there are any lessons for britain s labour party they are not from the democratic party of japan the main counterbalance to the conservative ldp over the past two decades in the last election in 2017 the party split with half joining an ldp breakaway centre right group each faction collected just over 10 per cent of available seats against the ldp s 60 per cent the poverty of viable options at election time has meant that nearly half the population no longer bothers to cast a vote into this space of political inaction has stepped the nippon kaigi the japan conference the stated aim of this right wing organisation formed in 1997 is to build a nation with pride its goals are not just nationalist but neo imperial inspired by a selective memory of japanese greatness at the height of colonial expansion the group seeks a new constitution recalling that of the meiji era when the japanese were duty bearing subjects rather than rights bearing citizens it hopes to return the emperor to the centre of political power in a throwback to the rhetoric and images used to rally the populace during the second world war traditional family values women in the kitchen off the throne and under their husband s family name form another area they want to strengthen the conference claims nearly 40 000 members but more important is who they are its reach into political offices and shinto religious organisations is long around 60 per cent of parliamentarians are members of the nippon kaigi which uses its networks to rally voters to the polls so far the group s biggest success has been in schools it has led the suppression of what it calls masochistic views of history as well as excessive focus on human rights twenty years ago all mainstream history books at secondary schools carried information about the comfort women the korean and chinese victims of colonisation who were trafficked into sex work for the japanese army now none do calls for greater pride and sovereignty in japan are as in the uk an inconsistent mash up of imperial imaginings if not hallucinations it s little wonder then that the name for the new imperial era selected by the abe government reiwa has unsettling overtones the term taken from classical poetry means auspicious harmony in the official translation it s rendered beautiful harmony a choice that recalls abe s own repeated appeals to create a beautiful japan by itself the character for rei also means command or order in everyday speech the semantic overlap may be innocuous few english speakers pause to reflect that the greek root of pharmacy pharmakon contains both remedy and poison among its meanings but how the name will be understood depends a lot on how naruhito defines his role a job not as easy as one might think the separation of the japanese monarch from any political issues is so complete that when emperor akihito floated the possibility of stepping down commentators debated whether he had exceeded his station none the less the retiring royal carved out a role for himself by supporting social welfare causes in contrast to his distant father hirohito he went out to the streets to offer solace and consolation to the underprivileged disaster victims and others in need his actions were so unexpected that even the most mundane gestures squatting to talk to an old woman sitting on the floor of an evacuation centre grabbed headlines outside the country and to the chagrin of ultranationalists akihito made a point of recognising japanese wartime aggression with a remorse that was more authentic than abe s pro forma apologies it remains to be seen what a path his son will take amid a landscape of continuing economic stagnation and escalating nationalism kristin surak is senior lecturer in japanese politics at the school of oriental and

for participants in the currency market trade wars offer plenty of moneymaking opportunities the decision of the trump administration to raise the stakes in the china us trade war is one such opportunity given reignited china us trade tensions the foreign exchange market may logically expect renewed and sustained yuan weakness and that beijing might well be inclined to tolerate some decline in the renminbi s value to partially counter the effect of washington s tariff hikes on chinese exporters with tariffs rising to 25 per cent for now but ongoing discussions likely to continue hsbc expects that heightened volatility should occur hsbc has revised its second and third quarter expectations for the us dollar to yuan exchange rate to 6 95 in both cases as opposed to prior forecasts of 6 70 and 6 75 respectively however the firm sees china us trade tensions moderating and has kept its year end forecast at 6 75 by the same logic if markets sense that the us imposed tariff hikes might be reversed the yuan might react positively but currency traders should not just be focusing on the daily moves in the spot price when seeking to gauge whether the market as a whole has a real conviction that sustained yuan weakening is a real possibility the yuan may not necessarily trade against the us dollar in a band that has parameters pre agreed on by beijing and washington which both sides would defend but it is probably fair to say that for the dollar yuan exchange rate the 7 00 level has become totemic simon derrick chief currency strategist at bny mellon noted last week that in recent years for the dollar yuan currency pair the non deliverable forward market had been getting trend shifts in the spot market roughly right non deliverable forward contracts or ndfs differ from standard forward contracts in that instead of buying or selling the currency at the agreed price at the specified date both sides settle the trade s loss or profit instead at the tail end of 2018 when there was a lot of talk of the yuan weakening beyond 7 00 to the us dollar there was a noticeable degree of equanimity in the ndf market derrick wrote that suggested traders felt china s central bank would ensure that any weakening of the renminbi beyond that level would likely prove muted through 2019 the difference or spread between the spot dollar yuan rate and one month three month and six month ndf outrights has been pretty well zero derrick added but since the start of may these spreads have begun to widen out rapidly albeit to still modest levels when compared to most points in the past three years this suggests that the currency market envisages that renewed yuan weakness will be sustained rather than fleeting but the dollar yuan rate will not be the currency market s only focus other currencies will also get caught in the slipstream of heightened china us trade tensions the yuan s slide against the japanese yen in recent days is just one example tokyo will not be overly impressed by a show of yen strength eroding the export competitiveness of japanese manufacturers at a time when japan has its own economic challenges and with japan us trade relations a little sticky but in truth there is not much that japanese policymakers can do about it the bottom line is quite simple at times of international tension the foreign exchange market tends to seek out what it perceives as safe havens such as the yen equally in the currency space the yuan will not be the only fall guy following the reigniting of china us trade tensions having experienced an economic contraction in the first quarter of 2019 the exposure of south korea s economy to china leaves the korean won vulnerable purported sales of us dollars by the bank of korea on friday to stem a slide in the value of the won versus the greenback not seen since january 2017 is not likely to deter markets if china us trade tensions continue to ratchet up a material setback has occurred in china us negotiations aimed at resolving the current trade war the currency market will respond accordingly source south china morning post
guest post by simon black earlier this month the world gold council published its quarterly report and it shows that central banks and foreign governments from around the world are buying up gold at their fastest pace in six years this is pretty big news and it says a lot about the future of the dollar remember central banks and foreign governments hold literally trillions of dollars of reserves and traditionally they do this by buying us government debt it sounds strange but to big institutions banks etc us government debt is equivalent to cash they use it as a form of money more importantly they hold us dollars because that s the global standard the us dollar has been the world s primary international reserve currency for seventy five years so us debt is extremely liquid in fact the 22 trillion us debt market is the biggest and most liquid market in the world but foreign governments have started breaking with the tradition of buying treasuries as the world gold council s report showed us foreign governments and central banks have been buying a lot more gold than in previous years net gold purchases in q1 2019 among foreign governments and central banks was nearly 70 greater than q1 2018 and the highest rate of first quarter purchases in six years the chinese in particular have been stockpiling gold faster than ever while at the same time chinese ownership of us treasuries as a percentage of total holdings has been gradually declining over the past years and it s not just china russia turkey qatar and even colombia a long time ally of the us have been diversifying and buying a lot more gold there are a few obvious reasons behind that the debt of the us federal government recently reached 22 trillion and it isn t getting any better they add at least 1 trillion to the debt each year and the congressional budget office forecasts that the uncle sam will never again see an annual budget deficit of less than 1 trillion starting in 2021 that has serious impact on the ability of the us government to repay its obligations to foreign creditors and if the bolsheviks come to power next year and offer free goodies paid for with more debt to anyone with a pulse the debt burden will explode anyone who thinks owning 10 year us treasuries or even worse 30 year government bonds is risk free is completely insane the dollar s problems aren t limited to the us government s pitiful finances either even the federal reserve the central bank of the united states is close to insolvency according to its own financial statements and the fed s coffers are routinely plundered by congress in order to fund pet projects in washington it s so ridiculous that in late 2015 congress passed a law to steal 53 3 billion from the federal reserve putting the central bank on the brink of insolvency then of course there s the looming prospect of escalating us trade wars and it s easy to see why so many foreign governments and central banks are diversifying out of the dollar and into gold history shows that reserve currencies come and go there was a time when the british pound was the dominant currency in the world and before that dutch guilders spanish pieces of eight reserve currencies go all the way back before the gold solidus coin of the byzantine empire today the us dollar is the dominant currency in the world this is unlikely to change in the near future but it would be equally foolish to assume that the dollar s dominance will last forever gold on the other hand has been a constant of wealth preservation for nearly all of human history it was first used as money more than 3 000 years ago and an ounce of gold continues to buy roughly the same amount of goods over time there are a number of reasons for that gold is scarce portable and it can stand the test of time without corroding today i own gold as an insurance policy it s a form of wealth with no counter party risk and one that has global demand virtually anywhere you can possibly go in the world gold has value and it s definitely worth your consideration one interesting benefit we re living in a time where nearly every other asset is at an all time high stocks bonds real estate etc a single troy ounce of gold sells for nearly 50 below its record price from 2011 given what s happening with central banks foreign governments and us debt it s clear that demand is rising but simultaneously the supply of gold is under a lot of pressure we ve discussed before that large mines have been closing and large producers haven t invested in new discoveries so there could be

vancouver british columbia may 15 2019 investorideas com newswire silvercrest metals inc tsxv sil v nyse american silv silvercrest or the company is pleased to announce the results of an independent preliminary economic assessment pea completed by tetra tech canada inc tetra tech for the las chispas project in sonora mexico the pea is based on the mineral resource estimate titled technical report and mineral resource estimate for the las chispas property sonora mexico effective february 8 2019 and announced on march 14 2019 the february 2019 mineral resource estimate all dollar amounts in this news release are in us dollar unless otherwise indicated las chispas preliminary economic assessment highlights base case the following assumes a silver price of 16 68 ounce oz a gold price of 1 269 oz and a mexican peso us exchange rate of 20 1 1 250 tonnes per day tpd production rate with an initial mine life of 8 5 years average diluted grades for silver or ag at 411 0 grams per tonne gpt gold or au at 4 05 gpt and silver equivalent or ageq based on 75 ag 1 au defined in table below at 714 gpt average annual production of 5 384 000 oz ag and 55 700 oz au or 9 6 million oz ageq years 1 to 4 average annual production of 7 575 000 oz ag and 81 600 oz au 13 7 million oz ageq life of mine lom all in sustaining cash costs aisc of 7 52 oz ageq years 1 to 4 aisc of 4 89 oz ageq initial capital expenditure capex of 100 5 million lom sustaining capex of 50 3 million payback period of 9 months after tax irr of 78 after tax npv of 406 9 million and cumulative undiscounted net free cash flow of 522 5 million n eric fier cpg p eng and ceo commented with an estimated after tax npv 5 of more than 400 million an after tax irr of 78 and a payback period of less than one year the economics for las chispas are exceptional the pea has focused initial development and production on the high grade babicanora babicanora fw and babicanora norte veins producing an average of 13 7 million ounces of silver equivalent per year for the first four years at an aisc of less than 5 00 oz ageq this production and cost structure have the potential to generate in excess of 100 million in annual net free cash flow at today s silver 14 75 oz and gold 1 297 oz prices preliminary economic results suggest that las chispas could be a high margin project even at low metal prices importantly this assessment is a snapshot of the potential value of las chispas we have been exploring the las chispas district for only three years continued drilling success may add significant value to the project the resources used in the pea consists of 10 of 30 known veins drill tested near surface in the district we currently have 14 drill rigs running at las chispas of which 6 are focused on expanding the resource and testing new targets and 8 are completing infill drilling for re categorizing resources the new decline into area 51 is progressing well with an anticipated intercept of the high grade shoot 51 in q2 2019 with subsequent surface stockpiling of material grading an average of more than 1 000 gpt ageq we have also identified a number of optimization opportunities in the pea which we intend to evaluate as we proceed with a feasibility study or fs with anticipated completion in first half of 2020 the company cautions that the results of the pea are preliminary in nature and include inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have economic consideration applied to them to be classified as mineral reserves there is no certainty that the results of the pea will be realized mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability technical and financial details the pea base case uses a 5 discount rate metal prices of 16 68 oz ag and 1 269 oz au 3 year historical average and mexico peso us exchange rate of 20 1 highlights of the base case economic estimates used for the pea are as follows 1 ageq based on 75 ag 1 au calculated using long term silver and gold prices of 17 per ounce silver and 1 225 per ounce gold with average metallurgical recoveries of 90 silver and 95 gold 2 includes expensed lateral development but excludes capitalized ramp and vertical development 3 contained ounces for gold and silver are estimated to include 29 indicated resources and 71 inferred resources the pea presents a range of metal pricing scenarios on after tax basis to evaluate the economics of the project in both upside and downside commodity price scenarios as illustrated in the following table the project is very robust even at downside commodity price scenarios additional sensitivities to the price of oil mexican peso capex and opex will be presented in the pea technical report the project economics are most sensitive to precious metal prices diluted resource estimate and mining method the diluted resource estimate for the pea is based on both indicated and inferred resources as stated in the february 2019 resource estimate for the las chispas project certain mining factors have been applied to this resource estimate to generate diluted resources using a conceptual mine plan for the pea the february 2019 resource estimate is summarized below notes all numbers are rounded 1 conforms to ni 43 101 and the canadian institution of mining metallurgy and petroleum cim definition standards on mineral resources and mineral reserves inferred resources have been estimated from geological evidence and limited sampling and must be treated with a lower level of confidence than measured and indicated resources 2 ageq based on 75 ag 1 au calculated using long term silver and gold prices of 17 per ounce silver and 1 225 per ounce gold with average metallurgical recoveries of 90 silver and 95 gold 3 bulk density has been applied to all materials as 2 55 tonnes per cubic metres 4 vein resource is reported using a 150 gpt ageq cut off grade and minimum 0 5 m true width babicanora norte babicanora sur babicanora fw and babicanora hw veins have been modelled to a minimum undiluted thickness of 0 5 m babicanora main has been modelled to a minimum undiluted thickness of 1 5 m and surface stockpile historic dumps resource is reported using a 100 gpt ageq cut off 5 there are no known legal political environmental or other risks that could materially affect the potential development of the mineral resources in this pea the february 2019 resource estimate was used which assumed that all mining of this resource would be completed by the cut and fill method with split blasting resue applied in narrower stopes in order to maintain a throughput rate of 1 250 tpd the development plan requires a minimum of 11 underground working faces to initially feed the process plant ramping up to a peak of 15 working faces by year 5 the pea estimates a diluted resource of 3 861 000 tonnes grading 4 05 gpt gold and 411 gpt silver or 714 gpt ageq containing 502 200 oz au and 51 004 000 oz ag or 88 7 million oz ageq using an estimated average mining dilution of 33 the table below summarizes the vein by vein tonnage grade and dilution for this diluted resource notes all numbers are rounded 1 conforms to ni 43 101 and the cim definition standards on mineral resources and mineral reserves inferred resources have been estimated from geological evidence and limited sampling and must be treated with a lower level of confidence than measured and indicated resources 2 diluted resource is preliminary in nature and are based on the incorporation of inferred mineral

as resue mining with a minimum mining width of 1m 7 stated dilution includes barren waste rock backfill mucked with mineralized material as well as unplanned low grade material mined with resource material 8 diluted resource is based on an overall 5 loss 9 there are no known legal political environmental or other risks that could materially affect the potential development of the mineral resources 10 the luigi vein is not included in the diluted resource incorporated in the mine plan of the pea this vein needs further review to justify economic viability process plant and metallurgy detailed metallurgical test work was completed from september 2018 to march 2019 to assess potential silver and gold recoveries for the las chispas project as announced in a news release dated april 18 2019 titled positive metallurgical recoveries for las chispas a 445 kilogram bulk sample was collected from 51 core hole and nine underground samples and compiled into 15 different samples based on geo metallurgical domains which were combined into three master composites low medium and high grade the best recoveries were generated from a process flowsheet that included a gravity recovery circuit with intensive cyanidation of the gravity concentrate and the gravity tails processed through standard leaching the pea assumes this is followed by a standard counter current decantation milling process with gold and silver recovered through a merrill crowe circuit the test work showed recoveries of 91 95 for silver and 98 99 for gold additional test work was completed on intensive leaching of gravity concentrates which showed recoveries of 99 for both gold and silver for the pea the company has limited the intensive leaching recovery to 90 until further optimization work is completed therefore an average recovery of 89 9 for silver and 94 4 for gold is used in the pea except during the six month start up period where the company further reduced the recovery by 5 the process plant has been designed at a nameplate capacity of 1 358 tpd with the production schedule assuming 8 downtime over the course of a year at 92 operating time the plant can support throughput of 456 000 tonnes per year or 1 250 tpd initial and sustaining capital cost estimates the pea estimates initial capital requirements of 100 5 million and cumulative sustaining capital of 50 3 million see details in the table below all capital excluding 2019 sunk capital estimated to be 7 3 million incurred up to the end of 2021 is included in the initial capital any capital required from 2022 and beyond is included in sustaining capital 14 8 million in contingencies have been included in the initial capital which is approximately 17 2 sustaining capital is expected to average approximately 5 2 million per year with an increase in sustaining capital in year 5 10 3 million and year 6 13 7 million primarily associated with the increase in underground development associated with opening up and operating the giovanni las chispas and william tell veins over the remainder of the mine life the projected timing of increases in sustaining capital expenditures in years 5 and 6 related to underground development may be pushed further into the future with continued exploration success see section entitled las chispas opportunities to enhance value below operating cost estimates lom operating costs for the las chispas project are estimated to average 98 66 per tonne which includes a minimum of 5 contingency applied to inputs see las chispas pea technical and financial details table above during the start up period processing and general and administrative g a costs per tonne are higher until mill throughput ramps up to design capacity the pea is based on contractor underground mining which has an estimated lom cost of 50 91 per tonne milled processing costs are estimated at 32 61 per tonne milled which includes dry stack and backfill tailings management costs of 1 40 per tonne milled g a costs are estimated at 15 14 per tonne milled the processing and g a costs per tonne milled are based on an estimated plant operating time of 92 over the lom with potential to improve these unit costs with a higher operating time or plant expansion see section entitled las chispas opportunities to enhance value below all in sustaining cash costs per ounce of silver equivalent aisc are estimated to be 7 52 oz ageq produced based on lom production of 81 2 million recoverable ounces ageq the break down of aisc for the las chispas project are as follows note that the above calculation does not include corporate g a costs or exploration expenditures for the las chispas project these costs would be included once the project is closer production and included in aisc oz ageq note that producing operations typically report aisc before development capital excluding development capital the pea outlines an aisc of 6 28 per ounce las chispas pea economic analysis base case the economic summary including annual production costs and free cash flow for the las chispas project as estimated in the pea are as follows note all numbers are rounded 1 aisc and net free cash flow are non ifrs measures refer to the non ifrs measures section of this press release 2 total lom net free cash flow includes 1 million spent per year on reclamation from 2032 2035 the recovery of 10 million in working capital and a 4 0 million reclamation bond in 2031 3 royalties include mexico government mining royalty of 7 5 from the income on the sale of minerals extracted minus authorized deductions and an extraordinary governmental royalty of 0 5 of the income for the sale of gold silver and platinum by mining concession holders for environmental purposes there are no other royalties on resources other than those imposed by law in the above economic analysis we have applied 10 year straight line depreciation to the carrying value of development capital costs exclusive of fixed capital items fixed capital items are depreciated at 12 per year based on applicable mexican accounting practices tax loss carry forwards are used to offset taxes in the first full year of production after applicable deductions a corporate tax rate of 30 is applied to the taxable income generated from the mine to estimate the lom cash taxes payable las chispas opportunities to enhance value several potential opportunities have been identified that may significantly enhance the economic return outlined in the pea including but not limited to the following exploration potential the diluted resource estimated for the pea is based on the february 2019 mineral resource estimate which includes 10 of 30 known veins on the project the company currently has 14 drill rigs on site with six 6 of those rigs dedicated to expanding resources and drill testing new targets for potential discoveries with success on further drilling there are several ways that expanded resources could improve the economics of the project including throughput expansion the mine plan for the pea is based on a 1 250 tpd throughput scenario which results in an 8 5 year mine life expanded resources have the potential to justify increased mine and mill throughput as part of the upcoming fs silvercrest will evaluate the potential costs to expand the process plant capacity to 1 500 2 000 tpd with potential benefits to unit costs for processing and g a with respect to economies of scale reduced development cost per ounce babicanora sur luigi granaditas including la blanquita have relatively high development costs per ounce of diluted resource expanding the diluted resource for these veins would spread the relatively high development capital over more ounces improving economics and reducing the aisc per ounce high grade discovery the grade profile for the las chispas project is heavily weighted towards the first four years of production a new high grade discovery could help smooth the decline in production that begins in year five by prioritizing development of a new high grade discovery and delaying the development of the lower grade veins while potentially adding economies of scale at the same time pea excluded resources the diluted resource that is incorporated into the mine plan for the pea excludes approximately 20 million oz ageq that were estimated in the february 2019 resource estimate specifically discrete mineralized zones in the babicanora fw babicanora norte and sur veins and all of the luigi vein resources have been excluded from adjacent designed mine stopes and discrete isolated zones which currently do not have enough critical mass to justify the added cost of underground development for production silvercrest is optimistic that by applying optimized stope designs and follow up drilling to expand discrete zones some excluded resources may be included in a future mine plan mining method the pea is based on 100 cut and fill underground mining with split blasting resue applied in those areas where vein widths drop to less than 1 5 metres there are known opportunities for the babicanora vein in particular to be mined using lower cost long hole and sub level mining methods in the areas where the vein averages over 3 0 metres in true width this could reduce mining and development costs at the beginning of the mine life metallurgy the results from our metallurgical test work suggested intensive leaching recoveries of 99 for both gold and silver gravity concentrates in the pea the intensive leaching recoveries is set at 90 which results in an implied recovery of 89 9 for silver and 94 4 for gold test work completed to date suggests potential for improved silver recoveries of 91 95 for silver and 98 99 for gold silvercrest intends to follow up these promising results with further test work to be completed and incorporated into the fs power line the pea assumes the use of onsite generated power using diesel fuel at 0 28 kwh and exposes the operation to fluctuations in the price of fuel the fs will be contemplating the connection of the site to the national grid via power available at an estimated cost of 0 09 kwh stockpiled material at start of production the mine schedule for the pea assumes that during the six month start up period of operations 100 of the mill throughput will be sourced from the current surface stockpiles with an estimated 175 000 tonnes grading 224 gpt ageq once silver and gold recoveries are optimized then processing of higher grade material would begin based on the ongoing construction of a new decline silvercrest plans on underground development in high grade mineralization starting in h2 2019 along with test mining and stockpiling material from area 51 this stockpiled material could be up to 20 000 tonnes for 2019 with additional tonnes before conceptual start up based on the possible early high performance of the mill high grade material could be processed in the first six months of operations with improved payback and npv feasibility study with the pea completed silvercrest is moving forward with a feasibility study for las chispas the company is targeting completion of the fs in h1 2020 and making a production decision following the release of a positive study of the 14 drill rigs currently working on site eight 8 of these rigs are focused on infill drilling in an effort to upgrade inferred resources into the indicated category for inclusion in the fs reserves on a related note the exploration decline into area 51 has been progressing smoothly ground conditions have been excellent which has allowed the company to advance the decline rapidly in less than three months the exploration decline has been advanced to over 420 metres with a target to intercept the high grade shoot 51 of the babicanora vein in q2 2019 once shoot 51 is intercepted 400 to 800 metres of mineralized development will be completed in h2 2019 this rapid access to high grade mineralization will allow us to conduct detailed feasibility work including further metallurgy assess geotechnical conditions reconcile underground grades with the resource model complete test mining to define the optimum mining method and determine more accurate development costs the recommended budget for the feasibility study field support for the study ongoing exploration work and exploration decline and development construction over the next 12 months is estimated at 17 5 million tetra tech s work to complete the pea demonstrates that the las chispas project has robust economic potential and recommends that silvercrest continue developing the project with emphasis on the exploration work required to improve confidence in inferred resources tetra tech recommends that the feasibility study evaluate alternate mining methods which could have lower costs than the cut and fill method considered in the pea qualified persons the independent qualified persons as defined

aklog birara dr may 15 2019 part i of iii if something is not done this constitution will not hold the country together dr negasso gidada the late president of ethiopia to whom i dedicate this commentary i decided to dedicate this commentary and the set of recommendations in the summary to dr negasso this is because he is among the few ethiopian political and thought leaders who leaves an enduring legacy for this and coming generations among other things he imparted critical values that often is missed in current ethiopian political discourse most notable of these is his honesty integrity and courage and his willingness and courage to admit that he made a mistake in championing the current constitution he recognized the dangers of ethnic federalism and changed his views i had the opportunity to discuss the pitfalls with dr negasso during his visit to the usa in fact i had offered him a huge study on demographic and geographic changes that are shaping the globe making narrow ethnic enclaves irrelevant to rapid modernization development can t take place without social mobility dr negasso said የእኔ አቋም በኢትዮጵያ አንድነትና ማዕቀፍ ውስጥ የኦሮሞም ሆነ የሌሎች ሕዝቦች መብቶች ይከበር የመገንጠል ጥያቄ ይቅር ነው his position that heartened me is this the human and democratic rights of the oromo and other people must and can be respected while embracing ethiopian unity secession must stop this leads me to my lead hypothesis prime minster dr abiy ahmed s inspirational and aspirational goals notwithstanding ethiopia faces policy log jams in almost every sector implementation capacity is stretched to the limit so are federal budgetary resources the government is in a fire fighting and reactive proactive mode the federal government and the regional states are at logger heads in resolving ethnic conflicts the prime minister emboldens some ethno nationalists by either being opaque or by not telling them like it is rightly or wrongly many ethiopians argue that the prime minister is incapable of pulling the society together and must therefore resign i disagree no single person no matter how inspiring and dedicated can and should be expected to cleanse ethiopia of the ethnic elite poison germ hate vitriolic and institutional corruption that has been inflicted on the entire society i do not believe that there is any single ethiopian on the horizon to replace abiy at this time the moses like idolization should however be tempered and subjected to a set of criteria that make sense if ethiopians wish to see a unified and prosperous country they must set aside ethnic and other differences and focus on the singular issues of tackling poverty and backwardness by harnessing their natural and human resources together foreign and other independent experts are right in asking why we ethiopians are incapable of accepting our differences as assets and why we are not forging ahead with the society s sustainable and equitable development agenda i think of a child in gedeo and guji in gambella and beni shangul gumuz in tigray and oromia in afar and the ogaden etc and always wonder why the country s political and intellectual elites cannot even sit together around a conference table and come up with a road map that will serve the entire society like the rest of the globe ethiopia possesses ample naturel resources rain waters rivers arable lands minerals human capital with a bulging youth group that is being wasted cultural assets and sits in a strategic location yet decades after the great famine that brought down the imperial regime it is home to 3 million internally displaced peoples idps and 8 3 million souls who depend on humanitarian aid ethiopia is unable to conduct a credible census against this the governing party and members of ethiopia s opposition plan to hold an election in about a year i should like to draw your attention to a child who begs for alms to underscore the priority of fighting poverty and backwardness rather killing one another in perpetuity fight poverty and not one another think of the starving child as your own the challenge for the prime minister his government and each one of us who care deeply about ethiopia s future is to diagnose problems and to offer doable and meaningful alternatives on his part the prime minster needs to reach out to and seek a menu of alternatives from a cross section of ethiopians in terms of policy he cannot afford to be inward looking the signals and narratives federal and regional authorities offer the ethiopian public are inconsistent and contradictory prime minister dr abiy ahmed arguably one of the most inspiring and forward looking leaders in the world believes genuinely in ethiopia s unity territorial integrity sovereignty and the prosperity of all ethiopians he has demonstrated resolve in numerous areas including respect for fundamental civil liberties press and political freedom and the formation of pluralist democracy he has positioned ethiopia s regional and global position strategically by reaching out to eritrea the rest of the horn and global investors however ethiopia is awash with internal ethnic conflicts theft graft corruption illicit outflow of scarce capital unemployment hyperinflation massive internal displacements of ordinary citizens estimated at 3 million and a humanitarian emergency crisis that requires safety net for 8 3 million ethiopians ironically ethiopia hosts one of the largest refugee populations in the world the government of ethiopia is keen in advancing modernization among other things it has opened up the country s womb to foreign direct investment fdi without a clear and transparent regulatory regime that enhances the country s interests sovereignty and resiliency protects workers boosts domestic private and state owned enterprises such as banks telecommunications and preserves intact profitable state enterprises such as ethiopian airlines i have shared my suggestions with the prime minister during his visit to the usa concerning the need for caution in privatization under the title of why the rush now i stand by my recommendation that unguided fdi is counterproductive for ethiopia the private sector is critical for ethiopia i shall come back to this topic in greater detail at a future date ethiopia cannot build a strong and prosperous middle class with paltry wages as a country it should dictate policy and not succumb to the temptation of gaining foreign exchange and generating employment for millions of youth youth must be paid good wages to prosper a recent study by the new york university stern center for business and human rights disclosed in early may 2019 an alarming situation ethiopian factory workers are now on average the lowest paid in any major garment producing company worldwide understandably ethiopia must be aggressive in ensuring that its industrial parks built with domestic capital are productive and sustainable the government s eagerness to attract foreign investment led it to promote the lowest base wage in any garment producing country now set at the equivalent of 26 a month it behooves us to compare these paltry monthly wages that are equivalent to about 780 birr using a lower black market exchange rate per dollar of 30 birr to what workers are paid in kenya next door and china the most important and powerful investor in ethiopia the center reported that kenyan garment workers are paid 207 per month and chinese garment workers are paid 340 per month more than ten times what ethiopian garment workers are paid in my professional opinion development is about improving the human condition the most critical variable in accelerating modernization is enhancing and empowering human development to put it differently human development is the single most important variable in advancing sustainable and equitable development in turn this requires public policy that is national competitive productive equitable and non discriminatory ethnic federalism is a barrier to this fundamental principle and must be addressed the only ethnic party that has called on ethiopia s ethnic elites civil society the federal government and others to review the current constitution that i believe is a barrier to equity and sustainability is the amhara democratic party adp i commend this initiative and urge the prime minister constituent parties and the opposition to make this call a national priority the call is essential because it is virtually impossible to make ethiopia the next global hub for textile and other manufacturing and industrialization unless there is universal peace and stability throughout the country and unless social capital is treasured pull and push the current debate concerning the future fate of ethiopia and its 110 million peace loving people is between those who believe that ethnic federalism and the constitution must prevail and those who contend that the constitution and revolutionary democracy rd are conflict prone must change lines are drawn between these two forces and no one really knows where the country would end up in the coming two to three years recently the founders of the olf and three ex generals of the tplf argued vehemently that dismantling ethnic federalism the developmental state and rd would result in the balkanization of ethiopia they believe that the next election ought to be the preservation of the status quo this pull and push between the federal center and the regional or kilil periphery is not only holding ethiopia from modernization and scaled up employment generation it is also sending contradictory and confusing signals to the population it emboldens sectarianism and ethno nationalism one unintended consequence of this pull and push is that ethnic federalism cherry picks winners and losers on the basis of ethnic affiliation and undermines talent creativity innovation and productivity in turn this dwarfs growth and productivity east asia and the pacific is an excellent example in the use of talent beyond ethnicity in a conflicted environment the government of ethiopia is reactive rather than proactive with regard to public policy not surprisingly ethiopians are confused what and who to believe there is no national road map in the political or economic development regimes sadly ethiopia s media continues to cater to ethnic parties and to the governing party there is limited impartial and independent reporting that bridges and advances common values and common policies think tanks and civil society organizations are still weak alternative policies that would serve ethiopia as a country and ethiopians as citizens are literally absent when they are offered it is not uncommon to screen them out the global community including experts and ngos are still wedded to their own narrow private and national interests they see the ethiopian dilemma as a nuisance that ethiopians themselves must tackle i agree with them ethiopia has the requisite human capital to resolve its national problems the hurdle is the lack of a shared and common understanding of what is best for ethiopia and the ethiopian people as a whole i challenge ethiopia s disparate fragmented and competing ethnic and national parties to convene an all inclusive conference for national consensus peace reconciliation and post ethnic politics based solely on citizenship ethiopians and the global community especially ethiopia s western friends ought to measure and evaluate prime minister dr abiy ahmed s government on the basis of clear and concrete criteria and outcomes the most critical criteria is accountability for misdeeds at every level and regardless of power and tribe by misdeeds i mean undermining the territorial integrity and sovereignty of ethiopia past and present targeted and deliberate ethnic cleansing past and present direct or indirect killings of innocent persons economic and financial sabotage the deliberate propagation of ethnic or religious hate and destruction as well as unfettered ultra ethnic nationalism that stimulates utter chaos and destruction we cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them albert einstein ethiopia shows all of the ingredients of un governability and mob rule african proverbs offer us a rich menu of wisdom if we decide to use them to improve ethiopia s conditions he who does not seize opportunity today will be unable to seize tomorrow s opportunity we are in fact squandering opportunities today whether or not they accept it ethiopia s ethnic elites and the intellectuals who champion them are not only squandering the windows of opportunity brought as a consequence of years of sacrifice 2005 2014 2018 in particular they are also pushing ethiopia to break up by championing a broken ethnic and linguistic constitutional system and an administrative structure that strengthens ethnic conflicts deaths and destruction separatism and secession ethiopia wastes resources it does not even have to preserve peace and stability proponents of ethnic federalism want to preserve a system that is literally broken and dysfunctional the struggle between two fundamentally contradictory and irreconcilable principles is being fought in ethiopia s villages towns as well as in social media on the one hand prime minister dr abiy ahmed spoke and still speaks inspirationally of a strong unified and prosperous ethiopia on the other hand the ethnic and linguistic federal system that is buffeted by an ethnic constitution his party created remains uncontested ethnic elites who created the current system have benefitted handsomely from the system they want to preserve at a huge cost including ethiopia s dismemberment in their vehement advocacy of ethnic federalism rd and the developmental state that gave them power and wealth they are also making it impossible for the prime minister to keep the country together the best example of this un governability is the garrison mentality in mekele where some of the worst party state and government criminals and thieves are stationed those who refuse to obey the center the federal government believe that the constitution itself guarantees them the legal right to rebel and to disobey the rule of law for all practical purposes the tigray region is now de facto an independent government dr debretsion g michael the leader of the region defies central authority consistently and arrogantly on the one hand he blames the federal government for refusing to avail budgetary largesse to the region that he has sealed off from the rest of ethiopia on the other he holds federal authorities callable and accountable for the abysmal deterioration of human rights that contributes directly to ethiopia s balkanization certainly as an ultra ethnic nationalist party that still refuses to acknowledge ethiopia and ethiopian citizenship the tplf does not possess the moral authority to demand accountability from abiy s government the tplf regime committed atrocities in his press conference that he holds freely and uses as a vehicle to prolong the agony of the ethiopian people including tigreans dr debretsion claims that national peace reconciliation the stability and sovereignty of ethiopia are being eroded he contends directly that the abiy government is not able or competent to manage ethiopia s national and security affairs to protect the safety and security of ethiopians and to accelerate development he has learned absolutely nil from statesmen such as ambassador suleiman dedifo an ethiopian who offered a compelling narrative for unity and diagnosed thievery theft graft undeserved commissions corruption and massive illicit outflow of foreign exchange from ethiopia tragically for the ethiopian people including tigreans who believe in the sovereignty of the country and for which tigrean heroes also died dr debretsion is accountable for making his region a bastion of criminals and thieves most prominent of these are getachew assefa former intelligence chief and abay tsehay one of tplf main architects of ethnic plunder who served among other things as director of a sugar conglomerate that lost or bilked away more than 12 billion ethiopian birr sebhat nega who at one time had boasted that the ethiopian orthodox church and the amhara were destroyed it is this system that they want to defend these persons are among the most ardent champions of ethno nationalism in ethiopia they are also defenders of the current constitution and kilil system neither the tplf nor its adherents and supporters seem to care about the arduous work of preparing tigrean and other youth for the solutions of tomorrow instead they seem to be wedded to the anachronistic notion of fermenting ethnic conflicts everywhere to do this they use the tens of billions of birr they stole from the public purse especially from the mid 1990s to 2017 2018 to ferment chaos the argument that the tplf and olf make that they are defending the sovereign rights of nations nationalities and peoples is absurd and indefensible the rights of all citizens irrespective of tribe and where they reside are irreconcilable with ethno nationalism an oromo or amhara or gurage or somali or wolayta national cannot compete in tigray a tigrean cannot compete in politics in the oromo region etc ethiopia is a polarized country i want the world community and ethiopians alike to appreciate the fact that those who were murdered using bows and arrows in beni shangul gumuz killed with machine guns and other modern weapons in northern shoa slaughtered like animals with machete like weapons ገጀራ in burayu and most recently hacked to death in jimma kaffa are innocent children mothers the elderly and peace loving farmers if you murder productive people you deepen poverty it is not implementation that it at issue it is the system itself the fate of the amhara the amhara population is a singular target for assaults everywhere following the capture of the state and government by the tplf eplf olf and other ethnic groups in 1991 meles zenawi was asked why the amhara population was not represented in london and in the transitional government his response was that the amhara did not organize themselves on the basis of ethnicity the amhara are ardent supporters of a unified ethiopia as well as defender of citizenship rights ኢትዮጵያዊነት because of this they were exposed to all forms of human rights abuses including ethnic cleansing i find it galling inhumane and shameful that the target population for ethnic cleansing in all parts of the country is the amhara nationality experts estimate that more than 46 percent of the amhara live and work outside the amhara region the spread of the amhara population serves as a bulwark for integration and economic vitality it also strengthens ethiopia s territorial integrity independence and sovereignty the amhara population has a proven track record for defending the rights of others the amhara region hosts all ethnic groups the amhara has a proven track record for resisting foreign aggression and occupation it should not be punished for these attributes the amhara resolve at last to organize and defend its own very survival is therefore legitimate and right in fact i hypothesize further that ethiopia s future survival and vitality will depend on the wellbeing of the amhara and on the peaceful coexistence of the amhara with the oromo afar tigray somali wolayta gurage and other ethnic groups it is their unity that preserved ethiopia defending and institutionalizing the rights of all citizens is critical for ethiopia s survival and for the modernization of all ethiopians so why destroy such a valuable human capital national asset for whose benefit it is worth repeating that the tplf and its ally the olf as well as other ethnic elites targeted the amhara population from inception the economic rationale behind ethnic cleansing of the amhara is land ethiopia has ample land ethiopians are wasting it through conflicts and carelessness years before the tplf and its ethnic allies concocted the current ethnic constitution that granted sovereignty to nations nationalities and peoples thereby abrogating citizenship rights the tplf ethnically cleansed the amhara in numerous parts of gondar it depopulated the amhara from their lands and replaced indigenous people with tigreans subsequently it engineered internal divisions within the region along sub ethnic clusters from the period 1991 to the present the amhara have been subjected to the most cruel and unusual punishment of any nationality group in ethiopia in arba gugu amhara children girls boys women and men were literally thrown over the cliff decades later in or near jimma one farmer mr getinet was hacked to death and buried in conditions that defy human conscience this chilling inhumanity in today s ethiopia is not any different from the slaying of ethiopian youth in libya an untold number of farming families are now housed in a church the only sanctuary where they feel safe the common expression of fake news in western democracies was deployed successfully and effectively by the tplf and its cohorts to characterize and demean the amhara population fake news and all forms of falsehoods are now deployed by the same group to assert the false and unfounded hysteria that the amhara wishes to take over political and economic power there isn t an iota of evidence to suggest that the amhara alone and exclusively ruled ethiopia in fact the amhara genius is the ability and commitment to intermarry and live with other ethiopians are there any other ethnic groups outside the oromo and amhara that are predominantly mixed and intermingled to the point where one cannot distinguish an oromo face from an amhara face how in the world would an amhara farmer who was hacked to death near jimma aspire power how does one justify killing an amhara child with bows and arrows in beni shangul gumuz this is savagery that defies humanity ethiopia s ethnic tragedy does not start and end with the amhara population it is now widespread and involves innocent people in the afar beni shangul gumuz gambella ogaden snnp and oromia regions once triggered ethnic hatred division and conflicts do not have borders at all everyone pays a price at one time i can provide numerous facts to dispel the notion that the amhara are out to assume political power i therefore find it hypocritical that the tplf that engineered the ethnicization of ethiopian politics would now critique abiy and his team for the disaster to which ethiopia and its diverse population are subjected and in which the amhara are singularly targeted for ethnic cleansing the killing and plunderers party state and government that the tplf and olf crafted to rule ethiopia is now shattering at its core what worries me is not the unraveling of the institutions created by the tplf and its allies and the eprdf super and supra infrastructure that still dominates rather it is prime minister dr abiy s reluctance to deal with the pitfalls of ethnic federalism and revolutionary democracy what worries me further is that despite compelling and chilling documentary evidence of atrocities on innocent ethiopians the culprits are allowed to exercise freedom and to carry out all sorts of crimes against ethiopia and ethiopians in some cases the abiy government hosts leaders of political parties in five star hotels among these are persons who are suspect of atrocities it is natural that they defend the status quo they are the lead beneficiaries what is the role of the federal government the primary role of the federal government is to protect civilians from any form of atrocity the sanctity of human life must be supreme abiy s government must be held accountable and responsible for the personal safety and security of persons families and entire communities for the durability of the country for accelerating national consensus peace reconciliation and stability for ethiopia s economic resiliency based on the performance of the economy and for employment generation for ethiopia s youthful population regional fiefdoms cannot cure ethiopia s ills on the contrary ethiopia will breakup and ethnic cleansing will deepen unless regional authorities are assembled by the federal government and are compelled in writing to vow publicly that they will subordinate their narrow interests to the national interest and to the welfare and wellbeing of all ethiopians as citizens it may not be totally clear of conflict but nigeria s federal constitution compels regional governments and governors to swear loyalty to the federal state of nigeria i pose a critical question that each and every ethiopian and the global community must ponder what are ethiopia s options based on current socioeconomic and political conditions in my estimation abiy s ethiopia has three choices a to continue with its downward spiral to the abyss of balkanization civil war and potential genocide with far reaching consequences for the country the entire horn of africa and eastern africa north africa and the middle east b to revert back to the reemergence of a dictatorial regime akin to or worse than that of the tplf led rulers of the 1991 2018 period or c to initiate deep and fundamental policy structural and institutional changes that would pave the way for the ethiopian people as a whole to realize genuine pluralist democracy the rule of law honest and measurable equality among the country s ethnic and religious groups and to establish a national model for sustainable and equitable development for all i have argued above that the first two options have been tried and failed miserably in fact the root causes of the current problem are traceable to the periods of brutal regimes following the removal of the imperial government that had offered ethiopians a semblance of peace and certainly national honor and dignity at the global level an ethiopian passport was highly respected then ethiopians were able to live and work in any part of the country then black people all over the world looked up to ethiopia and ethiopians with admiration and respect then it was uncommon for any ethiopian to complete higher education and to seek asylum then etc etc etc the socialist military dictatorship ruled with brutality and cruelty it disallowed dissent and competition and and it created a fertile ground for ethiopia s internal and external enemies to plot connive and undermine the fabric of ethiopian society socialism was a carbon copy of an alien ideology that was propagated without taking into account ethiopia s vast untapped and unique indigenous assets including administrative and legal instruments that work the tigray liberation front tplf the oromo liberation front olf and other ethnic fronts exceeded even the socialist regime in terms of breaking down unifying national assets ethiopia as a country and the numerous bonds that pulled ethiopia s diverse population together were either relegated to secondary status and or were intentionally and systemically engineered to fall apart into pieces how did they do it constitutionally if you break up socioeconomic religious and political bonds isn t time to revisit the constitution the tplf eplf olf and their foreign advisors and backers concocted the current blemished inconsistent and opportunistic constitution with the intent of enabling ethnic elites to rule the country for their own narrow personal family and tribal interests the culprit or the camouflage deployed as a central galvanizing ideology is the tplf s insidious attribution of national oppression of the rest of ethiopians by the amhara nationality this became the basis for massive and continuous ethnic cleansing of the amhara you can t cure the problem unless you deal with the constitution itself continuing the status quo will result in more bloodshed the data gathered of these killings forcible evictions abductions and expropriation of lands incorporating them into greater tigray began long before the tplf took power in 1991 equally chilling is the fact that the tplf was able to recruit and establish an amhara political movement that was subservient to it proxy wars that are now normalized started to take shape before the tplf dominated ethiopian peoples revolutionary democratic front eprdf began to rule ethiopia with an iron fist more than a quarter of a century ago as a consequence of the narrative that placed the amhara at par with colonial and imperial powers the amhara became targets of assault throughout the country to my knowledge no party or regional or federal official has been held accountable for the crimes against humanity inflicted on the amhara population innocent children women and men were literally thrown over the cliff to die tens of thousands were expelled from their homes lands and property in gura ferda various parts of oromia gambella beni shangul gumuz and various towns around addis ababa and even in the amhara region especially gondar every single forcible eviction and displacement killing maiming disappearance jailing without due process of law rape and confiscation of property from ordinary ethiopian citizens most noticeably from the amhara shows that the rule of law never existed under the tplf regime and it does not exist now under the odp regime either what it the rule of law anyway every activist intellectual human rights advocate politician and political party of any kind speaks about the rule of law constitutional lawyers have a shared definition that i shall use in this commentary first and foremost the rule of law applies equally to all persons or citizens regardless of ethnicity gender age class religion or other distinction it is a core principle if you don t apply it in one case it is discriminatory for example under apartheid south africa or jim craw america the rule of law did not apply to whites blacks and browns alike it was biased in favor of whites it still is second the rule of law is consistent regardless of the issue or the person unless they are guided by ethnicity or ideology or class public authorities do not determine that one case is potentially explosive and thus needs to be delayed for an opportune time and another is a priority now this is why experts argue that justice delayed is justice denied for example top level thieves tormentors and killers or corrupt party regional or federal officials and thieves of state in ethiopia who had committed crimes over decades continue to enjoy both freedom and livelihoods from stolen wealth yet petty criminals and thieves do not enjoy the same rights and privileges ironically criminals and thieves who possess ill gotten wealth have established a network of impenetrable connections and continue to enjoy unprecedented immunity in the process they create havoc and destruction all over ethiopia they blame the havoc on the new government and the central government does not seem to comprehend the problem it spends more time creating commissions rather than dealing with the core issues first among the missing links is the notion that ethiopia s external enemies are gaining ground while ethiopians fight one another for lands and for political power i still accept prime minister dr abiy as a potential change agent however i failed to understand what his road map is for ethiopia a road map is virtually untenable unless abiy s government recognizes that ethnic federalism and revolutionary democracy are undermining the country s sovereignty and uprooting the multiple bonds that hold the ethiopian people together third the rule of law is predictable and reliable predictability and reliability are essentially of clear laws that are implemented consistently by an impartial competent merit based independent incorruptible and national judiciary system judges and other key personnel are selected and appointed to administer the rule of law without reverting to ethnic religious class or party affiliation if you staff the court and judiciary system on the basis of ethnicity it is predictable that the outcome will be biased and discriminatory for this reason ordinary people won t trust the judiciary at all they perceive it as an arm of the governing party fourth the rule of law must enjoy neutrality over the past 27 years of tplf hegemony the law was deployed consistently and systematically to punish perceived enemies of the governing party the state the government and the constitution itself the anti terrorism proclamation is the best example of the lack of impartiality and neutrality you write a constitution with all the trappings of respect for civil and human rights on the one hand and use fabricated evidence to punish those who fight for justice equality and the rule of law or you condone misbehaviors and misdeeds arguing that proponents want a redress for past mistakes those who hold ethiopia s progress forward by deploying different methodologies to capture state power are not helping abiy in building bridges as the african wise proverb goes in the moment of crisis the wise build bridges and the foolish build dams i am not saying that dams are no good they are i am saying that the time to build dams and all other economic infrastructure will come when we embrace and accept one another as human beings and as ethiopians the priority now is to build bridges among all ethiopians it is the people of ethiopia as a whole who fought and lost their lives and ushered in a new regime ethno nationalism does the exact opposite it builds barriers to inclusion it is therefore time that the federal government shows muscle and teeth and guarantee the safety and security of ethiopians without distinction to ethnicity or religion or class no armed group no special force of any kind should be allowed anywhere in the country to roam maim kill and forcibly evict innocent citizens commissions alone do not work setting up all forms of commissions and staffing them with the same cadres of people who are part of the problem is not wise and won t produce positive outcomes ethiopia must strengthen at any cost its national institutions first no accountability no rule of law fifth the rule of law holds everyone accountable for harmful conduct and action if you apply ethnic religious or class preferences in adjudicating the rule of law all is lost thieves murderers and other criminals alike feel that they are entitled to impunity that the rule of law does not apply to them at all impunity is the enemy of national unity and justice for all whether affiliated to a municipal local regional or federal government or the private sector every citizen must be held accountable disparate or unequal or uneven treatment of individuals based on ethnicity wealth or political power is anathema to the rule of law most critical of all disparate treatment in the application of the rule of law based on different types of connections diminishes public trust in party and government officials an american scholar democratic activist and patriots summed up the rule of law in america the rule of law is king in contrast the rule of law in ethiopia is farce for example the tplf s chief of security getachew assefa is described by knowledgeable experts as corrupt murderer inhumane and torturer he and his partners have cordoned themselves off from the rest of ethiopia in the garrison city of mekele who knows what they are plotting next and where equally who knows what the olf is plotting from its home base in addis ababa what i surmise is this the tplf and its allies used public funds and other resources to recruit and staff an elaborate system of institutions in critical parts or regions of ethiopia for example in beni shangul gumuz gambella addis ababa and other locations i won t forget the 5 to one surveillance system that was orwellian the numerous state of emergencies that proved to be lethal in the amhara oromia regions as well as in addis ababa following the stolen elections of 2005 and during the state of siege from 2014 to 2018 while the tplf was dislodged from state power the grassroots level organizations and traps it planted most often using local proxies and agents have not been dismantled there is a plethora of evidence that confirms the existence of parallel authorities chieftains and some say governments the tplf plots in mekele and the olf plots in addis ababa what is the distinction between the two the prime minister ought to recognize that these schemes and plots together are intended to thwart the reform process and to reinstate the tplf or a similar ethnic based dictatorship the severity of a mafia or mob style resistance differs from one locality to another you bring oromo and somali ethiopians together artfully and systematically one day and resolve disputes successfully and another ethnic conflict erupts somewhere else the root cause is the same the tplf olf and other ethnic allies as well as their foreign backers institutionalized ethnic federalism with the intent of keeping ethiopia in suspense threatening it with a break up when the situation is not favorable to the ethnic elite masters and new land lords the tplf and olf in tandem argue that dismantling the ethnic federal system they established will result in ethiopia s balkanization the same architects that brought ethiopia to the brink are now telling us that ethiopia will balkanize unless the status quo is maintained why not asks the people of ethiopia to decide the matter in a national referendum proponents of the status quo ante do not however tell us why the system is the single most critical source of ethnic cleansing murders robberies internal displacements and land grab neither the tplf nor the olf gives value and priority to all human life for more than 27 years the tplf and its ethnic allies including ethnic parties such as the amhara national democratic movement that the tplf fathered ruled ethiopia with a level of cruelty and brutality unprecedented in ethiopian history no matter how much i have tried i find no parallel in modern african history that resembles ethiopia s orwellian party state and government all blended into one it is this same system that adherents of ethnic federalism the developmental state and rd want to preserve at any cost equally it is this orwellian system that abiy and his team must dismantle before it brings down the entire government balkanizes ethiopia and triggers civil war and possible genocide in the amhara region the tplf had successfully recruited planted and penetrated each and every municipal regional sub regional and regional administrative institution including the now morphed amhara democratic party itself colleges and universities are forced to serve as bastions of tplf propaganda the adp must cleanse itself of the monster to which it is a hostage peace and stability are unattainable as long as the tplf infrastructure exists it operates and breeds like a virus the solution to a virus is not appeasement it is dismantlement at its institutional and constitutional core contrast the amhara region s situation with that of the oromia region where the oromo democratic party has freed institutions and civil society of tplf hegemony influence and its hateful virus this does not mean that the rule of law prevails in oromia either it does not comparisons should be read as relative enablers and financers this takes me to another phenomenon in ethiopian politics that we fail to analyze and debate boldly and candidly for a mobster like political culture to flourish there must be enablers somewhere who are these domestic and foreign enablers of the mobs thieves robbers black marketers human and weapons traffickers sharp shooters and saboteurs of economic and financial infrastructure do they really care for ethiopia and for the ethiopian people why is this taking place in an environment of hope a pronounced focus on human rights well articulated aspirational goals by the prime minister better relations with neighboring countries especially with eritrea and a public euphoria for fundamental change why is the federal government unable to protect the safety and security of individuals communities and the country is the onslaught a threat to ethiopia s territorial integrity national honor and dignity and the country s sovereignty my answer to this core question is an unequivocal yes i do not think that any person or party has the answer i know from the experiences of other countries in transition that the prime minister and his party are genuine and sincere in their aspirations however they alone cannot solve this national and human problem equally ethiopia s fragmented and weak opposition or so called competitive ተፎካካሪ ፓርቲዎች parties cannot either i am convinced though that if united and free the ethiopian people can save the country they have done it in the past and will in the future too an aspect of ethiopia s systemic and institutional hurdle that no one is discussing forthrightly is the pull and push between the federal center and the regional or kill self governing units they are not in synch at all i have shown above in the tplf example that on the contrary elites of regional governments operate as independent units their loyalty to the center is questionable in a number of instances regions or kilil s serve as porous entry points for all types of extrajudicial bodies they provide safety and security to thieves and criminals for example in gambella it was reported that there are three military depots training camps etc in the afar region similar extrajudicial movements of armed men have been identified in beni shangul gumuz the marauding bandits of armed men who murdered civilians identifying them as amhara nationals are described as unknown similarly in northern shoa a well armed group with machine guns moved from house to house killing innocent people torching homes and churches this armed group was also described as unknown federal authorities including defense forces have failed miserably in mitigating these and other atrocities it is time to ask whether or not these establishments are independent and national or ethnic and biased what i recommend as a remedy my hypothesis from these sets of incidents is this when regions become porous and uncommitted or ill equipped to safe guard the safety and security of all ethiopians civilians in their own region and when unknown armed groups are able to roam kill persons and destroy property they have essentially failed to implement the rule of law they have also failed to bear their share of responsibility to the federal government in the process ethiopia s sovereignty is threatened regional governments and people have an obligation to ensure the safety and security of all citizens they have an obligation to safeguard ethiopia s national interests and its sovereignty what i conclude from the chaos and the uneven change process is this for ethiopians to enjoy personal security peace and stability the rule of law must be enforced throughout the country by local regional and federal authorities in synch no single person or party should be above the law the social and political glue that will strengthen the rule of law is citizens rights in any civilized country on the planet ex officials such as getachew assefa and any others who robbed 17 bank branches murdered 58 innocent people in burayu triggered massive ethnic conflicts and displacements in gedeo guji gondar oromia northern shoa beni shangul gumuz and near jimma and also took out billions of dollars of ethiopia s wealth illicitly would be wanted men they won t be allowed to live with impunity anywhere in the world this is the reason why i contend that appeasement won t work at all what would it take to strengthen the rule of law first and foremost is public resolve and participation in pursuit of fundamental change second is bold courageous and imaginative government leadership at all levels and continuous and proactive popular public engagement and support for peace and stability more than anyone else foreign or domestic ordinary ethiopian citizens especially youth know the facts on the ground this leads me to the third recommendation namely accountability youth can pinpoint and identity party regional and federal officials who have committed crimes against humanity and have plundered the country shouldn t such persons be held accountable in a court of law regardless of tribe or power my answer is yes how do we achieve accountability ethiopia must use all tools at its disposal including the magnitsky act in the united states the egmont financial intelligence surveillance system interpol and the international criminal court and hold those who committed extrajudicial murders of innocent civilians and those who used their public authority and power to steal and take out billions of dollars illicitly accountablewherever they may hide hemorrhaging through theft and graft i note with delight and anticipation that the ethiopian government has decided to join the egmont group of countries to track and retrieve the tens of billions of dollars stolen and taken out of the country illicitly i have been arguing for several years that ethiopia is hemorrhaging from illicit outflow that averages close to 3 billion dollars per annum it is not just price mis invoicing and under reporting that is the culprit the foreign exchange regime is replete with distortions including black market exchanges of dollars and other hard currencies for birr high commissions and kickbacks unreported and illegal diaspora transfers of monies etc i shall conclude from the above hypothesis and analysis that the implication of lack of accountability for any form of crime in ethiopia is consequential it must be dealt with now this is the fundamental reason why ethiopia needs a new constitutional system with checks and balances an independent judiciary an elected legislative body that is solely subservient to the electorate and not to the party and a top notch and incorruptible executive body appointed through free and fair elections i shall reiterate the most critical hypothesis one of the biggest hurdles the abiy government faces is lack of accountability for high crimes whether property or human lives you can talk all you want about the rule of law but no one will take you seriously if those at the highest level of government local municipal regional or federal are not held accountable for misdeeds in a court of law transferring criminals including thieves of party state and government from one role to another is a form of appeasement it is not justice it does not advance the democratization process an inch in the light of the above my advice to the abiy team is that they need to hold each and every person who has committed high crimes accountable in a court of law now i am hopeful and optimistic that this will happen in part ii of this commentary i shall discuss the pitfalls of ethnic federalism and propose an alternative that will hold ethiopia together and advance the prosperity of the ethiopian people in the interim i urge proponents of ethnic federalism to heed to the wise advice of the late dr negasso may 14 2019 ___ join the conversation like borkena on facebook and get ethiopian news updates regularly as well you may get ethiopia news by following us on twitter

than one year the economics for las chispas are exceptional the pea has focused initial development and production on the high grade babicanora babicanora fw and babicanora norte veins producing an average of 13 7 million ounces of silver equivalent per year for the first four years at an aisc of less than 5 00 oz ageq this production and cost structure have the potential to generate in excess of 100 million in annual net free cash flow at today s silver 14 75 oz and gold 1 297 oz prices preliminary economic results suggest that las chispas could be a high margin project even at low metal prices importantly this assessment is a snapshot of the potential value of las chispas we have been exploring the las chispas district for only three years continued drilling success may add significant value to the project the resources used in the pea consists of 10 of 30 known veins drill tested near surface in the district we currently have 14 drill rigs running at las chispas of which 6 are focused on expanding the resource and testing new targets and 8 are completing infill drilling for re categorizing resources the new decline into area 51 is progressing well with an anticipated intercept of the high grade shoot 51 in q2 2019 with subsequent surface stockpiling of material grading an average of more than 1 000 gpt ageq we have also identified a number of optimization opportunities in the pea which we intend to evaluate as we proceed with a feasibility study or fs with anticipated completion in first half of 2020 the company cautions that the results of the pea are preliminary in nature and include inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have economic consideration applied to them to be classified as mineral

and metallurgy detailed metallurgical test work was completed from september 2018 to march 2019 to assess potential silver and gold recoveries for the las chispas project as announced in a news release dated april 18 2019 titled positive metallurgical recoveries for las chispas a 445 kilogram bulk sample was collected from 51 core hole and nine underground samples and compiled into 15 different samples based on geo metallurgical domains which were combined into three master composites low medium and high grade the best recoveries were generated from a process flowsheet that included a gravity recovery circuit with intensive cyanidation of the gravity concentrate and the gravity tails processed through standard leaching the pea assumes this is followed by a standard counter current decantation milling process with gold and silver recovered through a merrill crowe circuit the test work showed recoveries of 91 95 for silver and 98 99 for gold additional test work was completed on intensive leaching of gravity concentrates which showed recoveries of 99 for both gold and silver for the pea the company has limited the intensive leaching recovery to 90 until further optimization work is completed therefore an average recovery of 89 9 for silver and 94 4 for gold is used in the pea except during the six month start up period where the company further reduced the recovery by 5 the process plant has been designed at a nameplate capacity of 1 358 tpd with the production schedule assuming 8 downtime over the course of a year at 92 operating time the

to enhance value several potential opportunities have been identified that may significantly enhance the economic return outlined in the pea including but not limited to the following exploration potential the diluted resource estimated for the pea is based on the february 2019 mineral resource estimate which includes 10 of 30 known veins on the project the company currently has 14 drill rigs on site with six 6 of those rigs dedicated to expanding resources and drill testing new targets for potential discoveries with success on further drilling there are several ways that expanded resources could improve the economics of the project including throughput expansion the mine plan for the pea is based on a 1 250 tpd throughput scenario which results in an 8 5 year mine life expanded resources have the potential to justify increased mine and mill throughput as part of the upcoming fs silvercrest will evaluate the potential costs to expand the process plant capacity to 1 500 2 000 tpd with potential benefits to unit costs for processing and g a with respect to economies of scale reduced development cost per ounce babicanora sur luigi granaditas including la blanquita have relatively high development costs per ounce of diluted resource expanding the diluted resource for these veins would spread the relatively high development capital over more ounces improving economics and reducing the aisc per ounce high grade discovery the grade profile for the las chispas project is heavily weighted towards the first four years of production a new high grade discovery could help smooth the decline in production that begins in year five by prioritizing development of a new high grade discovery and delaying the development of the lower grade veins while potentially adding economies of scale at the same time pea excluded resources the diluted resource that is incorporated into the mine plan for the pea excludes approximately 20 million oz ageq that were estimated in the february 2019 resource estimate specifically discrete mineralized zones in the babicanora fw babicanora norte and sur veins and all of the luigi vein resources have been excluded from adjacent designed mine stopes and discrete isolated zones which currently do not have enough critical mass to justify the added cost of underground development for production silvercrest is optimistic that by applying optimized stope designs and follow up drilling to expand discrete zones some excluded resources may be included in a future mine plan mining method the pea is based on 100 cut and fill underground mining with split blasting resue applied in those areas where vein widths drop to less than 1 5 metres there are known opportunities for the babicanora vein in particular to be mined using lower cost long hole and sub level mining methods in the areas where the vein averages over 3 0 metres in true width this could reduce mining and development costs at the beginning of the mine life metallurgy the results from our metallurgical test work suggested intensive leaching recoveries of 99 for both gold and silver gravity concentrates in the pea the intensive leaching recoveries is set at 90 which results in an implied recovery of 89 9 for silver and 94 4 for gold test work completed to date suggests potential for improved silver recoveries of 91 95 for silver and 98 99 for gold silvercrest intends to follow up these promising results with further test work to be completed and incorporated into the fs power line the pea assumes the use of onsite generated power using diesel fuel at 0 28 kwh and exposes the operation to fluctuations in the price of fuel the fs will be contemplating the connection of the site to the national grid via power available at an estimated cost of 0 09 kwh stockpiled material at start of production the mine schedule for the pea assumes that during the six month start up period of operations 100 of the mill throughput will be sourced from the current surface stockpiles with an estimated 175 000 tonnes grading 224 gpt ageq once silver and gold recoveries are optimized then processing of higher grade material would begin based on the ongoing construction of a new decline silvercrest plans on underground development in high grade mineralization starting in h2 2019 along with test mining and stockpiling material from area 51 this stockpiled material could be up to 20 000 tonnes for 2019 with additional tonnes before conceptual start up based on the possible early high performance of the mill high grade material could be processed in the first six months of operations with improved payback and npv feasibility study with the pea completed silvercrest is moving forward with a feasibility study for las chispas the company is targeting completion of the fs in h1 2020 and making a production decision following the release of a positive study of the 14 drill rigs currently working on site eight 8 of these rigs are focused on infill drilling in an effort to upgrade inferred resources into the indicated category for inclusion in the fs reserves on a related note the exploration decline into area 51 has been progressing smoothly ground conditions have been excellent which has allowed the company to advance the decline rapidly in less than three months the exploration decline has been advanced to over 420 metres with a target to intercept the high grade shoot 51 of the babicanora vein in q2 2019 once shoot 51 is intercepted 400 to 800 metres of mineralized development will be completed in h2 2019 this rapid access to high grade mineralization will allow us to conduct detailed feasibility work including further metallurgy assess geotechnical conditions reconcile underground grades with the resource model complete test mining to define the optimum mining method and determine more accurate development costs the recommended budget for the feasibility study field support for the study ongoing exploration work and exploration decline and development construction over the next 12 months is estimated at 17 5 million tetra tech s work to complete the pea demonstrates that the las chispas project has robust economic potential and recommends that silvercrest continue developing the project with emphasis on the exploration work required to improve confidence in inferred resources tetra tech recommends that

china running out of u s goods to penalize china may consider other u s imports non tariff measures devaluing yuan dumping u s debt seen risky steps washington also turns up pressure on other fronts by kevin yao and michael martina beijing may 15 reuters china is running out of options to hit back at the united states without hurting its own interests as washington intensifies pressure on beijing to correct trade imbalances in a challenge to china s state led economic model china said this week it would impose higher tariffs on most u s imports on a revised 60 billion target list that s a much shorter list compared with the 200 billion of chinese products on which washington has hiked tariffs washington has also turned up the heat on other fronts from targeting china s tech firms such as huawei and zte to sending warships through the strategic taiwan strait as the pressure mounts chinese leaders are pressing ahead to seal a deal and avoid a drawn out trade war that risks stalling china s long term economic development according to people familiar with their thinking but beijing is mindful of a possible nationalistic backlash if it is seen as conceding too much to washington agreeing to u s demands to end subsidies and tax breaks for state owned firms and strategic sectors would also overturn china s state led economic model and weaken the communist party s grip on the economy they said we still have ammunition but we may not use all of it said a policy insider declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter the purpose is to reach a deal acceptable to both sides the state council information office finance ministry and commerce ministry did not immediately respond to reuters requests for comment of the retaliatory options available to china none come without potential risks restricting u s imports since july last year china has cumulatively imposed additional retaliatory tariffs of up to 25 percent on about 110 billion of u s goods based on 2018 u s census bureau trade data china would only have about 10 billion of u s products such as crude oil and big aircraft left to levy duties on in retaliation for any future u s tariffs in contrast u s president donald trump is threatening tariffs on a further 300 billion of chinese goods the only other items beijing could tax would be imports of u s services the united states had a services trade surplus with china of 40 5 billion in 2018 but china does not have as much leverage over the united states as it might seem because large parts of that surplus are in tourism and education areas that would be more difficult for the chinese government to significantly roll back james green a senior adviser at mclarty associates told reuters china is more likely to further erect non tariff barriers on u s goods such as delaying regulatory approvals for agricultural products said green who until august was the top u s trade representative official at the embassy in beijing hurting u s firms trade analysts say china could reward other global companies at the expense of u s firms replacing for example boeing planes with airbus jets where possible but there is considerable risk for china in transitioning its retaliation from tariffs to non tariffs barriers on u s companies because doing so would intensify perceptions of an uneven playing field in china and incentivise some firms to shift sourcing or investment outside the country they say trump has called for u s firms to move production back to the united states the medium to long term ramifications on supply chains are being deeply underestimated i would be severely concerned if i was china robert lawrence a nonresident senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics recently told journalists in beijing where a group from the think tank met with senior chinese officials after trade negotiations hit a wall last week and led to the imposition of new tariffs chinese state media has stepped up nationalist rhetoric vowing that china won t be bullied but analysts say beijing at least for the time being is trying to keep the trade war from seeping into the larger political arena i don t think they see that as in their interests and are worried that anti americanism becomes anti regime very quickly said green devaluing the yuan a weaker yuan could help mitigate the impact on china s exports from higher u s tariffs but any sharp yuan depreciation could spur capital flight analysts say chinese leaders have repeatedly said they will not resort to yuan depreciation to boost exports and the central bank has said it will not use the currency as a tool to cope with trade frictions the yuan has lost just over 2 percent against the dollar so far this month as the trade war intensifies but analysts said the depreciation is likely to be market driven dumping u s treasuries investors are concerned that china which is the largest foreign u s creditor may dump treasury bonds and send u s borrowing costs higher to punish the trump administration but most analysts say such an action by china is unlikely as it risks starting a fire sale that would burn its own portfolio too china s massive treasury holdings totalled 1 131 trillion in february according to the latest u s data circumventing the u s the near term shock to china s economy from higher u s tariffs could be mitigated by increased policy stimulus to spur domestic demand chinese exporters are diversifying overseas sales helped in part by beijing s belt and road initiative to recreate the old silk road to meet its demand for raw materials china is also seeking alternative overseas suppliers chinese purchases of u s soybeans once china s biggest import item from the united states came to a virtual halt after beijing slapped 25 tariffs on u s shipments last year beijing has since scooped up soybeans from brazil reporting by kevin yao and michael martina additional reporting by hallie gu editing by ryan woo

india s slowing economy will need a boost soon after the current election but budget stresses mean new delhi probably has to rely on the reserve bank of india rbi to provide it through more interest rate cuts according to two senior finance ministry officials the government lacks the ability to hike already planned spending to spur growth they said as revenue in the year ending march 2020 is likely to be below target while borrowing will rise mainly for a new farm support scheme right now the government is not thinking of any stimulus i do not think we can afford it as any package would ultimately lead to higher borrowing one of the ministry officials who insisted on anonymity told reuters the government has a fiscal deficit target of 3 4 per cent of gross domestic product for 2019 20 the finance ministry did not respond to a request for comment limited impact while the rbi is likely to be open to more policy easing provided inflation does not surge their impact on economic activity may be limited given debts burdening the banking sector two rate cuts this year have barely reduced loan and deposit rates the finance ministry official said that the rbi needs to provide additional liquidity to ensure rate cuts pass to bank customers the central bank has injected 13 billion into the system in the past two months through open market operations and forex swaps but the officials expect more the second official said that the ministry is working on a plan to infuse capital into state run banks in exchange for equity state run banks have asked for a rs 50 crore 7 12 billion fund infusion in 2019 20 sources said economic growth which hit a five quarter low of 6 6 per cent in october december appears to be slowing march industrial output contracted for the first time in nearly two years surveys show a slackening in manufacturing and services growth while car and motorbike sales have tumbled the slip in growth comes at a time many economists are questioning the quality of official data and suggesting past levels have been overstated the trade war between the united states and china has sparked worries about a weakening in the global economy new delhi officials are concerned that low cost chinese goods which can t find a home in the united states might be dumped in india top priority indian economists agree that the next government whether again led by prime minister narendra modi and his bharatiya janata party bjp or by its opponents will urgently seek to lift growth the 39 day indian general election ends on may 19 with counting of votes on may 23 the central bank has cut its benchmark repo rate by 50 basis points this year to 6 0 per cent the two finance ministry officials said the government expects at least another 50 bps cut by august the next rbi policy meeting is june 6 gopal krishna agarwal bjp s economic affairs spokesman said the government needs to focus on lowering of interest rates higher spending and asset creation so that demand is created the party proposes spending rs 100 lakh crore over five years to build roads railways ports and rural infrastructure indian media this week quoted a senior official as saying the corporate affairs ministry is working on a plan to waive debt of very small businesses and individuals with annual earnings below rs 60 000 that could cost as much as rs 20 lakh crore but finance ministry officials say any such plan would have to be funded by budget cuts elsewhere and is unlikely to start in the current fiscal year the congress party has pledged to give rs 72 000 rupees to each of india s poorest families but this won t be immediately implemented should it form the government due to concerns this will make the fiscal deficit balloon the immediate focus has to be the macro economic stability p chidambaram former finance minister and a senior congress leader told reuters it s only when the growth process starts we can find the revenues for implementing all this fall in revenue in the 2019 20 budget the government expanded its borrowing programme by rs 1 4 lakh crore to more than rs 7 lakh crore the government expects to fall short of its 2019 20 indirect tax target of rs 13 8 lakh crore 20 per cent above last year making it harder to meet its revenue target also there could be losses from state run banks and other companies such as air india which might need further government support in 2019 20 fiscal deficit is expected to be much higher than the budget target predicted former rbi governor bimal jalan 1 70 2360 indian rupees
the trump administration s budget plan for fiscal year 2020 mirrors last year s in the massive cuts it proposes for core public services that help struggling individuals and families afford the basics and access health care although congress has previously rejected many of these proposals the budget merits attention given the administration s continued push for these priorities and the scope of the damage the budget would do if enacted these proposals and others in the budget would sharply increase the number of people who lack health coverage while increasing poverty widening income and racial disparities and driving up the number of households that struggle to afford the basics the president s budget reflects the direction in which the administration wants to take the country through both legislative and executive actions indeed while the budget s call to repeal the affordable care act aca and cut medicaid deeply likely won t be on the congressional agenda this year the administration has moved forward with administrative actions that advance some of the same goals on a more limited scale the budget s major themes are perhaps nowhere clearer than in its proposal to extend beyond 2025 the costly 2017 tax cuts that have given large windfalls to high income individuals and highly profitable corporations even as the budget calls for cutting 1 trillion over the next decade from entitlement mandatory programs that help low and moderate income households and layered on top of these cuts are proposals for additional reductions in funding for non defense discretionary ndd programs that would affect a broad set of programs many of which assist low and moderate income people in making ends meet and having a chance at upward mobility this analysis uses figures prepared by the administration s office of management and budget among its many cuts the budget reaffirms the administration s support for repealing the aca which would cause millions of people to lose health coverage increase health care costs for millions more and end nationwide protections for people with pre existing conditions many more would lose medicaid coverage if the administration were to successfully implement a nationwide policy of taking medicaid coverage away from those who don t meet a work requirement which would cause millions of people to lose health coverage increase health care costs for millions more and end nationwide protections for people with pre existing conditions many more would lose medicaid coverage if the administration were to successfully implement a nationwide policy of taking medicaid coverage away from those who don t meet a work requirement proposes to cut snap formerly food stamps by 220 billion or about 30 percent over the next ten years the budget would dramatically restructure how snap benefits are delivered taking away food choices and posing new food access hurdles for almost 90 percent of snap participants other benefit and eligibility cuts would cause at least 4 million people to lose snap benefits altogether the cuts would affect every category of snap participant including the unemployed the elderly individuals with disabilities and low income working families with children the budget would dramatically restructure how snap benefits are delivered taking away food choices and posing new food access hurdles for almost 90 percent of snap participants other benefit and eligibility cuts would cause at least 4 million people to lose snap benefits altogether the cuts would affect every category of snap participant including the unemployed the elderly individuals with disabilities and low income working families with children proposes to cut funding in 2020 for the department of housing and urban development hud by 9 7 billion or 18 percent including significant cuts in rental assistance for low income households that includes cutting funding to operate maintain and repair public housing by 60 percent and eliminating housing choice vouchers for 140 000 households it would also re propose a policy that would raise rents by an average 44 percent on 4 million low income households now receiving assistance and take benefits away from people judged not to have met a work requirement that includes cutting funding to operate maintain and repair public housing by 60 percent and eliminating housing choice vouchers for 140 000 households it would also re propose a policy that would raise rents by an average 44 percent on 4 million low income households now receiving assistance and take benefits away from people judged not to have met a work requirement calls for cutting funding for non defense discretionary programs by 54 billion or 9 percent not accounting for inflation in 2020 relative to the 2019 level by 2029 funding for non defense discretionary programs would be 40 percent below 2019 levels after taking inflation into account these cuts would affect a host of important programs including job training and education the budget also calls for eliminating the low income home energy assistance program lhieap entirely if enacted these proposals and others in the budget would sharply increase the number of people who lack health coverage while increasing poverty widening income and racial disparities and driving up the number of households that struggle to afford the basics budget prioritizes tax cuts while slicing basic assistance health care and non defense discretionary programs like his previous budget the president s 2020 budget calls for making the 2017 tax cuts permanent while making deep cuts to entitlement programs that help low and moderate income families afford the basics and provide them with access to health care it also calls for large reductions in non defense discretionary or annually appropriated programs which fund a broad set of public services and investments that promote opportunity and economic growth such as job training early k 12 and postsecondary education and scientific and medical research entitlement cuts target low and moderate income individuals and families the 2020 budget calls for 1 9 trillion in cuts over the next decade in programs considered entitlements that is programs such as medicare medicaid and snap whose funding is set in law and not determined by the annual appropriations process more than half of these cuts or some 1 trillion are to programs that help low and moderate income people and families afford the basics and access health care that figure includes deep cuts to medicaid and premium tax credits that help individuals purchase coverage in the affordable care act marketplaces as well as cuts to programs such as snap temporary assistance for needy families tanf the social services block grant and supplemental security income which provides income assistance to low income people with disabilities and low income seniors the largest cuts 777 billion would come from medicaid and premium tax credits the next largest come in snap which would be cut by 220 billion over the next decade or by about one quarter in 2020 and one third in the years after that the share of cuts coming from these means tested programs exceeds the overall share of entitlement spending on them while low income programs comprise just 29 percent of entitlement programs overall they constitute 53 percent of the cuts to entitlements proposed in the administration s budget while the cuts are disproportionate the bigger concern is their impact they would increase poverty and hardship and swell the number of people without health insurance cuts to non defense discretionary programs ndd programs whose funding is determined by annual appropriations range from education and veterans medical care to environmental protection low income housing assistance child care national parks and international affairs the trump budget proposes to set funding for ndd in 2020 at the very low sequestration level set by the 2011 budget control act bca that would mean ndd funding in 2020 would be reduced by 54 billion or 9 percent below the 2019 funding level or by 68 billion 11 percent after adjusting for inflation see figure 1 funding levels for both defense and ndd programs are currently well above the bca s austere sequestration levels because congress and the president reached an agreement to raise funding significantly above those levels for 2018 and 2019 this agreement reflected a broad bipartisan consensus that the funding levels under the bca s sequestration caps were substantially too low to meet key national needs in fact congress and the president have adjusted the bca funding levels upward for every year since 2013 the first year that the sequestration cuts were slated to take effect in contrast to the funding levels the president ultimately agreed to for 2018 and 2019 however his 2020 budget would cut ndd sharply relative to those levels with the cuts then deepening over time in 2029 his budget would set overall ndd funding 40 percent below the 2019 funding level adjusted for inflation the budget lays out funding levels for individual ndd programs only for its first year 2020 as is typical for administrative budgets and proposes to cut or eliminate a number of important low income programs for example it calls for deeply cutting rental assistance through cuts in both housing choice vouchers and public housing eliminating several community development programs and the low income home energy assistance program and sharply cutting job corps a department of labor job training program for disadvantaged young people these cuts and ones elsewhere in the budget would grow deeper and likely affect a still broader set of programs in years after 2020 while the budget plan would substantially reduce a number of ndd programs that provide supports or can build skills or otherwise improve prospects for low and moderate income people those programs are cut slightly less deeply than ndd as a whole at least in the first year but the cuts are significant and would grow over time budget plan would leave millions more without health coverage while the president is promising to enact health care legislation that would lower costs while protecting people with pre existing conditions his budget reaffirms his support for an aca repeal plan that would cause millions of people to lose coverage increase health care costs for millions more end nationwide protections for people with pre existing conditions and cut medicaid deeply the budget also includes proposals designed to make it harder for low and moderate income people to enroll in or maintain medicaid coverage including taking medicaid coverage away from people nationwide who don t meet a work requirement and proposals to shrink premium tax credits and make it more difficult for people to maintain coverage in the aca marketplaces in total the budget would cut medicaid and aca financial assistance by 777 billion over ten years with the cuts mounting over time the budget calls on congress to enact legislation modeled closely after the aca repeal and replace bill from senators bill cassidy and lindsey graham and on top of that to then cut coverage programs by hundreds of billions of dollars over ten years below the levels specified in that legislation see figure 2 like the 2017 cassidy graham proposal the trump plan would eliminate the aca s expansion of medicaid to low income adults which has extended coverage to almost 13 million low income people as well as its marketplace subsidies that now help about 9 million low and moderate income people obtain marketplace coverage cassidy graham would replace this funding with a vastly inadequate block grant to states the funding for which would fall further and further behind current law levels with each passing year the proposal also would impose a per capita cap on federal medicaid funding for all of the rest of the medicaid program which covers seniors people with disabilities pregnant women and families with children such a cap would limit federal spending on medicaid to a set amount per person regardless of the actual cost of health care in addition the proposal sets the growth rate allowed in the per capita cap from one year to the next below the rate of expected health care cost growth with the shortfall widening each year finally the trump budget would weaken consumer protections for people with private coverage such as by allowing states to eliminate key protections for people with pre existing conditions it s unlikely that aca repeal and a medicaid per capita cap will be on the congressional agenda during 2019 however the administration has moved forward with administrative actions that advance some of the same goals on a smaller scale for example through medicaid waivers that make it harder for low income adults to obtain and maintain health coverage and actions that discourage marketplace enrollment and make marketplace plans more expensive separate from its proposals to repeal the aca the budget puts forward a number of medicaid and marketplace policies in that same spirit including proposals that would take medicaid away from people who don t meet a work requirement expanding on the trump administration s unprecedented approval of state work requirement policies in medicaid the president s budget proposes to take coverage away from adults nationwide if they don t meet a work requirement in arkansas the first state to implement such a policy almost 1 in 4 people subject to the work requirement lost their medicaid coverage in the first seven months that it was in effect while a federal district court struck down state waivers with work requirements in arkansas and kentucky the trump administration continues to approve these policies in additional states this one budget proposal alone is projected to cut medicaid by 130 billion over the next decade that translates into about 1 7 million people losing medicaid coverage starting in 2021 based on the average level of federal medicaid spending for an adult enrolled through the aca s medicaid expansion other estimates suggest that the losses could be even higher imposing medicaid work requirements nationwide would cause 1 4 million to 4 0 million people to lose coverage according to researchers at the kaiser family foundation increase red tape for medicaid beneficiaries the president s budget indicates that the administration intends to undertake rulemaking to allow states to more frequently redetermine medicaid beneficiaries eligibility it estimates nearly 50 billion in savings over ten years from the intended regulatory change suggesting that it anticipates large coverage losses states are currently required to redetermine eligibility for most medicaid beneficiaries at the end of a 12 month enrollment period however beneficiaries are required to report changes that may impact eligibility throughout the time they are covered under medicaid and states have the option to create systems and processes to check data sources periodically to see if beneficiaries remain eligible if states find data that suggest beneficiaries may no longer meet the eligibility requirements they can request information from beneficiaries and terminate coverage if they find a person no longer meets the eligibility requirements since redeterminations entail work for both the state staff and beneficiaries requiring all beneficiaries to renew more than once a year would be burdensome and significantly increase the chances that some beneficiaries would miss a step resulting in the loss of health coverage despite continuing to meet all of the program s eligibility criteria the president s budget indicates that the administration intends to undertake rulemaking to allow states to more frequently redetermine medicaid beneficiaries eligibility it estimates nearly 50 billion in savings over ten years from the intended regulatory change suggesting that it anticipates large coverage losses states are currently required to redetermine eligibility for most medicaid beneficiaries at the end of a 12 month enrollment period however beneficiaries are required to report changes that may impact eligibility throughout the time they are covered under medicaid and states have the option to create systems and processes to check data sources periodically to see if beneficiaries remain eligible if states find data that suggest beneficiaries may no longer meet the eligibility requirements they can request information from beneficiaries and terminate coverage if they find a person no longer meets the eligibility requirements since redeterminations entail work for both the state staff and beneficiaries requiring all beneficiaries to renew more than once a year would be burdensome and significantly increase the chances that some beneficiaries would miss a step resulting in the loss of health coverage despite continuing to meet all of the program s eligibility criteria requiring documentation of immigration status before coverage takes effect all immigrants with undocumented status as well as many who are lawfully present are ineligible for medicaid based on their immigration status states are required to verify that applicants are either citizens or have an eligible immigration status as part of determining eligibility for the program states have tools to verify the citizenship or immigration status of the vast majority of applicants by quickly using data matching with other government agencies but in some cases the process takes longer in these cases current law requires states to temporarily issue medicaid benefits to people who have attested under penalty of perjury that they are citizens or have an eligible immigration status and who meet all of the other eligibility factors such as having income below the applicable medicaid income limit this policy helps avoid what could otherwise be long delays while people obtain the documents they need and the state medicaid agency processes them the budget proposes however to eliminate this reasonable opportunity period and to bar federal funding for an individual s medicaid coverage until citizenship or immigration status has been verified for some eligible people including children pregnant women people with disabilities and elderly individuals this may result in significant delays in obtaining needed health care increasing premiums for many low and moderate income marketplace enrollees the administration s budget proposal would require all marketplace enrollees to pay out of pocket toward the cost of their health plans even if they otherwise could enroll in a plan with a premium fully covered by their premium tax credit the administration argues that denying consumers the choice of the plan with the lowest premiums in these cases somehow promotes personal responsibility effectively that health care is currently too affordable for many low and moderate income consumers and they should pay more but a zero premium plan doesn t mean that coverage is free instead it s paid for by an advance premium tax credit which the enrollee is responsible for reconciling on his or her tax return and which he or she may need to repay in part after the end of the year if the enrollee s income for the year ends up higher than had been anticipated moreover zero premium plans often have high deductibles and other significant out of pocket costs although they still protect people against catastrophic costs and offer access to preventive care without cost sharing and often to primary care and generic drugs with no or low cost sharing as well based on other estimates from the administration this would mean reducing tax credits and increasing premiums for about 1 6 million low and moderate income consumers the budget also includes other policies that would make it harder for low and moderate income people to obtain medicaid coverage and marketplace subsidies for example it would allow states to consider assets such as retirement savings accounts in determining medicaid eligibility for children parents pregnant women and other adults undoing a major simplification achieved through the aca which eliminated those tests asset tests generally had little impact on medicaid eligibility most people with incomes below the medicaid limit don t have significant assets so few people were found ineligible for medicaid based on assets but asset tests have a number of serious downsides having to document assets increases paperwork can deter some eligible people from applying for medicaid and leads to delays or even denials of coverage for some eligible people not because they have substantial assets but because they don t succeed in providing all of the paperwork proving that they don t have such assets the budget also would make it harder for some seniors and people with disabilities to qualify for medicaid without selling their homes would expand states ability to impose significant cost sharing changes on medicaid beneficiaries that likely would deter some from seeking needed care and would allow states to end coverage of non emergency medical transportation taken together the budget s repeal and replace proposals and its additional medicaid cuts would cause millions of people to lose coverage and make coverage less adequate or less affordable for millions more would make it harder for struggling families to put food on the table the 2020 budget would cut snap by 220 billion or about 30 percent over the next ten years it would impose large benefit cuts on most households even though current benefits average just 1 40 per person per meal and would dramatically restructure how benefits are delivered it includes other benefit and eligibility cuts as well that would cause at least 4 million people to lose snap benefits altogether the cuts would affect every category of snap participants including the unemployed the elderly individuals with disabilities and low income working families with children in this area the budget would shift more than 260 billion in food purchasing from individual households to the government as it did last year the trump budget calls for the agriculture department usda to hold back an estimated 25 to 30 billion per year in snap benefits about 40 percent of the benefits issued to households and use about half of these funds to give households a box of non perishable foods such as shelf stable milk ready to eat cereals pasta peanut butter beans and canned foods this box of food would be in lieu of food that households would otherwise purchase with snap benefits at the grocery store the other half of the held back funds would be eliminated resulting in about 130 billion in federal snap cuts over ten years households wouldn t receive these benefits in any form the administration claims that the government can purchase box and distribute food commodities at a substantially reduced cost these changes would take away food choices and pose new food access hurdles to an estimated 33 million people in 15 million households in 2021 or almost 90 percent of snap participants it also would create significant new administrative costs and burdens for states as they would have to build a redundant food distribution system the proposal had little or no support from either party last year when the farm bill that reauthorized snap was debated as it did last year the trump budget calls for the agriculture department usda to hold back an estimated 25 to 30 billion per year in snap benefits about 40 percent of

or no support from either party last year when the farm bill that reauthorized snap was debated cut snap benefits for a broad swath of snap households the budget also includes roughly another 90 billion in snap cuts over ten years this includes a harsh unworkable work requirement almost identical to a house farm bill proposal that congress rejected last year this proposal would take snap benefits away from adults up to age 65 including many with children who are temporarily unemployed or working fewer than 20 hours a week despite evidence that such requirements do little to improve employment the budget attributes 45 billion over ten years in snap cuts to this change the budget also would cut snap benefits for many working families by eliminating a state option that allows benefits to phase down more smoothly as earnings increase thereby avoiding a benefit cliff and on top of that the budget contains further snap cuts that would reduce benefits for several million more individuals largely low income seniors and people with disabilities and households with more than six members would make it harder for millions of households to afford rent and utilities the president s 2020 budget calls for deep cuts in housing programs not counting losses due to inflation hud administered programs would receive 9 7 billion or 18 percent less than in 2019 the budget would also eliminate the low income home energy assistance program which helps more than 5 million low income households pay their utilities these deep cuts would raise rents on millions of low income households the budget would eliminate funding for 140 000 housing choice vouchers that low income households are using to afford decent homes the budget requests 20 1 billion to renew vouchers that families are currently using but that s 206 million less than policymakers provided for 2019 and 1 3 billion or 6 percent less than the 21 4 billion that will likely be needed to renew all vouchers in 2020 due to rent inflation and other factors the cuts would especially hit extremely low income seniors people with disabilities and working families with children and would undercut communities efforts to reduce homelessness the budget requests 20 1 billion to renew vouchers that families are currently using but that s 206 million less than policymakers provided for 2019 and 1 3 billion or 6 percent less than the 21 4 billion that will likely be needed to renew all vouchers in 2020 due to rent inflation and other factors the cuts would especially hit extremely low income seniors people with disabilities and working families with children and would undercut communities efforts to reduce homelessness cut funding to operate maintain and repair public housing by 4 6 billion more than 60 percent compared to 2019 public housing is an important source of affordable housing in the country providing decent homes to nearly 1 million low income households most of which consist of seniors or people with disabilities chronic underfunding is already pushing portions of the public housing stock toward a breaking point a 2010 hud sponsored study estimated that public housing faced 26 billion in repair needs such as leaky roofs or outdated heating or electrical systems and that amount has likely increased since then residents in some public housing developments live with conditions that adversely affect their quality of life and in some cases their health and safety such as unreliable heating systems faulty elevators and unaddressed lead paint hazards and thousands of units are lost every year as a result instead of directly addressing this challenge the president s proposed funding cuts would cause more housing developments to deteriorate to the point where housing agencies have little choice but to demolish or sell them squandering decades of federal and local investment and sharply accelerating the loss of public housing which would put hundreds of thousands of affordable homes at risk in coming years public housing is an important source of affordable housing in the country providing decent homes to nearly 1 million low income households most of which consist of seniors or

homes at risk in coming years re propose policies that would sharply raise the rents of more than 4 million households receiving hud rental assistance and take housing assistance away from those who don t meet a work requirement the budget indicates that the administration intends to re introduce legislation it proposed last year that would have raised rents on more than 4 million households by an average of 44 percent shifting 3 2 billion in housing costs from hud to vulnerable seniors people with disabilities working families with children and others the poorest households which include nearly 1 million children would be hit hardest placing many at risk of becoming homeless the budget also proposes to end assistance for non elderly non disabled households that don t meet rigid work requirements which would push some families into hardship and likely into homelessness the budget indicates that the administration intends to re introduce legislation it proposed last year that would

elderly non disabled households that don t meet rigid work requirements which would push some families into hardship and likely into homelessness eliminate home investment partnerships the community development block grant choice neighborhoods programs and the national housing trust fund which all provide flexible aid to low income rural and urban communities in total communities would lose more than 4 9 billion a year to improve basic infrastructure like streets and water and sewer lines provide services such as after school programs for youth and meals to seniors build and rehabilitate affordable housing for low income residents and promote economic development which all provide flexible aid to low income rural and urban communities in total communities would lose more than 4 9 billion a year to improve basic infrastructure like streets and water and sewer lines provide services such as after school programs for youth and meals to seniors build and rehabilitate affordable housing for low income residents and promote economic development eliminate funding for the low income home energy assistance program liheap which provided more than 5 million low income households with help paying for heating and cooling in 2017 based on preliminary federal data heating assistance averaged 383 in 2017 an amount of aid that was modest in size but helped millions of families keep the heat on in their homes budget s disability benefit cuts would increase hardship the trump budget would reduce disability programs by 84 billion over ten years including reductions to social security disability insurance ssdi as well as supplemental security income ssi which provides aid to low income individuals who have disabilities or are elderly the budget calls for tens of billions of dollars in cuts to ssdi benefits which are funded out of workers payroll taxes and protect workers and their families if a disability cuts their careers short one administration budget proposal would cut in half the retroactive benefits that disabled workers may receive these are benefits provided to new ssdi recipients to reflect the loss of earnings when they became disabled even if they delayed applying for benefits because they were hoping to get better and go back to work this change could mean the loss of thousands of dollars for workers who become disabled try to return to work and find they are unable to do so and need ssdi under current law such a worker someone who is in an accident for example and hopes to recover but ultimately does not can receive up to 12 months of retroactive benefits which can be a critical lifeline that can prevent bankruptcy or homelessness the trump proposal would cut that payment in half a beneficiary who would have qualified for 12 months of retroactive benefits would lose an average of about 7 000 in earned social security benefits the policy is also shortsighted since reducing the period of retroactive benefits would likely encourage people to apply earlier for ssdi instead of first testing whether they can return to work potentially reducing the number of people who try to rehabilitate and reenter the workforce the budget s largest ssdi cuts stem from a proposal to test new approaches to increase labor force participation of people with disabilities the likelihood that such tests would result in large savings from increased employment is low given evidence from past efforts in this area and the extremely poor health status of most ssdi beneficiaries the budget also calls for cuts to ssi which goes primarily to low income people with severe disabilities for example 1 1 million children receive ssi for conditions such as down syndrome cerebral palsy autism intellectual disability and blindness the budget would cut nearly 9 billion over ten years from benefits for children and parents if another family member also receives ssi hurting for example a family with children who share a genetic disorder some 70 percent of poor families that care for more than one child with disabilities already struggle to afford basic needs like food rent and heat in addition under the guise of simplification the budget would cut more than half a billion dollars over the next decade from ssi recipients who live with others outside their immediate family to make ends meet its cuts to temporary assistance for needy families tanf and social services block grants would hurt families and states the 2020 budget would cut the tanf block grant and eliminate the related tanf contingency fund a cut of 22 billion in funding over the next decade tanf provides funds to states for short term income assistance work programs and other crucial supports for poor families with children such cuts conflict sharply with the budget s rhetoric on promoting work opportunities for poor families the budget also would eliminate altogether the social services block grant ssbg which provides 1 7 billion in flexible funding to states each year for services such as child care day programs for seniors and people with disabilities services for homeless individuals and families and others taken together these two proposals would cut flexible human services funding by 38 billion over the coming decade in addition to cutting funding in these areas the budget includes a set of tanf policy proposals that would weaken some areas while strengthening others specifically the budget would require states to spend at least 30 percent of federal and state tanf dollars on work activities such as education training and subsidized employment work supports such as transportation assistance child care and assessment and provision of services such as case management half of that required spending or 15 percent of the total would have to be in work and training but the budget doesn t make any changes that would encourage states to serve the very families that could benefit from most those resources while targeting more tanf funding to key program areas makes sense the proposal is seriously flawed basic assistance cash income support to needy families is not included in the list of areas that would receive minimum targeted funding the combination of less overall funding and new requirements for spending on work programs without any requirement that state tanf programs fulfill the key mission of ensuring that very poor families with children can meet their most basic needs could lead states to shift funds away from basic income assistance that likely would push more families into severe hardship a handful of other policy proposals in the budget however would improve the tanf program these proposals would require federal and state tanf spending to be for families at or below 200 percent of the poverty line ending the practice in some states of using tanf resources for programs that serve families higher on the income scale the budget also would make some modest improvements in the work participation requirements on states though it would not make the kind of more fundamental reforms that could lead states to restructure their employment programs to make them substantially more effective opportunity and economic mobility demonstration would unravel low income program protections the budget also proposes a demonstration that could have negative consequences for low income individuals and families receiving basic assistance through key programs the proposed opportunity and economic mobility demonstration would provide 500 million over five years for five to seven states to experiment with merging funding streams for multiple programs including snap the child care development fund housing choice vouchers workforce innovation and opportunity act programs and tanf under this initiative states would be permitted to weaken or undermine federal policies and protections that congress has established for low income programs for example the demonstrations could subject more public benefit recipients to policies that take away assistance for those who do not meet work requirements and like similar proposals in the past they could allow states to redirect substantial resources away from basic assistance for families and shift them to services that while useful can t replace the help that families need in order to afford a place to live and adequate food cuts in grants and loans would make college more expensive the 2020 trump budget would also eliminate the 840 million supplemental educational opportunity grant seog which supplements pell grants for some of the neediest students the budget s justification is that seog funds duplicate pell and that the program does not effectively deliver need based aid to the neediest students but the administration fails to propose redirecting these funds to better serve needy students and to address the significant affordability issues that many low income students face in fact the budget freezes pell grants and cuts 1 4 billion from its rainy day fund even though the current maximum pell grant covers just 28 percent of the cost of attending an in state public four year college compared to 79 percent in 1975 rather than addressing concerns about seog or protecting and strengthening pell grants the administration proposes to eliminate a program that makes college more affordable for 1 5 million of the neediest students with no replacement in addition the budget s freezing of pell grants which help 7 5 million low and moderate income students pay for college guarantees that these grants will erode even further once the effects of inflation are taken into account the budget also deeply cuts the work study program the administration justifies that cut by saying it wants to change the type of work opportunities available to students and target the resources to lower income students but while proposals that alter funding formulas and sharpen the targeting may be worth considering college remains too costly for many students and work study programs can help fill part of the affordability gap for struggling students by providing jobs more likely to be aligned with the students school schedules and responsibilities instead the administration proposes to slash work study funding leaving many fewer students with job opportunities to help pay for college finally the budget proposes a series of changes in the student loan program that would raise students borrowing costs some of the reforms have merit such as consolidating loan repayment options automatically enrolling struggling borrowers in income driven repayment options and automating the program s annual income recertification process but overall the proposed changes to the loan program would make college less not more affordable the budget would cut student loan benefits by more than 200 billion over the next decade while failing to invest those savings into expanding college affordability meaningfully for those who need it most

central bank of nigeria cbn governor mr godwin emefiele on wednesday urged federal government to attach premium to palm oil production saying its price is higher than that of crude oil emefiele stated this in abuja when he appeared before senate committee on banking insurance and other financial institutions for screening for his second term nomination by president muhammadu buhari he did not however give the current prices of the commodities in the international market but said that palm oil was a goldmine which nigeria had capacity to export to many countries the cbn governor expressed concern that though nigeria was one of the major palm oil producers in the 1960s it failed to consolidate on it because of the discovery of crude oil he however said that the cbn through its legal functions would come up with a special programme to boost palm oil production to help in diversifying the economy according to him nigeria had the potential to export palm oil and boost its revenue generation emefiele recalled that â in the 60s nigeria controlled 40 per cent share in the global palm oil chain â we were exporting our palm oil to different parts of the world but because we found crude oil we receded and abandoned it â the price of a tonne of palm oil is more than the price of a barrel of crude oil so what happened â for other countries when they had the opportunity in agriculture and in the crude sector they did not let their guards down unfortunately we did and that is what we are paying for today â such move is so so that when there are some external shock it will not be felt â we will grow that market again and after that we will go into cocoa â he said he commended president muhammadu buhari for his commitment to repositioning the agriculture sector according to emefiele the president had on different occasions insisted that the country should be producing what it would consume and consume what it would produce he noted that the charge resonated with cbn management which took it further by starting the anchor borrowers programme that had impacted so much on the lives of nigerians he also disclosed that the apex bank was coming up with a fund for the creative industry â to engage nigerian youths so as to increase employment rate as well as tackle restivenessâ â the cbn governor informed the committee that the bank had worked assiduously to stabilise the economy in many areas â we went into the regime of restricting foreign exchange this was intended to control import and encourage export to reduce pressure on the reserve â fortunately we saw import dropping to as much as six billion dollars on a quarterly basis to today that it is significantly lower â having adjusted the demands and trying to see how to balance the foreign exchange rate a number of intervening actions were introduced to help boost the supply of foreign exchange into the market â he pointed out that the bank had explored other intervening initiatives that would help boost the supply of foreign exchange into the market including encouraging investors emefiele added that cbn had been able to reduce the exchange rate from about n500 to a dollar to the current rate of n360 to a dollar he promised to make further effort to ensure stability of the exchange rate for a clear monetary policy direction â exchange rate now converges substantially at n360 to a dollar inflation trending downwards for about 25 consecutive months now from about 18 72 per cent in 2017 to as low as 11 72 per cent now â in the area of interest rate we tried as much as possible but unfortunately we have not quite achieved what we thought we will achieve on interest rate moderation â though we have moved from about 18 5 per cent to 14 per cent we will still work hard to bring it further down â on recent international monetary fund imf and world bankâ s population projection of over 400 million for nigeria in 2050 emefiele said much work needed to be done for policies that would make life easy for the people â we just came back from the imf world programme in april and in the world bank imf world economic outlook nigeria is positioned as a country whose population will rise to over 425 million people by the year 2050 â that will present nigeria as the country with the third largest population in the world after china and india and surpassing the united states of america â we from the central bank on the monetary policy side have come to realise the instrumentality of the anchor borrowers programme â a programme where access to credit is being provided to our masses all over the country will be a way to generate employment and boost economic activities among our rural population â the results are there to see that as a result of our anchor borrowers programme where we have disbursed over n190 billion to over 1 1 million farmers cultivating over 1 3 million hectares of land we need to do more â as we do this we make finance available at low interest rate make access to credit easy for our people and in doing this we will be able to create jobs for them and improve their livelihood â i am very optimistic that this can be achieved â he said emiefele called for prayers and concerted efforts to consolidate on his achievements if his nomination was confirmed he said â you have all testified to what we have done in the last three to four years i am not saying it is that simple it is difficult but we will do our best â he pledged he would not rest in ensuring that the next five years would be unbearable for those bent on sabotaging government policies adding that the bank would do anything to bring such persons to book â we need your prayers because the road ahead is still very tough so i appeal to all nigerians to respect the policies and laws of the country â part of the problems we have is lack of respect for our policies nigeria is very good at putting in place policies that are sound and workable but implementation is almost zero and that must change â the governor said on belief that the bank was operating multiple exchange rate he said it was not true according to him the bank only have multiple windows to make it easy for nigerians who make use of foreign exchange and in spite of the multiple windows there is convergence of rate with about n360 to a dollar in his remarks chairman of the senate committee sen rafiu adebayo said that the committee would put its report together and submit to the senate in plenary for further action he commended emefieleâ s effort in stabilising the economy through various initiatives and urged him to put in more effort in ensuring that some economic challenges currently bedevilling the country were tackled the senate had on may 9 read a letter from buhari requesting the confirmation of the cbn governor for a second term it thereafter directed its committee on banking insurance and other financial institutions on monday to screen the appointee and report back

the canadian dollar rose 0 18 percent against the greenback on wednesday canadian inflation data met the forecast at a 2 percent rise on a year over year basis gasoline prices increased 10 2 percent in the last 12 months as crude has appreciated with the opec deal limiting output and several geopolitical disruptions to supply offsetting the rise of us and canadian production the biggest factor for the loonie did not come from an economic indicator the news that the us is close to reaching a resolution on steel and aluminium tariffs boosted the currency us treasury secretary mnuchin said high level talks met to discuss trade given the uncertainty surrounding trade with the us the news carries a positive connotation and eases concerns for the usmca deal that could come under fire if the us decided to pursue a global trade war the us is also signalling a willingness to reassume talks with china as mnuchin is looking forward to connecting again with beijing oil prices rose despite higher us weekly inventories as tension in the middle east forced the us to pull out its diplomats out of iraq the opec deal brought about stability to crude prices but as geopolitics have caused supply disruptions prices have risen as sanctions sabotage and military action threaten the steady flow of crude in the region the us dollar is higher against most majors on wednesday after a flurry of trade comments injected optimism into the market a delay of us auto tariffs boosted global stock markets and offset some of the softer us data released on wednesday retail sales and industrial production remain weak in an economic calendar that wrapped up early this week the next major release in the us will be next week on wednesday when the u s federal reserve published its notes from its

president has asked for a rate cut the market is now pricing in that scenario as a real possibility this year and it could become a reality if fundamentals don t improve the us decided it was better to delay the auto tariffs to avoid opening more fronts in order to concentrate on the china deal us treasury secretary mnuchin said that a deal with canada and mexico is close on steel and aluminium which would give more bandwidth on trade to focus on dealing with the second largest economy oil crude higher as middle east tension offset higher us inventories the energy information administration eia reported a gain of 5 4 million barrels but rising tensions in the middle east forced us diplomats to withdraw from iraq putting more emphasis on a showdown between america and iran the attacks on saudi tankers and iran ending its nuclear commitments have escalated turmoil in the region with the us ready to apply pressure in tehran and evacuating its embassy in iraq due to security concerns supply disruptions have kept crude higher even as the us has ramped up production the opec agreement to limit output is the biggest factor but geopolitical disruptions like the us sanctions against iran and venezuela and the armed conflict in libya are added to the situation in saudi arabia iran has said that its goal it s not military confrontation but just a response to us escalating its efforts supply disruptions have been the major factor boosting oil prices geopolitical saudi arabia is seen as the main producer that could cover the gap in supply left by iranian crude us president donald trump has tweeted about the opec s role in keeping prices lower if they increase their output the deal between opec and other major producers will reach its end in june but it could be extended if participants deem the market has not reach price stability which was their main goal russia remains a big question mark as it has sacrificed its revenue to be part of the deal and could be ready to take advantage of higher prices ahead of even higher levels of us production causing another drop us production has increased dramatically to the point that the one time net importer is now an exporter of energy products shale technology has tipped the scales of global production and threatens to reduce the influence that the opec has on the market the decision from opec members to fight fire with fire and flood the market to drive shale operations into bankruptcy backfired and forced the group to reach out to non opec members in order to have a significant impact on the market by collectively reducing their output gold gold stable as trade concerns ease but middle east tensions rise gold was flat on wednesday as positive us comments on trade brought back risk appetite the trump administration delayed auto tariffs by six months and is said to be close to resolving its steel and aluminum tariffs with canada and mexico stock markets rose on the news despite softer economic indicators out of the us the yellow metal s fall was broken by the higher tensions in the middle east making gold a good alternative for investors looking for a safe haven trade concerns are easing as the white house is looking forward to more talks with china and tariff delays for global auto lifted pressure on european stocks volatility will remain high as uncertainty is plentiful with so many geopolitical risks up in the air making gold a viable asset for diversification stocks equities rebound after positive trade news global equities were higher after us president donald trump announced a delay to the planned auto tariffs the six month term was a positive for auto stocks that gained after the news the us entered a combative stance on trade when trump entered the white house but as a trade deal with china broke off in the last mile american rhetoric had become more aggressive and markets feared a full on trade war us data came in below expectations with retail sales and industrial production disappointing and building the case for a fed rate cut this year economic indicators continue to be mixed and the market is pricing in lower growth but trade war concerns are driving prices until a us china trade deal is signed which could come before or at the g20 meeting in japan fundamentals will still be in the backseat to geopolitics content is for general information

more comparable year over year in the three months ended march 31 2019 the company recognized earnings before income taxes on a standalone basis of 23 7 million a decrease of 5 8 million from the prior year due to increased interest expense of 1 5 million and a one time net gain on acquisition of dream alternatives in the comparative period of 12 6 million this was partially offset by fair value gains on financial instruments as a result of an increase in the unit price of dream global reit relative to the prior year adjusted ebitda is calculated on a standalone basis using earnings for the period adjusted for interest and income tax expense depreciation and amortization fair value changes and the net distribution component of income from the company s investment in dream office reit it is an important measure for the company as it eliminates the impact of significant non cash items from earnings adjusted ebitda for the three months ended march 31 2019 was 21 4 million an increase of 6 5 million relative to the prior year primarily due to increased contribution from our asset management segment improved net operating income from arapahoe basin our ski area in colorado and

reflect how we view and manage our business our operating results have been defined as follows asset management and investments in the dream publicly listed funds asset management includes managing

publicly listed funds in the three months ended march 31 2019 the asset management division generated net margin of 8 7 million compared to 7 1 million in the comparative period the increase in net

reit was 5 2 million compared to 6 0 million in the comparative period dream office reit s net income was generated from net rental income and dream office reit s share of income from the investment in dream industrial reit which was offset by interest expense fair value adjustments to financial instruments and general and administrative expenses for the three months ended march 31 2019 comparative properties net operating income noi increased by 7 6 over the prior year mainly driven by higher occupancy and rental rates in downtown toronto partially offset by lower occupancy and rental rates in other markets in the current period the company s investment in dream office reit generated cash distributions of 3 6 million subsequent to the quarter dream and dream office reit

the comparative period driven by a 1 2 million increase in noi from the recently expanded arapahoe basin this was partially offset by the impact of the expropriation of a 73 acre property in toronto

sales and 14 housing occupancies march 31 2018 14 4 million of revenue and negative net margin of 2 9 million with 40 lot sales and 41 housing occupancies the decrease in revenue relative to the comparative period was driven by lower volumes achieved in 2019 consistent with management s expectations we have been proactive to address economic slowdowns in western canada and have right sized

the us publicly declared the week before that the us would keep tariffs on even after an agreement this violated the understanding that both sides would remove the new tariffs once an agreement was reached 100 billion china on us 250 billion us on china trump threatened tariffs on the remaining 300 billion of china imports the us signaled that china would have to not only stop technology transfer from us corporations doing business in china but that china would have to share its tech development with the us if it wanted an agreement that included the military sensitive nextgen technologies like 5g ai and cybersecurity the us demanded that china stop subsidizing its state owned enterprises soes with low interest rate loans that put us multinational corporations in an uncompetitive position in china even as the us continued to subsidize via tax cuts trade credits etc even as the us continued to subsidize via tax cuts trade credits etc the us indicated it would continue its global efforts to prevent us allies from doing business with china tech companies like huawai zte china mobile etc regardless if an agreement was reached this past week the us and china failed to reach agreement on a new trade deal despite high level china representative lie he meeting in washington on thursday friday may 9 10 in the wake of the meeting trump and his administration mouthpieces attempt to put a positive spin on the collapsed talks while placing blame on china for the break up the spin at first was that china had reneged on a prior agreement and changed its terms when they arrived in washington china had caused the breakdown not the us the stock markets swooned trump quickly jumped in and said he got a nice letter from china president xi and that it wasn t all that bad but make no mistake a trade negotiations rubicon has been reached so who s actually responsible for last week s trade breakdown to listen to trump and his neocons running the us foreign and trade policy show now it was the chinese they changed the agreement at the last minute but who really did the changes who set off the process and how if the chinese backtracked on some terms of the deal it was clearly in response to the trump neocon trade team initiating the backtracking here s what the trump team did if one wanted to scuttle negotiations at the last minute this was certainly a way to do it and as this writer has been saying for the past year scuttling is just what the neocon china hard liners driving the us negotiations have wanted all along and they are willing to forego china s significant concessions already made to the us in negotiations on us company access to china markets if they can t also stop china s technology development especially in the key nextgen technologies of ai cybersecurity and 5g these are not only the new industries of the next decade they are also the new technologies with major military implications from the very beginning of negotiations with china back in march 2018 the tech issue was central neocon china hard liner and head of the us negotiation team robert lighthizer issued way back in august 2017 a warning report that china s 2025 plan aimed at surpassing the us in these three tech areas that report promised to show that china was in fact stealing us technology from us companies in those areas lighthizer s march 2018 subsequent report then allegedly proved it the us china trade war was then launched that month at first it was led by treasury secretary steve mnuchin he led a team to beijing and came back indicating a deal was reached with china as part of the deal it was later revealed publicly china had agreed to allow us banks and businesses a 51 or more ownership of joint venture companies in china this was the us bankers main demand china also indicated revealed later that it would purchase 1 trillion more of new farm natural gas and manufacturing goods from the us over the next five years so much for the goods trade deficit imbalance and issue both concessions were major wins for mnuchin and the us but china refused apparently to budge on the major issue of nextgen tech it suggested concessions but failing a final agreement would not agree to us demands before hand or up front over the summer in 2018 the neocon faction reasserted control over the us trade negotiating team mnuchin s firing of anti china neocon peter navarro was reversed and lighthizer put him back on the team in the area of trade they have clearly convinced trump that a more aggressive stance on trade negotiations will eventually produce a bigger win for the us the north koreans offered to dismantle a number of sites if the us removed an equal number of sanctions but the neocons refused saying all the sites must be dismantled before the us would even consider lifting any sanctions at all that s a non starter in negotiations with anyone if effect it says capitulate and then we ll think about lifting sanctions the neocon anti china hardliners lighthizer navarro and bolton don t want an agreement with china there has been in fighting on the trade team from the beginning the neocon faction has been contending with the us bankers big business faction that want the 51 and the deeper control in china china has already conceded that and in fact has begun implementing it the farm manufacturing natural gas faction wants more purchases of their products china has already agreed on that as well but since last mid 2018 the neocon faction has trump s ear and they are driving the policy that s why the us moved the goalposts the week before the china delegation was to come to washington last week to finalize a deal they announced or leaked all the backtracking us terms well before the china team was to come the retaining of us tariffs despite an agreement the required sharing of tech regardless of limits on tech transfer in china the demands that china stop subsidizing its soes even as the us would continue subsidizing us corporations via massive tax cuts export import bank and direct payments from the us government and so on china s reply was to send its vice chairman and head of its negotiating team liu he to washington last week nevertheless their reply was they would respond in kind to us tariffs with more tariffs of their own and that china would not capitulate on matters of principle read technology development and its 2025 plan so where does it go from here is this a bona fide breakdown or just a hiatus with both sides posturing to look tough trump advisor larry kudlow trotted out on national syndicated talk shows on sunday may 12 and admitted that trump and china president xi would not meet until june at the next g20 meeting maybe no doubt some discussions will continue next in beijing in the interim but it is now far less likely a deal will be made this year but that s what the us necons prefer short of china capitulation the neocons have apparently convinced trump a deeper trade war with china would be good politics domestically the us economy is showing signs of slowing in key areas of business investment and household consumption the trade war with china has produced a sharp decline of imports from china lower imports translates into higher net exports a category in us gdp calculations that raises gdp so less imports from tariffs means higher gdp that could offset some of the slowing us economy in 2019 20 the neocons believe china s economy is also slowing and that its stock market is fragile china cannot conduct a deeper trade war over tariffs with the us it will eventually capitulate and agree to us demands including tech they no doubt argue and trump buys it the negatives include a sharp rise in us consumer inflation as the higher tariffs on china imports get passed on in the us economy that will reduce an already fragile us consumer spending and us business investing as costs rise for both both business and consumer confidence are poised for a major contraction and the trade war may just be enough to tip the balance and rising inflation may force a new conflict with the central bank the fed as it raises interest rates again to fund an even larger us budget deficit and debt caused by the economic slowdown but if the worse economically happens the neocons no doubt are whispering in trump s ear that he can then blame the us stock market collapse and economic recession coming on the chinese as well as on the democrats he can resurrect his extreme economic nationalism appeals of 2016 to his base once again claiming it s the foreigners and the socialists e g everyone proposing a reversal of his war spending tax cuts for the rich cuts to education and social programs etc these are indeed dangerous times for the us economically and politically as even democrat party leaders are now saying a bona fide constitutional crisis is brewing in the us as trump insists on governing for his 35 supporters and to hell with the rest of the country and as he governs increasingly at the expense of congress s constitutional rights it is also a dangerous time for the us economy and the global economy as well dr rasmus is author of the forthcoming the scourge of neoliberalism us policy from reagan to trump clarity press september 2019 and the just published alexander hamilton and the

everything to know about the april 8 eclipse in atlantic canada saltwire eclipse saltwire by aftab ahmed new delhi reuters india s slowing economy will need a boost soon after the current election but budget stresses mean new delhi probably has to rely on the central bank to provide it through more interest rate cuts according to two senior finance ministry officials the government lacks the ability to hike already planned spending to spur growth they said as revenue in the year ending march 2020 is likely to be below target while borrowing will rise mainly for a new farm support scheme related stories right now the government is not thinking of any stimulus i do not think we can afford it as any package would ultimately lead to higher borrowing one of the ministry officials who insisted on anonymity told reuters the government has a fiscal deficit target of 3 4 of gross domestic product for 2019 20 the finance ministry did not respond to a request for comment a limited impact while the reserve bank of india rbi is likely to be open to more policy easing provided inflation does not surge their impact on economic activity may be limited given debts burdening india s state banking sector two rate cuts this year have barely reduced loan and deposit rates the finance ministry official said the rbi needs to provide additional liquidity to ensure rate cuts pass to bank customers the central bank has injected 13 billion into the system in the past two months through open market operations and forex swaps but the officials expect more the second official said the ministry is working on a plan to infuse capital into state run banks in exchange for equity state run banks have asked for a 500 billion rupees 7 12 billion fund infusion in 2019 20 sources said economic growth which hit a five quarter low of 6 6 in october december appears to be slowing march industrial output contracted for the first time in nearly two years surveys show a slackening in manufacturing and services growth while car and motorbike sales have tumbled the slip in growth comes at a time many economists are questioning the quality of official data and suggesting past levels have been overstated graphic india s economic growth slows down the trade war between the united states and china has sparked worries about a weakening in the global economy new delhi officials are concerned that low cost chinese goods which can t find a home in the united states might be dumped in india indian economists agree that the next administration whether again led by prime minister narendra modi and his bharatiya janata party bjp or by its opponents will urgently seek to lift growth the 39 day indian general election ends on may 19 with counting of votes on may 23 the central bank has cut its benchmark repo rate by 50 basis points this year to 6 0 the two finance ministry officials said the government expects at least another 50 bps cut by august the next rbi policy meeting is june 6 gopal krishna agarwal bjp s economic affairs spokesman said the government needs to focus on lowering of interest rates higher spending and asset creation so that demand is created the party proposes spending 100 trillion rupees over five years to build roads railways ports and rural infrastructure indian media this week quoted a senior official as saying the corporate affairs ministry is working on a plan to waive debt of very small businesses and individuals with annual earnings below 60 000 rupees or about 850 that could cost as much as 200 billion rupees but finance ministry officials say any such plan would have to be funded by budget cuts elsewhere and is unlikely to start in the current fiscal year focus on stability the congress party has pledged to give 72 000 rupees to each of india s poorest families but this won t be immediately implemented should it form the government due to concerns this will make the fiscal deficit balloon the immediate focus has to be the macro economic stability p chidambaram former finance minister and a senior congress leader told reuters it s only when the growth process starts we can find the revenues for implementing all this in the 2019 20 budget the government expanded its borrowing program by 1 4 trillion rupees to more than 7 trillion rupees the government expects to fall short of its 2019 20 indirect tax target of 13 8 trillion rupees 20 above last year making it harder to meet its revenue target also there could be losses from state run banks and other companies such as air india which might need further government support in 2019 20 fiscal deficit is expected to be much higher than the budget target predicted former rbi governor bimal jalan 1 70 2360 indian rupees additional reporting by devjyot ghoshal editing by martin howell and richard borsuk
companies traded on us markets lost 700 million in value on may 13 deutsche bank analysts immediately cried â investors should prepare for extended period of economic warfare â really just because some american companies were smart enough to take advantage of lax us trade policy in the past and transferred a lot of their manufacturing capability to china are now going to have to pay the piper they collectively made hundreds of billions in additional revenue during all those years perhaps to the advantage of some us consumers but also to the detriment of many american workers the extra â taxâ effectively imposed if tariffs remain in place on us companies that still want to manufacture then import from china doesnâ t even equal the windfall corporations received via the most recent stimulative us tax cuts it was never worth risking the loss of an egalitarian and transparent society as many workers lost their jobs so a few better off could get bargains on their various gadgets i like many of the products from many of these companies however i feel even more strongly that my dollars should not go to the construction of chinaâ s sixth generation fighter jet it was simply time to level the playing field now if the elitist rulers of the masses in china are willing to stop stealing technology patented products copyrighted material and other intellectual property we can welcome them as a trading partner if not the peopleâ s republic needs the us consumer far more than the us consumer needs them it s understandable that an insular autocracy would believe its own press releases it s insane that any intelligent investor would do so as you read on i will show you what desperate straits china is really in unless they change and play nice this could be the peopleâ s republicâ s zenith moment understanding that in translation x means y there are 1 4 billion people living in what is today the peopleâ s republic of china prc xi jinping has taken the â chineseâ description further however and declared sovereignty over the independent nation of taiwan and its 24 million citizens as well as the 60 million overseas chinese in every other nation in the world demanding fealty from them as well since i donâ t share xi jinpingâ s definition to include chinese singaporeans chinese australians chinese americans et al as owing complete loyalty to the prc but as citizens of other nations who take well deserved pride in being the progeny of a great world culture i also will point out that the leaders of the prc are not taking â the chinese path to democracyâ as they claim but are instead merely the latest incarnation of the â dictatorship of the proletariat â there s one real political party in the prc â the chinese communist party ccp there are eight other parties but they all belong to the same united front and all vote precisely along ccp lines if you are not a member of the ccp you are not one of the anointed the intelligence communities of the united states and its fair market allies understand this particular doublespeak well briefed i believe the us negotiators in the current trade dispute understand these distinctions as well that s why i believe the us will be successful in curbing the prcâ s numerous transgressions against free markets it may be a long time coming but to obsess over this is just plain stupid this is a dispute over fair play not â tradeâ nations will always trade with each other they will only seldom and transiently reach pure parity but canada doesnâ t grow a whole lot of mangoes and hawaii doesnâ t have native oil and gas so the process of fair and open trade works from the smallest example to the most massive the problem as i see it with the prc and its ccp leadership is that they have no intention of playing fair nations that trade with the prc must understand they are subject to theft of their patented inventions or copyrighted material and that once they have been bled dry of all proprietary knowledge with their allegedly independent joint partners they will have made a few extra bucks for a short period of time but their usefulness will have ended their success in that nation is over and they will be usurped by a prc company most often an soe â state owned enterprise which will then compete on price with them until in many cases they are no more that would seem a dire prediction if it hadnâ t already played out in just this manner so many times already at a more macro level the prc strategy has not been that different from the one bram stoker the author of the book he called the undead later changed to dracula cooked up over a century ago you will recall that count dracula never drank the blood of his victims all at once he visited at night and left two little marks so small that the patientsâ doctors were befuddled as to the cause of their fatigue and listlessness only too late for the victim was the horrible truth understood the united states or any other country looking for a fair deal from the peopleâ s republic like the scores suckered by the belt road initiative will discover to update sen everett dirksen that â a hundred billion deficit this quarter and another and another pretty soon youâ re talking real money â better to upset the applecart of global trade in a dramatic way right now than continue to be sucked dry any longer i would rather see the chinese people able to reform the ccpâ s way of doing business for their own sake as well as the rest of the worldâ s sake why do i say this because the peopleâ s republic has massive problems which are known to them but swept under the rug by their repressive masters these autocrats believe they must continue their current bluff or the countryâ s massive problems will become obvious to everyone without change the ccp prc will fall of its own weight most analysts see this economic adversary as 10 feet tall they also are guilty of the linear thinking that because the peopleâ s republic has made such strides in the last 30 years it will continue to proceed at the same rate of climb in the next 30 nonsense the problems of the mainland are many and monstrous here are just a few condensed from a longer report i wrote for a think tank demographics after mao devastated the agricultural base that grew the nationâ s food by forcing the farmers into steel making collectives the great famine took the lives of some 45 million men women and children then began the 10 years of the cultural revolution in which many or most of the best and the brightest in the land were sent to be â reformed through labor â salvation came in the form of realpolitik in 1971 first kissinger then nixon began direct negotiations to help china why because if they had not then the soviet union would have stepped in and come away far more powerful with nearly unlimited human resources beholden to them the idea was to split china away from the soviets talk nice provide assistance and keep them from forming a united front it worked be careful what you wish for you may get it the next hit seemed to make sense at the time too many mouths to feed stop the growth in the number of mouths hence the one child policy which prevailed from 1979 to 2015 for 30 of these years families were allowed a second child if the first was a girl the result of this policy and the ensuing infanticide of many baby girls is that today there are 52 men for every 48 women i expect to see a diaspora of males for at least the next 20 years worse the mainlanders are growing old â within 30 years 330 million or more will be 65 or older usually without the benefit of social welfare protection as they ask â who will take care of me in my old age â when healthcare is most needed they now realize that a young chinese man and woman with two children of their own will likely have four parents to provide for that would be two incomes for eight people heaven forbid if any grandparents are still alive that would mean as many as 16 people depending on the income of two workers source united nations department of economic and social affairs you will notice in the un chart above that chinaâ s growth is reaching its zenith now and will likely begin a steady decline within the next five years as the country ages beyond the fertile years of their lives homogeneity the ccp leadership wants obedient foot soldiers not free thinkers this is the hallmark of all tyrannical police states though few have carried it so far in surveillance and recording the activities of an entire nation the â social creditâ score all citizens now have is based on many things if you smoke you will likely create more healthcare expense so that gets you downgraded for consideration for a promotion for instance if you are a han chinese 92 of the population you get an upgrade for not being say a tibetan immigrants from anywhere else who could provide youthful energy to support those 330 million chinese without enough income to live on are not welcomed for all the slings and arrows directed at the us the united states has 44 7 million first generation immigrants living there and in 2016 welcomed more than a million of these even japan notorious for keeping its culture homogenic allows about 10 000 immigrants per year according to the latest prc census there are 1 500 immigrants registered in the entire country not 1 500 per year â 1 500 some of those may be the â illegalâ wives that frustrated chinese men married mostly from southeast asia and brought home they are the regime has dictated â dilutiveâ to the nation debt if you are in awe of chinaâ s ability to finance everything from russian lng plants in the arctic to entire ports in djibouti and pakistan hold your applause thanks to the united statesâ sponsorship of the peopleâ s republic into the world trade organization the prc has access to lending from the world bank and many other sources but like a teenager with a credit card here s the result at first glance at this chart you might think â well at least the government and the banks are judicious in not taking on too much debt â you would be wrong unlike in the us australia europe and other places where the government is a different animal than private enterprise most of the debt compiled by â corporationsâ in the above chart are from the state owned companies lumbering and indebted they may be but they are also the way the elites get most of their billions in the peopleâ s republic those of us who view the united statesâ total debt are alarmed and disgusted that it is now above 100 of our gdp in china it s approaching 300 when this bubble bursts no one knows what the consequences will be we just know they wonâ t be pretty the system itself the prcâ s big problem is that it must remain the cheapest labor provider or the most efficient producer education and opportunity may not be equally distributed around the world but intelligence and street smarts are distributed equally the ruling elite is now discovering this there are other regions with people just as smart willing to work for less than chinaâ s now more demanding home population the peopleâ s republic is no more communist than the soviet union was in both cases a noble ideology simply masked a totalitarian police state but todayâ s china is no capitalist nation either no matter how tortured the headlines about chinaâ s â versionâ of capitalist i would best describe the current political system in china as plutocratic mercantilism it s plutocratic or kleptocratic in that everyone who can is chasing the money and squirreling it away offshore if they can but it s also mercantilist if a very big if china can grow its own consumer base at home it may be able to become less of a mercantilist nation but so many of the ccpâ s policies work at cross purposes for instance the country needs consumers at home so they donâ t have to depend on selling to others but they are racing headlong into artificial intelligence and robotics so they donâ t need pesky human workers they really canâ t have it both ways until then bri or obor â one belt one road if you prefer is not some saintly way to bring peace and love to the whole world it s the only way to ensure the supply chain is strong if your current reality is to take in raw materials and via cheap abundant labor turn those raw materials into something else that other nations will pay for a rather oversimplified view of mercantilism you cannot ever allow your supply chain to be disrupted viewed this way one could argue the seeming lunacy of aggressively placing its military on every strategic reef or island within another nationâ s exclusive economic zone is a defensive rather than offensive move and as any military strategist will tell you it does nothing for them in the event of a war in the military we call such places â stationary day 1 targets â finally a central statist autocracy is â efficientâ but not always effective it likes to see things done the same way in all places that makes it inflexible the hurly burly of entrepreneurialism is most unsettling to such a government in addition the system is easily gamed you want to shoot for 6 2 growth this year amazingly each village that rolls up all the way to the provincial level comes in at 6 16 6 23 etc no one within china or without really knows what the real numbers are as they say in the hinterlands the mountains are high and beijing is far away the leadership itself the combination of intellectual property and technology theft forcing recipient nations of prc largesse to use prc managers and sometimes laborers as a condition of loans forcing â partnersâ to divulge proprietary information and grandiose statements like calling the bri â a community of common destinyâ as xi recently did create significant resentment and animosity among other nations and cultures the prc leaders may be able to fool starved for real information chinese at home with calling russiaâ s northern route â the arctic silk road a partnership between china and russia â or claiming to be a â near polar state â but others donâ t fall for either the flowery phrases or the high handedness further evidence of this dawning realization on the part of many erstwhile partner nations abounds the prc decided to blast the pakistan china economic corridor through lands disputed by pakistan and india they were on the pakistan side of the always contested line of control but still â for people who like to think of themselves as terribly clever and cunning how tone deaf could this have been or when the philippines took china to the world court over its military buildup on scarborough shoal and both parties agreed to abide by the courtâ s ruling when it came down in favor of the philippines the prc simply sent additional warships to take the shoals by force tone deaf of course the us showed itself to be an unreliable ally back then an attack on even this piece of rock 222 miles from manila legally triggered the mutual defense treaty between the us and the philippines the us did nothing that was then the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago the next best time is now today the new reality of the bri and prc â assistanceâ is increasingly seen as hegemony and blackmail by many as a result chinese firms have now been disinvited from previous areas where the prc rulers thought they had deals sewn up in malaysia pakistan the maldives sri lanka burma myanmar and many african nations what are the investment implications you already are most likely an investor in china whether you want to be or not if you look at any emerging market fund unless its charter specifically says â ex china â china will be anywhere between 20 and 60 of an emerging markets fund or etf that s where the performance has been so that s where the portfolio managers invest if it s an em index fund that is where the valuations are high so again that is where the fundsâ funds go but you say you donâ t own any em funds do you have a pension or 401k at work if so i guarantee that the pension fund managers or advisors selected for the 401k are invested in china even if you have none of these china mainland shares are now part of the msci indexes almost every single endowment pension fund or administered 401k invests in these global indexes i need to re emphasize that tariffs are not directly assessed on an adversary nation they are assessed on the products coming in from that nation by making it more expensive for us manufacturers to have items built in china then shipped to the us those manufacturers must either raise their prices find a place like china was when labor was cheap pretty easy to do these days accept lower earnings or bring the jobs back to the us â where it will likely cost more in labor costs which matters most to the citizens of the united states â whether apple aapl a favorite of mine loses some sales or is forced to relocate some manufacturing or whether the prc can continue to steamroll its neighbors and us allies in the region into compromise and compliance which matters most to the citizens of the united states â whether qualcomm qcom another favorite of mine will continue to allow its technology to be stolen in the name of profitability or whether the prc has us consumer dollars to continue its headlong rush to develop its next aircraft carrier i answer this with my portfolio decisions you may have a different take but the big investment implications for me are that i own no chinese mainland stocks unless i buy an em etf in the future and even then i will seek a no or very low percentage of mainland holdings i own no money center us or european banks this is not only because these banks will be the ones most likely to lend to prc state owned enterprises but because long experience has shown me that these banks always will find a way to shoot themselves in the foot or more likely the head they will lend to argentina or to subprime borrowers or to russia then come running to the us government or their european government claiming no one could have seen x or y or z coming my governmentâ s only money comes from tax revenue so i figure i m already supporting enough of these dodos with my taxes no need to buy more i would however be a buyer of the companies most likely to fall temporarily as investors panic even if tariffs mean less employment by these us blue chips in mainland china it will and higher costs for these firms it will apple qualcomm corning glw albemarle alb and 3m mmm all come to mind all are highly adaptable firms that i m certain after a bit of hunting will find new and less onerous partner nations to relocate to as the song says â i got along without you before i met you gonna get along without you now â the panic pendulum always swings too far just like the exuberance pendulum when that happens these will be among the first to
