businesses are showing more visible signs of pain from the trade war as recent data on producer prices and exports revealed monday s gdp data no matter how well massaged could show quarterly growth at its weakest in three decades and raise doubts over a government aim to keep 2019 growth in the 6 6 5 range beijing s monetary and fiscal stimulus has hitherto been a fraction of what it was during the 2015 downturn the government is clearly wary of encouraging another property bubble and reckless rise in investment both of which were targeted during the 2017 campaign to cut leverage but with worsening economic headlines falling corporate investment and a looming fed rate cut the people s bank of china cannot merely be operating behind the scenes through local government spending and liquid money markets many expect that a bold symbolic statement about beijing s policy easing intent is needed most certainly if the fed also cuts at the end of july even though that may just involve the customary token 10 basis point cut in china s benchmark one year 4 35 policy rate 3 tariff heat picks up on europe too just when you thought there may be a glimmer of hope on world trade as talks between beijing and washington resume raising the possibility that the world s top two economies could clinch a deal the tariff heat switches to europe on thursday french lawmakers approved a tax on big tech companies potentially opening up a new front in a trade row between washington and the european union president trump has ordered an investigation into the french tech tax plans a probe that could lead to the u s imposing new tariffs or other trade restrictions and there s already lots of shuttle diplomacy going on german economy minister peter altmaier after meetings in washington on thursday predicted a 50 50 chance of averting u s auto tariffs and that it will take weeks or months to resolve at least some of the thorny trade disputes clouding u s european relations never mind all the differences over issues such as aircraft subsidies car imports and the russian led nord stream 2 gas pipeline meanwhile u s trade rep robert lighthizer and treasury secretary mnuchin are beijing bound in the very near future markets worried over the impact of trade wars on the health of the global economy will be watching closely for progress and deterioration on all those trade war fronts in days to come 4 a july 17 18 meeting of g7 finance ministers commemorating 75 years of bretton woods in july 1944 as world war two raged finance chiefs from the world s main trading nations met in bretton woods new hampshire that agreement signed july 22 was one of the first global monetary policy and currency agreements re establishing a gold standard for exchange rates backing away from competitive devaluations and setting up the international monetary fund to bridge balance of payments gaps but as the bretton woods pact turns 75 that spirit of cooperation whether on exchange rates or trade is waning trade protectionism is on the rise and nationalism and unilateralism is being championed by trump who says the rest of the world is stealing from the united states via competitive currency devaluations against the dollar and so the july 17 18 meeting of g7 finance ministers and central bankers in the french town of chantilly could well be a fraught one taking place at the same time as imf and world bank heads join ecb officials in paris to commemorate bretton woods g7 discussions will focus less on the past and more on how to resolve pressing problems such as the world economy sino u s trade tensions fair exchange rates between the major economies u s anger over france s plan to tax tech firms such as google and trump s threat to slap levies on european autos other issues on the table include tax havens cyber security and facebook s proposed new coin libra that has enlivened the debate about regulation of cryptocurrencies 5 the u k pound gets battered and battered losing support from monetary policy expectations the already battered pound faces a tough week ahead key economic data such as earnings growth inflation and retail sales will be closely watched by markets desperately trying to gauge where interest rates might be in a couple of years from now markets have nearly priced in a bank of england rate cut over the next 12 months after governor mark carney signaled he could be about to join other central banks in cutting rates economists expect year on year inflation for june to come in at 2 on wednesday but if the reading falls below the central bank s 2 target rate chances of a rate cut may rise however other data is expected to come in a touch stronger average weekly earnings are expected to rise on tuesday by 3 2 year on year in the three months to may versus a 3 1 increase in april retail sales due out on thursday are expected have risen by 2 5 year on year in june after a 2 3 increase in may brexit of course

capital flows to emerging markets ems has resumed since the first quarter q1 of 2019 11 months after its outflow from these markets the central bank of egypt cbe announced in its monetary policy report the direction of capital flows depends on the outlook for economic growth and the development of global trade tensions the cbe said it added that the international bond yields have continued to decline since the beginning of the year in line with the lower risk margin in ems meanwhile the cbe referred to the ongoing recovery of the gdp growth supported by structural reforms pointing out that the rise in net exports was supported by the growth of real gdp during q4 of 2018 according to the report the contribution of local bank financing to the state s fiscal deficit declined during q1 of 2019 on another note the cbe said since may 2018 household savers have tended to invest more in conventional saving forms such as deposits in banks operating in the egyptian market for three years and more it indicated a decrease in the rate of deposit interest to 12 and a stability on loans at 17 7 in march 2019 the cbe expected the international food commodity prices to rise in 2020 and that the cost of most petroleum products will be covered in addition to the fact that the automatic pricing mechanism will be applied locally according to cost developments the report highlighted that economic growth of egypt s external environment continued to soften during q4 of 2018 registering 2 5 down from 2 7 in q3 and from 3 2 in q4 of 2017 the highest pace since 2011 economic growth in advanced economies continued to ease for the fourth consecutive quarter to register 1 4 in q4 of 2018 compared to 1 8 in q3 of 2018 as slower growth in the euro area and the united kingdom more than offset a stronger growth in japan meanwhile economic growth in the united states remained unchanged in q4 of 2018 compared to the previous quarter on the other hand economic growth in emerging economies stabilised in q4 of 2018 at 4 9 after maintaining continuous improvement between q4 of 2015 and q2 of 2018 higher growth in russia offset slower growth in china india and brazil compared to the previous quarter the report read it noted that headline inflation of egypt s external environment continued to decline in january and february 2019 registering an average of 1 9 compared to 2 3 in q4 of 2018 inflation in advanced economies declined in january and february 2019 registering an average of 1 5 down from 2 0 in q4 of 2018 meanwhile the cbe added that inflation in emerging economies stabilised in january and february 2019 registering an average of 2 9 after accelerating to 3 0 in q3 of 2018 the deceleration of the inflation rate in china brazil and india offset the acceleration of the inflation in russia compared to the previous quarter it noted global trade growth declines for 5th consecutive quarter moreover the report stressed that annual global trade growth continued to decline for the fifth consecutive quarter q4 of 2018 to register 1 4 compared to 3 6 in q3 of 2018 and down from a peak of 5 3 in q3 of 2017 it explained that brent crude oil prices increased for the third consecutive month in march 2019 registering an average of 66 1 per barrel compared to an average of 57 4 per barrel in december 2018 opec and its partners continued production cuts until june 2019 while production from the us continued to increase international food prices using the domestic consumer price index cpi basket weights of core food items continued to decline on annual terms in march 2019 for the ninth consecutive month however by a weaker magnitude since december 2018 the decline was mainly due to red meat dairy products and oils as supply conditions improved the report added that the federal reserve system kept its policy rate unchanged in january and march 2019 after raising it by 25 basis points bps in december 2018 marking the fourth policy rate hike in 2018 moreover the federal reserve decided to slow the pace of its balance sheet unwinding plan which started in october 2017 by slowing down the reduction of its holding of government debt starting may 2019 before ending the programme in september 2019 meanwhile the european central bank also kept its policy rate unchanged in january and march 2019 while it decided to launch a new series of quarterly targeted longer term refinancing operations with a maturity of two years between september 2019 and march 2021 each furthermore the bank of england kept its policy rate unchanged in february and march 2019 after raising it by 25 bps in august 2018 for the second time since november 2017 the report read the cbe added that capital flows returned to ems in q1 of 2019 after 11 months of outflows that started in february 2018 the return of international capital to ems was mainly supported by a monetary policy normalisation pause in advanced economies however the direction of capital flows remains subject to the economic activity growth outlook as well as the prospects of further escalation of trade tensions elsewhere the cbe explained that the hydrocarbon trade balance registered a surplus for the first time since q4 of 2013 while the current account deficit widened after improving on annual terms for seven consecutive quarters between q4 of 2016 and q2 of 2018 the current account deficit widened in q4 of 2018 a less favourable contribution from remittances net service receipts and the non hydrocarbon trade deficit has more than offset the more favourable contribution from the hydrocarbon surplus and net investment income the report read nevertheless the deficit of net exports of goods and services continued to narrow in q4 of 2018 on annual terms for the eighth consecutive quarter this was due to a more favourable contribution from imports of goods and services mainly those related to the hydrocarbon sector which more than offset the less favourable contribution from exports the cbe explained that the hydrocarbon trade balance continued to improve on annual terms for the fourth consecutive quarter to register a surplus in q4 of 2018 for the first time since q4 of 2013 the improvement was mainly driven by lower imports which coincided with the accelerating annual pace of domestic natural gas production furthermore the non hydrocarbon trade deficit continued to widen on annual terms in q4 of 2018 for the fifth consecutive quarter this was mainly due to a less favourable contribution from imports which more than offset the more favourable contribution from exports the report noted that the service surplus continued to increase in q4 of 2018 on annual terms for the eighth consecutive quarter yet its pace of growth declined to the lowest level since q1 of 2017 the slower annual pace was mainly due to a less favourable contribution from net receipts from tourism as well as other services which more than offset a more favourable contribution from transportation excluding government services and suez canal tolls meanwhile remittances declined on annual terms in q4 of 2018 for the first time since q2 of 2016 net foreign direct investment fdi inflows resumed its annual decline in q4 of 2018 for the second consecutive quarter due to higher gross outflows after witnessing an annual increase in q2 of 2018 for the first quarter since q2 of 2017 portfolio flows excluding eurobonds continued to register a net outflow in q4 of 2018 for the third consecutive quarter amid unfavourable global conditions for emerging markets though at a slower pace compared with the previous two quarters this however was mostly offset by net inflows from commercial banks net foreign assets meanwhile gross international reserves stabilised in april 2019 for the second consecutive month at 44 2bn after increasing in february 2019 supported by the issuance of eurobonds by the ministry of finance the report read real gdp growth rose to 5 5 in q4 of 2018 the report highlights that real gdp growth rose to 5 5 in q4 of 2018 from 5 3 in q3 while unemployment rate dropped to its lowest rate since 2010 it explained that higher net external demand for egyptian goods and services reinforced a more balanced expenditure structure and supported the rebound of economic growth since the fiscal year fy 2017 18 meanwhile the contribution of domestic demand to gdp growth remained contained and the unemployment rate dropped to 8 9 in december 2018 the lowest rate since december 2010 the cbe added that the recent improvement in the contribution of net exports was mainly driven by the continued drop in real imports while the growth of real exports was slightly strengthened after four feeble consecutive quarters on the other hand the contribution of private domestic demand to gdp growth weakened due to the drop in the contribution of private consumption and investments meanwhile public domestic demand stabilised during the same period as the slight rebound of public consumption contribution was offset by the slight drop in the contribution of public investments it explained that at the sectoral level growth stabilised compared to the previous quarter as the boost in the contribution of public sector to gdp growth was offset by the weakness in the private sector the increased contribution of the public sector to the gdp was primarily due to the rising contribution of natural gas extractions while that of other sectors remained stable the contribution of the private sector to the gdp growth dropped due to weaker growth in the tourism sector which more than offset the improvement in the construction sector in addition available leading indicators for the non hydrocarbon sector mostly point to weakening activity in q1 of 2019 the purchasing managers index pmi average level in q1 of 2019 weakened compared to q4 of 2018 despite improving in march 2019 and the manufacturing index continued to contract in january 2019 albeit by a slightly lesser degree compared to q4 of 2018 furthermore the number of tourist nights contracted on annual terms in january 2019 for the first time since november 2016 and total car sales grew on average at a slower pace in january and february 2019 compared to the average pace registered in q4 of 2018 on the other hand suez canal net tonnage grew on annual terms at a slightly higher pace in january and february 2019 on average compared to q4 of 2018 in the hydrocarbon sector natural gas production continued to increase strongly on annual terms yet at slower pace during january 2019 compared to the average pace in q4 of 2018 broad money growth continues to decline supported by fiscal consolidation following the fading of the exchange rate revaluation effect in q4 of 2017 annual m2 growth continued to decline to an average of 11 6 in q1 of 2019 supported by fiscal consolidation and the containment of other broad money counterpart assets growth in q1 of 2019 the negative annual contribution of foreign nonbank financing of the fiscal budget deficit eased in line with the monetary policy normalisation pause in advanced economies this was more than offset by the decreased contribution of bank financing of the fiscal deficit in addition to the expected drop in contribution of external financing compared to q4 of 2018 according to the cbe other components of counterpart assets m2 claims on the private sector which slightly picked up the decline in m2 growth favourably coincided with an annual increase in broad money velocity which suggests lower room for noninflationary money growth meanwhile following its decline between q2 of 2017 and q1 of 2018 the contribution of claims on the private sector to m2 growth continued to pick up in q1 of 2019 similarly inflation adjusted l c claims on the private sector continued to witness annual increases since q1 of 2018 after recording annual contractions in 2017 the recovery was especially evident for claims on the private business sector while claims on the household sector recovered by a relatively weaker magnitude within the components of m2 cic as a percent of l c deposits in m2 continued to decline in q1 of 2019 for the third consecutive quarter recording a ratio below its long term historical average which suggests lessening currency holding behaviour meanwhile the annual growth of f c deposits in us dollar as well as the dollarisation ratio defined as f c deposits to total deposits in m2 broadly stabilised during q1of 2019 moreover the structure of household deposits in l c continued to be dominated by deposits for more than three years since may 2018 following one and a half years of dominance by deposits less than three years amid the introduction of 1 5 year saving certificates at a higher rate compared to longer term saving certificate rates the reversal of the structure of household deposits is consistent with redemptions of these certificates since may 2018 given their cancellation by public banks in late april 2018 the report revealed that annual growth of m0 adjusted by total excess liquidity continued to decline in q1 of 2019 for the sixth consecutive quarter due to cbe balance sheet operations which lowered excess liquidity growth the money multiplier measured as the ratio between local currency components of broad money and m0 as defined above increased slightly in q1 of 2019 following its broad stability between q4 of 2017 and q4 of 2018 this was mainly due to lower excess liquidity as a ratio of l c deposits in m2 the cbe said in another context the cbe noted that real monetary conditions remained tight backed by receding inflationary pressures as well as previous policy rate increases notwithstanding the cumulative 300 bps policy rate cuts in q1 of 2018 and q1 of 2019 after declining between december 2018 and mid february 2019 excess liquidity rose between mid february and mid march 2019 before stabilising to record an average of egp 734 5bn 13 8 of the gdp during the maintenance period ending of 8 april 2019 compared to egp 665 4bn 12 5 of the gdp recorded on average during the maintenance period ending 11 february 2019 meanwhile interbank activity remained relatively stable since april 2018 with interbank rates remaining below the policy rate by around 30 bps as higher long term absorption tenors offset the effect of higher short term absorption of excess liquidity concurrently the interbank yield curve shifted downward post the 100 transmission of the 100 bp policy rate cut on 14 february 2019 moreover the cbe added that yields for l c government securities declined to 14 0 net of tax in march 2019 and 13 8 during the first two issuances in april 2019 the lowest since may 2018 this compares to the 15 6 recorded on average during q4 of 2018 and january 2019 prior to the 100 bp policy rate cut in february 2019 the 1 6p p decline in march 2019 was due to the increase in demand reflected by higher coverage ratio which recorded 2 3x in march 2019 compared to 2 0x recorded during q4 of 2018 and january 2019 before declining to 1 6x during the first two issuances in april after being affected by em developments nevertheless treasury yields inched down further during the beginning of april 2019 supported by lower accepted to required ratio which was more than enough to offset the decline in demand the accepted to required ratio recorded 0 8x during the first two issuances in april 2019 compared to 1 1x recorded in march 2019 and 1 0x in q4 of 2018 and january 2019 meanwhile egyptian eurobond yields have been declining since the beginning of 2019 in line with the improvement in the risk premium for ems after increasing during most of 2018 moreover egypt s cds spreads remained relatively low compared to the majority of peers with similar sovereign credit rating furthermore egypt s credit rating was upgraded by moody s in april 2019 and by fitch ratings in march 2019 following the upgrade by s p in may 2018 in the banking sector march 2019 data reflected partial transmission of the 100 bp policy rate cut on 14 february 2019 to rates of new deposits which declined to 12 0 the limited transmission in the magnitude of 0 7x the policy rate cut was due to adjustment of flexible deposit rates as fixed rate saving certificates more than or equal to three years remained broadly unchanged the report added meanwhile rates of new loans remained relatively stable to record 17 7 in march 2019 due to the weaker impact of loans at subsidised interest rates as a result interest rate margins widened to 5 7p p compared to 4 6p p recorded on average between april 2018 and january 2019 in equity markets the cbe stated real prices recovered since the beginning of the year after declining in 2018 supported by net buying mainly by egyptian investors since the beginning of the year the egx 30 usd index recovered by a cumulative 20 outpacing the msci emerging markets index s 11 meanwhile real unit prices in q1 of 2019 inched down in the secondary market as the demand continued to shift from the secondary market toward the primary market given more flexible payment plans offered by numerous developers in the wake of tight liquidity conditions annual core inflation records single digits for 9th consecutive month the cbe said that annual headline inflation recorded 14 2 in march 2019 compared to 14 4 and 12 7 in february and january 2019 respectively meanwhile annual core inflation continued to record single digits for the ninth consecutive month averaging 8 6 between july 2018 and march 2019 the lowest rate in more than two years during q1 of 2019 annual headline inflation has been generally affected by unfavourable base effects given exceptionally low monthly inflation rates in january and february 2018 this comes after annual headline inflation was affected by fiscal consolidation measures as well as price volatility of fresh vegetables due to transitory supply shocks in the second half of 2018 the report stated nevertheless given the containment of underlying inflationary pressures annual inflation of services and retail items continued to record single digits for the sixth and fifth consecutive month respectively while annual inflation of core food items continued to record single digits for the tenth consecutive month in the meantime annual inflation of volatile food and regulated items remained elevated which contributed to widening of the spread between annual headline and core inflation rates consequently the cbe explained contribution of non food items to annual headline inflation has been broadly stable since november 2018 while contribution of food items experienced volatility since august 2018 recently annual contribution of food items remained broadly stable in march 2019 after increasing in january and february 2019 mainly due to volatile food items following its decline in november and december 2018 meanwhile monthly headline inflation was mainly driven by food inflation since august 2018 while non food inflation has been contained inflation of fresh vegetables was the main contributor to food inflation despite higher than expected price increases in february 2019 fresh vegetable inflation was broadly in line with seasonal patterns except for higher potato prices this comes after a supply shock specific to potatoes and tomatoes elevated inflation of fresh vegetables in september and october 2018 however it was partially reversed in november 2018 and by a larger extent in december 2018 in march 2019 potato prices increased for the second consecutive month contributing on average by 30 1 to monthly headline inflation prices of tomatoes declined after increasing for two consecutive months in the meantime according to the cbe prices of core food items inched up slightly since january 2019 mainly due to higher prices of poultry which increased for the third consecutive month in march 2019 contributing on average by 15 8 to monthly headline inflation in addition prices of rice as well as fish and seafood increased for the sixth and third consecutive month respectively average monthly core food inflation witnessed domestically since january 2019 was largely consistent with monthly international core food inflation after diverging between august and december 2018 international core food inflation continued to be mainly driven by prices of dairy products and red meat since december 2018 while contribution of poultry prices was negative since february 2019 finally after the cbe s monetary policy committee decided to cut key policy rates by 100 bps in its meeting on 14 february 2019 it decided in its meeting on 28 march 2019 that current policy rates are appropriate to achieve the inflation target of 9 3p p in q4 of 2020 which was declared in december 2018 real gdp growth is expected to continue recovering benefiting from continued structural reforms despite being affected by potential fiscal consolidation measures the primary fiscal balance is targeted to record a surplus of 2 0 of the gdp in fy 2018 19 compared to a surplus of 0 1 of the gdp in fy 2017 18 and a deficit of 1 8 of the gdp in fy 2016 17 and is targeted to maintain this surplus thereafter meanwhile the overall fiscal deficit is targeted to decline to 8 4 and 7 2 of the gdp in 2018 19 and 2019 20 respectively compared to 9 7 in 2017 18 and 10 9 in 2016 17 and is targeted to continue declining thereafter the outlook for brent crude oil price incorporated in the domestic inflation outlook remained unchanged compared to the previous monetary policy report while spot prices remain subject to volatility due to potential supply side factors as well as geopolitical risks domestically cost recovery for most fuel products is expected to be reached and automatic fuel price indexation to underlying costs is expected to be implemented meanwhile international food price forecasts relevant to egypt s consumption basket are expected to decline slightly during 2019 before increasing in 2020 according to the cbe s report in addition to international commodity price developments risks surrounding the inflation outlook from the global economy continue to include trade tensions and economic growth developments in the interim domestic risks continue to include the timing and magnitude of potential fiscal consolidation measures and the evolution of inflation expectations
the union finance minister nirmala sitharaman in her maiden budget speech on july 5 made a significant announcement in paragraph 103 that reads india s sovereign external debt to gdp is among the lowest globally at less than 5 per cent the government would start raising a part of its gross borrowing programme in the external market in external currencies this will also have a beneficial impact on the demand situation for government securities the announcement has been criticised by some for the risks of such an issuance while the government is at pains to explain that it has considered all the risks before making the announcement a clarification issued by the government officials said it will raise around 10 billion first in september 2019 amid the controversy a few facts are in order key parameters first the sovereign external borrowing will be a part of consolidated fund market borrowing for which the budget has assumed a gross amount of 7 10 000 crore taking into account the net market borrowing of 4 73 122 crore and repayments of 2 36 878 crore the government figure of 10 billion thus takes into account the exchange rate 75 to a dollar second the sovereign s debt as a percentage of gdp as per the data released by rbi on june 28 stood at 3 8 per cent as against 4 3 per cent in 2018 and 4 5 percent in 2017 it may be mentioned that these figures pertain to the residual maturity of external debt and amounted to 103 5 crore in absolute terms accounting for about 19 per cent of total external debt third the current account deficit as percentage to gdp was 2 1 per cent in 2018 19 which was financed comfortably by capital flows both debt and equity fourth since most of the external sector vulnerability indicators such as debt to gdp 19 7 per cent debt to forex reserve 76 per cent debt service ratio 6 4 per cent and forex reserve to import cover eight months have been at a steady state and stabilised there is some amount of resilience in the external sector fourth though economic growth has slowed down it is highest in the global context and is accompanied by a benign inflation outlook fifth volatility of the rupee is least among the emerging market economies sixth india has got the investment grade rating baa2 from moody s seventh even though the fiscal deficit 5 8 per cent of gdp and debt 68 per cent of gdp is at a higher level for the general government both centre and the states the strong commitment voiced by the government for fiscal consolidation will be well received by the global market in view of the foregoing this is an opportune time for the government to float sovereign external borrowings there are of course associated risks with sovereign external borrowings as country experiences tell us the most important is the default risk but taking into account the robust forex reserves of around 428 billion as on june 28 2019 global investors will draw enough confidence to invest debt manager having said this the modalities of issuance covering various aspects management of issuance countries stock exchanges coupon rate and maturity are crucial and need to be looked at immediately according to the rbi act 1934 the rbi is the debt manager for issuance of government debt the sovereign debt issuance will also be conducted by the rbi which will have to appoint a global manger to undertake this the global manger will be an investment banker of high repute and the selection of the global manger will be done through the bidding process may be the lowest commission bidder will be selected the amount of commission globally at the upper end has been 1 per cent of the issuance size it is appropriate to float the issuance in countries where there is a large presence of nris like north america and the middle east in addition japan is a good place to float this because of the strong political association and past bilateral swap arrangements between japan and india the currency of the bond will be in us dollar and japanese yen the external sovereign bonds will be listed in three important stock exchanges london new york and tokyo listing will help and facilitate secondary market trading the crucial issue is the coupon rate and maturity there are a few options one is regular vanilla bonds with a prefixed coupon rate the second is zero coupon bonds and the third is inflation index bonds however to begin with regular vanilla bonds are preferred being more investor friendly the decision on the interest rate is crucial as per the data available in the status report of external debt the implicit interest rate for external debt was 1 3 per cent for concessional rate 4 4 per cent for nri deposits and 4 7 per cent for external commercial borrowings the fixation of interest rate has to be seen both from the issuer and investor point of view a 10 year bond for domestic government debt was 7 34 per cent in 2018 19 in the us a 10 year bond yields around 2 per cent and in japan it is 0 15 per cent taking into account these factors a suggested coupon rate is 3 4 per cent with no currency interest rate and credit risk for the investor as an issuer the government will get the benefit of diversification of investor bases with global presence and there could be some easing of pressure on the domestic bond rates with reasonable economic growth benign inflation outlook a resilient external sector and above all political stability it is an opportune time for the authorities to enter the global market with sovereign bond borrowing the critical issue here is the appointment of an investment banker as a global debt manager testing the market with a new approach to raise sovereign external debt is one thing but falling into a trap by repeated floating of bonds and unwarranted enthusiasm is quite another in this while the approach is good the watchword should be caution the writer a former central banker is a faculty member at spjimr the views are personal through the billion press
the hashemite kingdom of jordan appears to be looking for new allies in qatar turkey and the islamic republic of iran as it faces declining subsidies and support by long time strategic sponsors such as saudi arabia the us and the israeli regime the still brewing development also comes as jordanian king abdullah ii has angered riyadh washington and tel aviv with his growing reservations about joining the trump administration s so called deal of the century plan for palestinians overwhelmingly rejected by the palestinian populations and leaders within and outside of the occupied territories jordan s refusal to join the saudi led military coalition against yemen has also contributed to the disappointment with amman by the despotic saudi rulers threatened by persisting protests at home on top of the declining saudi cash subsidies that have kept jordan afloat for decades king abdullah has reportedly opened talks in recent months with the longstanding rivals of saudi arabia turkey and qatar amman has even made subtle overtures to iran our relations depend on our interests said a source close to the government in amman speaking on condition of anonymity adding jordan doesn t have any conflict with turkey or qatar or even iran what distance we have depends on the benefits to us the 57 year old king abdullah has further come under even greater pressure due to washington s intention to dictate its own grand peace plan for the middle east with us president donald trump s son in law and senior advisor jared kushner acting as its chief architect unlike its neighbors jordan has few natural resources it is an emerging knowledge economy with key obstacles identified as scarce water supplies total reliance on oil imports for energy and regional instability just over 10 percent of jordan s land is arable and the water supply is limited rainfall remains low and highly variable and much of the country s available ground water is not renewable its economic resource base centers on phosphates potash and their fertilizer derivatives in addition to tourism overseas remittances and foreign aid jordan relies on natural gas for 93 percent of its domestic energy needs as it lacks coal reserves hydroelectric power and large tracts of forest or commercially viable oil deposits the country used to depend on baghdad for its oil imports until the us led invasion of neighboring iraq in 2003 it also has a surplus of industrial zones producing commodities in such sectors as textile aerospace military ict pharmacy and cosmetics in the last few years jordan s economic growth has slowed however averaging nearly two percent the nation s total foreign debt in 2011 was 19 billion dollars representing 60 percent of its gdp in 2016 its debt reached 35 1 billion dollars representing 93 4 percent of jordan s gdp such substantial increase is attributed to effects of regional instability leading to declining tourist activity and foreign investments growing military expenditure persisting attacks on egyptian pipeline supplying the kingdom with gas the collapse of its trade with iraq and syria the costs of hosting syrian refugees as well as accumulated interests from outstanding loans preview_thumbnail palestinian relations in crisis over illegal workers since the foreign sponsored war in syrian began in 2012 jordan has had an influx of 1 5 million refugees over its northern border according to the world bank syrian refugees have cost jordan more than 2 5 billion dollars per year amounting to six percent of its gdp and 25 percent of the government s annual revenue due to the introduction of syrian refugees in jordan wage growth declined considerably due to the growing competition for jobs between refugees and jordanian citizens the downfall that began in 2011 continued until 2018 the country s top five economic sectors contributing to its gdp government services finance manufacturing transport tourism and hospitality were badly damaged by the war in syria firstly jordan received in 2011 and 2014 its largest amount of foreign financial aid in decades in 2011 alone it took in 1 2 billion jordanian dinars 1 7 billion dollars additionally during the december 2011 summit of the gulf cooperation council the regimes of saudi arabia the united arab emirates kuwait and qatar decided to extend five billion dollars in financial grants for development schemes in jordan over a five year period with each state contributing 1 25 billion dollars this is while these persian gulf states offered jordan three times as much foreign aid in 2011 as the country received in the previous year since that was the year of the arab spring which brought the largest and most serious wave of protests in jordan s history it was obvious that aid jordan received that year was intended at calming down the jordanian streets in an effort to avoid regional instability meanwhile in 2018 saudi arabia and two other persian gulf nations pledged 2 5 billion dollars to help support jordan s economy after a proposed income tax increase sparked some of the largest protests since the arab spring in 2011 in 2017 the foreign grants jordan had previously received declined by 15 percent this explains an important aspect of the current economic crisis and the reason why the government was forced to raise the prices of many goods as well as the income tax rate for the working population triggering massive protests saudi arabia facing budget shortfalls of its own due to lower oil price and attempts at engineering economic reforms has since cut its regular subsidies to jordan the public unrest in jordan is not dying down and the frequent protests are threatening to destabilize the country not only are the kingdom s dire economic straits one of the factors driving the protests not improving despite harsh austerity measures but the situation is getting even worse alongside calls to address the economic problems various political forces including not only the traditional opposition but also tribal leaders former regime officials and retired military officers have been demanding political reforms and even calling for limiting the king s powers among the key forces taking part in protests across jordan in recent months have been the unemployed and popular protest movements tribes constituting the regime s traditional support base as well as former government officials and military officers many of whom are also tribal members that have grown disenchanted with the king s policies the national follow up committee a pro reform coalition including military veterans leftists and muslim activists have railed against growing corruption and economic policies that they insist have brought the country s economy to its knees before the protest the committee issued a statement demanding immediate reform and also called on king abdullah ii to enter into dialog with them despite our repeated calls on the king to expedite reform and to crack down on corruption he never listened to the pulse of the street or addressed our grievances said the statement this article has been adapted from its original

in recent months we have witnessed a noticeable deceleration of inflation in february and march we saw the prices of many goods and services remaining relatively stagnant or even falling briefly the behaviour of prices in june has been similar coinciding with a seasonal period where several items such as cheese various vegetables and some fruits tend to be produced in greater quantity than during the rest of the year read the original in spanish according to a report published in may by the polling firm hinterlaces the inflation of basic goods in april stood at 61 4 percent while in may it was at 44 8 percent bourgeois economist luis oliveros director of the firm ecoanalítica recently said we estimated that for the month of june inflation would finish at 26 percent the lowest of the hyperinflationary cycle that began at the end of 2017 this last estimate for june contrasts with the price increase in january recorded at 196 6 percent according to the venezuelan central bank bcv according to the above figures the government is clearly slowing down inflation however faced with what should in theory be good news we must ask ourselves at what cost and in what way is this slowdown of inflation being accomplished should we feel at ease and more importantly are the workers the true beneficiaries of this slight improvement in our article published on 4 september 2018 in which we analysed the set of measures in the then recently announced plan for recovery and economic prosperity we noted the chorus of bourgeois economists has not stopped insisting on the need to apply severe fiscal adjustments austerity measures and restrictions on the printing of money as the only formula to curb hyperinflation these economists propose a return to rationality in the economic policy which in the framework of a society based on private ownership of the means of production and competitive anarchy only translates into losses sacrifices and disgrace for the poorest layers of venezuelan society the bolivarian leadership and its intelligentsia buried in the swamp of class collaboration are seeking to open up the economy although not at the pace demanded by the capitalist class following this limited and unpopular bourgeois logic following on from this we will explain how the subsequent development of the government s orientation has only confirmed our suspicions clearly a severe undisclosed fiscal adjustment has been carried out which is reducing both public spending and the size of the state along with a strict monetary diet to reduce liquidity at the cost of strangling the level of consumption the bolivarian government subject to multiple internal and external pressures has chosen to accelerate its movement towards deregulation and liberalisation of the national economy through means that inevitably unload the weight of the crisis on the shoulders of the workers and the oppressed restriction of monetary liquidity hyperinflation and the economic crisis that venezuela is facing arose as a result of the collapse of oil prices in 2014 which triggered the fiscal deficit higher expenditure than state revenues to rise to very high levels at one point as high as 20 percent to cover this deficit the government decided to undertake an expansionary monetary policy that was not backed up by increases in national production or international reserves the subsequent decline of oil production from three million barrels per day in 2015 to one million today according to official data secondary sources suggest that venezuelan oil production stands at 770 000 barrels per day only worsened the critical situation immediately after the harsh sanctions issued by the white house on finance which prevented the renegotiation of foreign debt and oil which have made it difficult to export crude oil pushed the national economy into a sort of comatose state today it is undeniable that one of the main causes of hyperinflation in venezuela lies in the excess of circulating money supply which the government increased by more than 60 000 percent between 2012 and mid 2018 this coincided with the collapse of domestic production according to the bcv gdp has contracted by 52 percent in the last six years and the supply of goods in general with a decline in imports of more than 80 percent in the last six years the importation of food medicine consumable goods and machinery into the country decreased severely because the government in an excessive and illusory effort to generate confidence in international markets prioritised payment of foreign debt over the fundamental needs of the population with everything that has been paid due to international commitments since 2015 it would have been possible to import food for six years at the value of the amount destined for 2013 food imports for the bolivarian leadership the economic crisis is to be dealt with using any means but revolutionary ones like nationalising the commanding heights of the economy under control of the workers image lucha de clases the situation of scarcity caused in large part by the factors described above coincided with a period of unprecedented growth in the money supply a lot of money circulating plus the high speed of circulation itself to avoid inflation as much as possible people choose to spend or invest their money quickly instead of saving it led to a growing shortage of goods and services resulting in constant price hikes although commercial usury is a well known practice this was strengthened by scarcity which faced with a growing cash circulation a pressure of demand gave vendors an objective advantage over consumers such economic distortions partly explain why price control policies failed how could it be any other way when the laws of the capitalist market impose their dictatorship which is unrelenting as long as bourgeois property relations to sustain it given the past situation the government resolved earlier this year to apply a legal reserve rate of 57 percent and a marginal rate of 100 percent which implies that the country s banks are obligated to keep a certain percentage of their total deposits in reserve reducing the funds available for credit to companies and individuals and with this restricting the monetary supply this combined with the profound impoverishment of wages the minimum wage currently stands at just under 6 per month and less frequent and pyrrhic wage increases have generated a contraction in consumption this means that based on the hunger of the workers it has been possible to reduce the pressure of demand which faced with the situation of scarcity pushed prices up more rapidly cendas estimated the cost of the basic family goods basket in may at 2 552 836 bolivares 32 7 percent higher than was registered in april and with a variation of 115 865 percent between may of 2018 and 2019 according to these calculations one would require 63 8 times the minimum wage of 40 000 bolivares to cover the cost of all basic family goods these numbers show the current situation of the venezuelan workers only this data can explain the departure of almost four million venezuelans to neighbouring nations in recent years in search of an income higher than the lowest salaries in the region and possibly the world for the bolivarian leadership the crisis is to be dealt with by whatever means except revolutionary means nationalising the commanding heights of the economy under genuine democratic control of the workers and the organised masses those who attempt to justify the unjustifiable assert that reducing hyperinflation is the supreme economic objective given the impediments it creates to an anxiously awaited economic recovery certainly inflation is not rising to the levels of 2017 or 2018 however the attempt to reduce the liquidity of the economy in the way it is being carried out is compromising any possibility of future economic growth despite the sacrifices to which the poor masses are subjected the restriction of bank credit as a direct consequence of the reserve rate policy can only lead to greater disinvestment in the actual economy and the sustaining of the existing capacity in industry to replenish stock in the commercial sector a deeply unlikely dream is that it will lead to the increase of national production something that the bourgeoisie stopped doing since the 1980s more shortages more closures of companies which have been increased by the bourgeoisie in the last period more unemployment and in short a greater collapse of gdp this could be the price that the workers and the poor will have to continue paying because of the inability of the bolivarian leadership to complete the revolution in the face of the fruitless setbacks being undertaken it is worth saying that even from the bourgeois point of view the government tries to abate inflation at the expense of the rest of the economy the fact that inflation is not increasing to previous levels does not mean that the economic crisis in general is waning the current monetary policy is a more harmful antidote than the disease itself the exchange factor hyperinflation in venezuela was also driven by multiple depreciations of the bolívar resulting from the serious distortions that our economy has suffered in recent years once again the need to pay off foreign debt to the detriment of national interests caused international reserves which backed the bolívar to fall by 63 percent since 2014 on the other hand the flight of capital abroad which several studies estimate at more than 300 billion bleeds the country dry and hands it over to the corrupt and voracious bourgeois bureaucrats and military the ruin of the state accounts which produced a shortage of foreign currency unable to supply national demand coincided with an economy full of bolívares and a public eager to get rid of them which devalued our currency countless times faced with the disproportionate dependence of our economy on imports the devaluation of the bolívar has had a huge impact on the behaviour of prices to mitigate the constant rises in the price of foreign currency as one of the driving factors of inflation the government decided to resort to the gradual elimination of foreign exchange controls first with the repeal of the foreign exchange law allowing the fixing of the official price of currency to that of the parallel black market or occasionally above and finally with the abolition of the dicom semi floating exchange rate mechanism and establishment of the money exchange tables the latest measure was possible after the white house issued sanctions against the bcv on 17 april which made direct foreign exchange auctions by dicom unfeasible and led the executive to accelerate the liberalisation of the foreign exchange model that was already being carried forward this fact shows how the us pressures have not been entirely in vain in response to every coercion of imperialism and the right wing the bolivarian leadership has made greater concessions to the bourgeoisie who have been calling for the elimination of exchange controls since 2003 without major legal and formal extenuating factors to continue the flight of foreign currencies apart from the fact that today the state does not have enough foreign currency to transfer income as in the past and with the liberalisation of prices which even bourgeois economists recognise the ruling classes have managed to impose part of their interests in economic policy over the interests of the working masses with the aforementioned measure of increasing the bank reserve rate as a mechanism to reduce liquidity the government also sought to reduce the pressure on scarce foreign currency because if people have less money in turn they will demand less foreign currency goods and services although these measures have not been able to stop the growth of the foreign exchange rate at least they have slowed it down which undoubtedly reduces the strength of inflation undisclosed fiscal adjustment in keeping with a course that to a greater or lesser extent all the bourgeois governments in the world follow the national government has been pursuing serious efforts to cut public spending and reduce the size of the state at first this situation was happening de facto due to hyperinflation the constant rise in prices resulted in the real value of state spending to plummet by more than 70 percent between 2015 and 2018 this means that the grand sounding government announcements of increases of investments in health and education among other areas always corresponded to simple nominal increases which in national currency were quickly eroded by the repeated devaluations and the resulting inflation in fact such announcements could not conceal austerity from the eyes of the masses to get an idea it is enough to note the deplorable state of public services infrastructure education and health venezuela is experiencing unprecedented economic counter reforms resulting from the effects of hyperinflation the crisis in general and a government that has its back turned on its social base image lucha de clases with a high fiscal deficit which is covered with the printing of money which has no solid base in the economy the government under the pressure of teams of chinese and russian economic advisers decided to start putting the state accounts in order to the detriment of public workers and the working class in general the government gave the go ahead to the levelling down of wages to the level of the minimum wage in the public administration they used the little known memorandum circular 2792 of the ministry for the social process of labour as a battering ram to carry out this equalisation the disregard for collective agreements signed before the implementation of the recovery and economic prosperity plan coupled with the memorandum circular allowed the suppression of any contractual socio economic benefits that would raise wages above the level of the minimum wage in the state and private sector as well as the violation of the right to strike by means of cheapening the state payrolls apart from the new favours given to employers the government tries to reduce the fiscal deficit as one of the engines of inflation trampling the rights and gains made by the working class the executive accelerates the reduction of state spending combined with the evident ease of layoffs in both the public and private sectors as for the crisis of decaying capitalism which the bolivarian leadership is determined to save in its own contradictory way the incredible pulverisation of wages in the country currently one of the lowest in the world has not been enough the crisis has also impacted the reduction of the size of the state in the following way due to the miserable salaries there has been no end to the plethora of resignations and abandonments of jobs in the state administration although we do not have reliable figures to quantify that phenomenon it cannot be ignored as it is clear for all to see emigration and the search for better incomes in the informal sector point to causes typical of an economy holding a sign that says save yourself if you can nor can we forget how the current privatisation policy falls within this regressive and ominous atmosphere all these elements show the execution of an aggressive process of unprecedented economic counter reforms which results from the effects of hyperinflation the crisis in general and the permissiveness of a government that has its back turned on its social base the revolution must be completed against all forms of manipulation and historical distortion we must point out that the catastrophe we are currently experiencing is not the result of the establishment of socialism in venezuela which was never the case except in the febrile imagination of the right wing verbiage and the demagogy or ignorance of the bolivarian leadership what failed in venezuela was a model of regulation that did not sufficiently advance the construction of a new society but which also did not allow the development of the capitalist market certainly controls on foreign exchange and prices were introduced to the normal functioning of the economy which although at one point they represented advances within the framework of capitalism were condemned to become their opposite with chávez at the head an important policy of nationalisation was developed where later the bureaucracy intervened to prevent workers control and dismantle the companies these elements combined with the revolutionary fervour of the masses frightened the capitalists which worsened the flight of capital and the investment strike that the bourgeoisie has been carrying out for several decades what was missing was to move towards the final taking over of the commanding heights of the national economy to plan the production and distribution of resources to serve the majority the attempt to sustain all the social progress achieved while preserving bourgeois property relations could only lead to chaos the great lesson to be learned by the revolutionaries of the world is that a revolution cannot be carried out halfway it must be carried through to the end by demolishing bourgeois property relations and the capitalist state the consequences of not implementing this idea are well illustrated in venezuela today despite the current fateful context the working class and public sector workers have not been defeated definitively multiple scattered initiatives for discussion and organisation are being developed throughout the country at the vanguard level the present moment demands the confluence of all these instances to bring together all the forces of the consistent left prepare a defensive struggle against all the setbacks that are being carried out build a revolutionary alternative from below and finally to give a new leadership to the entire workers movement one determined to unrelentingly defend the interests of workers the only way out of this quagmire of misery and corruption is to build a planned economy based on the nationalisation without compensation of the monopolies large estates latifundios banks and insurers and the formation of a state monopoly of foreign trade under strict democratic control of the working class and the organised masses obviously the success of this programme depends to a great extent on the destruction of the bourgeois state apparatus and its replacement by a workers state made up of the organs of working class struggle and power workers councils peasant councils and communes which we must strengthen today to advance in their necessary maturation

seventy five years ago this month the foremost economic and policy minds of their generation gathered in a sleepy mountain town in new england while world war ii still raged they envisioned a new international monetary system with rules procedures and institutionsâ including the international monetary fund imf and the world bankâ to promote recovery and stability in a war ravaged world today we gather in paris the city of light to recognize their vision the bretton woods institutions played a pivotal role after the war in rebuilding economies and in facilitating the international economic relations that are essential to prosperity generations later the world bank and the imf continue to play important roles in fostering global monetary cooperation financial stability and international trade as well as in promoting sustainable economic growth and reducing poverty in 1944 those who sat around the table at the mount washington hotel knew that the trauma and tragedy of the war and the great depression had fundamentally altered the economic systems that preceded them for us around our dinner tables tonight a decade has passed since the global financial crisis although in no way comparable to the devastating events of the 1930s and 1940s the crisis represents the deepest and broadest financial upheaval since that era and in many ways we too are grappling with a changed world today s conference has looked at this post crisis environment and the issues we now face from many angles i am grateful to the banque de france for organizing this important event and to the outstanding speakers for their deep insights tonight i will offer some thoughts on this new environment i will begin with a discussion of current economic conditions in the united states and then highlight some significant structural changes in the environment facing monetary policymakers in the post crisis era finally i will consider how these structural changes are affecting the framework in which we conduct monetary policy highlighting the federal reserve system s ongoing review of our monetary policy strategy tools and communications the u s economy is now in its 11th consecutive year of growth unemployment has steadily declined from its 10 percent post crisis peak and has now remained at or below 4 percent for more than a year the longest stretch in a half century a strong labor market with plentiful job openings has supported labor force participation after rising only grudgingly early in the recovery wages have moved up the past few years some groups such as african americans hispanics and rural americans continue to face long standing challenges but the benefits of this strong job market are increasingly widely shared at outreach events we are holding across the united states we are hearing loud and clear that this long recovery is now benefiting low and moderate income communities to a greater extent than has been felt for decades many people who have struggled to stay in the workforce are now getting an opportunity to add new and better chapters to their life stories solid growth has sustained this strong labor market most recently u s gross domestic product gdp increased at an annual rate of just over 3 percent in the first quarter similar to last year s strong pace but first quarter growth was driven largely by net exports and inventoriesâ two volatile spending categories that are typically not dependable indicators of ongoing momentum indeed overall growth in the second quarter appears to have moderated growth in consumer spending which was soft in the first quarter looks to have bounced back but business fixed investment growth seems to have slowed notably moreover the manufacturing sector has been weak since the beginning of the year in part weighed down by the softer business spending weaker growth in the global economy and as our business contacts tell us concerns about trade tensions despite low unemployment and solid overall growth inflation pressures remain muted after running close to the federal open market committee s fomc symmetric 2 percent objective over much of last year both overall consumer price inflation and core inflation moved down earlier this year we currently estimate that the change in the core personal consumption expenditures pce price index was 1 7 percent over the 12 months ending in june in our baseline outlook we expect growth in the united states to remain solid labor markets to stay strong and inflation to move back up and run near 2 percent uncertainties about this outlook have increased however particularly regarding trade developments and global growth in addition issues such as the u s federal debt ceiling and brexit remain unresolved fomc participants have also raised concerns about a more prolonged shortfall in inflation below our 2 percent target market based measures of inflation compensation have shifted down and some survey based expectations measures are near the bottom of their historical ranges many fomc participants judged at the time of our most recent meeting in june that the combination of these factors strengthens the case for a somewhat more accommodative stance of policy we are carefully monitoring these developments and assessing their implications for the u s economic outlook and inflation and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective we will also assess these developments in the context of the broader structural changes monetary policymakers have been facing since the great recession i will focus on three tonight the changed macroeconomic backdrop the expanded toolkit and the heightened focus on communication and transparency in the united states from the mid 1980s to right before the great recession pce inflation averaged 2 6 percent a year gdp growth 3 4 percent and the interest rate on a 10 year treasury note 6 5 percent since the trough of the great recession average inflation and output growth are around 1 percentage point lower and the 10 year treasury rate has averaged 2 4 percent these declines are not unique to the united states average inflation rates for the other major advanced economies have declined by almost half while the inflation rates of major emerging market economies are less than one fifth of what they were indeed with few exceptions we are all facing lower rates of interest growth and inflation in a number of countries including the united states these declines have been accompanied by strong labor markets and a much lower unemployment rate such changes in the macroeconomic environment are significant because the long run normal levels of inflation output interest rates and the unemployment rate are important structural features by which we guide policy standard estimates of the natural rate of unemploymentâ u â and the neutral rate of interestâ r â have been declining for 2 decades and particularly since the crisis many factors are contributing to these changesâ well anchored inflation expectations in the context of improved monetary policy demographics globalization slower productivity growth greater demand for safe assets and weaker links between unemployment and inflation and these factors seem likely to persist if that happens the neutral rate of interest will remain low and policymakers will continue to operate in an environment in which the risk of hitting the effective lower bound is much higher than before the crisis this proximity to the lower bound poses new complications for central banks and calls for new ideas it is true that many of these features have been with us for some time trend inflation productivity and interest rates were declining well before the crisis but for monetary policymakers in that era the threat of high inflation felt proximate the hard fought battle to control high inflation having been just recently won technological progress seemed likely to continue to sustain rapid increases in productivityâ an outcome we continue to await and the effective lower bound for interest rates was mainly a theoretical concern except of course in japan the changes to the macroeconomic environment may have been in train earlier but the crisis seems to have accelerated the process the world in which policymakers are now operating is discretely different in important ways from the one before the great recession i should also note as is fitting given this event and this audience that since the crisis policymakers are even more keenly aware of the relevance of global factors to our policies the global nature of the financial crisis and the channels through which it spread sharply highlight the interconnectedness of our economic financial and policy environments u s economic developments affect the rest of the world and the reverse is also true for example the stresses surrounding the euro crisis and later the china related volatility events in 2015 and 2016 led to a general pullback in demand for risky assets that put downward pressure on u s interest rates and weighed on u s confidence and growth in addition we have seen how monetary policy in one country can influence economic and financial conditions in others through financial markets trade and confidence channels pursuing our domestic mandates in this new world requires that we understand the anticipated effects of these interconnections and incorporate them into our policy decisionmaking a second important feature of this new world is the tools central bankers now have to fight recessions in the face of the dramatic economic and financial collapse during the crisis policymakers quickly exhausted conventional monetary policy tools and employed a range of unconventional measures to support their economies in the united states these measures included new forms of forward guidance and a range of balance sheet policies broadly across different economies so called unconventional monetary policies have generally been successful at lowering interest rates and supporting economic recovery though cyclical and structural headwinds have made achieving our inflation targets a challenge a legacy of the crisis is that policymakers now have a broader range of tested tools to turn to the next time the effective lower bound is reached we must continue to assess additional strategies and tools to bolster our economies and meet our inflation and employment mandates finally the crisis and great recession brought into stark relief the need for transparency and accountability for central banks central bank communication is increasingly important and increasingly challenging it is important because clear transparent communication about the economy the risks and our policy responses is critical for the effectiveness of our tools and for our accountability to the public in a democratic society it is challenging because we are operating in a changing macroeconomic environment with tools that while no longer new remain less familiar to the public moreover our audience has become more varied more attuned to our actions and less trusting of public institutions gone are the days when the federal reserve chair could joke as my predecessor alan greenspan did if i turn out to be particularly clear you ve probably misunderstood what i said 1 central banks must speak to main street as well as wall street in ways we have not in the past and main street is listening and engaged where does this leave us and how should policymakers adapt to this new environment recognizing challenges posed by the changing structure of the economy the need for effective policy responses and the importance of clear communication central banks are taking a closer look at their strategies and the range of tools currently at their disposal for example the bank of canada examines its framework every five years as part of the renewal of its inflation control agreement with the federal government canadian officials have announced the bank will assess a broad range of monetary policy frameworks ahead of the renewal in 2021 of this agreement 2 the bank of england commissioned a review over the past year of the future of the united kingdom s financial system and what it might mean for the bank s agenda toolkit and capabilities 3 for our part the federal reserve is conducting for the first time a public review of the strategy tools and communications that we use to promote our goals of maximum employment and price stability 4 the heart of this review has been a series of fed listens events around the country in every reserve bank district to hear directly from the constituencies we serve these events have been live streamed on the internet last month we hosted a research conference at the federal reserve bank of chicago to explore ways to more effectively and sustainably achieve our mandated goals beginning soon the fomc will devote time at its regular meetings to assessing the lessons from these events we will publicly report the conclusions of our discussions likely during the first half of next year 5 other central banks many represented in this room are also looking deeply at the challenges posed by the current environment and assessing tools and strategies i look forward to learning from your experiences and sharing ours in the coming months and years as we face the trials and opportunities of this new era for all of us the turmoil that preceded this new world was severe although not as extreme as that faced by those around the table in bretton woods 75 years ago tonight let us celebrate their success and strive so that our vision for the future of the global economic and financial system proves as durable and as effective 1 see alan greenspan 1988 trade deficit and budget deficit c span video of a speech delivered at the

seventy five years ago this month the foremost economic and policy minds of their generation gathered in a sleepy mountain town in new england while world war ii still raged they envisioned a new international monetary system with rules procedures and institutions including the international monetary fund imf and the world bank to promote recovery and stability in a war ravaged world today we gather in paris the city of light to recognize their vision the bretton woods institutions played a pivotal role after the war in rebuilding economies and in facilitating the international economic relations that are essential to prosperity generations later the world bank and the imf continue to play important roles in fostering global monetary cooperation financial stability and international trade as well as in promoting sustainable economic growth and reducing poverty in 1944 those who sat around the table at the mount washington hotel knew that the trauma and tragedy of the war and the great depression had fundamentally altered the economic systems that preceded them for us around our dinner tables tonight a decade has passed since the global financial crisis although in no way comparable to the devastating events of the 1930s and 1940s the crisis represents the deepest and broadest financial upheaval since that era and in many ways we too are grappling with a changed world today s conference has looked at this post crisis environment and the issues we now face from many angles i am grateful to the banque de france for organizing this important event and to the outstanding speakers for their deep insights tonight i will offer some thoughts on this new environment i will begin with a discussion of current economic conditions in the united states and then highlight some significant structural changes in the environment facing monetary policymakers in the post crisis era finally i will consider how these structural changes are affecting the framework in which we conduct monetary policy highlighting the federal reserve system s ongoing review of our monetary policy strategy tools and communications the u s economy is now in its 11th consecutive year of growth unemployment has steadily declined from its 10 percent post crisis peak and has now remained at or below 4 percent for more than a year the longest stretch in a half century a strong labor

subhash chandra garg the top official at the finance ministry told indian business leaders last week that the overseas debt move was part of efforts to bring down real interest rates for indian firms to help the economy grow faster we will have a very open attitude to welcome foreign investment and savings because that is what would be required he said garg said that the problem with relying so much on domestic debt was that the government tapped into nearly 80 of total savings in the economy leaving little for private companies as a result those businesses are forced to pay up to 12 13 in interest rates on bank loans the government has in the past considered raising funds from overseas markets but those tasked with determining the feasibility of such a plan have ended up recommending against it most of the debt is of domestic origin insulating the debt portfolio from currency risk india s previous finance minister arun jaitley wrote in a paper on public debt in february last year

agarwal the bjp s national spokesman on economic affairs said that despite some risks highlighted by the critics the sovereign bonds were the best alternative at this point considering the government

this morning a former deputy governor of australia s central bank rba published a short op ed in the australian financial review july 16 2019 why there are no free lunches from the rba which served as a veiled critique of modern monetary theory mmt the problem is that the substantive analysis supported the core of the mmt literature that we have developed over 25 years refuted the standard macroeconomics textbook treatment of the link between the government and non government sectors and incorrectly depicted what mmt is about all in one short article not a bad effort i thought but disappointing that a person with such experience and knowledge resorts to perpetuating such crude representations of cost and myths about government finances the author stephen grenville now a consultant to the world bank imf and other like institutions seeks to caution against the current vogue for asking the central bank to fund socially desirable expenditures he is somewhat mistaken to source the start of this vogue as america s quantitative easing qe which started in 2008 japan has been demonstrating what central banks can do in this regard when they adopted qe on march 19 2001 at that point the bank of japan pushed large volumes of excess reserves into the commercial banking system in return for purchases of government and by ensuring there were always excess reserves each day in the cash system they have been able to maintain short term interest rates at zero ever since it is clear that in response to the gfc other central banks the federal reserve in the us the bank of england swiss national bank the sveriges riksbank and the ecb followed suit in varying proportions the motivations were expressed differently but the intent was to militate against the recessionary impacts of declines in non government spending what was held out to the public was a policy approach to push more reserves into the system to enhance the ability of the commercial banks to make loans at times when credit was tight and economic activity was in decline modern monetary theory mmt economists at each phase pointed out that this justification was based on the false mainstream notion that banks loan out reserves and that lending can become reserve constrained the reality is that banks only loan excess reserves among themselves as part of the payments system cheque clearing and that lending is not constrained by deposits and hence reserves mmt economists were the first in the modern era to point out that loans create deposits not the other way around you will never find that proposition in the standard macroeconomics textbooks what follows is that qe cannot influence bank lending in the way claimed by mainstream economists the lack of lending behaviour during the gfc was the result of a shortage of credit worthy borrowers people were simply reluctant to borrow given elevated and precarious debt levels and this constrained the loan books of the banks the only way qe might have been a stimulative measure was in its impact on interest rates at the investment end of the yield curve by purchasing the volumes of government debt that qe achieved the central banks drove up bond prices via higher demand and pushed down yields competition in the financial asset classes at the maturities of the bonds being bought then led to lower interest rates across the board but as we learned in times of heightened economic uncertainty people will not borrow even as the cost of funds fall if they lack confidence in the returns that the projects might deliver into the future stephen grenville claims that qe is printing money and that the revival of modern monetary theory mmt promotes the same idea first i am not sure the term revival is very descriptive it suggests that mmt had a day in the sun faded and now is shining again i think it is more accurate to think of mmt as a growing body of work which people are finding out about slowly but surely and realising that it helps them understand the dissonance between what mainstream economists are saying and predicting and what mmt says second to characterise mmt as advocating printing money is of course incorrect and demonstrates a rather superficial knowledge of the core literature the term is also loaded and critics know that and use it intentionally it invokes years of characterisations of out of control central bankers goaded by government officials running printing presses at ever increasing speeds and people wandering the streets carrying wheelbarrows full of bank notes to buy a loaf of bread stephen grenville adds some weight to his accusation claiming that mmt says it appears that budgets can be funded costlessly by printing money because money doesn t pay interest sadly this seemingly costless funding source isn t in fact a free lunch i will come back to this claim after going through the logic of his argument that logic actually correctly depicts the way the central bank interacts with the commercial banks and the impacts of government deficits on the banking system in that sense it captures what mmt economists have been writing about for over 25 years it also exposes the lack of insights in the mainstream macroeconomics i believe our new mmt textbook macroeconomics is the only one on the market that actually gets this all down correctly so stephen grenville is in fact while trying to critique mmt unwittingly defending core components of our analysis and unintentionally providing a sound critique of mainstream money and banking analysis he considers two scenarios first suppose the central bank funds infrastructure expenditures receiving in return some kind of zero interest government iou note he thinks of the central bank as being separate from the government when in fact central banks are legal and politicial creatures of the government and have to work daily in close cooperation with the treasury arm of government in their liquidity management functions but lets play along with the story in other words the government tells the central bank to pay some bills to say road building companies etc and offers them a bit of paper in return bearing no interest the central bank credits the bank accounts of the infrastructure providers or in stephen grenville s words creates central bank money there is no money multiplier operative as in the mainstream textbooks stephen grenville s version of this is that the banks are already lending to all the borrowers who are judged to be bankable which is another way of saying that loans create deposits not the other way around the latter being required for the operations of the fictional money multiplier and if banks are lending to all the credit worthy borrowers requesting credit then they will not create any further deposits so what fiscal deficits do in this case is expand excess reserves after all the transactions are exhausted the liquidity injection from the net public spending shows up as excess bank reserves these are held in accounts the commercial banks have to hold with the central bank i detail that process in detail in this introductory suite of blog posts 1 deficit spending 101 part 1 february 21 2009 2 deficit spending 101 part 2 february 23 2009 3 deficit spending 101 part 3 march 2 2009 in stephen grenville s words the bank deposits the excess funds with the central bank in the form of bank reserves pure mmt so what is his point well because central banks just about everywhere pay a market related rate of interest on reserves thus the expenditure is funded by the banking system holding excess reserves on which the central bank pays a market related interest no free lunch here just a distortion of the banks balance sheets holding more reserves than they need it would be better if this expenditure were to be funded in the conventional way by the government issuing bonds to the public first whether central banks pay a market related rate of interest on reserves is a policy choice the rba pays an interest rate on es balances that is 0 25 percentage points below the cash rate target source es balances are the exchange settlement accounts reserves that banks are reequired to maintain with the central bank since the gfc the us federal reserve pays an ioer interest on excess reserves currently set at 2 35 per cent as at february 5 2019 this is in line with the the target range for the federal funds rate at 2 1 4 to 2 1 2 percent source the bank of japan has a different policy approach to excess reserves it deploys a three tier approach to which a positive interest rate a zero interest rate and a negative interest rate are applied respectively the three tier system encourages negative interest rate transactions in the money market source this exempts some proportion of the excess reserves from the negative rate applied at the margin i may write about tiered reserve systems separately given that the ecb is toying with the introduction along the japanese lines the point is that it is a policy decision whether to leave excess reserves in the system to drive the short term interest rates down to zero as banks compete to offload their excesses onto other banks as stephen grenville acknowledges the banks can swap these reserves among themselves but the banking system as a whole can t get rid of the excess central bank money another pure mmt proposition that you won t find articulated in mainstream textbooks and if there is no return offered banks with excesses on a particular day will try to loan them to banks facing shortfalls but if there is a system wide surplus this activity is fraught and only results in the yields dropping on the loans in the interbank market to zero so if a central bank desires a non zero policy rate then it has to either sell interest bearing bonds to the banks to drain these reserves or just pay them a market rate for holding the excesses a policy choice second the concept of cost that stephen grenville invokes lacks any sense he seeks to exploit the concept of there ain t no such thing as a free lunch which milton friedman s 1975 book there is no such thing as a free lunch advanced as part of his attack on government activity but alleging that an interest payment from the central bank is somehow a cost in the sense that friedman and others use the term no free lunch is invalid friedman was talking about real resource scarcity and in an environment that sort of scarcity is a binding constraint there is an opportunity cost involved in making choices if we choose to use a resource in one way then it cannot be used in another way the choice thus influences the net benefits that flow from that resource usage against the usage foregone friedman and his clan always claimed that government usage of productive resources led to inferior outcomes because the free market did not discipline the choice so in economics the free lunch metaphor is about opportunity cost at the heart of mainstream economics is the claim by say gregory mankiw that to get one thing that we like we usually have to give up another thing that we like making decisions requires trading off one goal against another of course the concept is difficult to sustain at a macro level if there are idle resources that is productive resources that are being wasted as a result of unemployment then for a time the opportunity costs are low to zero and there is a free lunch now ask yourself what the next best alternative use of an interest payment made by the currency issuer is when that payment is accomplished by the stroke of a computer key and comes from nowhere in his famous paper fifteen fatal fallacies of financial fundamentalism october 5 1996 american economist william vickrey discussed said that much of the conventional economic wisdom prevailing in financial circles largely subscribed to as a basis for governmental policy and widely accepted by the media and the public is based on incomplete analysis contrafactual assumptions and false analogy he noted that these fallacies lead to the assumption that future economic output is almost entirely determined by inexorable economic forces independently of government policy so that devoting more resources to one use inevitably detracts from availability for another he also accepted that this might be justifiable in an economy at chock full employment but when economic policy is keeping us in the economic doldrums with overall unemployment rates stuck in the 5 to 6 percent range the loss of 10 to 15 percent of our potential production unemployment of 10 20 and 40 percent among disadvantaged groups the further damages in terms of poverty family breakup school truancy and dropout illegitimacy drug use and crime become serious indeed in these situations claiming there is no free lunch is simply absurd ideological nonsense his 15 fallacies document beautifully what remains problematic with mainstream macroeconomics and the type of reasoning stephen grenfell tries to invoke in the article under discussion they relate to the standard arguments of sound finance you should know them all by now they are the core propositions that mmt undermines william vickrey wrote that these fallacious notions which seem to be widely held in various forms by those close to the seats of economic power are leading to policies that are not only cruel but unnecessary and even self defeating in terms of their professed objectives we will not get out of the economic doldrums as long as we continue to be governed by fallacious notions that are based on false analogies one sided analysis and an implicit underlying counterfactual assumption of an inevitable level of unemployment and in conclusion he wrote with considerable eloquence that to assure against such a disaster and start on the road to real prosperity it is necessary to relinquish our unreasoned ideological obsession with reducing government deficits recognize that it is the economy and not the government budget that needs balancing in terms of the demand for and supply of assets and proceed to recycle attempted savings into the income stream at an adequate rate so that they will not simply vanish in reduced income sales output and employment there is too a free lunch out there indeed a very substantial one but it will require getting free from the dogmas of the apostles of austerity most of whom would not share in the sacrifices they recommend for others the point is that a core principle of mmt is a recognition that what constrains government spending are the available real resources that can be purchased and put into productive use or diverted from other uses whether there is scarcity or not depends on the state of utilisation of the resources available to a nation that assessment then determines what policy interventions might be appropriate but there are no real constraints on the central bank paying interest on excess reserves should they decide to do so from an mmt perspective there is no reason for the central bank to do so just as there is no reason to match fiscal deficits with debt issuance stephen grenfell s second scenario is in his words closer to the printing money idea that the government can pay with interest free liabilities so instead of crediting the bank accounts of the infrastructure supplier he posits that the central bank loads up some delivery vans with actual bank notes and pays the supplier accordingly what happens then well in his words the contractors don t want the cash nor do they want to splurge it on bidding up prices as milton friedman warned instead they deposit it with their bank the bank doesn t want the cash either so it gives it back to the central bank in return for bank reserves we re back at the same place which is pure mmt operational intelligence you won t find this sort of logic in any mainstream macroeconomics textbook students in mainstream programs are taught the milton friedman line that inflation would ensue at least stephen grenfell is experienced enough to understand that the inflation risk is embedded in the spending decision not how that spending is made operational his next logical statement is that the central bank money ends up as bank reserves on which the central bank has to pay interest again note that whether the central bank pays interest on excess reserves is a policy choice it clearly doesn t have to do so and the next link in his logic train fails similarly this interest payment may not show up as a line item in the budget but if the central bank has to pay additional interest on reserves it makes a smaller operating surplus and hence pays a smaller dividend to the government bank reserves may not be included in the total of public debt but this is an accounting omission these are a clear liability of the central bank and should be included in any comprehensive enumeration of public debt this is the left hand pocket transferring something to the right hand pocket misnomer the fact that the accounting records of the central bank records a lower operating surplus because they have provided more income to the non government sector interest on reserves does not reduce its capacity to credit bank accounts or load up vans with cash it wouldn t even matter if the central bank recorded a perpetual accounting loss and had negative capital the currency issuer cannot go broke further the fact that the treasury then records a lower surplus or higher deficit because the accounting flows from the left pocket don t appear in the right pocket is also largely irrelevant for assessing the capacity of the government to net spend in the next period remember the public debt at any point in time is just the accounting record of past fiscal deficits that have not yet been taxed away it is true that if we want to consolidate the liabilities of the government sector overall then bank reserves would be added to outstanding public debt but what would that tell us that was interesting not much at all please read the following blog posts among others for more discussion of these themes 1 the ecb cannot go broke get over it may 11 2012 2 the us federal reserve is on the brink of insolvency not november 18 2010 3 better off studying the mating habits of frogs september 14 2011 4 central bank independence another faux agenda may 26 2010 5 the consolidated government treasury and central bank august 20 2010 conclusion so you see that 1 the public debate is indeed shifting and op ed contributions from otherwise mainstream commentators are starting to invoke the frames that mmt has introduced to the public sphere you will not find analysis such as offered by stephen grenfell in any conventional money and banking textbook so that is a positive trend part of getting people to reach an mmt understanding is to get them to use mmt frames and language 2 the characterisation of mmt in the public debate by those intent on criticism remains facile and error ridden the interesting point about this article is that in trying to put mmt down stephen grenfell basically rehearses key mmt concepts without even knowing it 3 tying those operational realities in with milton friedman s free lunch arguments however fails badly when stephen grenfell closes his op ed article with but milton friedman got this part right there is no free lunch he is demonstrating a wilful misunderstanding of what mmt is about and what the free lunch concept was about paying interest on excess reserves is not constrained by scarcity his analogy fails at the most elemental level that is enough for today c copyright 2019 william mitchell all rights

and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term lease payments include fixed and variable payments that are based on an index or a rate if the company s leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit interest rate the company uses internal incremental secured borrowing rates for comparable tenor in the same currency at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments operating and finance lease rou assets also include lease prepayments and initial direct costs but are reduced by lease incentives the lease term may include periods associated with options to extend or exclude periods associated with options to terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the company

into a three level hierarchy established by gaap that prioritizes those inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value based on the degree to which they are observable the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly and level 3 inputs are not observable in the market when possible the estimated fair value is based on quoted market prices and if not available it is based on estimates from third party brokers for non exchange traded derivatives classified in level 2 the company uses standard valuation techniques to calculate fair value primary inputs to these techniques include observable market prices interest fx and commodity and volatility depending on the type of derivative and the nature of the underlying risk the company uses inputs and data used by willing market participants when valuing derivatives and considers its own credit default swap spread as well as those of its counterparties in its determination of fair value all derivatives and long term debt are classified as level 2 the carrying values of financial instruments equal or approximate their fair values with the exception of long term debt in millions of canadian dollars june 30 2019 december 31 2018 long term debt including current maturities fair value 9 972 9 639 carrying value 8 539 8 696 the estimated fair value of current and long term borrowings has been determined based on market information where available or by discounting future payments of principal and interest at estimated interest rates expected to be available to the company at period end b financial risk management derivative financial instruments derivative financial instruments may be used to selectively reduce volatility associated with fluctuations in interest rates fx rates the price of fuel and stock based compensation expense where derivatives are designated as hedging instruments the relationship between the hedging instruments and their associated hedged items is documented as well as the risk management objective and strategy for the use of the hedging instruments this documentation includes linking the derivatives that are designated as fair value or cash flow hedges to specific assets or liabilities on the company s interim consolidated balance sheets commitments or forecasted transactions at the time a derivative contract is entered into and at least quarterly thereafter an assessment is made as to whether the derivative item is effective in offsetting the changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged items the derivative qualifies for hedge accounting treatment if it is effective in substantially mitigating the risk it was designed to address it is not the company s intent to use financial derivatives or commodity instruments for trading or speculative purposes fx management the company conducts business transactions and owns assets in both canada and the united states u s as a result the company is exposed to fluctuations in the value of financial commitments assets liabilities income or cash flows due to changes in fx rates the company may enter into fx risk management transactions primarily to manage fluctuations in the exchange rate between canadian and u s currencies fx exposure is primarily mitigated through natural offsets created by revenues expenditures and balance sheet positions incurred in the same currency where appropriate the company may negotiate with customers and suppliers to reduce the net exposure net investment hedge the fx gains and losses on long term debt are mainly unrealized and can only be realized when u s dollar denominated long term debt matures or is settled the company also has long term fx exposure on its investment in u s affiliates the majority of the company s u s dollar denominated long term debt has been designated as a hedge of the net investment in foreign subsidiaries this designation has the effect of mitigating volatility on net income by offsetting long term fx gains and losses on u s dollar denominated long term debt and gains and losses on its net investment the effect of the net investment hedge recognized in other comprehensive income for the three and six months ended june 30 2019 was an unrealized fx gain of 120 million and 240 million respectively three and six months ended june 30 2018 unrealized fx loss of 122 million and 273 million respectively interest rate management the company is exposed to interest rate risk which is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will vary as a result of changes in market interest rates in order to manage funding needs or capital structure goals the company enters into debt or capital lease agreements that are subject to either fixed market interest rates set at the time of issue or floating rates determined by ongoing market conditions debt subject to variable interest rates exposes the company to variability in interest expense while debt subject to fixed interest rates exposes the company to variability in the fair value of debt to manage interest rate exposure the company accesses diverse sources of financing and manages borrowings in line with a targeted range of capital structure debt ratings liquidity needs maturity schedule and currency and interest rate profiles in anticipation of future debt issuances the company may enter into forward rate agreements that are designated as cash flow hedges to substantially lock in all or a portion of the effective future interest expense the company may also enter into swap agreements designated as fair value hedges to manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt forward starting swaps during the second quarter of 2018 the company settled a notional u s 500 million of forward starting swaps related to the u s 500 million 4 000 10 year notes issued in the same period the fair value of these derivative instruments at the time of settlement was a loss of u s 19 million 24 million the changes in fair value from forward starting swaps for the three and six months ended june 30 2019 was nil three and six months ended june 30 2018

statements of income until the underlying hedged notes are repaid for the three and six months ended june 30 2019 a net loss of 3 million and 5 million respectively related to settled forward starting

certainty it is the opinion of management that their resolution will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations legal proceedings related to lac mégantic rail accident on july 6 2013 a train carrying petroleum crude oil operated by montreal maine and atlantic railway mmar or a subsidiary montreal maine atlantic canada co mmac and collectively the mma group derailed in lac mégantic québec the derailment occurred on a section of railway owned and operated by the mma group the previous day cp had interchanged the train to the mma group and after the interchange the mma group exclusively controlled the train in the wake of the derailment mmac sought court protection in canada under the companies creditors arrangement act r s c 1985 c c 36 and mmar filed for bankruptcy in the united states plans of arrangement have been approved in both canada and the u s the plans these plans provide for the distribution of a fund of approximately 440 million amongst those claiming derailment damages a number of legal proceedings set out below were commenced after the derailment in canada and the u s against cp and others 1 québec s minister of sustainable development environment wildlife and parks the minister ordered various parties including cp to clean up the derailment site the cleanup order cp appealed the cleanup order to the administrative tribunal of québec the taq the minister subsequently served a notice of claim seeking 95 million for compensation spent on cleanup cp filed a contestation of the notice of claim with the taq the taq proceeding cp and the minister agreed to stay the taq proceedings pending the outcome of the province of québec s action described in item 2 below 2 québec s attorney general sued cp in the québec superior court initially claiming 409 million in damages which claim was amended and reduced to 315 million the province s action the province s action alleges that cp exercised custody or control over the petroleum crude oil until its delivery to irving oil and was negligent in that custody and control the province alleges that cp is jointly and severally liable with third parties responsible for the derailment and vicariously liable for the acts and omissions of mmac 3 a class action in the québec superior court on behalf of persons and entities residing in owning or leasing property in operating a business in or physically present in lac mégantic at the time of the derailment the class action was certified against cp mmac and the train conductor mr thomas harding harding the class action seeks unquantified damages including for wrongful death personal injury and property damage arising from the derailment all known wrongful death claimants in the class action have opted out and by court order cannot re join the class action 4 eight subrogated insurers sued cp in the québec superior court initially claiming approximately 16 million in damages which claim was amended and reduced to 14 million the promutuel action and two additional subrogated insurers sued cp in the québec superior court claiming approximately 3 million in damages the royal action both actions contain essentially the same allegations as the province s action the lawsuits do not identify the parties to which the insurers are subrogated and therefore the extent to which these claims overlap with the proof of claims process under the plans is difficult to determine at this stage the royal action has been stayed pending the determination of the consolidated proceedings described below the province s action the class action and the promutuel action have been consolidated and will proceed together through the litigation process in the québec superior court while each action will remain a separate legal proceeding there will be a trial to determine liability issues commencing mid september 2020 and subsequently if necessary a trial to determine damages issues 5 forty eight plaintiffs all individual claims joined in one action sued cp mmac and harding in the québec superior court claiming approximately 5 million in damages for economic loss and pain and suffering these plaintiffs assert essentially the same allegations as those contained in the class action and the province s action against cp the plaintiffs assert they have opted out of the class action all but two of the plaintiffs were plaintiffs in litigation against cp described in paragraph 7 below that originated in the u s who either withdrew their claims or had their case dismissed in the u s 6 an adversary proceeding commenced against cp in november 2014 in the maine bankruptcy court by the mmar u s estate representative estate representative accuses cp of failing to abide by certain regulations the adversary proceeding the estate representative alleges that cp knew or ought to have known that the shipper had misclassified the petroleum crude oil and therefore should have refused to transport it the estate representative seeks damages for mmar s business value as yet unquantified allegedly destroyed by the derailment 7 a class action and mass tort action on behalf of lac mégantic residents and wrongful death representatives commenced in texas in june 2015 and wrongful death and personal injury actions commenced in illinois and maine in june 2015 against cp were all removed and subsequently transferred and consolidated in federal district court in maine the maine actions the maine actions allege that cp negligently misclassified and mis packaged the petroleum crude oil being shipped on cp s motion the maine actions were dismissed by the court on several grounds the plaintiffs are appealing the dismissal decision 8 the trustee the wd trustee for the wrongful death trust the wd trust as defined and established by the estate representative under the plans asserts carmack amendment claims against cp in north dakota federal court the carmack claims the wd trustee seeks to recover approximately 6 million for damaged rail cars and lost crude and recover the settlement amounts the consignor and the consignee paid to the bankruptcy estates alleged to be 110 million and 60 million respectively on cp s motion the district court in north dakota dismissed the carmack claims on timeliness grounds the wd trustee appealed this decision to the eighth circuit court of appeals 8cca who reversed that decision and remanded the matter back to the district court cp sought reconsideration by the 8cca but the 8cca denied rehearing cp filed a petition for judicial review of this decision to the supreme court on february 13 2019 the supreme court denied cp s petition for judicial review on june 3 2019 and the district court set a trial date for august 2020 cp is considering applying for dismissal of the carmack claims on other grounds at this stage of the proceedings any potential responsibility and the quantum of potential losses cannot be determined nevertheless cp denies liability and is vigorously defending the above noted proceedings environmental liabilities environmental remediation accruals recorded on an undiscounted basis unless a reliable determinable estimate as to an amount and timing of costs can be established cover site specific remediation programs the accruals for environmental remediation represent cp s best estimate of its probable future obligation and include both asserted and unasserted claims without reduction for anticipated recoveries from third parties although the recorded accruals include cp s best estimate of all probable costs cp s total environmental remediation costs cannot be predicted with certainty accruals for environmental remediation may change from time to time as new information about previously untested sites becomes known and as environmental laws and regulations evolve and advances are made in environmental remediation technology the accruals may also vary as the courts decide legal proceedings against outside parties responsible for contamination these potential charges which cannot be quantified at this time may materially affect income in the particular period in which a charge is recognized costs related to existing but as yet unknown or future contamination will be accrued in the period in which they become probable and reasonably estimable the expense included in purchased services and other for the three and six months ended june 30 2019 was 1 million and 2 million respectively three and six months ended june 30 2018 1 million and 2 million respectively provisions for environmental remediation costs are recorded in other long term liabilities except for the current portion which is recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities the

uncertainty the ecb s governing council decided to extend the forward guidance on interest rates which are now expected to remain unchanged at least through the first half of 2020 previously end of 2019 financial markets expect interest rates to be cut the deposit facility rate is currently set at 40 bp further easing of monetary policy lower deposit facility rate restarting the asset purchase

consultants and media reports suggest that many charge temporary workers for jobs in canada however few migrants complain and there are few government investigations four consultants were convicted of defrauding migrants in 2018 immigration consultants are usually canadian immigrants or citizens most target their countrymen advertising their services online in their customers language canada issued 340 220 temporary work permits in 2018 and 358 190 visas to foreign students a quarter of the work permits went to low skilled workers whose number is falling after scandals while the number of student visas is rising allegedly because foreign students can work without their canadian employers having to first search for canadian workers the government in june 2019 announced that it would explore giving low skilled migrant farm workers sector specific work permits so they could change employers while in canada workers would have to find another canadian employer who was approved to hire migrants in order to change employers prime minister justin trudeau in june 2019 announced that the 7 billion expansion of the trans mountain pipeline to move alberta oil to british columbian ports would begin in summer 2019 profits from the pipeline expansion will be used to fund alternative energy projects a lack of pipeline capacity has forced some alberta oil to move by train which is more costly and dangerous in exchange for the trans mountain pipeline expansion alberta will introduce carbon taxes vancouver in june 2019 was rocked by the trial of zhao li who killed his cousin in

mexico beginning june 10 2019 to persuade the mexican government to do more to prevent central americans from transiting to the us to apply for asylum trump withdrew the tariffs just before they were to go into effect after mexico agreed to take unprecedented steps to increase enforcement to curb irregular migration by july 2019 mexico had deployed 20 000 members of its newly formed national guard to deter the entry and transit of central americans at its southern border and to prevent unauthorized entries from its northern border into the us mexican authorities apprehended 29 000 unauthorized foreigners in june 2019 and deported 22 000 the national guard combines units of the navy army and federal police federal police in july 2019 protested against inclusion saying that their pay and benefits could be reduced and they could be forced to move from their current posting second mexico agreed to allow the us to implement its migrant protection protocols or the remain in mexico program along the entire border so that migrants entering us ports of entry and applying for asylum can be returned to mexico to wait for hearings before us immigration judges third if stepped up enforcement and remain in mexico do not slow the flow of central american asylum seekers to the us mexico promised to explore becoming a safe third country for asylum seekers meaning that central americans seeking asylum would have to apply there and could be returned to mexico if they entered the us and sought asylum canada and the us adopted a safe third country agreement in 2002 mexico says that it needs additional resources and help from un agencies to become a safe third country advocates say that mexico is not safe and point to internal migration away from southern mexican states such as guerrero which is torn by violence and received the most mexicans deported from the us in fy18 over 20 000 small farmers have long cultivated opium poppies in mountainous areas but criminal gangs fighting over control of the heroin trade have raised the murder rate and prompted people to move to other states some 155 000 mexicans were apprehended just inside the us border in fy18 compared with 226 000 from guatemala el salvador and honduras in 2018 the us imported mexican goods worth 346 billion meaning the us would collect over 17 billion a year in tariffs if trade levels remain unchanged us exports to mexico were worth 265 billion many items cross the border several times as with mexican crude oil that is refined into gasoline and re exported to mexico or auto parts that cross the border several times before being assembled in cars mexico s 570 mile border with guatemala is porous with migrants often crossing the suchiate river on rafts mexico returned 436 125 guatemalans salvadorans and hondurans back to guatemala between january 2015 to september 2018 and deported 9 000 central americans a month in 2019 mexico in june 2019 required long distance buses operating in border states to demand identification such as passports voter identification cards and driver s licenses from passengers to prevent central americans without documents from traveling through mexico critics said that these new id requirements are unconstitutional and discriminate against mexicans who do not have ids guatemala in june 2019 announced that it was ready to sign a safe third country agreement with the us that would require hondurans and salvadorans to apply for asylum in guatemala rather than transit the country through mexico and on to the us some 444 000 guatemalan hondurans and salvadorans were apprehended inside the us border in the first seven months of fy19 most were guatemalans the central america 4 free mobility agreement allows citizens of guatemala honduras el salvador and nicaragua to travel freely between the four countries honduras is a country of nine million with many migrants leaving from san pedro sula 175 000 hondurans were apprehended in the us in first eight months of fy19 up from 76 500 in all of fy18 there are many reasons to leave from one of the world s highest homicide rates to a 60 percent poverty rate in the most unequal country in latin america some 70 percent of hondurans are unemployed or underemployed honduran gdp is 20 billion a year government officials are routinely accused of stealing money meant for social security and aid mexican president andres manuel lopez obrador amlo asked trump for dialogue about migration rather than tariffs mexico continues to issue year long humanitarian residence and work visas to foreigners who apply for asylum and expects over 60 000 asylum applications in 2019 double the 30 000 of 2018 trump s threat to impose tariffs on mexican imports despite nafta and while usmca is being ratified caused an uproar among trade negotiators who warned of damage to us credibility by mixing trade and migration even though the tariffs on mexico were not implemented trade negotiators warned that some businesses will rethink their cross border supply chains because they realize that a tariff could be imposed quickly us critics say that the surging number of central american asylum seekers led to a classic trump response declare a crisis threaten tough action prompt furious negotiations to prevent catastrophe and declare success trump who says that he does not want anyone to know exactly what he is thinking to keep them off balance has used threats more often than any other president mexico s economy expanded two percent in 2018 and is likely to slow to 1 6 percent in 2019 the threat of tariffs led to the downgrading of mexican debt and a fall in the value of the peso to 20 pesos to 1 amlo s government doubled retirement pensions granted stipends to unemployed youth and cancelled a new airport for mexico city while trying to reorganize petroleos mexicanos which has 100 billion in debt labor the mexican congress in april 2019 approved legislation that gives workers

that replaces nafta mexico s labor law changes will end protection unions which are unions that sign agreements with employers before workers are hired so that workers have no vote for their union or contract critics say that protection unions depressed mexican wages under the new labor law unions must win the support of at least 30 percent of the workers in a workplace to be recognized as their bargaining representative the labor ministry is supposed to review the 500 000 contracts signed under the old system that are likely invalid because workers did not vote on them mexican wages declined

an aging cycle rising geopolitical risks and heightened market volatility all seem to threaten the ability of investors to reach their objectives one major result is a renewed focus on the concept of portfolio resilience always good to have but especially important now widely used these days the term resilience sometimes connotes a defensive bias blackrock believes there s more to resilience than that investors need to participate on the upside as well as to mitigate the downside a truly resilient portfolio should be consistent diversified risk aware and flexible with the ability to effectively navigate short term shocks while capitalizing on long term trends how do you build a multi asset portfolio that has these attributes under current market conditions there is of course no one size fits all answer but considering the question from multiple perspectives can help to bring potential solutions to light to that end ii asked two blackrock experts phil green head of global tactical asset allocation and phil hodges head of research for factor based strategies for their thoughts on building resilience for the long term how are you looking to build resilience in today s market environment phil hodges we believe the economy is starting to slow and that the easy money of the equity bull market is largely off the table as a result we think that now is the time to start diversifying portfolios into exposures that can do well in different market environments adding interest rate risk or inflation risk to a portfolio that is heavily exposed to equities and thus to economic growth risk can be a good place to start within an equity portfolio investors may want to consider tilting toward quality or low volatility stocks or both these moves can help investors build resilience while still targeting the returns they need what steps are required to construct a resilient factor based portfolio hodges step one is to determine what actually drives the returns of different asset classes we ve found that six macroeconomic factors economic growth real rates inflation credit emerging markets and liquidity explain more than 90 of the returns across asset classes step two is to balance risk across these fundamental drivers of return because many different asset classes are exposed to the same common sources of risk and return we believe that it s much more effective to diversify your exposure to factors than to asset classes step three is to be very aware of the risks of market extremes and to provide downside mitigation during periods of economic stress this is a crucial component of building resilience into a factor based strategy there are some environments in which even well diversified portfolios are subject to severe drawdowns so you need a process in place that allows you to act nimbly and decisively in adverse environments to try to mitigate losses how does the multi asset factor based strategy you re describing differ from a traditional risk parity approach hodges over the course of many years a variety of multi asset investment approaches have come to be grouped under the term risk parity recent market conditions have impelled many investors to look more carefully at the similarities and differences among these strategies we think that our approach stands apart in two ways one is that we balance factors not asset classes factors are the fundamental building blocks that drive risk and return across asset classes so it makes much more intuitive economic sense to balance factor exposures number two is that we don t actually believe that parity is optimal parity works if all risks are equal but we think that different risk exposures lead to different long term return outcomes we take an active approach to seeking the appropriate balance among the risks in a portfolio different risks also have different tail characteristics and allocating with an awareness of those characteristics can play a key role in improving a portfolio s resilience the bottom line is that we believe in balance not in parity for more information please click here how are you looking to build resilience in today s market environment phil green to build more resilience we start by analyzing the macro environment including the outlooks for economic growth inflation fiscal policy and monetary policy we then draw insights from that analysis and look to see whether or not those insights are priced into asset classes including equities bonds currencies and commodities for example we might determine that the global economy is accelerating from an already high level if that insight is already priced in across asset classes then we won t make any changes to our portfolio but if one or more asset classes are not reflecting that insight we ll increase our position in the asset class that appears to be the most mispriced while also factoring in sentiment crowdedness and possible asymmetrical payoffs what s different about this approach is that we re starting with insights and then looking for the best asset class in which to express those insights rather than just building a portfolio asset class by asset class what often happens when you take an asset class approach to investing is that your exposures within equities bonds and currencies are all correlated because they re all based on the same insights we think it s very important to start with a broad diverse set of insights and then look for asset classes that are attractively priced according to those insights and we believe this approach can help to build better diversified more resilient portfolios a lot of investors think we re nearing the end of the current cycle do you agree i think there is a general consensus that we re in the latter stages of the cycle but that s not entirely clear to us for several years many investors have believed that we re late in the cycle but the cycle seems to continue we think the cycle has further to run and a big reason for that has to do with monetary policy policymakers can have significant impact on market and credit cycles and we think that the fed s new more patient posture as well as the patience we re seeing from other major central banks will allow this cycle to carry on further than some participants appreciate that said we are hyper vigilant about tracking changes that could indicate a turn in the cycle so we re constantly monitoring a multitude of economic indicators in addition to tracking valuations it seems clear that markets have entered a more volatile stage how does that affect your strategy green we actually welcome higher volatility environments increased volatility gives tactical asset allocation taa strategies and other macro strategies increased opportunities to capitalize on changing market prices as taa investors we re looking at two types of volatility first is the obvious one of price volatility across stocks bonds currencies and other asset classes but we re also interested in the volatility of the fundamental variables that i mentioned earlier things like growth inflation central bank policies and other macroeconomic indicators one of things that can drive opportunities for us is the relationship between price volatility and what i d call fundamental volatility in the environment we re in now the volatility of prices is quite a bit higher than the volatility of the fundamentals that we are tracking and we see that as an excellent climate for us to attempt to add value and build resilience for our clients we don t believe that we re going back to the low volatility high return environment that characterized much of the post crisis period when central bank policies effectively amplified the returns and reduced the volatility of most asset classes so when volatility presents opportunity we think that it s critical for institutions to have the flexibility to adjust their strategic asset allocations for more

this morning a former deputy governor of australia s central bank rba published a short op ed in the australian financial review july 16 2019 why there are no free lunches from the rba which served as a veiled critique of modern monetary theory mmt the problem is that the substantive analysis supported the core of the mmt literature that we have developed over 25 years refuted the standard macroeconomics textbook treatment of the link between the government and non government sectors and incorrectly depicted what mmt is about all in one short article not a bad effort i thought but disappointing that a person with such experience and knowledge resorts to perpetuating such crude representations of cost and myths about government finances the author stephen grenville now a consultant to the world bank imf and other like institutions seeks to caution against the current vogue for asking the central bank to fund socially desirable expenditures he is somewhat mistaken to source the start of this vogue as america s quantitative easing qe which started in 2008 japan has been demonstrating what central banks can do in this regard when they adopted qe on march 19 2001 at that point the bank of japan pushed large volumes of excess reserves into the commercial banking system in return for purchases of government and by ensuring there were always excess reserves each day in the cash system they have been able to maintain short term interest rates at zero ever since it is clear that in response to the gfc other central banks the federal reserve in the us the bank of england swiss national bank the sveriges riksbank and the ecb followed suit in varying proportions the motivations were expressed differently but the intent was to militate against the recessionary impacts of declines in non government spending what was held out to the public was a policy approach to push more reserves into the system to enhance the ability of the commercial banks to make loans at times when credit was tight and economic activity was in decline modern monetary theory mmt economists at each phase pointed out that this justification was based on the false mainstream notion that banks loan out reserves and that lending can become reserve constrained the reality is that banks only loan excess reserves among themselves as part of the payments system cheque clearing and that lending is not constrained by deposits and hence reserves mmt economists were the first in the modern era to point out that loans create deposits not the other way around you will never find that proposition in the standard macroeconomics textbooks what follows is that qe cannot influence bank lending in the way claimed by mainstream economists the lack of lending behaviour during the gfc was the result of a shortage of credit worthy borrowers people were simply reluctant to borrow given elevated and precarious debt levels and this constrained the loan books of the banks the only way qe might have been a stimulative measure was in its impact on interest rates at the investment end of the yield curve by purchasing the volumes of government debt that qe achieved the central banks drove up bond prices via higher demand and pushed down yields competition in the financial asset classes at the maturities of the bonds being bought then led to lower interest rates across the board but as we learned in times of heightened economic uncertainty people will not borrow even as the cost of funds fall if they lack confidence in the returns that the projects might deliver into the future stephen grenville claims that qe is printing money and that the revival of modern monetary theory mmt promotes the same idea first i am not sure the term revival is very descriptive it suggests that mmt had a day in the sun faded and now is shining again i think it is more accurate to think of mmt as a growing body of work which people are finding out about slowly but surely and realising that it helps them understand the dissonance between what mainstream economists are saying and predicting and what mmt says second to characterise mmt as advocating printing money is of course incorrect and demonstrates a rather superficial knowledge of the core literature the term is also loaded and critics know that and use it intentionally it invokes years of characterisations of out of control central bankers goaded by government officials running printing presses at ever increasing speeds and people wandering the streets carrying wheelbarrows full of bank notes to buy a loaf of bread stephen grenville adds some weight to his accusation claiming that mmt says it appears that budgets can be funded costlessly by printing money because money doesn t pay interest sadly this seemingly costless funding source isn t in fact a free lunch i will come back to this claim after going through the logic of his argument that logic actually correctly depicts the way the central bank interacts with the commercial banks and the impacts of government deficits on the banking system in that sense it captures what mmt economists have been writing about for over 25 years it also exposes the lack of insights in the mainstream macroeconomics i believe our new mmt textbook macroeconomics is the only one on the market that actually gets this all down correctly so stephen grenville is in fact while trying to critique mmt unwittingly defending core components of our analysis and unintentionally providing a sound critique of mainstream money and banking analysis he considers two scenarios first suppose the central bank funds infrastructure expenditures receiving in return some kind of zero interest government iou note he thinks of the central bank as being separate from the government when in fact central banks are legal and politicial creatures of the government and have to work daily in close cooperation with the treasury arm of government in their liquidity management functions but lets play along with the story in other words the government tells the central bank to pay some bills to say road building companies etc and offers them a bit of paper in return bearing no interest the central bank credits the bank accounts of the infrastructure providers or in stephen grenville s words creates central bank money there is no money multiplier operative as in the mainstream textbooks stephen grenville s version of this is that the banks are already lending to all the borrowers who are judged to be bankable which is another way of saying that loans create deposits not the other way around the latter being required for the operations of the fictional money multiplier and if banks are lending to all the credit worthy borrowers requesting credit then they will not create any further deposits so what fiscal deficits do in this case is expand excess reserves after all the transactions are exhausted the liquidity injection from the net public spending shows up as excess bank reserves these are held in accounts the commercial banks have to hold with the central bank i detail that process in detail in this introductory suite of blog posts 1 deficit spending 101 part 1 february 21 2009 2 deficit spending 101 part 2 february 23 2009 3 deficit spending 101 part 3 march 2 2009 in stephen grenville s words the bank deposits the excess funds with the central bank in the form of bank reserves pure mmt so what is his point well because central banks just about everywhere pay a market related rate of interest on reserves thus the expenditure is funded by the banking system holding excess reserves on which the central bank pays a market related interest no free lunch here just a distortion of the banks balance sheets holding more reserves than they need it would be better if this expenditure were to be funded in the conventional way by the government issuing bonds to the public first whether central banks pay a market related rate of interest on reserves is a policy choice the rba pays an interest rate on es balances that is 0 25 percentage points below the cash rate target source es balances are the exchange settlement accounts reserves that banks are reequired to maintain with the central bank since the gfc the us federal reserve pays an ioer interest on excess reserves currently set at 2 35 per cent as at february 5 2019 this is in line with the the target range for the federal funds rate at 2 1 4 to 2 1 2 percent source the bank of japan has a different policy approach to excess reserves it deploys a three tier approach to which a positive interest rate a zero interest rate and a negative interest rate are applied respectively the three tier system encourages negative interest rate transactions in the money market source this exempts some proportion of the excess reserves from the negative rate applied at the margin i may write about tiered reserve systems separately given that the ecb is toying with the introduction along the japanese lines the point is that it is a policy decision whether to leave excess reserves in the system to drive the short term interest rates down to zero as banks compete to offload their excesses onto other banks as stephen grenville acknowledges the banks can swap these reserves among themselves but the banking system as a whole can t get rid of the excess central bank money another pure mmt proposition that you won t find articulated in mainstream textbooks and if there is no return offered banks with excesses on a particular day will try to loan them to banks facing shortfalls but if there is a system wide surplus this activity is fraught and only results in the yields dropping on the loans in the interbank market to zero so if a central bank desires a non zero policy rate then it has to either sell interest bearing bonds to the banks to drain these reserves or just pay them a market rate for holding the excesses a policy choice second the concept of cost that stephen grenville invokes lacks any sense he seeks to exploit the concept of there ain t no such thing as a free lunch which milton friedman s 1975 book there is no such thing as a free lunch advanced as part of his attack on government activity but alleging that an interest payment from the central bank is somehow a cost in the sense that friedman and others use the term no free lunch is invalid friedman was talking about real resource scarcity and in an environment that sort of scarcity is a binding constraint there is an opportunity cost involved in making choices if we choose to use a resource in one way then it cannot be used in another way the choice thus influences the net benefits that flow from that resource usage against the usage foregone friedman and his clan always claimed that government usage of productive resources led to inferior outcomes because the free market did not discipline the choice so in economics the free lunch metaphor is about opportunity cost at the heart of mainstream economics is the claim by say gregory mankiw that to get one thing that we like we usually have to give up another thing that we like making decisions requires trading off one goal against another of course the concept is difficult to sustain at a macro level if there are idle resources that is productive resources that are being wasted as a result of unemployment then for a time the opportunity costs are low to zero and there is a free lunch now ask yourself what the next best alternative use of an interest payment made by the currency issuer is when that payment is accomplished by the stroke of a computer key and comes from nowhere in his famous paper fifteen fatal fallacies of financial fundamentalism october 5 1996 american economist william vickrey discussed said that much of the conventional economic wisdom prevailing in financial circles largely subscribed to as a basis for governmental policy and widely accepted by the media and the public is based on incomplete analysis contrafactual assumptions and false analogy he noted that these fallacies lead to the assumption that future economic output is almost entirely determined by inexorable economic forces independently of government policy so that devoting more resources to one use inevitably detracts from availability for another he also accepted that this might be justifiable in an economy at chock full employment but when economic policy is keeping us in the economic doldrums with overall unemployment rates stuck in the 5 to 6 percent range the loss of 10 to 15 percent of our potential production unemployment of 10 20 and 40 percent among disadvantaged groups the further damages in terms of poverty family breakup school truancy and dropout illegitimacy drug use and crime become serious indeed in these situations claiming there is no free lunch is simply absurd ideological nonsense his 15 fallacies document beautifully what remains problematic with mainstream macroeconomics and the type of reasoning stephen grenfell tries to invoke in the article under discussion they relate to the standard arguments of sound finance you should know them all by now they are the core propositions that mmt undermines william vickrey wrote that these fallacious notions which seem to be widely held in various forms by those close to the seats of economic power are leading to policies that are not only cruel but unnecessary and even self defeating in terms of their professed objectives we will not get out of the economic doldrums as long as we continue to be governed by fallacious notions that are based on false analogies one sided analysis and an implicit underlying counterfactual assumption of an inevitable level of unemployment and in conclusion he wrote with considerable eloquence that to assure against such a disaster and start on the road to real prosperity it is necessary to relinquish our unreasoned ideological obsession with reducing government deficits recognize that it is the economy and not the government budget that needs balancing in terms of the demand for and supply of assets and proceed to recycle attempted savings into the income stream at an adequate rate so that they will not simply vanish in reduced income sales output and employment there is too a free lunch out there indeed a very substantial one but it will require getting free from the dogmas of the apostles of austerity most of whom would not share in the sacrifices they recommend for others the point is that a core principle of mmt is a recognition that what constrains government spending are the available real resources that can be purchased and put into productive use or diverted from other uses whether there is scarcity or not depends on the state of utilisation of the resources available to a nation that assessment then determines what policy interventions might be appropriate but there are no real constraints on the central bank paying interest on excess reserves should they decide to do so from an mmt perspective there is no reason for the central bank to do so just as there is no reason to match fiscal deficits with debt issuance stephen grenfell s second scenario is in his words closer to the printing money idea that the government can pay with interest free liabilities so instead of crediting the bank accounts of the infrastructure supplier he posits that the central bank loads up some delivery vans with actual bank notes and pays the supplier accordingly what happens then well in his words the contractors don t want the cash nor do they want to splurge it on bidding up prices as milton friedman warned instead they deposit it with their bank the bank doesn t want the cash either so it gives it back to the central bank in return for bank reserves we re back at the same place which is pure mmt operational intelligence you won t find this sort of logic in any mainstream macroeconomics textbook students in mainstream programs are taught the milton friedman line that inflation would ensue at least stephen grenfell is experienced enough to understand that the inflation risk is embedded in the spending decision not how that spending is made operational his next logical statement is that the central bank money ends up as bank reserves on which the central bank has to pay interest again note that whether the central bank pays interest on excess reserves is a policy choice it clearly doesn t have to do so and the next link in his logic train fails similarly this interest payment may not show up as a line item in the budget but if the central bank has to pay additional interest on reserves it makes a smaller operating surplus and hence pays a smaller dividend to the government bank reserves may not be included in the total of public debt but this is an accounting omission these are a clear liability of the central bank and should be included in any comprehensive enumeration of public debt this is the left hand pocket transferring something to the right hand pocket misnomer the fact that the accounting records of the central bank records a lower operating surplus because they have provided more income to the non government sector interest on reserves does not reduce its capacity to credit bank accounts or load up vans with cash it wouldn t even matter if the central bank recorded a perpetual accounting loss and had negative capital the currency issuer cannot go broke further the fact that the treasury then records a lower surplus or higher deficit because the accounting flows from the left pocket don t appear in the right pocket is also largely irrelevant for assessing the capacity of the government to net spend in the next period remember the public debt at any point in time is just the accounting record of past fiscal deficits that have not yet been taxed away it is true that if we want to consolidate the liabilities of the government sector overall then bank reserves would be added to outstanding public debt but what would that tell us that was interesting not much at all please read the following blog posts among others for more discussion of these themes 1 the ecb cannot go broke get over it may 11 2012 2 the us federal reserve is on the brink of insolvency not november 18 2010 3 better off studying the mating habits of frogs september 14 2011 4 central bank independence another faux agenda may 26 2010 5 the consolidated government treasury and central bank august 20 2010 conclusion so you see that 1 the public debate is indeed shifting and op ed contributions from otherwise mainstream commentators are starting to invoke the frames that mmt has introduced to the public sphere you will not find analysis such as offered by stephen grenfell in any conventional money and banking textbook so that is a positive trend part of getting people to reach an mmt understanding is to get them to use mmt frames and language 2 the characterisation of mmt in the public debate by those intent on criticism remains facile and error ridden the interesting point about this article is that in trying to put mmt down stephen grenfell basically rehearses key mmt concepts without even knowing it 3 tying those operational realities in with milton friedman s free lunch arguments however fails badly when stephen grenfell closes his op ed article with but milton friedman got this part right there is no free lunch he is demonstrating a wilful misunderstanding of what mmt is about and what the free lunch concept was about paying interest on excess reserves is not constrained by scarcity his analogy fails at the most elemental level that is enough for today c copyright 2019 william mitchell all rights

with brent d griffiths the ticker fresh off getting slapped with a record breaking 5 billion fine from the federal trade commission facebook is facing new pushback this week from both the administration and congress over its proposal to roll out a digital currency the backlash suggests the social media giant faces a steep climb to win regulatory approval for libra the cryptocurrency it aims to roll out as soon as next year it also highlights how far the stock of silicon valley s tech titans have fallen with washington policymakers from faultless pioneers of the new economy to potentially dangerous monopolists whose power needs to be checked facebook s immediate challenge with libra and its broader struggle against new animus from washington decision makers will both be on display today david marcus head of the company s blockchain division will be on the hot seat before the senate banking committee he will seek to reassure senators that libra will comply with regulators demands police money laundering and terrorist financing and remain transparent and consumer friendly per a preview of his testimony from the post s hannah denham advertisement meanwhile across capitol hill executives from facebook google amazon and apple will face a grilling from the house judiciary committee s subcommittee on antitrust enforcement the companies competitors including yelp ceo jeffrey stoppelman and representatives from spotify have been laying the groundwork for the hearing by making the rounds on the hill axios s david mccabe reported amazon founder and chief executive jeff bezos owns the washington post facebook has complicated the task of playing defense against antitrust charges by deciding simultaneously to go on offense with its ambitious cryptocurrency plan and the company s lobbying push on the issue is coming up short politico s zachary warmbrodt writes per warmbrodt key lawmakers and aides from both parties said in interviews that they had not yet had the chance to meet with facebook or had gotten incomplete at times conflicting information from briefings involving the company and the company has been doing an unsatisfactory job explaining a complex undertaking even lawmakers and aides who spoke with representatives of facebook in briefings during the last few weeks walked away feeling like they didn t have the full story part of the confusion has arisen from the fact that even though facebook is spearheading libra and will operate a digital wallet dubbed calibra based on the coin the currency is set to be managed by a switzerland based non profit called the libra association that will include companies in addition to facebook libra has also drawn a chilly early reception from top regulators the company has tried to pitch the product as an alternative for billions of facebook users who can t get access to traditional banking but treasury secretary steven mnuchin on monday said the potential for criminal or terrorist misuse of the currency makes it a national security concern we will not allow digital asset service providers to operate in the shadows and will not tolerate the use of the cryptocurrencies in support of illicit activities he said while he said he hasn t decided to oppose libra s rollout he added he is not comfortable today with the plan and facebook has a lot of work to do to convince regulators advertisement president trump weighed in on the matter last week stating he is not a fan of cryptocurrencies and suggesting facebook may need a banking charter to proceed with libra that amounted to a rare point of agreement between trump and federal reserve chair jerome powell who said in testimony before the house financial services committee last week he has many serious concerns about the plan while the project s sponsors hold out the possibility of public benefits including improved financial access for consumers libra raises many serious concerns regarding privacy money laundering consumer protection and financial stability powell said these are concerns that should be thoroughly and publicly addressed before proceeding marcus is set to tell congress that he agrees with powell that the regulatory review of libra needs to be thorough and the company won t proceed with a rollout it gets a green light from the feds the time between now and launch is designed to be an open process and subject to regulatory oversight and review marcus said prepared testimony and i want to be clear facebook will not offer the libra digital currency until we have fully addressed

trade adviser told reporters the order would reinforce the administration s buy american preferences by requiring that 95 percent of steel and iron used in federal contracts be american made despite trump s repeated claims that the tariffs have refashioned the american steel industry their most tangible impact may have been widening the gap between companies such as u s steel that use costly legacy blast furnaces and companies such as nucor that use cheaper more efficient electric arc furnaces and his tariffs aren t covering the trade war s costs the new york times s ana swanson and jim tankersley trump on monday portrayed america as being on the winning end of his trade war saying tariffs are punishing china s economy while generating billions of dollars for the united states an economic victory that will allow him to continue his fight without domestic harm advertisement but government figures show that the revenue the united states has collected from tariffs on 250 billion worth of chinese goods is not enough to cover the cost of the president s bailout for farmers let alone compensate the many other industries hurt by trade tensions the longer mr trump s dispute with china drags on the more difficult it could be for him to ignore that gap china s stimulus isn t working a strategy by chinese policy makers to stimulate the economy with tax and fee cuts hasn t

an aging cycle rising geopolitical risks and heightened market volatility all seem to threaten the ability of investors to reach their objectives one major result is a renewed focus on the concept of portfolio resilience always good to have but especially important now widely used these days the term resilience sometimes connotes a defensive bias blackrock believes there s more to resilience than that investors need to participate on the upside as well as to mitigate the downside a truly resilient portfolio should be consistent diversified risk aware and flexible with the ability to effectively navigate short term shocks while capitalizing on long term trends how do you build a fixed income portfolio that has these attributes under current market conditions there is of course no one size fits all answer but considering the question from multiple perspectives can help to bring potential solutions to light to that end ii asked two blackrock experts rick rieder chief investment officer and co head of global fixed income and james keenan chief investment officer and global co head of credit for their thoughts on building resilience for the long term how do you build a resilient fixed income portfolio in today s environment rieder we re really focused on what i call efficient portfolio construction we run some very sophisticated analytics to assess things like beta risk volatility and dispersion with an eye toward understanding how all of the assets in a portfolio are interrelated one very important theme that arises from this analysis is the renewed role that treasuries can play as a hedge in a portfolio in this environment we think interest rates are likely to remain range bound for the near term which means investors can once again use duration as a hedge to build more durable portfolios at the same time we re faced with a slower global growth dynamic so we think it s important to be cautious around credit risk we have a high quality bias across our allocation to credit that we rely upon to source durable income in areas like high yield we are very selective and favor idiosyncratic opportunities rather than broad index exposure how do you approach risk management in your portfolios rieder we believe in casting an extremely broad net in search of returns and in taking a cautious deliberate and flexible approach to both investment selection and risk management we avoid concentrated bets and instead seek out the many and diverse sources of alpha that markets offer in our experience targeting a wide array of incremental return opportunities without being tied to a benchmark can help keep volatility low while enabling investors to seek returns across different market environments and cycles we also spend a lot of time looking at marginal contribution of risk we want to understand how every individual asset and every sector that we re considering adding to a portfolio would impact the risk of the overall portfolio if you can understand that we think you have a much better chance of building a stable resilient portfolio that doesn t experience massive up and down swings even when markets come under pressure our goal is not necessarily to have the best performance in up markets but we definitely want to avoid having the worst performance in down markets we want to create consistent returns for our clients and the portfolio construction and risk management strategies that i just described really form the backbone of our approach which market or macro risks are you most concerned about rieder there are two things that come to mind the first is china i think a lot of people underestimate how important china has become to the global economy and by extension to global financial markets when you look at china s contribution to global growth its importance to commodities markets the amount of debt on its books these are all variables that can have a tremendous impact on market outcomes to be clear i don t think china is headed for an imminent hard landing but i do think that investors need to monitor the situation there very closely if they want to build resilient portfolios the second risk is what i call short volatility liquidity there are many more ways to take a short position in volatility than there were in the past and a lot of investors piled into various short volatility trades over the past several years of relative market calm but when markets come under stress the liquidity in a lot of these trades can evaporate so i think you need to be really careful about how you manage your liquidity how you diversify your portfolio and how those decisions will impact your performance in unstable environments credit is often viewed as a risky asset class how can an allocation contribute to the resilience of an investor s overall portfolio keenan we view credit as a strategic asset in a broadly diversified portfolio credit exists in the space between equity risk and traditional fixed income equity returns are based on expectations of future earnings whereas sub investment grade credit returns are based on the likelihood of default both returns factor in earnings expectations but because credit is senior to equity in the capital structure an allocation to credit may reduce the volatility and drawdown risk associated with an equity portfolio from the perspective of a bond investor adding credit to a fixed income portfolio can introduce diversifying sources of risk and return for example an allocation to credit can be used to reduce duration and make the overall portfolio less susceptible to changes in interest rates how should investors be thinking about allocating to credit given where we are in the cycle keenan i think you need to start with a historical perspective for many decades we were in a boom and bust environment that culminated in the global financial crisis during that era it was critical to move to a much more defensive position as we got later in the cycle in order to invest after the dislocation or the pullback we re always going to have credit cycles but we think that an important shift occurred after the financial crisis in the last ten years we ve seen assets and leverage move from the household sector and the banking sector onto government and central bank balance sheets when we think about that structural change we believe that the end of cycle tail risks and liquidity shock risks are lower than they have been historically we think the cycles are probably going to be more frequent and milder to both the upside and the downside so if we re no longer living in a boom and bust world but we are living in a world of low growth low returns and low inflation we believe there is a strong case to be made for a long term allocation to credit how are you looking to build resilience in your portfolios in the current environment keenan we believe in looking across the full spectrum of credit opportunities credit is an asset class that has become more accessible to investors over the past decade as the market has grown and bank financing has shrunk this larger investable universe allows you to build resilience through diversity across industries geographies and liquidities at this late stage of the credit cycle we look for companies with stable cash flows in non cyclical industries and in our liquid portfolios we have a higher quality bias we also take advantage of the growth of credit markets in europe and asia to gain exposure across different stages of the economic cycle and by giving up some liquidity we see opportunities to pick up additional yield for comparable credit quality in the private market we think the global monetary policy environment will extend the current credit cycle and the risk of recession has come down from last year this is a supportive environment for credit nevertheless we re still underweight companies in cyclical industries and those with already slow earnings that we think would suffer the most if economic growth slows you mentioned private assets what role can they play in a credit portfolio keenan if you believe that we re going to be in a low growth low return environment for some time and we do then i think you have to ask yourself how you re going to meet your long term return objectives trying to achieve reasonable return targets in this environment requires taking on some additional exposures in our view when you move into private markets assets like direct lending opportunistic credit or dislocation strategies you may be able to harness an illiquidity premium or a complexity premium on top of the spread premium that you re getting in public markets this can obviously improve your long term return profile but it can also improve the resiliency of your portfolio via exposure to these diversifying sources of return for more information please click here capital at risk all financial investments involve an

good tuesday want this by email sign up here tariffs on china don t cover the cost of the trade war president trump says his trade fight with beijing is hurting china s economy while generating billions of dollars for the u s that s not entirely true tariffs are undeniably hurting china where exports power about 20 percent of the economy compared with 12 percent in the united states ana swanson and jim tankersley of the nyt write on monday the chinese government said its economy had grown at a 6 2 percent annual rate in the second quarter the lowest rate in 27 years but there is little sign that china s loss is america s gain business activity that is shifting from china is largely headed to other low cost countries like vietnam with a transition cost attached for american companies that depend on them and income from tariffs is more than offset by costs the u s has raised 20 8 billion from tariffs on 250 billion worth of chinese goods through last wednesday according to data from customs and border protection but mr trump has already committed to paying 28 billion in subsidies to american farmers hurt by the trade war and numerous studies have shown that u s consumers are bearing costs from the tariffs

it s an epidemic with life and death significance for a pivotal portion of trump s base but the president has paid no attention to the way it is afflicting u s civilians writes rajan menon by rajan melon tomdispatch com we hear a lot about suicide when celebrities such as anthony bourdain and kate spade die by their own hand otherwise it seldom makes the headlines that s odd given the magnitude of the problem in 2017 47 173 americans killed themselves in that single year in other words the suicide count was nearly seven times greater than the number of american soldiers killed in the afghanistan and iraq wars between 2001 and 2018 a suicide occurs in the united states roughly once every 12 minutes what s more after decades of decline the rate of self inflicted deaths per 100 000 people annually the suicide rate has been increasing sharply since the late 1990s suicides now claim two and a half times as many lives in this country as do homicides even though the murder rate gets so much more attention in other words we re talking about a national epidemic of self inflicted deaths worrisome numbers anyone who has lost a close relative or friend to suicide or has worked on a suicide hotline as i have knows that statistics transform the individual the personal and indeed the mysterious aspects of that violent act why this person why now why in this manner into depersonalized abstractions still to grasp how serious the suicide epidemic has become numbers are a necessity according to a 2018 centers for disease control study between 1999 and 2016 the suicide rate increased in every state in the union except nevada which already had a remarkably high rate in 30 states it jumped by 25 percent or more in 17 by at least a third nationally it increased 33percent in some states the upsurge was far higher north dakota 57 6 percent new hampshire 48 3 percent kansas 45 percent idaho 43 percent alas the news only gets grimmer since 2008 suicide has ranked 10th among the causes of death in this country for americans between the ages of 10 and 34 however it comes in second for those between 35 and 45 fourth the united states also has the ninth highest rate in the 38 country organization for economic cooperation and development globally it ranks 27th more importantly the trend in the united states doesn t align with what s happening elsewhere in the developed world the world health organization for instance reports that great britain canada and china all have notably lower suicide rates than the u s as do all but six countries in the european union japan s is only slightly lower world bank statistics show that worldwide the suicide rate fell from 12 8 per 100 000 in 2000 to 10 6 in 2016 it s been falling in china japan where it has declined steadily for nearly a decade and is at its lowest point in 37 years most of europe and even countries like south korea and russia that have a significantly higher suicide rate than the united states in russia for instance it has dropped by nearly 26 percent from a high point of 42 per 100 000 in 1994 to 31 in 2019 we know a fair amount about the patterns of suicide in the united states in 2017 the rate was highest for men between the ages of 45 and 64 30 per 100 000 and those 75 and older 39 7 per 100 000 the rates in rural counties are almost double those in the most urbanized ones which is why states like idaho kansas new hampshire and north dakota sit atop the suicide list furthermore a far higher percentage of people in rural states own guns than in cities and suburbs leading to a higher rate of suicide involving firearms the means used in half of all such acts in this country there are gender based differences as well from 1999 to 2017 the rate for men was substantially higher than for women almost four and a half times higher in the first of those years slightly more than three and a half times in the last education is also a factor the suicide rate is lowest among individuals with college degrees those who at best completed high school are by comparison twice as likely to kill themselves suicide rates also tend to be lower among people in higher income brackets the economics of stress this surge in the suicide rate has taken place in years during which the working class has experienced greater economic hardship and psychological stress increased competition from abroad and outsourcing the results of globalization have contributed to job loss particularly in economic sectors like manufacturing steel and mining that had long been mainstays of employment for such workers the jobs still available often paid less and provided fewer benefits technological change including computerization robotics and the coming of artificial intelligence has similarly begun to displace labor in significant ways leaving americans without college degrees especially those 50 and older in far more difficult straits when it comes to finding new jobs that pay well the lack of anything resembling an industrial policy of a sort that exists in europe has made these dislocations even more painful for american workers while a sharp decline in private sector union membership down from nearly 17 percent in 1983 to 6 4 percent today has reduced their ability to press for higher wages through collective bargaining furthermore the inflation adjusted median wage has barely budged over the last four decades even as ceo salaries have soared and a decline in worker productivity doesn t explain it between 1973 and 2017 productivity increased by 77 percent while a worker s average hourly wage only rose by 12 4 percent wage stagnation has made it harder for working class americans to get by let alone have a lifestyle comparable to that of their parents or grandparents the gap in earnings between those at the top and bottom of american society has also increased a lot since 1979 the wages of americans in the 10th percentile increased by a pitiful 1 2 percent those in the 50th percentile did a bit better making a gain of 6 percent by contrast those in the 90th percentile increased by 34 3 percent and those near the peak of the wage pyramid the top 1 percent and especially the rarefied 0 1 percent made far more substantial gains and mind you we re just talking about wages not other forms of income such as large stock dividends expensive homes or eyepopping inheritances the share of net national wealth held by the richest 0 1 percent increased from 10 percent in the 1980s to 20 percent in 2016 by contrast the share of the bottom 90 percent shrank in those same decades from about 35 percent to 20 percent as for the top 1 percent by 2016 its share had increased to almost 39percent the precise relationship between economic inequality and suicide rates remains unclear and suicide certainly can t simply be reduced to wealth disparities or financial stress still strikingly in contrast to the united states suicide rates are noticeably lower and have been declining in western european countries where income inequalities are far less pronounced publicly funded healthcare is regarded as a right not demonized as a pathway to serfdom social safety nets far more extensive and apprenticeships and worker retraining programs more widespread evidence from the united states brazil japan and sweden does indicate that as income inequality increases so does the suicide rate if so the good news is that progressive economic policies should democrats ever retake the white house and the senate could make a positive difference a study based on state by state variations in the u s found that simply boosting the minimum wage and earned income tax credit by 10 percent appreciably reduces the suicide rate among people without college degrees the race enigma one aspect of the suicide epidemic is puzzling though whites have fared far better economically and in many other ways than african americans their suicide rate is significantly higher it increased from 11 3 per 100 000 in 2000 to 15 85 per 100 000 in 2017 for african americans in those years the rates were 5 52 per 100 000 and 6 61 per 100 000 black men are 10 times more likely to be homicide victims than white men but the latter are two and half times more likely to kill themselves the higher suicide rate among whites as well as among people with only a high school diploma highlights suicide s disproportionate effect on working class whites this segment of the population also accounts for a disproportionate share of what economists anne case and angus deaton have labeled deaths of despair those caused by suicides plus opioid overdoses and liver diseases linked to alcohol abuse though it s hard to offer a complete explanation for this economic hardship and its ripple effects do appear to matter according to a study by the st louis federal reserve the white working class accounted for 45 percent of all income earned in the united states in 1990 but only 27 percent in 2016 in those same years its share of national wealth plummeted from 45 percent to 22 percent and as inflation adjusted wages have decreased for men without college degrees many white workers seem to have lost hope of success of any sort paradoxically the sense of failure and the accompanying stress may be greater for white workers precisely because they traditionally were much better off economically than their african american and hispanic counterparts in addition the fraying of communities knit together by employment in once robust factories and mines has increased social isolation among them and the evidence that it along with opioid addiction and alcohol abuse increases the risk of suicide is strong on top of that a significantly higher proportion of whites than blacks and hispanics own firearms and suicide rates are markedly higher in states where gun ownership is more widespread trump s faux populism the large increase in suicide within the white working class began a couple of decades before donald trump s election still it s reasonable to ask what he s tried to do about it particularly since votes from these americans helped propel him to the white house in 2016 he received 64 percent of the votes of whites without college degrees hillary clinton only 28 percent nationwide he beat clinton in counties where deaths of despair rose significantly between 2000 and 2015 white workers will remain crucial to trump s chances of winning in 2020 yet while he has spoken about and initiated steps aimed at reducing the high suicide rate among veterans his speeches and tweets have never highlighted the national suicide epidemic or its inordinate impact on white workers more importantly to the extent that economic despair contributes to their high suicide rate his policies will only make matters worse the real benefits from the december 2017 tax cuts and jobs act championed by the president and congressional republicans flowed to those on the top steps of the economic ladder by 2027 when the act s provisions will run out the wealthiest americans are expected to have captured 81 8 percent of the gains and that s not counting the windfall they received from recent changes in taxes on inheritances trump and the gop doubled the annual amount exempt from estate taxes wealth bequeathed to heirs through 2025 from 5 6 million per individual to 11 2 million or 22 4 million per couple and who benefits most from this act of generosity not workers that s for sure but every household with an estate worth 22 million or more will as for job retraining provided by the workforce innovation and opportunity act the president proposed cutting that program by 40percent in his 2019 budget later settling for keeping it at 2017 levels future cuts seem in the cards as long as trump is in the white house the congressional budget office projects that his tax cuts alone will produce even bigger budget deficits in the years to come the shortfall last year was 779 billion and it is expected to reach 1 trillion by 2020 inevitably the president and congressional republicans will then demand additional reductions in spending for social programs this is all the more likely because trump and those republicans also slashed corporate taxes from 35percent to 21 percent an estimated 1 4 trillion in savings for corporations over the next decade and unlike the income tax cut the corporate tax has no end date the president assured his base that the big bucks those companies had stashed abroad would start flowing home and produce a wave of job creation all without adding to the deficit as it happens however most of that repatriated cash has been used for corporate stock buy backs which totaled more than 800 billion last year that in turn boosted share prices but didn t exactly rain money down on workers no surprise of course since the wealthiest 10percent of americans own at least 84 percent of all stocks and the bottom 60percent have less than 2 percent of them and the president s corporate tax cut hasn t produced the tsunami of job generating investments he predicted either indeed in its aftermath more than 80 percent of american companies stated that their plans for investment and hiring hadn t changed as a result the monthly increase in jobs has proven unremarkable compared to president obama s second term when the economic recovery that trump largely inherited began yes the economy did grow 2 3 percent in 2017 and 2 9 percent in 2018 though not 3 1 percent as the president claimed there wasn t however any unprecedented economic boom a boom that has rarely been seen before as he insisted in this year s state of the union address anyway what matters for workers struggling to get by is growth in real wages and there s nothing to celebrate on that front between 2017 and mid 2018 they actually declined by 1 63 percent for white workers and 2 5 percent for african americans while they rose for hispanics by a measly 0 37 percent and though trump insists that his beloved tariff hikes are going to help workers they will actually raise the prices of goods hurting the working class and other low income americans the most then there are the obstacles those susceptible to suicide face in receiving insurance provided mental health care if you re a white worker without medical coverage or have a policy with a deductible and co payments that are high and your income while low is too high to qualify for medicaid trump and the gop haven t done anything for you never mind the president s tweet proclaiming that the republican party will become the party of healthcare the republican party will become the party of healthcare donald j trump realdonaldtrump march 26 2019 let me amend that actually they have done something it s just not what you d call helpful the percentage of uninsured adults which fell from 18percent in 2013 to 10 9 percent at the end of 2016 thanks in no small measure to obamacare had risen to 13 7 percent by the end of last year the bottom line on a problem that literally has life and death significance for a pivotal portion of his base trump has been awol in fact to the extent that economic strain contributes to the alarming suicide rate among white workers his policies are only likely to exacerbate what is already a national crisis of epidemic proportions rajan menon a tomdispatch regular is the anne and bernard spitzer professor of international relations at the powell school city college of new

million including 158 million from the oak bank acquisition or 11 on an annualized basis net interest income increased by 4 2 million as the impact of a 797 million increase in average earning assets was partially offset by an eight basis point decline in net interest margin mortgage banking production revenue increased by 13 3 million as mortgage originations for sale totaled 1 2 billion in the second quarter of 2019 as compared to 678 million in the first quarter of 2019 other highlights of the second quarter of 2019 total period end loans were 751 million higher than average total loans in

completed the oak bank acquisition with one branch in the city of chicago announced an agreement to acquire stc bancshares corp the parent company of stc capital bank which is expected to close in the third quarter of 2019 edward j wehmer president and chief executive officer commented wintrust reported net income of 81 5 million for the second quarter of 2019 down from 89 1 million in the first quarter of 2019 the company experienced strong balance sheet growth as total assets were 1 3 billion higher than the prior quarter end and 4 2 billion higher than the second quarter of 2018 the second quarter was characterized by strong balance sheet growth increased mortgage banking revenue resolution of problem credits and a continued focus to increase franchise value in our market area mr wehmer continued this quarter demonstrated our asset driven mentality as we generated high quality assets while leveraging our retail banking footprint to grow core deposit funding the company experienced significant loan growth in the quarter as total loans grew by 1 1 billion and the yield on loans remained relatively flat to the prior quarter additionally the loan growth was diversified across various loan portfolios as we experienced growth of 380 million of commercial premium finance receivables 303 million of commercial real estate loans and 277 million of commercial loans total deposits increased by 714 million in the current quarter although the rate on interest bearing deposits increased by eight basis points we remain aggressive in growing quality assets that meet our standards and will seek to fund that by expanding deposit market share and household penetration mr wehmer noted our mortgage banking business production increased dramatically in the current quarter as loan volumes originated for sale increased to 1 2 billion from 678 million in the first quarter of 2019 the favorable increase in origination volume was a result of the seasonal purchase market combined with increased refinance activity due to the declining interest rate environment declining long term interest rates also contributed to a 4 1 million reduction in our mortgage servicing rights portfolio related to payoffs and paydowns as well as a 3 4 million reduction due to changes in fair value assumptions net of hedging gain however those declines were more than offset by capitalization of retained servicing rights of 9 8 million in the current quarter we continue to focus on efficiencies in our delivery channels and our operating costs in our mortgage banking area we believe that the mortgage rate outlook bodes well for mortgage origination demand in future quarters commenting on credit quality mr wehmer stated during the current quarter the company recorded 24 6 million of provision for credit losses and 22 3 million of net charge offs of which 15 2 million of provision for credit losses and 18 4 million of net charge offs related to three credits this contributed to a four basis point reduction in non performing loans as a percent of total loans to 0 45 the company recorded additional provision expense during the current quarter in recognition of the significant loan growth as well as certain specific reserves on other non performing loans we believe that the company s reserves remain appropriate and we remain diligent in our review of credit we do not believe that the charges taken during the current quarter represent any pervasive issues that may have broader implications on the credit quality of our loan portfolio turning to the future mr wehmer stated we have experienced significant franchise growth in the first two quarters of 2019 and believe that our opportunities for both internal and external growth remain consistently strong total period end loans exceeded total average loans by 751 million in the current quarter providing momentum for an increase in net interest income in the third quarter of 2019 despite market conditions that are applying pressure to the net interest margin we plan to continue to emphasize core deposit growth and we will remain diligent in monitoring the interest rate environment to ensure that we

18 for additional information on this performance ratio table 9 interest rate sensitivity as an ongoing part of its financial strategy the company attempts to manage the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income management measures its exposure to changes in interest rates by modeling many different interest rate scenarios the following interest rate scenarios display the percentage change in net interest income over a one year time horizon assuming increases of 100 and 200 basis points and a decrease of 100 basis points the static shock scenario results incorporate actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for balance sheet instruments following an instantaneous parallel change in market rates based upon a static i e no growth or constant balance sheet conversely the ramp scenario results incorporate management s projections of future volume and pricing of each of the product lines following a gradual parallel change in market rates over twelve months actual results may differ from these simulated results due to timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies the interest rate sensitivity for both the static shock and ramp scenario is as follows static shock scenario 200 basis points 100 basis points 100 basis points june 30 2019 17 3 8 9 10 2

unarmed protesters in 1968 are met by the us military in memphis tn while elevating awareness of the plight of sanitation workers dr martin luther king jr was assassinated on april 4 1968 at the lorraine motel in memphis he had traveled to the city in support of this campaign bettmann getty when senator bernie sanders told msnbc s rachel maddow on june 10 that his presidential campaign was launching a political revolution i took notice it was the first time since dr martin luther king s leadership during the tumultuous 1960s that i had heard any influential voice on a national stage speak sincerely about a societal revolution bernie said what this campaign is about is if you want real change we need a political revolution what does that mean it means we re going to have to take on wall street and the insurance companies and the drug companies and the fossil fuel industry and the military industrial complex and the prison industrial complex at the end of the day to understand why we are where we are with the middle class shrinking with 40 million living in poverty we have to understand the political reality of america and the power structure of america rachel maddow interviews 2020 presidential candidate senator bernie sanders on july 10 2019 i agree with senator sanders point that we must understand the political reality of america that s quite a challenge given the broad ignorance of the citizenry about the history and present day construct of the political landscape still i remain optimistic about the range of ideas introduced by the democratic presidential candidates that start to address some of the most intractable problems that have divided america into two segregated societies since the reconstruction era following the civil war and if the candidates are sincere my hope is they will not shrink away from the ideas they proposed when their campaigns close candidates should remember that the president of the united states is not the only political or influential power that can move the needle of progress toward a more equitable and inclusive america history shows that some measurable progress has actually occurred at the local regional and state levels albeit fraught with legislative and economic setbacks despite opposition from the highest office in the land leading scholars and activists have even called for an economic bill of rights for the 21st century addressing segregation and white supremacy the 2020 presidential election represents a critical juncture in american history the nation is racing toward a monumental racial demographic shift in the coming decades and by mid century the collective minority populations will become the majority currently a collective force of two dozen diverse democratic voices are standing on america s biggest stage and expressing visionary hope for progress toward building an inclusive america and not since the 1960 presidential election when john f kennedy proclaimed he would eliminate housing discrimination with a stroke of a pen and fannie lou hamer s democratic freedom party in 1964 influenced a national political party to address its own segregationist policies and practices have we witnessed so much of a focus in a presidential campaign on issues of segregation the 2020 candidates have introduced myriad ideas for redesigning reshaping and reconstructing a segregationist society into a 21st century landscape that would create equitable access to opportunities and pathways to prosperity for all these ideas and others to come must move forward regardless of who is in the white house and congressional seats of power my hope is for sincerity and commitment to moving these ideas forward and welcoming more ideally these ideas would be collected by an institute or collaboration of organizations and cultivated with participating leadership from the candidates into real strategies and fully funded plans that are piloted in target cities willing to experiment with progressive policies city state leadership cities are the most promising areas of real progress given each is independent from the pendulum swings of national politics and free to pilot new ideas and implement them the states also have power to enact policies that can improve the lives of millions while dismantling inherited segregationist infrastructure through an overt practice of denying mortgages based upon race and ethnicity the fha played a significant role in the legalization and institutionalization of racism and segregation the underwriting manual established the fha s mortgage lending requirements ultimately institutionalizing racism and segregation within the housing industry the explanation and timeline is from the boston fair housing website housing is a huge issue because it stands at the intersections of land use policies community segregation school segregation economic empowerment access to capital and building generational wealth it doesn t require being potus to disrupt longstanding segregationist policies and practices at the local and regional levels so what s preventing every city in the united states from dismantling systemic segregationist policies and practices in land use and real estate inherited from the 20th century the current president of the united states was learning the real estate industry from his father at the same time dr martin luther king jr was risking his life protesting discriminatory policies and practices for which donald and fred trump were notorious in new york city as president trump has failed to address the ever present institutionalized racism in real estate mortgage and banking industries these are areas of purported expertise in the trump family perhaps media will highlight this issue and call for the president to prioritize dismantling segregationist policies in housing across the nation meanwhile state and local leaders aren t waiting on an executive order or congressional act progressive steps are occurring in pockets of america the racist housing policy that made your neighborhood one example is the state of oregon governor kate brown is set to sign legislation that will redesign land use policy that restricted development of multifamily units in areas designated for single family home lots land use policies across the country have long been used to form segregated communities around socioeconomic and racial status that benefited white families by designing land development just for single family homes the fha has a long sordid history of racial discrimination in home loans thereby ensuring white middle class families would have priority access to single family homes oregon is addressing that issue city observatory offers insight first a bit of history oregon adopted comprehensive state regulated land use planning in 1973 the core elements of the system are a series of statewide land use goals and a supporting infrastructure of regulations that govern and limit the discretion of city and county planning officials state laws and regulations limit local government s ability both to allow development and to prohibit it most famously oregon has drawn urban growth boundaries ugb around all of its cities spelling out which places are off limits for urban scale development credit for political leadership in getting this bill passed goes squarely to oregon house speaker tina kotek who made the bill a personal priority this session the definitive telling of the political and policy story behind hb 2001 comes from sightline institute s michael andersen sightline s andersen and madeline kovacs founder of portland for everyone have been key figures in building the case for addressing missing middle housing in oregon andersen and kovacs have carefully argued that the objective is not to ban single family homes but to legalize two to four family housing they ve cleverly and accurately embedded that point in observations that these housing types were long allowed nearly everywhere and that neighborhoods that have this diverse inheritance of housing are among the state s most desirable for four decades the oregon system has precluded local governments from playing beggar thy neighbor in addressing regional housing demand every city in the portland area has to shoulder a share of the responsibility for allowing for new housing construction it s one of the reasons that portland has the highest level of economic integration of any large metropolitan area in the nation it s effectively impossible for local jurisdictions to use land use restrictions to preclude a range of housing types with this system in place re legalizing missing middle housing types isn t so much a revolutionary step as it is an evolutionary one oregon s focus on the redesign of land use policies and housing could potentially be a step in the direction of building racial equity into its economically integrated neighborhoods these kinds of multicultural and economically diverse communities could undercut the power wielded by some white parents in cities across america who oppose integrating their community schools many of which still defy the 1954 landmark supreme court ruling brown v board of education to desegregate with all deliberate speed supreme court quashes school desegregation stubborn opposition of white supremacy let s be honest when we think of white supremacists we seldom think of land use policymakers economic planners mortgage brokers real estate agents bankers teachers preachers journalists and other people around us who live their lives without thinking much about redlining busing school segregation denial of loans generational poverty police brutality and other systemic issues born out of the robotic activities of white middle class america that support sinful policies of a society established on a foundation of evil let s be clear the white supremacists who marched in charlottesville in protest over the removal of racist monuments are not the same people in positions of power who established widespread segregationist policies and practices that protect white supremacy and oppress nonwhite peoples the marchers are visible angry and openly honest about their desire to preserve white power and supremacy across the united states the people in seats of power and influence who subscribe to the same ideology are frequently dishonest disingenuous and untrustworthy to hold office in a multicultural society ironically average middle class white families who offer friendly smiles love jesus and enjoy the benefits of living in racially segregated communities while sending their kids to racially segregated schools are likely supporting the same status quo conservative policies as the avowed white supremacist violent extremist this is why the son of a klansman potus who openly expresses racist views and hostile attitudes toward nonwhites is supported by a solid majority of white christian conservative voters tracking trump the president s standing across america the belief that white supremacy applies solely to those sadly misled individuals and groups who express their opposition to the empowerment of nonwhites through hateful rhetoric and violence conveniently overlooks the broad spectrum of nonviolent white peoples even many evangelical christians whose beliefs align with the ideology of white supremacy charlottesville s root causewhite supremacy is undeniably mainstream american ideology the broad spectrum of white supremacy ranges from hate filled violentwhite extremists to hate filled nonviolent well educated highly influential policymakers in both public and private sectors in between there are tens of millions of average nondescript white americans who support white supremacist policies and ideals without fully understanding their role in sustaining an infrastructure against which native peoples fought 278 battles over nearly 300 years and black americans have risen up against in nonviolent protests repeatedly for generations spanning more than 150 years disgusting racist trump slammed for attack on congresswomen white vs white political ideology also standing in opposition to the large landscape of nonviolent white supremacists are other nonviolent white americans whose beliefs in the development of a multicultural society clash with their fellow white christians this embattled political landscape of white christian progressive ideology vs white christian conservative ideology continued in the immediate aftermath of the civil war and long after the dead were buried and the lives of survivors expired decades later this ideological battle continues today across america s political economic social and religious landscapes frederick douglass who president trump assumed was still alive indicted the white christian church as a stakeholder in the evil institution of slavery dr martin luther king jr would later indict the same church as a stakeholder in the evil immoral and sinful institution of american segregation is the church listening america s king peacemaker one side of this ideological war seeks to advance a nation originally established as a whites only citizenry into a multicultural multi ethnic america that represents the beloved community that dr king dreamed of and wrote about in his book where do we go from here chaos or community the other side seeks to maintain the status quo of white supremacy which king addressed in his letter from a birmingham jail it seeks to undermine progressive measures that empower nonwhites which is perceived as a dilution of white power and supremacy in king s 1967 speech in atlanta ga where do we go from here he addressed the small steps of progress made by the collective efforts of white progressives and black activists while cautioning that the journey was only just beginning here s an excerpt ten years ago negroes seemed almost invisible to the larger society and the facts of their harsh lives were unknown to the majority of the nation but today civil rights is a dominating issue in every state crowding the pages of the press and the daily conversation of white americans in this decade of change the negro stood up and confronted his oppressor he faced the bullies and the guns and the dogs and the tear gas he put himself squarely before the vicious mobs and moved with strength and dignity toward them and decisively defeated them yes and the courage with which he confronted enraged mobs dissolved the stereotype of the grinning submissive uncle tom yes he came out of his struggle integrated only slightly in the external society but powerfully integrated within this was a victory that had to precede all other gains in short over the last ten years the negro decided to straighten his back up yes realizing that a man cannot ride your back unless it is bent yes that s right we made our government write new laws to alter some of the cruelest injustices that affected us we made an indifferent and unconcerned nation rise from lethargy and subpoenaed its conscience to appear before the judgment seat of morality on the whole question of civil rights we gained manhood in the nation that had always called us boy but in spite of a decade of significant progress the problem is far from solved the deep rumbling of discontent in our cities is indicative of the fact that the plant of freedom has grown only a bud and not yet a flower states and cities address segregation progress is still being made albeit excruciatingly slow today 51 years after america lost the leadership of its iconic king the leadership of the state of oregon which was initially established as a white utopia is inspiring the decision to discontinue the antiquated policy of building only single family homes in targeted communities will hopefully motivate other states to adopt similar changes in land use policy and begin reconstructing neighborhoods that are more suitable for a 21st century multicultural society oregon s hb 2001 received bipartisan support in both state houses npr reported on july 1 experts say it would be the first state level legalization of a housing type that has become very difficult to build in much of the u s this type of housing is often called missing middle housing that is everything between single family homes and mid or high rise apartment buildings buildings such as three flats or courtyard apartments used to be common but many communities made them illegal often as part of a strategy for racial and class segregation while oregon governor kate brown is demonstrating how governors can address segregationist policies mayor pete buttigieg is one example of the power inherent in mayoral leadership to begin a process of changing the status quo that all cities inherited from an obsolete era when the ideology of white supremacy dominated the nation detroit mayor mike duggan is another example of how mayoral leadership can address longstanding segregationist policies and practices duggan s 2017 speech is a must watch presentation in south bend indiana mayor pete buttigieg has introduced what he calls the douglass plan inspired by the marshall plan that reconstructed europe in the aftermath of wwii the douglass plan a comprehensive and intentional dismantling of racist structures and systems combined with an equally intentional and affirmative investment of unprecedented scale in the freedom and self determination of black americans this includes reforming broken criminal justice and health systems strengthening access to credit and injecting capital into the black community and taking bold steps toward fulfilling long broken promises of true equity the douglass plan a comprehensive investment in the empowerment of black america peteforamerica com given mayor pete s position as mayor of south bend i m excited about his idea of a comprehensive strategy which includes a broad approach to dismantling segregationist policies and practices in addition to asserting common sense core infrastructure development around education economic development housing access to capital healthcare employment and income incarceration and the challenges facing returning citizens and more american descendants of slaves ados to be clear the research and investigation into strategies and policies that could address generations of disaffected black americans after the civil war and the slave era dating back to 1776 and the formation of the united states as a sovereign nation has been ongoing for decades dr william sandy darity the director of the samuel debois cook center on social policy at duke university is the nation s leading scholar on the issue of reparations for american descendants of slaves with more than 30 years of experience on the issue he testified before congress on june 19 2019 in a written statement the time has come for the united states finally to lay to rest the issue of what has been called variously the slave problem the colored problem the negro problem the black problem and the african american problem the country can ill afford to remain stranded in the mire of injustice perpetually refusing to resolve the fundamental historic national dilemma facing all americans for too long the nation has refused to take steps to solve an unethical predicament of its own making the problem of the unequal status of black and white americans a policy of reparations is a set of compensatory policies for grievous injustice the three goals of a reparations plan should be 1 acknowledgement 2 redress and 3 closure 1 acknowledgement is the admission of responsibility for the atrocity or atrocities by the culpable party incorporating an apology the admission must also be accompanied by a guarantee to make restitution in as rapid a fashion as possible 2 redress is the provision of restitution typically in the form of monetary compensation as it has been in the cases of germany s reparations program on behalf of victims of the holocaust and the united states reparations program on behalf of japanese americans unjustly incarcerated during world war ii 3 closure means the agreement by the victimized community and the culpable party that the debt has been paid the victims would make no further group specific claims on the culpable party unless new atrocities take place while the congress remains divided on the issues of reparations and will likely remain so as long as white christian conservative republicans remain in seats of power and influence in both houses smaller steps that follow the framework outlined by dr darity can be taken in cities across the country mayor pete appears to understand the impact of a historical battle waged against black americans which has impacted all other minority populations along the way and by addressing the root cause and impact of the war waged against black americans specifically new policies will provide benefit to all populations through the process of targeting a major population group black american descendants of slaves that is also among the most vulnerable class of americans the douglass plan explains its focus in committing to a comprehensive plan that focuses on black americans the goal of the douglass plan is not to ignore the specific histories and experiences that have impacted other communities of color in the united states mayor pete understands that racism is not just a black and white issue and that we also need to address the unique challenges facing other communities from native communities confronting poverty and dispossession to the islamophobia impacting middle eastern arab and south asian communities to dehumanizing immigration policies that stereotype latinos and overlook their vital contributions to our economy america s racist structures were built to justify and perpetuate slavery and by achieving greater equity for black americans we lay the groundwork for achieving greater equity for other people of color as well the inclusive nature of the douglass plan appears to underscore the priority of addressing the challenges facing black communities in south bend which can be the scaffolding upon which a framework of inclusive infrastructure is developed that benefits the entire city and region all of america s mayors seeking to address inherited systems of segregation would do well to establish a partnership with the center for social policy at duke university and particularly dr darity and his team the guidance darity can provide along with a commission including other leaders and activists will assist city leaders in developing progressive models that ensure a measurable exponential increase among black americans in asset ownership business productivity household income wealth and generational prosperity that bolsters the competitiveness of the region the tepid steps taken toward inclusion are not the bold steps necessary for acknowledgement redress and closure as articulated by dr darity in response to the issue of reparations but in lieu of such a strong response from the federal government cities and states can begin laying the groundwork through efforts at the local and state levels by tilling the ground of a hardened foundation of segregationist policies and practices through inclusive competitiveness strategies and initial steps to disrupt ingrained policies that support systemic racism local and state leaders can move the needle of progress and compel national leaders to do the right thing this process of local leaders taking small immediate steps is definitely insufficient to address the enormity of the reparations issue which must be effectively addressed to bring about a successful conclusion to the negro american revolution but it is a movement which offers hope that a significant segment of white america is contrite and intent on reconciling with the sins the nation perpetrated against targeted populations from its founding to the present day i m optimistic about america s future when i see political competitors introducing plans to deconstruct segregationist policies and practices that have long undermined progress for generations of minority populations in particular black americans but let me perfectly clear i do not believe a full comprehensive vision strategy and plan will emerge through a process of waiting for white leaders to produce it i am encouraged by the willingness of white influencers to learn to advocate to support and leverage their privilege of influence to move the needle of progress toward acceptance of a need for reparations to american descendants of slaves ados nevertheless i firmly believe that strategy and plan must originate from the disaffected class of black americans and find support across a majority of the white american landscape i offered my own strategy for addressing some of the necessary redress of a viable reparations plan crafting a true reparations plan requires truth and reconciliation reparations for african or american descendants of slaves ados has been a longtime aspiration of the congressional moguldom com reparations for african or american descendants of slaves ados has been a longtime aspiration of the congressional black caucus cbc national discourse on reparations is gaining momentum following the 2018 blue wave election victory and democrats taking control of the house these discussions in my opinion unfortunately miss the mark while i am in favor of reparations and even a truth and reconciliation effort i am well aware of the war waged against black americans and a multicultural society in general i believe the discussion of reparations will unfortunately never translate into actionable steps without a very specific vision strategy plan and method of paying for the implementation of a viable plan with measurable milestones toward specified goals with equitable outcomes this level of visioning strategy planning and investing will never come from within white america including from those who are allied with black americans on this issue sustainable solutions must come from the affected class of americans principally and generally speaking the vast majority of white americans lack the knowledge of their own history of hostilities against black americans and the severity of the generational economic impact to fully understand the social and economic carnage created by their ancestors moreover the vast majority of educated white americans still lack knowledge of the last six decades of damage that their own grandparents parents and now they themselves have done and continue to do to exacerbate the egregious evils of segregationist policies and practices that protect white supremacy while oppressing nonwhites we can measure the damage white leaders and influencers simply refuse to calculate the carnage they won t even discuss it even media ignore these data so it is up to us the affected class of americans to design a sustainable solution of restitution and restoration and given the rise of consistent discourse around reparations in congress and the across america we need to leverage the narrative now to direct discourse toward actionable and productive steps economic strategy for who i am impressed by the continued drumbeat of national economic policy reforms i hear primarily from bernie sanders and elizabeth warren although others have weighed in as well but no candidate has yet to speak directly to the unique economic strategies process implemented nationwide decades ago given the federal government s dubious history in the housing industry it should come as no surprise that another government funded process established a nationwide standardized method of economic planning in each region of the country yet uniformly ignored minority communities thereby contributing greatly to a widening of the chasm of economic disparities that already plagued the country institute of government public affairsthis website compiles the results of several national surveys that have been tracking americans racial attitudes from igpa uillinois edu in the late 1960s when the us began to transition from a manufacturing economy into a knowledge based tech driven globally competitive innovation economy fueled by high growth entrepreneurship and equity investments the economic development administration invested in a national infrastructure of regional development organizations rdo that blanketed nearly every region of the country these rdos most of which belong to a national association of development organizations nado org are responsible for creating updating and stewarding a comprehensive economic development strategies ceds plan for their respective regions there are more than 500 ceds plans across the nation in every region of the country black communities are not only left out of the measurable impact metrics and milestone goals established by the plans most of black america doesn t know these plans exist even after 50 years ceds plans have a five year horizon and contain the necessary research data and visioning to guide policymaking and investment decisions by all levels of government and public private partnerships the eda requires the ceds to be updated annually and a new ceds produced every five years to qualify for continued eda funds screenshot of the nado org website homepage america s rdos and ceds plans most of which are about 50 years old or younger have uniformly neglected black american communities for decades still i m encouraged to see that economic inclusion is now a rising priority across the country even in ceds planning yet i fear there will much time and money wasted unless economic planners are provided a platform of continuous learning to gain a thorough understanding of how the nation arrived at this point in history through the lens of the disaffected populations i m not insinuating these professionals are in any way responsible for the existing plight of black and other minority communities ceds planners inherited the processes they steward today most are managing those processes without consideration of the damage done in the past and the damage continuing today the solution is to inform educate and train lacking a deep understanding of the historical context wherein the ceds process was created most planners in america today are not aware of the critical impact of the strategies they develop on the foundation of economic disparities that still undermine the capacity of underrepresented populations to compete in today s high growth industries we must move beyond band aid approaches or quick fix programs or just the incessant talk of doing something that never gets done but succeeds in quieting the clatter of impatient protests minority communities are valuable areas of untapped talent that can otherwise bolster regional competitiveness across both workforce and entrepreneurial pipelines every region should have a strategy of inclusive competitiveness to improve the measurable productivity output of underrepresented populations in local and regional innovation ecosystems scaleup partners in 2017 published the book the future economy and inclusive competitiveness how demographic trends and innovation can create prosperity for all americans available on amazon the negro american revolution my hope is that new leadership in cities and towns across the nation will invest in learning informing and educating their communities about systemic institutionalized racism that remains ubiquitous across all of america and the stubborn opposition of white supremacy in positions of power and influence today and the unfinished business of the negro american revolution i don t think any political leadership can be successful in taking on the entire infrastructure of white power and supremacy without embracing the most important revolution in us history yet not one of the current presidential candidates has mentioned it but i m still hopeful democrats ominous shift on school segregationbut in his fond recollections of his southern conservative colleagues biden perhaps unintentionally expressed sympathy www theatlantic com some have come close like mayor pete senators elizabeth warren kamala harris and julian castro have all mentioned a need to address segregationist policies but none have spoken directly and informatively about the revolution that rocked this nation during the 1960s which did not die with dr king it simply went dormant when the riots that followed king s assassination were quelled it seemed that all of america appeared to fall asleep preferring not to deal with the overt racial problems that fueled hundreds of protests and violent uprisings across america but ignoring the problem doesn t make it magically disappear perhaps the 2020 presidential election campaign will sound an alarm long and loud enough to revive the effort that re commits our nation to the work of king s leadership and the long forgotten negro american revolution this most important part of us history is described in detail in this essay mlk addresses american amnesia in the spring of 1964 dr martin luther king jr visited san diego california and sounded an alarm while millions of white americans were aware of the nonviolent direct action revolution led by dr king and risked their reputations livelihoods and even their lives in support of it the vast majority of white americans still remained unaware trapped in their day to day business of life even in the midst of a tremendous uprising against the status quo of segregationist policies and practices that protect white power domination and supremacy the majority of white christian americans remained under the belief that all was well between white and black america america was asleep during the most important turning point in us history when dr king visited the politically conservative enclave of southern california he delivered a searing message that applies to the whole nation today i am convinced that there is nothing more tragic than to sleep through a revolution king said there can be no gainsaying of the fact that a revolution has taken place in the world and in our nation and is sweeping away an old unjust order and bringing into being a new creative order the great challenge facing every man and every woman today is to remain awake through this great social revolution during the previous year dr king had written his now famous letter from a birmingham jail given two explosive national speeches excoriating the evil inherent in america s systemic segregationist policies and practices and written a book about the most important domestic event in the postwar period of the united states that quote above is taken from a blistering report produced by the research division of the us department of labor indicting the united states as a racist landscape that intentionally targeted and severely damaged black american families both the government s quote above and the book king wrote in 1963 were referring to the negro american revolution a sustained political movement in the us so massive it touched nearly 1 000 cities and had global impact dr king received the nobel peace prize because of this revolution yet much of the nation knew little or nothing about the size and scope of the revolution as it was happening unfortunately that remains the status today ask anyone about the negro american revolution and you ll receive blank stares or questions sadly americans are still asleep in 1964 king was concerned that america was sleeping through the most important series of ongoing events in us history today how many americans have a working knowledge of this momentous movement why is the negro american revolution not a required course throughout high school not an elective but a required course by every student there are many facets to the study of this still ongoing movement in us history it is an outrage that we have allowed this history to be swept under the rug of white fragility note the negro american revolution and the civil rights movement overlap but are not the same most folks who are asked what did the civil rights movement achieve will say the 1964 civil rights act and 1965 voting rights act were pinnacle achievements but that would not explain why more than 150 cities erupted in violence during the long hot summer of 1967 and why dr king and countless others were still protesting in 1968 i will address these issues later in this essay unfortunately the vast majority of children whose parents lived through the civil rights movement were never taught about the great revolution to which dr king referred in turn they ve not taught their children today that trend of ignorance pervades america and serves as a nice cozy blanket to keep us comfortably snoring how scholars sustained white supremacythere it sat on a library cart with 50 other elementary grammar and high school history textbooks its bright red www chronicle com remaining awake through a great revolution in late spring 1964 at san diego s california western university now point loma nazarene university dr king gave a speech titled remaining awake through a great revolution it should be required reading in all schools and churches alongside the book he wrote in 1963 why we can t wait which details the reasons for the great revolution king offered this caution at the outset of his speech many of you have probably read that arresting little story by washington irving entitled rip van winkle the thing that we usually remember about rip van winkle is that he slept twenty years but there is another point in that story that is almost always completely overlooked it was a sign on the inn in the little town on the hudson in which rip went up into the mountain for his long sleep when he went up the sign had a picture of king george the third of england and when he came down the sign had a picture of george washington the first president of the united states and when rip looked up at the picture of george washington he was amazed he was completely lost he knew not who he was this incident reveals to us that the most striking thing about the story of rip van winkle is not merely that he slept twenty years but that he slept through a revolution while he was peacefully snoring up in the mountain a great revolution was taking place in the world a revolution that at many points would change the course of history and yet rip van winkle knew nothing about it he was asleep one of the great liabilities of history is that all too many people find themselves amid great periods of social change and yet they fail to achieve the new mental outlook and the new attitudes that the new situation demands i am convinced that there is nothing more tragic than to sleep through a revolution there can be no gainsaying of the fact that a revolution has taken place in the world and in our nation and is sweeping away an old unjust order and bringing into being a new creative order the great challenge facing every man and every woman today is to remain awake through this great social revolution dr king detailed three specific ways for america to remain awake and engaged during the revolution 1 reaffirm the essential immorality of racial segregation 2 discard the ideological notion that there are superior and inferior races 3 strive to achieve excellence in any chosen endeavor a bullet point list is no substitute for the eloquence of dr king i encourage you to read his speech in its entirety sadly too many americans today subscribe to the belief that segregationist policies and practices against which dr king vigorously fought died with him or soon thereafter bernie sanders would do well to tie his political revolution to the unfinished work of the negro american revolution if he fails to do so that leaves the door open for another candidate to fully embrace this moment in history rooting out and ending segregation it is unlikely anyone can be successful in taking on the status quo without first acknowledging the landscape of 20th century segregation we inherited and making a public commitment to disrupt dismantle and discard such policies and practices at every level of government and the private sector dr king would ve considered donald trump and the republican party today segregationists who seek to maintain the status quo of white supremacy that point should be included in the democratic party s national narrative and made part of the debate questions why isn t it why mlk would consider donald trump a segregationistking charged defenders of america s status quo with protecting systems of white supremacymedium com sadly too many americans today are unable to identify segregationist policies in their own cities as well as the impact of such policies on targeted minority populations far too many americans still hold onto long debunked stereotypical notions of racial hierarchy and race itself which is a social construct and far too many long oppressed americans have lost the fire and ambition needed to become their best selves regardless of chosen occupation or field of endeavor dr king understood this deep wound in the soul of america as a preacher king understood something the presidential candidates who seek to defeat trump and the status quo of white supremacy must also understand we cannot pour new policy wine into old infrastructure skins all the great ideas flowing forth from the 2020 presidential candidates must not fill the dirty cup of an american economic infrastructure established on the foundation of 20th century white supremacy christian bible matthew 9 14 17 mark 2 21 22 and luke 5 33 39 our first priority must be to understand the political reality of america and the power structure as bernie said and reaffirm the essential immorality of racial segregation and discard the ideological notion that there are superior and inferior races as king said when senator kamala harris spoke directly to vice president joe biden during the first 2020 presidential debate and informed him of her personal participation in efforts to desegregate the schools in berkeley through busing the issue for sleeping americans sounded like busing it wasn t busing was the unenviable alternative option to equitable funding for schools serving minority communities which were redlined from segregation to gentrificationlessons from seattle and detroit how city policies and nimbyism lead to unimpeded market forces displacing poor people medium com white parents were as adamant about not funding the schools of black children as they were about directing their tax dollars in support of the schools their children attended the issue was plainly segregation discrimination and white supremacist ideology in education housing banking entrepreneurship and small business employment hiring access to capital access to networks and resources transportation land use and virtually every area of american life white bias domination and supremacy has prevailing influence any effort to narrow the focus of the larger issue of a systemic cancer in the body politic as king described segregation diminishes the enormity of a pervasive evil that has long undermined the capacity of this nation to live up to its initial creed that all people are created equal we witnessed this effort when the subject of busing was introduced by kamala harris as a segue to speak to the larger issue of segregation busing was a failed effort to address the systemic evil that white parents were perpetrating upon black children yet media pundits and politicians all focused on the narrow point of busing while ignoring the larger systemic problem that busing was instituted to address it seems as though really smart folks in charge of managing the national narrative and questioning the candidates lack serious understanding of the depth and breadth and scope of the history of segregation in america today not just in the 1960s in 1964 when king spoke at cal western he wasn t just speaking to an audience of 4 000 students and faculty in a packed college gymnasium he was speaking across generations to you and i today the question is do we care enough to listen and heed his advice or can we even hear his advice at all through our slumber democratic candidates school integration plans explainedthe clash between joe biden and kamala harris over desegregation busing programs that biden opposed in the 1970s www vox com waking up to truth the challenges of remaining awake through a revolution for americans then and now is being connected to truth receptive to truth and having the capacity to discern the truth when we are inundated with tons of propagandized garbage in a daily deluge of toxic information and distractions designed to lull us to sleep workshop how to talk to kids about race to be clear most of america remains asleep today it has been for decades my wife and i launched a workshop on how to talk to kids about race in america we re doing it to provide parents educators and societal influencers with storytelling tools and resources as well as the background knowledge of us history which was built on a foundation of race our workshop empowers participants to educate future generations with empathy and an understanding that they can redesign reshape and reconstruct the segregationist society they inherited and build a 21st century inclusive america to do that they need to have truthful knowledge and data that provides them with a full breadth and depth and scope of the problem they ve inherited repairing damage restoring truth all around us a revolution is ongoing just as it was when king was alive a little more than 50 years ago protests are occurring people are being harmed and some are dying media are asleep foundations are asleep churches are asleep schools colleges and universities are asleep little has changed since king was leading the uprising he knew then that most of america was not aware of the great revolution no matter how much noise it made or how long the alarm sounded or even how many lives were lost america was asleep case in point earlier this summer on the eve of juneteenth a k a freedom day senate majority leader mitch mcconnell readily dismissed the topic of reparations reminded the nation that he along with the vast majority of white america knows very little about us history and the foundation of white supremacy upon which it was built the important issue mcconnell haphazardly dismissed is the seminal debate spanning fifteen decades back to the reconstruction era in the immediate aftermath of the civil war mcconnell on reparations for slavery not a good idea washington ap senate majority leader mitch mcconnell on tuesday rejected reparations for slavery in part because it www apnews com the question the nation was forced to address then is still ignored today how does white america reconcile and atone for centuries of institutionalized evils perpetrated systemically upon a targeted landscape of black people for many generations mcconnell believes white men have done enough and there is no more needed to be done that hasn t already been done millions of white americans agree sadly they do not know their own history of hate and hostility a paralyzing new paradigm was introduced on june 19 1865 when the last slaves walked away from plantations in galveston texas after hearing the extraordinary news delivered by the union army s general granger black people would now be free ordered by proclamation from president lincoln but what did that mean to four million newly freed black people who have only known subjugation in a nation that was established for a whites only citizenry and what did that mean to states that had seceded from the union when they had the autonomous authority to recognize only whites as citizens prior to the war the senate majority leader offered his view i don t want reparations for something that happened 150 years ago we ve tried to deal with the original sin of slavery by passing civil rights legislation and electing an african american president true justice medianew york public radio wnyc bryan stevenson s true justice cnn amanpour a 30 year fight for true justice eji org war by any other name the central theme of every effort by white america to include nonwhites and or develop diversity in their existing political business economic and social constructs is an admission of guilt that they have built an entire society upon a foundation of white supremacy with bias toward and for the benefit of whites first throughout the antebellum period prior to the civil war there is no question the nation functioned as a landscape for the benefit of whites only if others found some measure of opportunity in the northern or southern states it was not due to an intentional construct of the society as fair meritocratic and egalitarian it was due to fewer constraints on that specific individual such as free from bondage and slavery which was prevalent in the south but there should be no misconception about the beliefs and general attitudes of the northerners albeit some white americans admirably did risk reputation livelihoods and their very lives to participate in abolitionist movements and aid in the freedom of slaves the question is truly about whether northern states as a measure of official policy and practice ensured us citizenship for black people and equal stature afforded to white people the answer is unequivocally no that s the first part of american history which is an unequivocal condition of white superiority over all others following the civil war the freedom of the slaves did not equate with the freedom of the british colonies in 1776 in the minds of white us citizens it still doesn t to this day but why not if freedom is so desired that white people will risk their very lives to attain it should that same principle be recognized by whites today in celebration of the freedom of black people in america but the focused question in the second half of american history was what should be done with black people after the civil war given they were all free and numbered roughly four million that was the central question facing a nation comprised of a whites only citizenry white christian radicals held a progressive attitude toward reconstructing the nation as a multicultural inclusive america they were opposed by white christian conservatives whose attitude about losing the physical war did not dissuade their resolve to continue a political war over the future of a re united states of america these christian conservative white men had no intention of sharing the lands that they stole from the native peoples and killed their own european countrymen to call their own with their former black slaves as mr trollope explained and so a political war ensued in congress the loss of president lincoln to an assassin s bullet meant the white progressives would battle a recalcitrant president andrew johnson who opposed the vision of reconstruction that white progressive radicals envisioned the president opposed the 13th 14th and 15th amendments which revised the highest law in the land to prohibit slavery expand citizenship to include black people and immigrants born on us soil and empower black men with the right to vote equal to white men sadly this vision of a multicultural inclusive america was doomed from the start the reunification of the states empowered white southern conservatives with sufficient capability to run their states however they determined regardless of what the federal government mandated although the radicals in congress overrode the veto power of the presidency with three quarters ratification of 37 states agreeing to the constitutional amendments they could not override his veto of the freedmen s bureau and it is this critical political victory along with the numerous policies and practices within all the states themselves that effectively nullified the three constitutional amendments and initiated a full scale war against black americans for the next 100 years from 1868 to 1968 from the 14th amendment that gave american descendants of slaves ados legitimate standing as us citizens to the death of america s iconic king a warrior who led a nonviolent resistance against america s segregationist supremacists who managed the war black americans endured every aspect of every element inherent in any war state sanctioned segregation status of black americans state managed ghettos relegated for black americans targeted economic sanctions toward black americans broad deprivation of opportunity and resources for black americans intermittent physical attacks enabled and cultivated by the public and private sectors mass attacks by white americans and mass casualties in black communities and black cities state sanctioned assaults upon individual black americans families and communities military and guerrilla style assaults with state sponsored spying and assassinations white supremacist brutal policing and the unjust adjudication of black people black codes pig laws sundown towns and other widespread state sanctioned practices and policies outlawing being black in america indiscriminate unresolved kidnappings rampant rapes of men women and children destruction of community infrastructure state sponsored razing of entire black communities widespread torture widespread murders widespread false imprisonment white police and other authorities brutalizing black americans convict leasing as another form of slavery bombings of communities and churches indiscriminate killings of children and the elderly by white men with impunity widespread sustained white terrorism targeting black americans and allies mass refugees fleeing war torn regions great migration institutionalized discrimination targeting black americans in public and private sectors government led and government sanctioned discrimination and destruction state sanctioned sustained poverty and economic strategies with published plans designed to sustain the status quo of white supremacy state sanctioned trafficking of drugs and humans and destabilizing of black families and communities sabotaging opportunities for children to escape state sanction secret medical experiments on masses of black populations including sterilizations state sanctioned eugenics experiments including military suicides due to unrelenting stress public sector support of private sector racial discrimination practices continues today state sanctioned public humiliation ridicule and broad degradation propaganda in education media business sectors and politics targeting black americans often leading to white riots media led national narratives influencing white america to accept negative stereotypes tropes religious leaders condemnation of black americans and support of us hostility toward them lack of access to judicial redress political legal judicial processes all controlled by enemies of black americans education landscape replete with propaganda and stereotypical tropes about black americans institutionalized discrimination in all areas of finance real estate investing economic development land use housing education secondary and higher ed transportation etc supreme court rulings justifying widespread discriminatory practices and sanctioning an environment of hostility and terror targeting black americans this national war exemplified by the massacre of black americans in elaine arkansas in 1919 see video above narrated by ossie davis has been largely ignored by white america writ large it has been softened by historians narrowed by media into presumed unrelated episodic events versus systemic institutionalized state sanctioned war and still continues today in various forms the fear exhibited in congress over decades in response to repeated calls for a national inquiry into reparations is exhibit a that evidences some level of awareness of the war the fear of public disclosure of the existence of the war could likely compel descendants of the white supremacists who initiated the war to demand an end to it a national call for an end to the war waged against black american descendants of slaves ados could lead to public hearings public testimonies public education and public admission of egregious wrongdoing for at least 100 years of evil aggression leading to the death of dr king in 1968 and the election of richard nixon a law and order candidate propelled into the white house in the midst of hundreds of race riots across the nation in 1967 68 today the president is a man who stood on the wrong side of history in 1968 in opposition to dr king and the negro america revolution not one journalist in america has addressed the issue of a negro revolution that rose up in nonviolent protest against a century of war waged by white america today white americans have been taught that a civil rights movement began in the mid 1950s with rosa parks refusing to give up her seat on a bus and ended with the 1965 voting rights act this false narrative and dilution of reality has assured at least two perhaps three generations of white americans have absolutely no idea about the history of their parents grandparents and great grandparents who bequeathed to them a bubble of comfortable ignorance within which they enjoy the privileges and benefits of being white in america while remaining ignorant of the ongoing suffering of segregationist policies and practices they inherited and unwittingly support and sustain white america selected elected and have protected the son of a man notably arrested at a klan rally notably accused of discriminating against black families through his real estate business and even being sued together with his son by the us government for continuing discriminatory practices against black americans donald trump was a young man when dr king was assassinated today he and senator mcconnell have the power to open a door to a process of truth reconciliation and healing of racial discord that continues today as the war rages on these two men and those many other men and women supporting them have both wittingly and unwittingly decided the war should continue truthful information and education of the white public is anathema to those who seek to maintain the status quo as dr king described segregationists in his letter from a birmingham jail still congress has a moral ethical and legal duty to investigate these allegations of an internal state sanctioned war against black americans it is understandable that white supremacists in seats of power would fear the enormity of an indictment against them it is understandable that white supremacists in seats of power and influence in america would recoil from the notion that public dollars be used to conduct research develop a strategy and implement an equitable plan to repair incomparable damages inflicted upon generations of american descendants of slaves ados it is understandable that white supremacists and today s segregationists would resist allowing the public to be informed about the facts of the war that still rages today it is understandable that the enemy of progress for black americans and other minority population groups will undermine any effort to persuade a majority of white people that a segregationist america must be dismantled and reconstructed for a 21st century multicultural society nevertheless the war against the ados population must be officially called ended an official apology must be proclaimed an official truth reconciliation national council with collaborative region councils blanketing the country must be established the nation must be informed across all generations the education sector and media must employ reforms that incorporate teaching truth about current events and connected historical events and timelines this process must the collective outcry from the christian church community given this war has been fought most aggressively in the church and by the church it was a christian preacher who rose to prominence as a nonviolent warrior leading a resistance and revolution against the war and its immoral segregationist tools that elevated white people over all of god s other peoples in the human race the white christian church must call for an end to this war and they must call for truth and reconciliation and of course the white christian churches must call for a committed reparations plan to repair the damage and restore people of the ados population to a whole status in america today after they and their ancestors have endured both centuries of slavery and more than 150 years of state sanctioned war as american citizens witnessing white fragility the underlying key point in senator mcconnell s response to a call for a reparations inquiry and the response of many americans who agree with him is that white christian conservative americans do not want to engage in a committed process to reconcile repair and restore the extraordinarily damaged landscape they inherited and sustain today but here s just one of many hypocritical aspects of that position white christian conservatives didn t worry about the cost of restoring entire european cities starting with basic infrastructure in the aftermath of wwii but to consider investing in repairing generations of damage done to american citizens who are black seems to end the conversation with mcconnell and the entire republican party and surprisingly i don t hear any objections from the community of white christian conservative evangelical leadership truth and reconciliation was once at the core of the gospel and god s relationship with the church itself apparently the cost of doing god s work of truth and reconciliation with black america and the american descendants of slaves ados is too high for mcconnell and his ilk the truth that s required to be revealed and dealt with is apparently too painful the 150 year old war waged against black people by white christian conservatives since freed black people left the plantations would need to officially cease and mcconnell isn t about to agree to such a proclamation hitting the floor of the senate for a vote the strength of white power in american society would inevitably be diluted to empower others who were oppressed for generations which is apparently untenable to those who still believe that america remains a white nation with a political economic and social power structure of white supremacy grim reaper deals death to reparations when mcconnell says we ve tried to deal with the original sin of slavery the we that he is referring to is only white males who still remain divided over the issue today as they were in the aftermath of the american revolution and the civil war leading up to the negro american revolution in the 1960s when mcconnell says white males passed civil rights legislation he is speaking of eight separate times a civil rights bill passed through congress from 1866 to 1991 and never succeeded in meaningful sustainable progress for black americans these were pushed by white christian progressives and opposed by white christian conservatives like congressman gene snyder for whom mcconnell interned when he was cutting his political teeth in the 60s but mcconnell also interned for a devoted supporter of civil rights congressman sherman cooper the new york times gave mcconnell praiseworthy coverage about his attitude toward civil rights he was raised by parents who opposed segregation he attended dr king s iconic speech in 1963 he urged his students at louisville to support king s protests still his record is dubious mcconnell also served as asst deputy attorney general under gerald ford he voted for nixon who had previously lost to jfk and then embraced the orphaned white supremacist voters from gov george wallace s failed independent party run for president in 1968 and mcconnell claims the finest moment in his career came when he stood against everything president obama tried to do including nominate merrick garland to the supreme court today mcconnell is the man who stood in the way of obama and the intelligence community s attempt to warn the nation that russia had successfully attacked the 2016 election in favor of donald trump mcconnell is the impediment to at least 145 bills passed by the house this year that will not be considered for a vote in the senate mcconnell is the senatorial director of a corrupt cabal of congressional conservatives that protect a tyrannical president whose daily deluge of despotism and dramatic discord has literally thousands of legal minds scholars and mental health professionals making public statements of high concern mcconnell is married to secretary of transportation elaine chao who like all of the trump cabinet and other people who reach inner circle status is embroiled in scandal of breaching ethics laws and moral values mcconnell comically considers himself the grim reaper well the grim reaper failed to mention that white americans have never needed civil rights legislation for themselves they have the constitution what do black americans have unfortunately the constitution has never been sufficient to protect and empower black americans despite being the highest law in the land we continue to appeal to congress for rights already afforded to us by the constitution which has little apparent effect across the landscape of white america when the grim reaper refers to the election of an african american president albeit obama was duly and legitimately elected despite the best efforts of the republican party as some measure of atonement for 246 years of slavery and 143 years of white terrorism segregation and active oppressive policies and practices that he and the gop still support today mcconnell is publicly mocking the outcry for reparations through his dry grim reaper humor and the through the silent solemnity blanketing the landscape of white christian evangelicals we can hear a tiny whisper saying amen grim reaper mitch mcconnell haunts democrats debate he s the grim reaper hanging over democrats and his silent presence haunts their dreams for a bigger more generous www cnn com this attitude of racial animus among white americans toward black americans has been studied for decades the university of illinois collected the results of surveys on america s racial attitudes dating back to the wwii era in the 1940s researchers have concluded that while white america s attitude toward black america has changed significantly over the decades the support for actual implementation of policies and practices that would disrupt a landscape of segregation hasn t changed much at all one of the central conclusions from the survey record on white racial attitudes is that in contemporary american society whites are more likely to support the principle of racial equality than they are to support either the implementation of equality or policies that would take more affirmative steps to redress past or persistent discrimination the deepening crisis in evangelical christianitysupport for trump comes at a high cost for christian witness last week ralph reed the faith and freedom coalition s www theatlantic com uncomfortable inquiry for americans to understand our perilous present day paradigm through the prism of historical truths that have led up to this moment in time we need to awaken our minds to a foundation of truthful knowledge of past events this process requires a sincere curiosity that compels us to peek our heads outside of our bubbles of comfortable ignorance when we do we will inevitably discover surprising circumstances that dr king sought to elevate to our attention throughout his leadership in the revolution domestic war zones pockmark the american landscape from coast to coast wherein tens of millions of the most vulnerable americans try to survive each day against systemic institutionalized segregationist policies and practices that protect white supremacy and oppress poor nonwhite populations the probing question we must continue to ask is do we care researchers report that white americans struggle with concern about their fellow humans living in the united states sadly many white americans prefer that the federal government not intervene to help people in need despite the fact that systemic racist policies have taken a significant toll on target populations of nonwhites one of the most interesting trends in the implementation questions is the increase in the no interest response assupport declined for federal intervention during the 1980s and 1990s only about one out of three whites thought the government should see to it that blacks and whites are treated equally in schools and jobs whites reported their lowest levels of support for federal intervention in jobs in 2008 23 percent however this does not reflect an increase in those saying the government should stay out rather whites increasingly declined to state a position instead indicating that they have not been concerned or interested enough about it to favor one side over the other the trend for this question may reflect a pattern of increasing racial apathy which is an indifference to racial inequality apathy in america the three worst words in the english language are i don t care when we become ambivalent indifferent and apathetic to the suffering of others around us particularly when we actively support policies practices and leadership that cause or sustain harm the problems in our society worsen americans are powerless to change these circumstances when we are asleep immune to the anguish and suffering occurring daily within these designed areas of degradation in the world s wealthiest country the advantage king had in his day was that 100 years of war waged against black americans 1868 1968 impacted every black american regardless of socioeconomic status knowledge of the shameful condition as king described the environment for black americans during his famous i have a dream speech was unavoidable it was ubiquitous across america if you were black sundown towns by james w loewen the homepage of dr james w loewen author of lies my teacher told me lies across america and sundown towns sundown tougaloo edu today even many black americans have been indoctrinated into a trance like condition of the larger landscape of sleeping white americans lacking the truthful knowledge required to fully understand how historic policies and strategic plans have created and sustained a consistent pattern of generational economic and social degradation they personally experience and witness on a daily basis apathy is still prevalent in america today among all races and remains an impediment to the progress of disrupting dismantling and discarding segregationist policies and practices in us cities today white christians wage war against black americans from the day the 14th amendment was ratified on july 9 1868 to king s untimely death on april 4 1968 every black american was impacted by the war the same is true of white americans through the christian church the war was fought and through the christian church the prevailing attitudes about the war slavery segregation and the presumed racial hierarchy with whites at the top would shape american society through reconstruction and beyond to the present day the churches slavery the civil war and reconstruction a review essay on jstorjames h moorhead the churches slavery the civil war and reconstruction a review essay the journal of www jstor org most in white america had some level of awareness about the hostile landscape of white power targeting america s black population which represented 90 percent of the entire us minority population into the mid 60s the christian churches that filled the us landscape from coast to coast serving every community no matter how small were the most segregated arena of america life ironically it is through the christian church that black americans sought redress refuge and reconciliation with white america and it is through the christian church that a prominent minister dr martin luther king jr would rise to lead a revolution that would result in a monumental national conflict over the fate of white and nonwhite americans that has yet to be resolved king and many others in leadership and supporting roles in the national uprising by black christian americans had their hands full in calling on a primarily complacent white christian population to join the revolution and change the status quo of segregationist policies and practices that protected white supremacy and oppressed minorities reconstructing religion the journal of the civil war eramark a noll as recently as 1994 a distinguished historian in an important book on reconstruction opined that there www journalofthecivilwarera org to be fair it is understandable why most of white america today like senator mcconnell still turns a blind eye and deaf ear to centuries of suffering standing against white supremacy requires courage of conviction and a willingness to risk everything including one s own life there is no ambiguity among white supremacists about the viciousness of the war waged against multiculturalism and the incremental progressive steps toward an inclusive american society both the violent extremists as well as the nonviolent supremacists in positions of power and influence seek restraints on racial demographic shifts constraints on political and economic empowerment of minority populations and the preservation of white power and superiority by any means necessary still many in white america are dismissive of such notions they do not accept the idea that white americans are at war against black americans they reside comfortably within a bubble of ignorance of the suffering black americans have endured for generations at the hands of the entire spectrum of white supremacists from the bomb throwing church burning kkk and nazi ish supremacists to the well coifed suit wearing university presidents elected politicians ceos and even evangelical preachers far too many white americans remain in a state of denial too afraid to let go of their grip on the belief that america is the land of the free a benevolent meritocratic home of egalitarian ideals where all are welcome but the reality of the war still reaches even the most distant of white america of course when the impact of oppression is far removed it is a difficult decision for any white american to intentionally exit a comfortable life and put one s reputation livelihood and family at risk on behalf of people who have always known oppression in a hostile land of white power white power controls and dominates all of the institutions of power and influence in the most powerful nation on earth it isn t going to politely acquiesce to progressive forces seeking to redesign reshape and reconstruct the nation to accommodate shifting racial demographics in a multicultural society as frederick douglass reminded us power concedes nothing without a demand trump s war against inclusive america the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress if there is no struggle there is no www linkedin com joining the negro revolution wasn t merely a matter of sit ins kneel ins marches and boycotts it was and still is downright dangerous people inspired to take a stand against the status quo in the 1950s and 60s were arrested and jailed severely beaten severely injured tortured and many died people were bitten by dogs sprayed with high pressure fire hoses shot and bombed even in churches victims ranged from pre school children to the elderly men and women black and white were all victims of the war those who pretend the national debate over civil rights is theoretical discourse over policy issues aren t on the front lines the reality is people s lives are at stake bloody sunday a flashback of the landmark selma to montgomery marcheson march 7 1965 civil rights activists organized a march from selma alabama to montgomery alabama to press for www nbcnews com the war didn t care if you were a young naïve student leader like john lewis in 1965 taking a stand for justice when he marched across the edmond pettus bridge in selma alabama beaten nearly to death or whether you were a naïve young white preacher from boston participating in a southern protest to show alliance with the movement beaten to death or whether you were a naïve young white mother in the midwest inspired by the events depicted on television to join a crowd gathered in birmingham to hear dr king s powerful voice shot to death the war took its toll on them all and many many more king himself was stabbed nearly to death his mother was assassinated his family was under constant threat his wife coretta courageously facing the onslaught as her husband traveled onto the front lines of the battle his staff narrowly escaped a bullet riddled cottage they had rented for road operations just as king was preparing to travel to the west coast in the late spring of 1964 coretta scott king 20 factsshe was the first lady of the civil rights movement but she was much more than wife and widow coretta scott king is www legacy com yet king was undeterred about his commitment and the inevitable life risking consequences of the revolution while he implored white americans which comprised 90 percent of the nation s population to rise up on behalf of the minority populations being oppressed he also required of the oppressed to risk everything in joining a national movement that sought an acceleration of the pace of racial progress and elevation of the outcry for justice and equality in america now i do not want to give the impression that there is nothing for the negro himself to do king told an audience at california western university the federal government can t solve the whole problem i said over and over again that if justice is to be a reality for the negro in america the negro must feel a basic responsibility and a basic urge to struggle and sacrifice for that freedom and justice and so this is the meaning of the movement this is the meaning of what is taking place in our nation today it is the meaning of the demonstrations this is behind the freedom rides that you hear about here and there the sitins the standins the wadeins the kneelins and all of the other ins they are all for the purpose of getting america out of the dilemma in which she finds herself as a result of the continued existence of segregation and discrimination and i am convinced that if this problem is to be solved we must delve deeper into strong action programs to keep the issue before the forefront of the nation but as i have said all across the country i am convinced that our struggle must be a nonviolent struggle i am convinced that our basic thrust must be nonviolent excerpt from dr king s speech in san diego at cal western university now point loma nazarene university spring 1964 it is hard to imagine how a black christian preacher could request unconditional restraint of his own black people who were being systemically oppressed immersed in a discriminatory drain of daily microaggressions and humiliation indiscriminately incarcerated with many kidnapped raped tortured and murdered at random by white americans who professed to be christians yet king practiced what he preached and he also repeatedly reached out to his counterparts in white christian america for help although it is an open secret it should be stated plainly that the so called civil rights movement was in reality a constant outcry by black christian americans for white christian americans to do the right thing and the response was 150 years of ungodly hate viciousness and violence from within a widely diverse christian community the white christian is not implicated in the full societal panorama of problems many white christians have risked everything from reputations to family safety to livelihoods to their very lives to stand up against other white christians on behalf of oppressed minorities in particular black populations this chaos of white on white christian crime is often lost in the discourse when addressing the overall problem of black integration into white society in the united states so it must be stated without equivocation that in this commentary there is recognition admiration and gratitude for those white europeans in the colonies who stood as abolitionists those who participated and supported the underground railroad those who preached and pushed against policies of slavery and subsequent segregation and those who in the halls of victory demanded that the freed slave become a citizen of the us with powers equal to all white citizens those white americans and others who stood on our behalf during the 100 years of war from 1868 to 1968 deserve to be acknowledged and regarded as heroes for without their sacrifice there would be no war in white america over the fate of black people and other nonwhites that said after the civil war the battle over reconstruction and the fate of black americans resulted in the establishment of two americas one white and powerful the other black and powerless the nation was still embroiled in political and social conflict while overlaid with a ubiquitous landscape of systemic racist public policies and private sector practices and the true enemy of integrating the negro into a former whites only society became clear the white christian conservative sought a return to an era when white power was never questioned and whites never had to even consider much less acquiesce to any nonwhite of any race for any reason today institutionalized racism simply cannot sustain itself without the support of the white conservative christian sadly it is the white christian conservative that not only supports it but perpetrates it while presenting a public persona of pretentious piety it is time for the nation to identify its racial antagonist the white christian conservative the white christian conservative today is indistinguishable from the white nationalist the white supremacist and the white nazi sympathizer they are all at war against multiculturalism and an inclusive america but this is not a modern day change in attitude it is consistent with the philosophy that has guided their principles for centuries they were against black slaves being freed they were against freed slaves becoming us citizens they were against black americans being empowered as equal citizens to themselves they were against black americans voting they have long been against the progress of black americans from the day black people became americans in 1868 to the day martin luther king jr was killed 100 years later it is their unrelenting hostility toward black americans that led to a 1960s revolution that shook the foundations of this nation uw press american evangelicals and the 1960s edited by axel r schäferamerican evangelicals and the 1960s edited by axel r schäfer american evangelicals and the 1960s refutes the thesis uwpress wisc edu hiding the truth today most of this nation s 327 million population lack knowledge of the truth about this 100 year war that triggered the courageous response of a nonviolent great revolution this history isn t taught in most schools whether public or private because textbooks do not contain it both state legislators and school boards ensure the public schools use textbooks of which they approve and the publishers of textbooks find themselves facing a gauntlet of opposition to truth which they must successfully navigate to attain major contracts and book sales this history isn t taught in most churches because faith leaders either don t know it or won t allow it and most journalists don t know this history because they were never taught it either media which covered the revolution episodically have not served as a consistent source of contextual history that connects the past to current events in an unbroken storyline the purpose of this commentary is to contribute to the existing knowledge bank by revealing fragments of historical dots in a timeline of truth that connects the present day to past events in a manner that can be better understood and perhaps empower a slumbering nation to awaken and make changes before it is too late truth is hiding in plain sight but generations of americans have failed to see hear and understand it and that means we have failed to teach truth to our children and they have failed to teach theirs without the truth to awaken us to act in our own best interest as one human race we ve fallen asleep as a nation still reliving past racial hostilities and division over and over as past conditions impacting black americans and other minority populations continue to deteriorate and worsen with each generation as the world s wealthiest and most powerful country our national ability to change this cycle of degradation within our borders depends upon whether we can awaken to truth and act upon it accordingly consider this your personal alarm the freedom lie america is living a lie we claim to love truth but what is truth when so many of our churches schools media politicians and other institutions of influence and trust do not possess it we claim to love freedom but what is freedom to those who arrive at our border only to be turned away or worse parents torn from children and sent away without ever knowing their fate and powerless to protect them freedom is nevertheless an american aphrodisiac it is the intoxicant poured out each year through messaging campaigns with additional copious amounts flowing through the 2020 presidential campaign season for the american electorate to imbibe as the president and his campaign competitors continuously fill our patriotic cups with shots of freedom slogans like political bartenders capitalizing upon our freedom loving stupor the love of freedom is at the core of america s character it is why we celebrate independence day every fourth of july and honor the strength of our military which protects and preserves america s precious freedom yet this open embrace of freedom is a mask that hides an open secret in 1776 when the founding fathers declared the independence of the united states from great britain the only citizens for who freedom was being fought were white europeans who desired to secede from the monarchy and form their own government indeed edmund burke a famous parliamentarian expressed this very point in a speech to the british parliament in 1775 at the outset of the american revolution this fierce spirit of liberty is stronger in the english colonies probably than in any other people of the earth first the people of the colonies are descendants of englishmen england sir is a nation which still i hope respects and formerly adored her freedom the colonists emigrated from you when this part of your character was most predominant and they took this bias and direction the moment they parted from your hands they are therefore not only devoted to liberty but to liberty according to english ideas and on english principles the people are protestants and of that kind which is the most adverse to all implicit submission of mind and opinion this is a persuasion not only favourable to liberty but built upon it this religion under a variety of denominations agreeing in nothing but in the communion of the spirit of liberty is predominant in most of the northern provinces where the church of england notwithstanding its legal rights is in reality no more than a sort of private sect not composing most probably the tenth of the people some gentlemen object to the latitude of this description because in the southern colonies the church of england forms a large body and has a regular establishment it is certainly true there is however a circumstance attending these colonies which in my opinion fully counterbalances this difference and makes the spirit of liberty still more high and haughty than in those to the northward it is that in virginia and the carolinas they have a vast multitude of slaves where this is the case in any part of the world those who are free are by far the most proud and jealous of their freedom freedom is to them not only an enjoyment but a kind of rank and privilege edmund burke speech on conciliation with the colonies march 22 1775 to be clear the freedom loving white european settlers in america did not desire freedom equal to their own for the native peoples whose land they illegally occupied and fought continuous battles against since 1622 they did not desire freedom equal to their own for the african peoples who many enslaved for their own enrichment they did not desire freedom equal to their own for the mexican peoples whose lands they illegally settled and ultimately waged war to obtain they did not desire freedom equal to their own for asian peoples whose labor they exploited and who they would eventually expel and incarcerate america s open secret from the declaration of independence in 1776 to the outbreak of an internal civil war in 1861 the united states consisted solely of a whites only citizenry this is the open secret never discussed on the national stage understandably this secret exposes so many others being a free person of any race in the us colonies leading up to and through the civil war never equated to the power of white citizenry even when citizenship was extended in 1868 the new citizens were never empowered to fairly access opportunity and compete with white citizens in a free market capitalist economy white power domination and supremacy have tolerated others with limited levels of integration but equality has remained elusive throughout the entire history of the nation including today for this reason we must acknowledge one simple truth for an inclusive america to live white supremacy must die the realization of the necessary death of white supremacy is of course merely a thought exercise after all white supremacy is ingrained in the bedrock of the foundation upon which the united states was built and every small step of progress toward empowering nonwhite populations is met with the force of white power seeking to maintain the status quo in order to change the status quo we must reveal the whole truth truth and reconciliationmalusi mpumlwana was a young enthusiastic antiapartheid activist and a close associate of steve biko in south africa s greatergood berkeley edu reconstructing america on a foundation of truth generations today cannot redesign reshape and reconstruct an inherited 20th century segregationist landscape into a 21st century equitable inclusive society unless there is a common understanding of the depth and breadth and scope of the level of systemic biases ingrained in the bedrock of america s foundation truth and reconciliation must become a priority across the united states and that requires overcoming our reluctance to agitate the delicate senses of those whose paradigm is shaped by indoctrination into the ideology of white supremacy the fate of ongoing efforts to build an inclusive america must not be governed by tenuous tip toeing around white fragility due to an aversion to an inconvenient truth truth and reconciliation starts with truth the truth is that the united states was founded as a racist nation dedicated to white male superiority to be clear not all white males are racist not all white males were regarded the same even in colonial america white males competed against one another and jockeyed for power while tolerating to a degree the presence of nonwhites white males established their own caste system and decided the fate and future of both white women and nonwhite peoples white males were at the top of the power structure of the united states from its inception and remain so today freedom was a luxury reserved for white males regardless of their socioeconomic status until the outcome of the civil war in 1865 even president lincoln s 1863 emancipation proclamation which gave black slaves their first taste of freedom was in perilous doubt freedom for black people was perceived as a risky dangerous experiment that would ultimately dilute white power and supremacy white power ironically freedom for the black slave exposed the biggest secret of the white man in america it wasn t freedom that the 13 british colonies fought so bitterly to achieve it was power after all there were free black people throughout the era of slavery but freedom for black people did not equate to power in antebellum america it did for white men freedom did not expand the 13 colonies into states power did freedom did not expand the territory of the us colonies to conquer lands west and south power did freedom did not come to the rescue of white families illegally settled in the lands of texas which belonged to mexico power did freedom did not conquer every native tribe on the north american continent power did in a speech to congress in 1833 president andrew jackson unabashedly spoke about his belief in the superiority of white men and white power in his successful attempt to persuade legislators to vote 29 to 17 in favor to remove native tribes from their rightful lands he said they have neither the intelligence the industry the moral habits nor the desire of improvement which are essential to any favorable change in their condition established in the midst of another and a superior race they must necessarily yield to the force of circumstances and ere long disappear although white men ultimately agreed how they would segregate native tribes onto distant out of the way lands reserved for them by white men they did not agree on the fate of black slaves who had neither land nor power to resist the white man s domination the white men who wielded power in the united states were split on the moral issue of slavery and soon following john brown s failed insurrectionat harper s ferry a war between the states erupted had john brown s raid not occurred it is very possible that the 1860 election would have been a regular two party contest between antislavery republicans and pro slavery democrats says city university of new york historian david reynolds author of john brown abolitionist the democrats would probably have won since lincoln received just 40 percent of the popular vote around one million votes less than his three opponents while the democrats split over slavery republican candidates such as william seward were tarnished by their association with abolitionists lincoln at the time was regarded as one of his party s more conservative options john brown was in effect a hammer that shattered lincoln s opponents into fragments says reynolds because brown helped to disrupt the party system lincoln was carried to victory which in turn led 11 states to secede from the union this in turn led to the civil war john brown day of reckoning the abolitionist s bloody raid on a federal arsenal at harper s ferry 150 years ago that set the stage for the civil war smithsonian magazine october 2009 white christian american powers collide the civil war 1861 1865 pitted white christian power against white christian power to be clear they were not arguing over the future of native peoples they fully agreed the future of native american tribes would include a limited freedom regulated by white men upon lands relegated by white men and governed by white men indeed white men continued to wage war against native tribes following the civil war up to a final battle in 1918 even during the civil war white men continued to wage war on native tribes this included peaceful tribes who sought to stay away from white men that effort failed on november 29 1864 a former methodist minister john chivington led a surprise attack on peaceful cheyennes and arapahos on their reservation at sand creek in southeastern colorado his force consisted of 700 men mainly volunteers in the first and third colorado regiments once a missionary to wyandot indians in kansas chivington declared damn any man who sympathizes with indians i have come to kill indians and believe it is right and honorable to use any means under god s heavens to kill indians that fateful cold morning chivington led his men against 200 cheyennes and arapahos cheyenne chief black kettle had tied an american flag to his lodge pole as he was instructed to indicate his village was at peace when chivington ordered the attack black kettle tied a white flag beneath the american flag calling to his people that the soldiers would not kill them as many as 160 were massacred mostly women and children what is freedom without power at the core of the civil war dispute between white men was the fate of black people in the united states at the end of the argument the freedom black people received at the hands of the white men who won the war ironically revealed a major secret neither side had hoped to divulge freedom did not equal power it was power that white men craved freedom was the ability to exercise it but freedom alone was insufficient for the white man yet was the only option offered to the black man and with the emancipation of black people who had generations of lives lived on north american soil since the first african slaves arrived in 1619 the question white men had to address was how much power would black people be allowed to exercise in a white nation diluting white power the first step toward power for

feature the peak car phenomenon has captured the attention of many but what does it really mean this is a deep dive into mobility trends of today and where this might steer us into the future in a 2017 post one of us analysed the peak car phenomenon critiquing the data it is based on and querying whether there really were long run and fundamental changes occurring to how people can and do move about their urban environments here we discuss peak car further considering whether more recent vehicle and travel data particularly from the us and australia provide evidence for a more enduring and profound change to urban passenger transport we are interested in both the nature of change how are people travelling instead if at all and evidence regarding causes of change the enduring peak car discussion the peak car concept has achieved a lot of air time since the global financial crisis eminent international transport researchers including peter newman and jeff kenworthy described peak car as the attainment and retreat from maximum vehicle kilometres travelled vkt per capita in many cities globally including a range of traditionally car dependent cities in north america and australia significantly they argued car ownership and use seemed to be decoupling from income and city governments were decoupling urban growth from the primacy of the car as a means to meet peoples mobility needs it is reasonable to expect a plateauing of vkt per capita based on saturation of vehicle ownership and access to vehicles population demographics and limits to peoples time available to travel purposeful trips to be conducted and average travel speeds still analyses by researchers such as newman and kenworthy pointed to plateau and decline across many international cities up to 2011 or so citing a range of positive megatrends as contributing factors in addition to income decoupling and less car centric urban growth these megatrends included potential reductions in spatial reach by car owing to increasing congestion declining trip lengths and reduced demand for mobility generally timothy garceau and others focusing on the us concluded similarly regarding the plateau and decline in vkt emphasising fundamental changes in behaviour across cities with quite different spatial and socio demographic characteristics researchers such as michael sivak at the university of michigan argued that societal changes as well as economic factors appeared to contribute to vkt trends a recent article in the economist speaks to a historic ideal for the average joe josephine to strive for vehicle ownership and use because cars were the embodiment of personal freedom and representative that one was keeping up with the joneses in the us some researchers used driver licensing rates as evidence of peak car pointing to particular declines among under 30s julie beck writing for the atlantic speculated that licensing and subsequent car ownership may be less of practical necessities than they once were and therefore less necessary for personal freedom during the first decade or so of this century data was showing uptrends in use of active and public transport simultaneously many led by millennials and empty nesters were flocking or at least wanting to flock to newly regenerating city centres in pursuit of the amenity that density and diversity can offer as part of urban consolidation trends indicative of the move away from car centric growth the upward trajectory of fuel prices also disincentivised private vehicle use apparently travel behaviour change has been reinforced and accelerated by embracement especially among millennials of the sharing economy including growing access to car share ride hailing and other mobility services these services offer quasi private vehicle travel on demand without the hassles of licensing ownership insurance and securing parking spaces since 2014 demand for and supply of these new mobility services have been in overdrive as we all appear to be catching on to the convenience mobility services have been facilitated by technology and technology led entrepreneurialism and innovation have influenced patterns of consumption including travel various commentators have argued that millennials are a generation that would rather have a smart phone than a car in reality today s technophiles do not really have to choose between the two but the assertion is that the more people rely on devices the more they would rather play with them than worrying about driving a car what a virtuous cycle it could be growth of inner cities and demand for inner city living accelerating demand for increased amenity and investment in quality transport choices and services like the mode of the moment e scooters ripe conditions perhaps for peak car more recent data and broader analyses may paint a less optimistic picture looking at longer run and emerging trends fuel prices as well as various other macro economic factors have undoubtedly affected all aspects of private vehicular mobility including licensing vehicle purchase and mode choice and vkt there was a widespread view in the 2000s that oil scarcity would trigger a steep and protracted rise in fuel prices and that this would force travel behaviour changes on the contrary shale and tar sand extraction improved fuel efficiency driven by environmental regulation and greater global exploration discoveries have contributed to much less severe if still volatile prices observable at australian bowsers the bureau of infrastructure transport and regional economics bitre observes that the average household s expenditure on ownership and operation of cars as a share of total household expenditure on goods and services dropped through the first half of the twenty teens and seemingly not because the average person was driving less plus typical vehicle capital cost relative to earnings has dropped substantially meanwhile demand for suvs in australia for example has increased dramatically over recent years influencing total numbers of new cars sold generally all car sales over recent post global financial crisis years have risen but there is year to year variance with respect for purchase trends with some of the most pronounced variance occurring post 2017 as the economy softens car sellers are linking weaker sales with a lack of purchasing capacity rather than lack of consumer desire demand for cars in the us us data show more consistent and sharper growth in all sales through to 2016 with cooling sales thereafter according to statista post 2014 dips in demand for cars were offset by significant growth in demand for light trucks for example pick ups with 2018 sales accounting for about 70 per cent of all light vehicle sales the post 2016 cooling of us sales reported by statista correlates with oil price rises and higher gas prices still according to a february 2019 commentary by bloomberg the recent cooling is a portent of an approaching new peak car moment ostensibly some sort of peak 2 0 following the peak identified in the 2000s the cooling itself the article argues results from the ubiquity of new mobility options such as ride hailing as well as reinvigorated civic concerns about congestion and reaffirmed belief in the sharing economy the eventual peak will correlate with widespread deployment of automated vehicles on to the mobility market this explanation begs a more considered definition of peak in our view there are limited differences between a kilometre ridden in a light passenger vehicle and one driven if overall vkt remains the same more about the potential effects of vehicle automation later for now it s worth noting that may sales of passenger vehicles in the us were strong correlating with similar uptrends in key economic indicators chris loader s detailed and comprehensive manipulation of bitre and australian bureau of statistics data relating to australian vkt and licensing trends through to 2018 allows easy review of recent australian metadata the data show a plateauing of total vkt around 2004 2006 and a rise since then most of the growth is accounted for by cars rather than light commercial and heavy vehicles including buses per capita data does reflect the declines in vkt observed by others but these declines flatten from 2012 and rebound for some cities adelaide and perth particularly us data in the aggregate show a similar rebound effect from 2014 the licensing data show that the national licensing rate per 100 persons is trending upwards and there has been some acceleration in licensing rates in recent years in states and territories including western australia tasmania and northern territory slow declines in licensing among people aged 20 to 29 are being offset by older people especially those 70 and older the decline among younger people is particular to new south wales and victoria and less so tasmania mode share data for australian cities tend to be limited to the census journey to work set there are exceptions such as the victorian integrated survey of travel and activity vista dataset referring again to chris loader s analysis journey to work data at the city level tells a story similar to vkt for states and territories with dips since 2011 in public transport use for cities including brisbane perth and hobart but rises in sydney and melbourne average car occupancy appears to be on the decline a similar but converse pattern is evident in car only trips overall average car occupancy appears to be dropping still while public transport use in new south wales has risen ten times faster than the long term historical average anyone driving on a saturday in sydney will attest to the fact that the private vehicle remains the mode of common choice a recent analysis by the authors shows that the increase in public transport usage is not a mode shift it correlates with historically high population growth in fact despite the severe crowding on public transport the same effect is evident on the road network with some 40 billion in rail and road investment mode shift to public transport appears to be a fraction of a per cent over the past three years in the us pundits are lamenting widespread declines in public transport ridership short years after the apparent ridership renaissance reported early this decade by the american public transportation association even then the apparent renaissance was critiqued for hiding significant variability in trends between cities the small handful of cities such as seattle where ridership increases continue to occur tend to be where investment in public transport infrastructure and priority and services including feeder bus services is enduring that and they feature crippling road congestion these factors support a basic premise of travel decision making among the travelling public cost convenience and comfort considerations have to be weighed up access to public transport as well as other modes plus the affordability of those modes are key a may 2019 article by university of sydney researchers somwrita sarkar david levinson and hao wu analysed the polycentricity of sydney and found enduring spatial inequities they concluded that much more change is required in the distribution of homes and jobs to reduce the primacy of sydney s central business district and improve housing and employment balances in sub centres these outcomes would likely reduce journey times and lengths as well as improving the price and convenience equation of public transport for more trips including non commutes and non peak hour trips the rise of ride hailing we anticipate that until relatively recently peak car researchers did not predict much like the majority of us the sharp increase in availability and services offered by new mobility service vendors including uber and ola these effects have ramped up sharply from around 2015 and research remains exceedingly patchy regarding their nature magnitude and direction thus there is limited data regarding how they relate to car and public transport based passenger kilometres as well as mode choices us research using richer trip based datasets than available typically in australia today demonstrates the scale of growth in ride hailing kilometres over the last five years with bruce schaller predicting that by the end of 2018 associated vkt would exceed local bus passenger kilometres many ride hailing trips would have been conducted by public transport instead if the service was not available also the per trip vkt by a ride hailing service exceeds vkt if it is conducted by a private vehicle owing to dead head miles the number of miles a taxi needs to drive from the point of unloading to the point where its new load is ready for pickup others argue that emerging meta data sets show a close correlation between actual public transport ridership declines and increases to trip numbers using ride hailing services despite significant growth in ride hailing trips and associated vkt the overall share of travel fulfilled by these and other mobility services remains minor for now furthermore demand for ride hailing and car sharing varies significantly based on socio economic and demographic factors as well as intra urban location still mode substitution and dead heading issues are problems for advocates of the sharing economy and tech led disruption in the transport sector variable trends in private car ownership and usage may mask other trends of equal or greater concern relating to travel choices made instead including undermining the peak car 2 0 argument congestion charging these concerns have found resonance in new york where a congestion charging scheme is pending to both curtail congestion which worsened following huge growth in ride hailing trips and to generate revenue for a chronically under funded public transport system london s policy makers have found also that the city s much lauded cordon pricing scheme was being undermined by an explosion in car services operating within the cordon travelling often without passengers in australia infrastructure supply side responses remain popular and not just to improve the convenience of public transport in the decision making equation public transport new high profile plans and projects like melbourne metro and metro 2 sydney light rail and perth s metronet compete for funding with congestion busting road projects such as north east link westconnex and trenches and double stackers commonly these are justified on traditional forecasting safety and travel time savings grounds they can serve their intended purpose in terms of providing some albeit often temporary congestion relief however supply side responses tend to perpetuate particular patterns of travel behaviour as such induced traffic considerations more comprehensive bcrs and fuller sets of alternatives could factor into project assessment and selection this may help avoid more highway boondoggles to borrow from frontier group s and u s pirg s lexicon in addition significant rethink is required in financial markets given the many billions nationally being invested currently in new toll roads which generate profitability through increased vkt returning to price issues and transport affordability swedish research by anne bastian and maria börjesson concluded that economic factors could well explain changes in vehicle use between 2002 and 2012 they noted also differences within populations based on income observing limits to vehicle ownership and use for example saturation we have ourselves noted previously the likelihood of limits to population level ownership and vkt and recognise the potential for considerable volatility below these thresholds for all manner of economic and non economic reasons but what of those millennials and their aloof attitudes to car ownership what about trends generally towards urban consolidation meta data seems to tell stories about relative urban consolidation in australian cities yet we think care is needed assuming that decisions made today regarding housing location and its association with mobility and access choices will be sustained through life stages and we are not the only ones we also think more scrutiny is required regarding socio economic and socio demographic characteristics of those forsaking cars and locating in urban centres lang walker one of the most successful land use developers in australia turned focus recently from apartments back to house and land packages noting that the grand experiment in apartment living was reaching saturation his view is that these sorts of housing offers are undersupplied relative to demand the cost component of transport decision making cannot be considered in isolation from other affordability issues especially those relating to housing plainly the price and convenience dynamic applicable to peoples travel and car ownership decisions is influenced strongly by where they live which in turn depends on the housing they can afford in the 21st century housing affordability has decreased globally australian house prices surged in the 2000s with particular growth between 2011 and 2017 rent and sales prices in major cities across the developed world like london san francisco toronto sydney and auckland remain at extreme levels even with some evidence of retreat from record highs some reduction does not mean a return to broad affordability particularly as wage growth has stagnated in economies such as australia s over some years and disposable income evaporates this is despite the reserve trying to reinflate confidence by cutting interest rates to historic lows wealth gaps and transport choices undoubtedly technology and fuel innovation including in transport are creating more choice and convenience than ever they also tend to raise urban wealth still these factors help to fuel income and buying power disparities jobs and living opportunities in centres are great but the liveability of centres for a broad cross section of the population depends on both the types of jobs available and affordability of housing even urban evangelists like richard florida acknowledge both the triumphs and failures of the return to city centres noting unprecedented geographies of affluence and poverty especially in some of north america s and australasia s most liveable cities according to recent canadian research airbnb which is to short term accommodation what uber is to the mobility sector has taken about 31 000 homes about 1 5 per cent of supply out of the country s rental market this unintended consequence of technology led innovation appears to contribute increasingly to reduced housing supply and therefore all else equal unaffordability in san francisco the hyper successful tech sector has started to take more responsibility for the income polarisation and affordability issues it has contributed to in june 2019 google announced a 10 figure commitment to providing more affordable housing in the bay area about three quarters of this is planned on land owned by the company which includes holdings in relatively car dependent locations a happy brunch crowd enjoying melbourne s laneways not everyone can afford to be a member of the urban brunch crowd source authors other researchers look at these sorts of issues from alternative perspectives concluding that trends in urban consolidation are tied to restrictive land use policies and limitations to housing supply more so than population preferences and footloose entrepreneurialism these consolidation trends contribute directly to housing affordability with flow on effects on peoples buying power for relatively capital intensive items like cars in our view there is good evidence of a range of reasons for unaffordability and the lack of consensus helps to show that causes are complex so the return to centres especially among young people may signify the trade offs that a proportion of this generation chooses to make to balance access to employment and education with what they can afford to rent or buy in this context cars become luxury goods that can be forsaken for necessities kevin naughton s and david welch s article refers to a tech exec from boston who decided to sell his luxury car and spend up to 20 000 a year commuting using ride hailing services we should all be so lucky to be able to value our time so highly and shell out such money on chauffeuring presumably the execs can choose to live where they like still choice depends on context even for wealthy tech execs in dublin the european headquarters of google and facebook there is no ride hailing other than taxi and even getting a taxi can be difficult in this city the exec would probably retain their luxury car there is a lack of readily available and powerful data demonstrating that the urban influx has been voluntary profound preferred representative for example it reflects a broad social strata and sustained the same can be said of data showing peak car as researchers we tend to analyse car use based on necessity and choice a distinction made well by susan handy and others at uc davis the ideal is to avoid the former and provide convenient cost effective and comfortable alternatives to minimise the latter increasingly we should also be analysing car ownership on the same basis recognising that living in some of our urban centres means not owning a car may be less voluntary and more necessary on price grounds if there is a sustained drop in accommodation costs relative to income should we assume that inner cities will continue to boom another relative exodus to the suburbs might fuel more growth in vkt especially if governments have favoured increased land supply to try to take heat from the housing market one of the problems with urban datasets is they tend to measure what happened not why and are thus poor at predicting future behaviour furthermore even surveys do not deal well with if and when which will reveal what millennials do when they enter new life stages multi stacked freeway infrastructure in oakland sited above bay area rapid transit right of way source authors what can we learn from all of this should we be pessimistic given all of these facts figures and trends and give up on urban development and transport strategies including smart growth polycentricity and investment in high quality mass transit should we also spurn innovation in the mobility market and regulate ride hailing and variants out of our cities the answer is no but we must respect the inherent diversity of our cities and respond to the diversity of needs with regard for mobility and access we must not rest thinking we have conquered car dependence or even car preference focus must become tighter on public transport ubiquity convenience affordability and comfort if we want liveable equitable and affordable cities various peak car practitioners are encouraged by some evidence of changing preferences and choices among some of the population and particular to their life circumstances they are positive also regarding some of the relative increases in funding for public and active transport infrastructure and adoption of some smarter growth policies these things represent progress not perfection with respect for our cities and the transport systems that support them step changes to urban structure and patterns of travel tend to take decades these require more effective governance frameworks flexible funding mechanisms tied more closely to pay as you go revenue streams and robust investment decision making based on more holistic appraisal frameworks for example the research community has developed tools such as luptai snamuts and arup s accessibility toolkit to gauge spatial disparities and evaluate the impacts of new infrastructure projects while the urban liveability index under development at rmit is intended to provide intra city and longitudinal evidence regarding spatial disparities in accessibility among other variables these should be used to supplement more traditional transport modelling approaches to project evaluation various urban growth and transport policies have failed to address a range of issues satisfactorily including congestion geographies of affluence and poverty and driving by necessity rather than choice limited investments in blue ribbon infrastructure showcase revitalisation projects and the land use uplifts that these may yield tend to favour a relatively limited slice of the urban population and are not serious approaches to deal with historic and emerging problems the cheonggyecheon revitalisation project in seoul south korea is cited often as evidence of success with respect for urban renewal in this case regeneration of an urban stream and supportive active transport infrastructure following removal of an elevated arterial road still for all its merits the economic uplift the project has contributed to is cause for concerns regarding potential socio economic exclusion urban space needs to be utilised more flexibly this means cleverer zoning investment incentivisation and building practices something tim williams discusses in one of his articles in the fifth estate in the context of sydney furthermore the political clout of nimby lobby groups needs tempering because the perceived importance of low density character areas cannot trump the need for cities to feature more diverse housing product and support sustained mode switch away from cars because of the increased viability of alternatives as urban densities increase in the us various state and local governments are revising zoning laws to facilitate development of more diverse housing stock in locations where previously only single lot product was permissible from a transport policy and strategy perspective commitment to revised infrastructure appraisal and delivery practices needs to bridge election cycles and extend beyond blue ribbon projects to common practice this requires a rethink of what constitutes key performance indicators for projects including criteria such as consumer savings and affordability beyond just estimates of travel time savings for car drivers improved mobility options for non drivers and energy conservation increasingly price signals need to be used to moderate travel behaviour in peak hours via peak routes pay as you go congested based pricing should apply to light passenger travel whether it is by driving or being driven this all means commitment and thinking beyond assuming millennials will drive the fall of the private vehicle aided and abetted by technology and everyone wants to live in a city centre it does mean more relevant data are needed to help us understand changes in travel behaviour luminaries like jarrett walker continue to call on industry to work harder to make sense of what is going on with our transport systems and why what might we anticipate tomorrow the oft maligned private vehicle will remain an essential feature of the mobility landscape for the foreseeable future it remains convenient and relatively affordable for a lot of travel whether a person drives or is driven moreover we should not overlook the opportunities private vehicles provide for people to participate socially and economically in their communities a shift worker shuffling kids on a low income is a long way from being convinced that car ownership is an option still fundamental changes are required and should be facilitated to policy planning pricing business models and consumer behaviour for peak car and sustained reductions in vkt to be realised there are two trends that will place increasing pressure on our cities and their supporting systems and present added challenges to peak car theory the first is the ongoing pressure for urban expansion and associated consumer demands for different housing typologies these in turn will be influenced by macroeconomic trends including relative wage rises inflation interest rates and overall consumer buying power even increased densities within existing urban boundaries may lead to growth or at least maintenance of vkt if new housing tends to be in outer and middle suburbs rather than in higher density centres the quality of that higher density living will determine its attractiveness relative to other housing typologies given the amount of land available to metropolitan fringes in australia given farebox revenue often does not get close to covering costs of providing and operating public transport added suburban growth patterns are likely to make providing cheap and convenient public transport services impossible as that other macroeconomic trend of reducing taxation per head of population further constrains public investment in service provision the second trend is the increasing application of complex technology in the transport sector already technology enabled ride hailing is cause of concern regarding light vehicle vkt in the near future connected and automated vehicles cav promise low cost demand responsive hyper mobility automakers technology firms venture capitalists and investment banks are going all in globally in the deployment race the profit incentive will tend to favour increased vehicle use at the expense of walking cycling and public transport use cav are likely to redefine the cost convenience and comfort equation making consumers potentially more willing to spend longer travelling this may redefine peoples expectations regarding where they live relative to where they work learn shop and recreate moreover this can fit in nicely with the sharing economy people do not have to own their own cav if a shared unit is only a smartphone thumbprint

1 a night of mixed trade overnight trade might be considered an elegant microcosm for the affairs of financial markets right now the news flow shifted from mixed to bearish to bullish then back to mixed again the story began with a us retail sales data beat that cast doubts on the fed s need to cut interest rates that doubt was compounded by more soft bank earnings in the us the mood then turned decidedly nervous on headlines us president trump stated his willingness to increasing tariffs on china if he wanted before sentiment was salvaged by a speech from fed chair jerome powell during which he re affirmed his openness to lowering rates 2 risk taking dulled in the market the ultimate result on wall street being a slight play out of riskier assets and into safe haven assets the s p500 receded from its all time highs to fade back towards the key psychological level of 3000 long term us rates climbed as markets priced in a marginally better outlook for us consumption that gave a boost to the us dollar which drove the aud towards the 0 7000 level once again and pushed gold prices back to the us1400 mark the lead sets up the asian session for a soft start with spi futures suggesting the asx200 ought to extend its three days of declines and dip around 4 points at the open 3 asx200 drifting lower the asx suffered from the same listlessness yesterday that had characterized the night prior s trade on wall street somewhat like what was experienced last week market participants remain effectively still and vigilant ahead of greater event risk at the back end of the week a play into the safety of government bonds pushed long term interest rates down with price action in stocks reflecting the difference in income yield dynamics the utilities sector climbed while the real estate sector lead the sectoral map despite the fall in interest rates the australian dollar remained well supported during the local session primarily due to a climb in industrial commodities 4 rba confirms it s on standby the minutes from the rba s most recent meeting were released during yesterday s local session and while they offered little disruption to market activity they did provide insight into the current state of mind of the central bank global growth risks and global central bankers policy re actions to them were greatly examined as were the current drags on households and domestic consumption but the key takeaway was this the rba will continue to cut interest rates if needed to stimulate the australian economy and support the ongoing process of absorbing the stubborn spare capacity in the labour market that s currently undermining the outlook for domestic growth and inflation 5 the rba s clear canvas the rba seems to expect that this will be a relatively long and slow process such an attitude isn t a surprise by any means monetary policy is a slow burning fuel when it comes to stimulating the economy even still the moderation cautiousness and broadness in the rba s language betrayed an uncertainty not just in the economic outlook but also the potential direction for monetary policy it reaffirms an interesting dynamic whereby the rba is standing guard for a potential deterioration in local and global economic fundamentals amid a lingering sense of doubt about whether policymakers across the globe can extend this business cycle 6 ambiguity brings market opportunity market action around yesterday s rba minutes reflected the ambiguity betrayed within the document market participants weren t preparing for anything more the rba was only ever going to expound on what had already been communicated in its meeting press release a fortnight ago further to that all the benefits and impact to financial markets from the information received had all but been priced in by this month s actual cut moving forward however the open endedness of the rba s present policy outlook raises the stakes for markets the next cut implied for december could just as easily be brought forward or deferred setting up ample ground for volatility

when you hear certain populists bleat about how america is in decline and foreign competitors like china are taking advantage of our weakness think back to the 1980s during the reagan era pundits warned that the u s population was on the verge of becoming indentured servants to the supposedly smarter and tougher japanese this school of thought was epitomized by michael crichton s cautionary novel about an ascendant japan called rising sun 1992 which became a huge bestseller and blockbuster movie i read the book and saw the movie i now laugh at how the otherwise brilliant mr crichton got it so completely wrong the title imploding sun would have been more appropriate to be sure japan is finally getting off its feet but only after a lost generation of severe economic decline which brings me to china china remains a formidable competitor economically and militarily however signs are emerging that the country isn t on the verge of taking over the world not yet anyway new data cast doubt on the sustainability of the country s growth and long term competitiveness the chinese government reported monday that the country s gross domestic product gdp grew by 6 2 in the second quarter of 2019 the lowest figure since records began in march 1992 this protracted decline in growth is depicted in the following chart released july 15 by the research firm statista as you can see even during the global financial crisis in 2009 china s quarterly gdp growth did not fall below 6 4 the latest gdp data came in the wake of trade figures released last friday which showed that china s exports and imports both contracted in june beijing cited tariffs and sputtering growth around the world as the major reasons for china s weak second quarter many investors are unnerved by china s recent under performance and rightfully so china is the world s growth engine and a key barometer of the global economy s health in january 2019 the chinese government announced a 1 3 trillion yuan 193 billion spending package to stimulate the economy this shot of steroids only adds to china s massive existing debt the country s total debt now exceeds 300 of gdp an astronomical number to be fair global debt is increasing and other countries such as the u s shoulder considerable debt as well but by comparison the debt to gdp ratio is 100 for the u s the policy making mandarins in china s centralized mercantile economy racked up this debt during previous downturns by trying to stimulate the economy through infrastructure projects many of them poorly conceived and wasteful state banks are now plagued by nonperforming loans with the latest stimulus package china s leaders vowed they wouldn t get carried away as they have in the past the emphasis this time around has been on modest measures such as tax cuts for small businesses we ll see how the stimulus plays out during the rest of the year but analysts are increasingly gloomy about china s prospects will it get even worse economists with investment bank nomura nyse nmr stated last week that the worst is yet to come in the second half of 2019 for the chinese economy although china s gdp grew by a better than expected 6 4 in the first quarter nomura called this uptick illusory because it was driven by record high exports as chinese and american companies front loaded the shipment of goods to sidestep higher tariffs another red flag the volume and value of venture capital vc deals in china are in precipitous decline according to data released last week from research firm preqin 1 375 vc deals successfully closed in china during the first half of 2019 a nearly 50 decrease from the 2 593 deals closed in the same period a year ago the value of deals fell to 19 9 billion in the first half of this year a 66 decrease from 59 2 billion in the first half of last year the vc community is souring on china after discussions with chinese leader xi jinping at the g 20 summit in osaka japan in june president donald trump shelved additional tariffs of up to 25 on 300 billion worth of chinese goods trump also lifted restrictions on u s companies selling equipment to chinese telecom giant huawei however despite this ostensible trade truce several sanctions are still in effect and they re already taking their toll on corporate profits in addition to the trade standoff with china other geopolitical risks are rising tensions are growing worse between the u s and iran while the brexit mess is sowing political discord between britain and the european union read this story how to trade in the new era of chaos the u s wants certain trade concessions from china notably an end to the theft of intellectual property china refuses to budge xi can t afford to lose face with party leaders and the public by caving to the americans investors are desperate for any indication that a full blown trade war won t occur meanwhile the united states mexico canada agreement usmca which replaced the north american free trade agreement nafta still needs to be approved by the respective legislatures of those three trading partners war without end whenever you hear a fatuous pundit on cnbc say that the trade war is close to resolution don t you believe it president trump will continue to bash china all the way up to the 2020 election he has concluded that tough rhetoric against the foreign boogeyman is a political winner but strategic jockeying with china won t end with the next election conflict between the two great powers will drag on for years does china throw sharp elbows on trade absolutely the ascendancy of the chinese economy was largely based on cheap labor for decades china s policy has been to purloin or extort technological innovation from the west china denies it but the facts say otherwise however when it comes to labor costs china currently finds itself in a race to the bottom transnational firms are increasingly leaving china to relocate in developing countries with even lower wages such as vietnam cambodia malaysia thailand indonesia and bangladesh not surprisingly these alternatives to china are emerging as hot investment destinations in today s interconnected global economy tariffs only succeed in wreaking havoc with supply chains dampening economic activity and squeezing margins who loses with tariffs everyone including investors businesses and consumers fair but tough minded negotiations combined with strictly enforced multilateral trade pacts work best to curb bad actors on trade but such nuances don t play well with nationalists the trump administration s protectionist mindset on global trade is reminiscent of the 1980s when japan was viewed as the major threat to america s primacy in manufacturing and trade the reagan administration imposed a wide range of trade restrictions on japan in the 1980s they didn t work ignore the incendiary tweets and mute the tv pundits focus on the hard data the latest numbers don t bode well for

sydney and kuala lumpur jul 16 ips on 17 june a facebook white paper proposed a new global digital currency it plans to launch in the first half of 2020 the libra will be managed by a not for profit swiss based facebook led consortium of for profit corporations with uber ebay lyft mastercard and paypal among its founding members mixed reaction the initiative has received mixed reactions while a few have cautiously welcomed it most commentators want it stopped or tightly regulated with one calling it a totally insane idea anis chowdhury even president trump has declared he is not a fan of cryptocurrencies which facilitate illegal activity adding if facebook and other companies want to become a bank they must seek a new banking charter and become subject to all banking regulations just like other banks both national and international president trump s comments came a day after us federal reserve chairman jerome powell told lawmakers that libra could not move forward unless it addressed concerns over privacy money laundering consumer protection and financial stability meanwhile the g 20 finance ministers agreed that regulation of cryptocurrencies requires globally coordinated efforts involving national regional and international authorities spanning different regulatory and geographical borders unlike other cryptocurrencies with no intrinsic value libra will be backed by a basket of bank deposits and short term government securities hence when anyone buys libras the facebook led consortium will acquire matching securities in different currencies reversing this process when libras are redeemed although securities prices and exchange rates will become more volatile it is claimed that the libra will be more stable the plan is to become more decentralised over time more resistant to regulation and hence an unregulated shadow payment system cost cutting appeal jomo kwame sundaram facebook claims that libra will be more efficient than all existing payments platforms which are both fragmented and costly with highly regulated financial institutions at their core facing expensive prudential compliance requirements against money laundering and for consumer and privacy protection by avoiding them libra could reduce costs particularly for cross border transactions as facebook asserts its user friendly libra system can process 1 000 transactions every second with almost no transactions costs in early 2019 facebook had 2 38 billion monthly active users libra will allow facebook users to make financial transactions anywhere almost instantaneously as the libra becomes popular the consortium may offer more services particularly credit thus libra can shake up world finance not just banking systems but also by circumventing and disrupting central banks and governments compounding risks critics have raised privacy money laundering consumer protection and financial stability concerns pointing to facebook s track record of disregarding privacy exploiting user data and failing to control its platform facebook has already been investigated for massive privacy violations anti competitive practices eroding the free press and fomenting ethnic cleansing while the new money may enable more illicit activities according to the bank for international settlements cryptocurrencies issued by big tech companies such as facebook could quickly dominate global finance threatening competition and stability matt stoller of the open markets institute has described libra like a private global international monetary fund run by techbros except it needs reserves so it ll need a giant bailout during a crisis highlighting four core problems with libra first ensuring a reliable payments system while preventing illicit financial activities e g money laundering terrorist financing tax avoidance and counterfeiting second preventing conflicts of interests e g involving access to information business relations or technology third greater global systemic risk if libra succeeds governments will need to prepare for public bailouts of a private too big to fail system due to the systemic threat posed requiring more liquidity than any single central bank or government can provide fourth governments ability to pursue sovereign policy making will be curbed as libra and related decision making will be in private corporate hands not democratically accountable governments mark zuckerberg once bragged in a lot of ways facebook is more like a government than a traditional company we re really setting policies when libra becomes popular and the consortium offers other financial services private for profit companies would have their own central bank and fiat currency undermining central bank and government control over monetary policy this will effectively privatise monetary policy with scant regard for the public interest not for profit facebook claims the swiss based consortium governing libra will be a not for profit foundation but as libra becomes popular people will exchange their national currencies for libra to transact with when they hold libra the association will earn from investing users money and may even issue extra libra to earn seigniorage as central banks do with national currencies they can also profit handsomely from regulatory arbitrage e g between regulation and no regulation or even just less regulation even if libra remains just a payments system fully backed by fiat currencies in reserve consortium decisions to buy certain currencies and assets will move bond markets and exchange rates partners profits from using the financial data of libra users can grow rapidly if loosely checked and regulated first target developing countries facebook s explicit target is 1 7 billion developing country citizens without banking services promising to speed up transactions and cut costs for them thus developing countries poorer capacities and capabilities make them especially vulnerable to the libra threat already losing trillions of dollars via illicit fund transfers libra will likely accelerate such losses macroeconomic policies in major advanced economies make developing countries financial sectors vulnerable to shocks and volatility their already limited capacity for making independent macroeconomic policies will thus be further constrained as with the dollarization temptation those in countries with weak currencies will be tempted to libralize reducing use of national currencies for accounting and invoicing further complicating monetary policy and stability alternatives such an unregulated privately owned and directed global payments system issuing its own currency further diminishing policy space for development is alarming especially for developing countries but merely suspending the initiative until all its full ramifications are understood and appropriate regulatory measures are in place will not address the problems of existing systems that encourage such moves e g governments and central banks have lagged behind technological developments and have been slow in enabling low cost real time transactions therefore policymakers must urgently consider alternatives e g creating publicly owned digital currencies to supplement traditional monetary instruments they also need new laws and global treaties to check those issuing global digital currencies and mitigate negative fallouts anis chowdhury adjunct professor at western sydney university university of new south wales australia held senior united nations positions in

worker pay isn t rising fast enough to push up inflation federal reserve chairman jerome powell says even with the unemployment rate near a five decade low little inflation pressure makes it easier for the fed to cut short term interest rates we don t have any basis or any evidence for calling this a hot labor market powell says during testimony before the house financial services committee to call something hot you need to see some heat powell acknowledges that many businesses complain they cannot find enough workers to fill their open jobs but he adds that average hourly pay which grew 3

as the july meeting powell says that since fed officials met last month uncertainties around trade tensions and concerns about the strength of the global economy continue to weigh on the u s economic outlook meanwhile inflation has fallen further below the fed s annual target of 2 many investors have put the odds of a rate cut this month at 100 powell who has been under increasing attack by

we re here today to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the 1944 conference in bretton woods new hampshire as you all know the conference led to the creation of the international bank for reconstruction and development now the world bank of which i m president i d like to mention some key points in the world bank s financial history and discuss some of the development challenges many more details are in my essay in the bretton woods 75 compendium when the bretton woods conference opened on the evening of july 1 1944 battles raged across europe and the pacific u s treasury secretary henry morgenthau the chair of the conference urged the delegates from 44 countries to create a dynamic world economy in which the people of every nation will be able to realize their potentialities in peace to raise their own standards of living and enjoy increasingly the fruits of material progress the world bank started operations in 1947 collecting capital subscriptions from shareholding countries and approving its first loan that loan was a straightforward operation based on a short letter of application from france outlining france s reconstruction program the world bank issued its first bond in july 1947 and made a 250 million loan to france for equipment and raw material purchases that s in today s dollars 2 85 billion still one of the largest loans in the bank s history reconstruction remained one of the bank s key activities i was in osaka japan for the g20 meetings in june and rode the bullet train to tokyo the world bank helped finance it in the early 1960s in time for the 1964 tokyo olympics soon afterward japan was able to graduate from world bank financing and quickly became a major donor of the world bank we welcome that economic success and our partnership with japan and other donors through the decades another early activity of the bank was development the first paragraph of the articles of agreement states that one of the purposes of the bank is the encouragement of the development of productive facilities and resources in less developed countries the bank approved two sovereign loans to chile in 1948 for equipment and agricultural machinery still in the 1940s the bank recognized in its third annual report that part of its value was in analysis to help its members to analyze their development problems mapping out the broad lines along which their development may be advanced most soundly and rapidly many of these lines of development need to come from the private sector in 1956 the international finance corporation ifc opened for business with the difficult mission of investing only in private sector projects where sufficient private sector capital is not available on reasonable terms in 1960 the bank s shareholders created ida the international development association to make grants and low interest rate loans to the poorest countries since then ida has provided nearly 400 billion in 113 countries with donors replenishing its fund every three years there s been some success in terms of poverty reduction helped by the world bank group s development assistance and funding the number of people living in extreme poverty has declined by more than 1 1 billion the poverty rate in 2018 was estimated at 8 6 percent that s thought to be the lowest global average rate in history though it s still much too high in a world that has gone through a great deal of turbulence since world war ii ida s three year cycle of replenishing funds for the poorest countries has shown unusual stability and a clear sense of purpose by the end of 2019 we hope to conclude discussions on ida19 the 19th replenishment with france our host today playing a strong leadership role in the replenishment process and in encouraging the development community s focus on the sahel the needs facing ida and the world are great more than 700 million people still live in extreme poverty in sub saharan africa the numbers are growing not declining and 15 million new jobs would be needed every year to keep up with population growth there current economic growth rates will not be sufficient to achieve the ambitious goals that we all have for sustainable development just as the world bank and development policy evolved during the 75 years since the bretton woods conference so too did development finance the bank pioneered the currency swap in 1981 swapping u s dollars for swiss francs and deutschmarks with ibm the original world bank sovereign loan documents became much longer with clauses regarding negative pledges and pari passus oil exporters borrowed heavily in the 1970s using commercial bank loans that were syndicated to hundreds of participants creating very difficult debt restructurings in the 1980s i worked for treasury secretary james baker on the 1980s debt problems and then on the bond securitization process for secretary brady when i was the head of the developing nations and mdb part of treasury in the reagan administration with secretary brady i attended the world bank and imf annual meetings in berlin in the fall of 1988 and noted the vital importance of the world bank and other international financial institutions in the development of eastern europe after the fall of the berlin wall and the soviet union in 1989 the world bank issued the first globally traded and settled bond it eliminated pricing disparities between the united states and europe reducing the bank s borrowing costs the world bank created its first electronic bond in 2000 it was the first bond offered globally on the internet allowing retail investors to invest in the bank s development activities for the first time eight years later the bank issued the world s first green bond for the first time investors could directly support climate projects without incurring the project risk helping change the way investors decide how to allocate their investments for a balance of risk reward and developmental impact in 2018 the bank and shareholders developed a capital increase package for both the ibrd and ifc the ibrd portion encourages graduation and a differential pricing structure that will help shift resources toward borrowers that need it most it develops a sustainable lending limit that can help the bank s effectiveness the ifc capital increase builds on the experience that a country s private sector environment and its development plan core early ideas in the articles of agreement of the world bank are critical to meeting the world bank s mission of ending poverty and shared prosperity thus the world bank group of 2019 has vastly more tools and approaches than in its early days i ve mentioned ibrd ida and ifc there s also icsid the international centre for settlement of investment disputes founded in 1966 and miga the multilateral investment guarantee agency founded in 1988 when i was at the u s treasury department the first time the world bank group also uses a variety of analytical tools and provides technical and advisory services that have helped countries make progress one example is the annual doing business report which rates countries on their business environment including contract law start up regulation and taxation another example is the bank s women business and the law report a comprehensive global analysis of laws and regulations that affect women s ability to fully participate in the economy we are now using the human capital index which was launched last year to help quantify the importance of full health successful learning and job skills i d like to turn now to a short look ahead the focus of our work at the world bank group is based on strong country programs to improve living conditions to drive growth raise median incomes create jobs fully incorporate women and young people into economies address environmental and climate challenges and support a stronger more stable economy for everyone today the pace of innovation is accelerating and millions continue to escape poverty but many parts of the world are more fragile than in recent decades with more of the world s poor living in areas suffering from conflict violence and the effects of climate change strong leadership is needed to focus on liberty safety and creating an environment that fosters better opportunities we urgently need countries to break through their obstacles in order to allow the lives of the poorest and most vulnerable to improve secretary morgenthau closed the consequential bretton woods conference in the mountains of new hampshire on july 22 1944 75 years ago the participants had actively debated shaped and agreed on a set of ideas and ideals that built a strong foundation for the world bank group and our many ongoing developmental needs watch president david malpass remarks on bretton woods 75th anniversary

for the sake of the environment we must embrace the free market says alvarez show caption hide caption gas prices are cheapest on this day gas prices can vary widely depending on when you fill up usa today subscribe get local news and views with a subscription to rgj com starting at just 99 cents a month re for environment and nevada economy amodei should embrace clean energy says unr professor june 11 whenever i see somebody advocating the government promote clean energy i m reminded of a plea from a congressman i saw many years ago encouraging people to report price gouging at the gasoline pump if somebody saw a gasoline price that deviated upwards from some normal they were encouraged to report it to some hotline simultaneously there are regional committees that enforce regulations against undercutting on the price of gasoline in other words the real purpose of the central planners was to enforce the same price there s only one reason to set similar prices amongst vendors and that s not to curtail price gouging but to fix prices upwards the market will punish price gouging naturally driving gougers out of business how so if a vendor is selling gasoline 5 or 10 cents higher than other gas stations that vendor will lose market share to other vendors if somebody sees higher prices on the same gasoline don t call a hotline buy the cheaper gasoline furthermore how do we know what vendors are price gouging and what vendors are undercutting if half the stations have a price that s lower than the other half is one half price gouging or is one half undercutting that price gougers can t succeed in the free market is why cartels must rely upon government intervention and support all participants must raise prices in synchronization with one another the moment one participant begins to set prices pursuant to supply vs demand the entire cartel begins to collapse the problem for the cartel is that even if all participants set prices pursuant to the price fixing scheme vendors can t short inventory at prices above what consumers are both willing and able to pay higher prices beget fewer consumers diminishing the volume of sales the campaign against fossil fuels has nothing to do with saving the environment it s all about price fixing by erecting barriers for oil producers that benefit the big oil producers and big green energy companies that can t compete against fossil fuels it s about the restraint of trade to curtail competition not only is it about price fixing it s about waging war against humanity restricting the supply of energy is most injurious to the poor on one hand the government offers subsidies to people with low income on the other hand the government pursues policies that raise the cost of living opposing view for environment and nevada economy amodei should embrace clean energy says unr professor the key to an economic recovery does not rest in washington the key to an economic recovery is to put washington through a recession any efforts by politicians to con you into believing they re stimulating some kind of economic progress again bribing you with your own money by promoting one form of energy or another should be detected as a ruse some politicians have gone green in the name of curtailing dependence on fossil fuels and foreign oil it s a sham why not promote a certain type of underwear in the name of curtailing dependence on a particular foreign brand the fundamental problem is that most politicians and central planners view the economy as a blob to be manipulated rather than a complex capital structure involving individuals making choices in exchanges a process of production and a price mechanism last year the united states imported about 2 3 million barrels of oil per day more than it exported the reason why the united states is so dependent upon foreign oil is due to policies that have already been put in place the solution then is to repeal and correct these policies not creating new legislation artificially low interest rates brought on by loose monetary policy at the fomc drives capital overseas by deploying unearned income from a printing press disconnecting consumption from production capital is also consumed capital naturally gravitates to cheaper more efficient higher yield economies rather than generating revenue and income the nation spends beyond its means that s the short explanation i hate to spend time belaboring the long answer because i have already done so in previous commentaries look at it like this if a person firm or nation is dependent upon inflationary credit expansion then that person firm or nation is insolvent and inefficient we are spending beyond our means which yes engenders dependence upon cheaper markets to supply us with production if you want to reduce dependence upon foreign anything then the fed has to tighten forcing up interest rates and washington has to abandon the spending orgy dollars that have been accumulating in foreign reserves will then come flowing back into the domestic loan market begetting lower interest rates it s impossible for any industry including clean energy to thrive in the absence of sound economic policy rather than promoting one form of energy or another the best thing the government can do to buttress clean energy would be to pursue free market policies which extend the maximum number of benefits for the maximum number of people it s impossible for a government to bankrupt a people and keep industry intact i know clean energy sounds so nice so questioning it is very environmentally incorrect i will put everything i can into layman s terms let s start with the following axiom we consume energy in everything we do if you re that environmentally conscious you shouldn t be online reading this right now because you re using electricity which is consuming energy that s why i m confident that everybody reading this agrees with everything i write in this commentary solar energy sounds so nice after all it comes from the sun but let s not forget that there is a process of production take for example the solarization of a house solar energy requires panels charge controllers batteries inverters etc and then let s not forget capital asset depreciation energy is consumed during the process of production if clean energy has a positive yield then it will be profitable and private enterprise will pony up the capital the government need not encourage this if clean energy has a negative yield then this means that it is unprofitable and dependent on so called dirty energy for its sustenance it would be akin to consuming 1 000 blueberries for every 500 you are growing nobody in their right mind would pursue that course absent government subsidies somewhere you have to make up the difference i m not arguing that solar power is necessarily inefficient but that the market will naturally produce the most efficient and therefore the cleanest forms of energy it s the pursuit of profits on the free market that engenders efficiency it s government intervention in the marketplace that engenders inefficiency and the needless consumption of resources government subsidies enable firms to produce inefficient energy by mandating inefficiency only those with political connections can compete conversely sound economic policies enable firms to supply efficient forms of alternative energy absent government support this leads me to the following axiom the most profitable and economically efficient form of energy within the construct of the unhampered market is also the cleanest form of energy also pretending that global warming is real does this mean we should rely upon government coercion to solve the problem cancer is real but that doesn t mean we should trust the government to run our healthcare rather than saying end our dependence on oil if you support clean energy then you should be saying end our dependence on government intervention in the marketplace the best ecological hygienist is the unhampered market suppose a logging company owns a forest that logging company can clear cut the forest say tripling immediate income however this must be weighed against diminishing future income or the capital value of the forest as a whole suppose however this is government property this calculation no longer needs to be made and the objective is going to be rapid extraction of resources no shocker then that government is the biggest abuser of the environment and waster of resources look at the atomic weapons tests done in the nevada desert and right on top of our own military service members or think about the government s war policy which both major parties support last time i checked there are no cafe standards on tanks how are exploding munitions good for the environment the government does not sustain itself by satisfying consumer demands but through compulsory taxation government subsidies to and control over industry diminishes the need to set prices pursuant to supply vs demand why because sustenance is no longer nexused with having to satisfy consumer demands sustenance is disconnected from the satisfaction of consumer demands it s the price mechanism that ensures resources are allocated and managed efficiently the price mechanism can only function within the construct of the unhampered market allowing for producers to set prices pursuant to supply vs demand i e market clearing prices the scarcer the supply the greater the demand the higher the price consumption runs inversely with prices government subsidies distort prices interfering with the price mechanism and cause prices to be set above or below market clearing prices there is a paradox in government policy in that the government encourages consumption without production in the name of demand side stimulus tells us that we should conserve resources while simultaneously punishing price gouging within the construct of the unhampered market there can t be price gouging any more than there can be wage gouging since vendors can only short inventory at prices consumers are both willing and able to pay prices send signals to entrepreneurs telling them where to deploy capital prices tell entrepreneurs what to produce and what not to produce prices tell consumers what to buy and what not to buy the price mechanism can only function within the construct of an unhampered market there s no need for the government to encourage or discourage the use of any kind of energy and let s not forget that tax credits are subsidies camouflaged as tax cuts a tax credit merely allows a person to use a portion of their income for a specific purpose i e indirect subsidy i write as a native minnesotan minnesota is one of the states that mandated the use of ethanol blend fuels i hate ethanol blend fuel it s cheap for a reason it s inefficient there are environmental groups pointing out that the production of biofuels is a drag on the environment only politicians can get away with turning efficient food into inefficient fuel if politicians keep at it we will soon be filling our automobiles up with corn and drinking motor oil maybe after installing those solar panels the government can begin shooting those pollution particles which supposedly clean energy is designed to diminish into the atmosphere in order to block the sun and save us from global warming sounds like the perfect plan one only a politician in washington can dream up as i wrote almost a decade ago we will soon not only be dependent upon foreign sources of fossil fuels but also so called clean energy that has come to pass unfortunately it was due to misguided policies coming from washington if congressman mark amodei cares about

briefing highlights 80 loonie within reach a trudeau scene i d love to see stocks loonie oil at a glance goldman sachs tops esimates jpmorgan profit rises required reading 80 canadian dollar a foreign bank believes we could soon see a canadian dollar worth about 80 us cents that may not be something canadian exporters want to see but it might give summer vacationers to the u s a bit of a leg up in buying power olivier korber foreign exchange derivatives strategist at société générale made that call after last week s bank of canada rate decision and federal reserve chair jerome powell s monetary policy testimony what that showed mr korber said in his latest outlook is that north american central banks are definitely out of sync by that he meant that the fed is preparing to cut interest rates as early as this month actually while the bank of canada isn t expected to change its benchmark rate from its current 1 75 per cent for some time yet and it may not cut at all many observers believe but rather just sit it out which would make the loonie more attractive against the u s dollar as the fed ratchets down usd cad continues to lag the move in relative rates and the boc is definitely out of sync with the fed which is securing expectations of the coming easing cycle mr korber said referring to the u s versus the canadian dollar by their symbols with equities shining a summer move towards 1 25 is possible he added that 1 25 translating to a loonie at 80 us cents bank of nova scotia in turn says its fair value model puts an estimated equilibrium exchange rate nearer to 80 us cents but its year end target for the loonie is just above 78 us cents the risk of a more precipitous general usd decline in the next few months cannot be ignored however scotiabank said in its outlook muddying some waters here is president donald trump who has been attacking the fed for not yet cutting rates and has complained the u s currency is too high and that certain other currencies notably the euro and yuan are too low the president has taken a variety of views on usd since entering the white house but now seems more clearly focused on a weaker exchange rate scotiabank said investors will also need to closely monitor how this issue evolves in the coming months and whether a lower usd becomes a more or less formal policy objective senior economist jonas goltermann of capital economics in turn believes the loonie is headed for a fall along with norway s krone both of which are tied to oil prices mr goltermann believes not only that oil prices will ease in the second half of the year but also that the bank of canada will cut interest rates more aggressively than others anticipate the upshot is that we forecast both the loonie and the krone to depreciate against the u s dollar by 7 per cent and 8 per cent respectively between now and the end of 2019 he said read more a scene i d love to see it s a pancake who says i waffle open this photo in gallery

let s say you are deciding between two models of federal reserve candidates one has no fixed principles and embraces whatever is most politically expedient the other has a blind commitment to a dangerously wrong set of beliefs to borrow from hamilton i know it s lose lose but if you had to choose or maybe you don t because with judy shelton you can get both last week president trump announced plans to fill two vacant fed slots with shelton now u s executive director at the european bank for reconstruction and development and christopher waller the research director at the st louis federal reserve bank waller has kept a low profile but looks like a serious researcher and reasonable candidate the same cannot be said of shelton who appears to have deftly tricked the president into thinking she supports all his bad ideas when she actually supports different possibly even worse bad ideas shelton a denizen of the republican gold bug circuit in some ways resembles trump s two recent failed fed picks stephen moore and herman cain like them she decried monetary and fiscal stimulus even while we were on the brink of depression when a democrat happened to be president but she supports ultralow rates and shrugs off deep deficits now when the economy is much stronger and can it be coincidence a republican occupies the white house back during the obama years easy money and profligate fiscal policy were about to stoke ruinous inflation and debase the dollar shelton argued zero percent interest rates were equivalent to stealing from savers she argued that the fed should stop trying to make its supposedly favored politicians look good or inflate financial markets today she has been transformed or she wants her audience of one to believe so anyway she believes interest rates should be cut to zero the fed should support the president s agenda and the central bank should help prop up markets people can evolve what s striking about shelton s evolutions however is that they concur exactly with what the president wants to hear these about faces call into question whether she would safeguard the fed s political independence a feature necessary for it to function trump after all has made clear he s looking for a puppet having been disappointed that the four sitting board members he previously chose haven t done his bidding besides the flip flops shelton has demonstrated her personal loyalty with effusive praise of the president she has pointedly mentioned multiple times that trump s mar a lago club would be a lovely place for a major international monetary conference a bretton woods for the 21st century this brings me to what her actual monetary policy views are and they re doozies there is one doctrine shelton has consistently promoted for decades including in recent public comments it s sometimes difficult for laypeople probably including the president to decipher unless you understand the sound money or dependable dollar code of the crank right wing fringe her radical vision involves replacing the fed s mandate of stable prices and maximum employment with a gold standard the gold standard is roundly rejected by economists and was abandoned ages ago worldwide for good reason gold prices are volatile a gold peg also crimps liquidity in times of crisis as it did during the great depression she also wants the rest of the world to adopt some version of the same thing resulting in either fixed exchange rates or even a single global common currency that s where bretton woods at mar a lago comes in there s a lot to say about why such a system would create more severe business cycles and more international financial contagion for now it s worth pointing out that if trump actually understood what shelton is promoting he probably never would have tapped her for the fed because it contradicts so much of what he stands for such a system would mean ceding u s sovereignty over its currency as well as tighter monetary policy and at least theoretically tighter fiscal policy too she s riding two horses at the same time says american enterprise institute fellow desmond lachman shelton has tried to reconcile her grand globalist un trumpian vision with trumpian policy goals with some skillful sleights of hand in a recent washington post op ed for instance she complained that other countries are cutting rates to manipulate their currency what trump wants to hear but proposed as a solution a new dependable dollar an unsubtle wink to her fellow gold bugs but if confirmed to the fed she might eventually have to choose a lane lackey or crank catherine rampell s column is distributed by the washington post writers group

in the late 1850s the united states experienced a political realignment when the whig party disbanded and many of its members including abraham lincoln joined the nascent republican party because of the betrayal of the whig leadership over the issue of slavery and its extension american politics may be poised for a similar realignment today as popular disaffection with the two major parties and their domination by corporate money and interests increases polls show that 57 percent of americans want a major new party including 71 percent of millennials the reason for these figures are not hard to discern from climate change to rising cost of education to a lack of a universal health care system to a policy of endless war the washington ruling elite has failed its citizenry a princeton and northwestern university study found that there is no correlation between public preferences expressed in opinion polls and the decisions made in congress let alone by the executive branch the study concluded that the preferences of the average american appear to have only a minuscule near zero statistically non significant impact upon public policy the movement for a people s party mpp was founded in 2017 and has begun to attract a considerable following in an attempt to reverse the trend towards oligarchy party founder nick brana who in 2016 served as national outreach director for bernie sanders stated in an interview that we are now at a historic moment just like in 1852 when the whig elites went against their base when they adopted a pro slavery position that led to the formation of the republican party similarly today the democratic party has abandoned its working class base creating a fissure between the party and the people that necessitates the foundation of a new party brana points to the rapid formation of new political parties in mexico and europe in the midst of wide scale disaffection with neoliberal policies as a model for the united states he sees the green party as equivalent to the free soilers and other 19th century parties which set the groundwork for more successful parties like the socialists and populists at the turn of the 20th century these latter parties amassed large followings not only in urban centers like new york but also in the southwest among farmers by promoting the regulation or break up of wall street banks that had plunged them into debt by selling them usurious loans according to brana the green party today is too wedded to an electoral strategy and runs candidates who do not have a strong local connection to the communities in which they are running the mpps strategy is different in that it is focused on grass roots organizing its members have rallied for climate justice with zero hour demonstrated for peace at the women s march on the pentagon boycotted driscoll s batteries on behalf of exploited farmworkers picketed with striking teachers and hotel employees promoted the public banking movement participated in civil disobedience with the poor people s campaign and helped institute ranked choice voting in maine mpp political director carol ehrle a former journalist and media relations specialist stated that the mpp was focused on establishing coalitions with progressive and non profit organizations and labor unions like the afl cio whose executive council endorsed mpp in 2017 the afl cio passed a resolution stating that whether candidates are elected from the republican or democratic party the interests of wall street have been protected and that the time has passed when we can passively settle for the lesser of two evils politics in his 2016 book bernie and the sandernistas jeffrey st clair editor of counterpunch website criticized bernie sanders the left wing democratic party stalwart for being a fake revolutionary who failed to speak out enough against u s foreign policy and directed his followers into the counter revolutionary fold of the democratic party according to st clair during the 2016 presidential campaign sanders should have done precisely with the mpp is now doing mobilize his followers to support civil disobedience and direct action protests and link up with those directly challenging corporate power the mpp on its website is calling for a new economic bill of rights that would guarantee employment food clothing leisure a living wage housing healthcare social security education and freedom from monopolies and unfair competition to every american based on the model of fdr s new deal it wants to set up a massive public works program that will help generate full employment and revitalize america s infrastructure other planks call for free medicaire for all free public college and quality education the abolishment of free trade agreements that benefit large corporations a fair tax code that increases inheritance taxes and tax on the wealthy banning offshore oil drilling and fracking improvement of public transportation sustainable agriculture and strong legislation that supports labor unions and workplace democracy including through encouragement of workers cooperatives a skeptic would suggest that these latter measures are unfeasible in the american system and that some of the measures are being advanced by the democratic party public opinion polls show however that most of these measures are widely supported by the electorate while the democratic party leadership remains wedded to large corporations the frontrunner in the 2020 party primary joe biden stated that the rich and powerful are not a problem and has a long record of supporting corporate friendly legislation many of the other contenders also have dubious backgrounds including kamala harris who upheld the death penalty in the state of california as a district attorney and covered up for prosecutorial misconduct if a third party should emerge anywhere oklahoma the state where i live is a prime target over a decade of austerity policies have decimated public and higher education and cut basic services there to third world levels a guardian article in 2017 described a dire situation where a teacher was seen panhandling to buy supplies for her classroom county jails were dangerously overcrowded and riddled with abuse and families had to wait ten years just to get on a wait list to obtain state support for caring for a disabled child all while nearly one in four children struggled with hunger the state legislature in the face of this crisis remained fixated on sustaining low tax rates for the oil corporations which fund its representatives fracking pioneer harold hamm the 43rd wealthiest man on the planet is a prime donor of the state s republican party while the democrats receive substantial funding from oil industry billionaire george kaiser a self professed red state robber baron who helped turn the state into his own private tax haven historian richard hofstadter compares third parties in american history to bees who sting and then die their sting is nevertheless sharply felt even if for a fleeting moment along with their buzz the mpp is a promising new organization which could yield a major impact the time is indeed ripe for a new third party to blossom and there is no time to lose

commentary from 1991 to 1994 i worked in mexico city as the director of new mexico s mexico commercial tourism office this was the period when the north american free trade agreement nafta was negotiated and formally enacted by all three countries on january 1 1994 american ex patriots such as myself formed an ad hoc group to lobby the mexican government and u s policymakers in favor of passing nafta i remember being at the u s embassy in mexico city with other compatriots eating snacks and drinking beer while watching the u s house of representatives debate and then vote in favor of the agreement it was an exciting time to be involved in the international trade arena and i was grateful to witness first hand the creation of nafta twenty five years later as yogi berra would say it s déjà vu all over again on june 26 dr luz maria de la mora sanchez mexico s undersecretary for foreign trade visited the el paso juarez region to speak about north american trade and the importance of the u s passing the revised nafta agreement that is being called the united states mexico canada agreement usmca i had the opportunity to meet with de la mora sanchez and discuss opportunities to improve trade between the u s and mexico as with most mexican diplomats i have ever dealt with de la mora sanchez is extremely educated phd from yale polished and very charming she spoke of mexico s challenge to close the economic gap between mexico s poorer southern states and the more affluent ones in the north she also discussed how the andres manuel lopez obrador amlo administration has spearheaded the passage of labor reforms in mexico which although a 180 degree change in direction will take time to see effects she stressed that amlo had raised the minimum wage along the border by 100 percent and this had not affected inflation as some people worried it would as per the new usmca de la mora sanchez was a very effective lobbyist for its ratification by the u s congress she referred to nafta as being transformational for mexico and a tool used her country to improve its economic development at present 78 percent of mexico s economy is based on foreign trade as opposed to 64 percent in canada and 28 percent in the u s today mexico is the eighth largest exporter and ninth largest importer in the world more than 540 billion in foreign direct investment has been injected into mexico since 1999 one of the largest totals for an emerging economy at present mexico has 13 free trade agreements with 50 different countries de la mora sanchez advocated that mexico and the u s are part of one production platform and that nafta has helped integrate the economies trade between the u s and mexico is seven times larger than it was before nafta the u s exports more than 265 billion to mexico our southern neighbor has become the third largest trading partner for the u s during the nafta period buying 16 percent of the u s s total world exports more than 1 7 billion of trade is generated between the u s and mexico daily note that for the first six months of 2019 mexico was the biggest trading partner of the u s due to the current u s china trade war approximately 40 percent of the content of mexican products exported to the u s are of u s origin i e u s plastic steel and electronic components based on this de la mora made an interesting point when she said when mexico exports the u s also exports mexico is the second largest buyer of u s agricultural products and the largest supplier of these products to the u s exports to mexico account for 38 percent of new mexico s international trade and 34 2 percent of those of texas the highest percentage of any u s states mexico s congress passed the new usmca on june 19 de la mora sanchez stated that mexico understands the concerns by many u s policymakers as to whether the agreement adequately protects labor rights she emphasized that labor and anti corruption elements are parts of the usmca and these will help both countries create a stronger trade foundation however mexico does not want to reopen negotiations on the usmca rather it wants to explain how it is going to address these issues going forward de la mora concluded our meeting by emphasizing how the u s and mexico are good neighbors and important to each other s economies she did point out that unilateral issues i interpreted this as referring to the trump administration s most recent threat of tariffs against mexico are not helpful and that there are always issues that friends have but unilateral actions are a self inflicted wound on both countries she strongly feels that the u s and mexico can work together to create effective solutions to solve our problems this is what good partners do with these concluding thoughts from de la mora i was transferred back to 1994 jerry pacheco is executive director of the international business accelerator a non profit trade counseling program of the new mexico small business

people who get a kick out of watching children at play must love the spectacle staged in washington every time the issue of the federal debt ceiling comes up but they re the only ones for most responsible onlookers the spectacle is nerve racking taxpayers face higher government costs and suspended programs people who provide services to the government for pay including public employees get stiffed investors fret over the possibility that a federal default on its debt will produce a surge in interest rates and a stock market crash and a long term crisis of confidence in the safety of u s government securities economists worry about potentially cataclysmic effects on global financial systems advertisement most politicians wish in their hearts that the debt ceiling would just go away yet it s still with us despite universal judgment that it s useless and a perennial waste of everyone s time even president trump displaying shockingly wise economic judgment has dissed the debt ceiling for many years people have been talking about getting rid of the debt ceiling altogether he said in june 2017 there are lots of good reasons to do that for many years people have been talking about getting rid of the debt ceiling altogether there are lots of good reasons to do that president trump 2017 trump hasn t repeated that sentiment since then as far as we can tell that s too bad because the debt ceiling is back after a suspension of roughly 13 months enacted as part of a bipartisan budget bill in february 2018 the debt ceiling went back into effect on march 9 at the level of government debt in the marketplace at that moment 22 trillion in other words the government instantly hit the ceiling advertisement since then the treasury has kept the government going through what are known as temporary extraordinary measures and what managers of household budgets know as moving money around these include deferring payments to government funds that would otherwise require issuing government debt thus leaving some borrowing headroom for other purposes the funds include the government employee retirement fund and a thrift savings plan investment fund which holds retirement investments made by government workers the funds will be made whole once the debt ceiling crisis passes but at a cost to taxpayers that could run into the hundreds of millions of dollars business column the debt ceiling fight this time it s different and much more dangerous every couple of years with a regularity you can almost set your watch by congress flirts with the threat of not raising the federal debt ceiling and toying with a federal default the extraordinary measures can work only for a short period after which they run out by the treasury s current reckoning that point comes in mid september in other words that s the drop dead date for raising the debt ceiling adding to nervousness about the date is that it s been creeping closer the treasury originally said it would have enough options to keep the debt ceiling from being breached until november then it revised its projection to the end of october and again to september the changes result chiefly from shortfalls in government tax collections because of the tax cut bill republicans enacted in december 2017 on the promise that it would pay for itself it hasn t let s be clear that the consequences of breaching the debt ceiling would be dire if the government defaults on its bonds by missing a payment its cost of borrowing would instantly rise placing a further burden on the budget and cratering the value of treasury securities held by individuals pension funds and sovereign nations the safe haven stature of t bonds and the dollar would be deeply impaired interest rates would rise for all forms of debt mortgages credit cards state and local borrowing government output of social security checks tax refunds medicare reimbursements military salaries and more would be reduced or halted advertisement the ultimate deadline for when the government will run out of money has been creeping closer it s now at mid september bipartisan policy center before we get into the substance of the current discussions which involve house speaker nancy pelosi d san francisco and treasury secretary steven t mnuchin let s canter through the historical background of this stupid government rule as we ve reported many times before the debt ceiling originally was enacted to give the treasury more freedom to issue debt not less that was in 1917 at that time congress was required to vote on every bond issue which the members rightly considered a pain in the rear they decided that it would be better to give treasury blanket authority to issue bonds but not unlimited authority so it imposed an aggregate limit advertisement by the 1960s the limit became a hindrance to fiscal policy raising it turned into a routine since 1962 congress has raised the limit roughly 100 times on average more than once a year more recently unfortunately the debt ceiling acquired the image of a brake on fiscal irresponsibility on capitol hill the idea being that if the government was forbidden to borrow it would have to live within its means this was a gift to tea party types and other conservatives whose goal was to shrink federal programs typically those that served the working class and the poor they could proclaim themselves guardians of public resources with the debt ceiling serving as their line in the sand this was always mere posturing spending decisions are made by congress almost always without regard to the debt ceiling which comes into play later when the treasury is tasked with finding the money for congressional mandates the government accountability office delivered a reality dose about this as bluntly as possible in a report in february 2011 the debt limit does not control or limit the ability of the federal government to run deficits or incur obligations the agency wrote rather it is a limit on the ability to pay obligations already incurred politicians who never stop jabbering about the need for individuals to accept personal responsibility for their finances always seem to forget that when the topic turns to the need for government to make good on its borrowing republicans and democrats have agreed to raise the debt ceiling scores of times over the decades but the negotiations have been getting nastier bipartisan policy center advertisement the government has always managed to avoid default but sometimes it has been a close call in 2011 congress passed an increase only hours before the ultimate deadline averting default but prompting standard and poor s to downgrade the creditworthiness of u s government debt for the first time ever in 2013 the ceiling was raised with a day to spare in 2017 weeks and in 2018 a month producing the suspension that expired on march 9 serious economic policy thinkers aren t comforted by this sort of brinkmanship in 2003 when the debt limit kicked in for three months the government had to call in bonds held by a civil service retirement fund early costing the fund and its members more than 1 billion in lost interest former reagan economic advisor bruce bartlett accurately called the debt ceiling fight in 2009 a uniquely american political crisis with its roots in political theater the danger always is that the children in whose hands this weapon rests can t be trusted to understand its potency in 2010 for instance a republican congressman from south carolina airily dismissed concerns about the consequences of a default on u s government debt i have heard people say that if we don t do it it will be the end of the world he said then i have yet to meet someone who can articulate the negative consequences that was mick mulvaney who is now director of the office of management and budget fortunately treasury secretary mnuchin like all his predecessors is fully alive to the negative consequences he has been urging action on the debt ceiling since the spring but progress has been stalled by discord on broader budget issues on monday pelosi turned down his proposal for a short term rise in the debt ceiling to be enacted next week before congress leaves for its summer recess pelosi and her house democratic caucus want an agreement that protects nonmilitary spending from cuts which the trump white house so far has refused to accept advertisement pelosi isn t asking enough she should demand abolition of the debt ceiling as the price of lifting it now almost every deal to raise the debt ceiling in recent years has produced bad policy one way or another the consequences of breaching the ceiling are just too serious for this weapon to remain in partisan arsenals on either side of the aisle it does nothing but get in the way of intelligent fiscal management get rid of it already
everything to know about the april 8 eclipse in atlantic canada saltwire eclipse saltwire by lucia mutikani washington reuters u s retail sales increased more than expected in june pointing to strong consumer spending which could help to blunt some of the drag on the economy from weak business investment the report from the commerce department on tuesday did not change market expectations that the federal reserve will cut interest rates this month for the first time in a decade related stories but coming on the heels of solid employment growth in june and a pickup in underlying inflation the signs of strong consumer spending further reduced the possibility of the u s central bank cutting rates by 50 basis points at its july 30 31 policy meeting as markets had initially anticipated fed chairman jerome powell last week told lawmakers the central bank would act as appropriate to protect the economy against risks stoked by a trade war between the united states and china as well as

userfriendly chided me for not having reproduced this classic as i did for michal kalecki s 1943 essay on the obstacles to reaching full employment apparently this classic article by beardsley ruml on why what we would now call a sovereign currency issuer doesn t need taxes in order to spend doesn t show up well on the internet for instance links to full versions don t have a preview which is an impediment to sharing it on twitter so to encourage you to read and share it we re reproducing it below enjoy this article was first published in the january 1946 issue of american affairs taxes for revenue are obsolete by beardsley ruml chairman of the federal reserve bank of new york mr ruml read this paper before the american bar association during the last year of the war it attracted then less attention than it deserved and is even more timely now with the tax structure undergoing change for peacetime his thesis is that given 1 control of a central banking system and 2 an inconvertible currency a sovereign national government is finally free of money worries and need no longer levy taxes for the purpose of providing itself with revenue all taxation therefore should be regarded from the point of view of social and economic consequences the paragraph that embodies this idea will be found italicized in the text mr ruml does not say precisely how in that case the government would pay its own bills one may assume that it would either shave its expenses out of the proceeds of taxes levied for social and economic ends or print the money it needs the point may be academic the latter end of his paper is devoted to an argument against taxing corporation profits editor the superior position of public government over private business is nowhere more clearly evident than in government s power to tax business business gets its many rule making powers from public government public government sets the limits to the exercise of these rule making powers of business and protects the freedom of business operations within this area of authority taxation is one of the limitations placed by government on the power of business to do what it pleases there is nothing reprehensible about this procedure the business that is taxed is not a creature of flesh and blood it is not a citizen it has no voice in how it shall be governed nor should it the issues in the taxation of business are not moral issues but are questions of practical effect what will get the best results how should business be taxed so that business will make its greatest contribution to the common good it is sometimes instructive when faced with alternatives to ask the underlying question if we are to understand the problems involved in the taxation of business we must first ask why does the government need to tax at all this seems to be a simple question but as is the case with simple questions the obvious answer is likely to be a superficial one the obvious answer is of course that taxes provide the revenue which the government needs in order to pay its bills it happened if we look at the financial history of recent years it is apparent that nations have been able to pay their bills even though their tax revenues fell short of expenses these countries whose expenses were greater than their receipts from taxes paid their bills by borrowing the necessary money the borrowing of money therefore is an alternative which governments use to supplement the revenues from taxation in order to obtain the necessary means for the payment of their bills a government which depends on loans and on the refunding of its loans to get the money it requires for its operations is necessarily dependent on the sources from which the money can be obtained in the past if a government persisted in borrowing heavily to cover its expenditures interest rates would get higher and higher and greater and greater inducements would have to be offered by the government to the lenders these governments finally found that the only way they could maintain both their sovereign independence and their solvency was to tax heavily enough to meet a substantial part of their financial needs and to be prepared if placed under undue pressure to tax to meet them all the necessity for a government to tax in order to maintain both its independence and its solvency is true for state and local governments but it is not true for a national government two changes of the greatest consequence have occurred in the last twenty five years which have substantially altered the position of the national state with respect to the financing of its current requirements the first of these changes is the gaining of vast new experience in the management of central banks the second change is the elimination for domestic purposes of the convertibility of the currency into gold 1 as an instrument of fiscal policy to help stabilize the purchasing power of the dollar 2 to express public policy in the distribution of wealth and of income as in the case of the progressive income and estate taxes 3 to express public policy in subsidizing or in penalizing various industries and economic groups 4 to isolate and assess directly the costs of certain national benefits such as highways and social security in the recent past we have used our federal tax program consciously for each of these purposes in serving these purposes the tax program is a means to an end the purposes themselves are matters of basic national policy which should be established in the first instance independently of any national tax program among the policy questions with which we have to deal are these do we want a dollar with reasonably stable purchasing power over the years do we want greater equality of wealth and of income than would result from economic forces working alone do we want to subsidize certain industries and certain economic groups do we want the beneficiaries of certain federal activities to be aware of what they cost these questions are not tax questions they are questions as to the kind of country we want and the kind of life we want to lead the tax program should be a means to an agreed end the tax program should be devised as an instrument and it should be judged by how well it serves its purpose by all odds the most important single purpose to be served by the imposition of federal taxes is the maintenance of a dollar which has stable purchasing power over the years sometimes this purpose is stated as the avoidance of inflation and without the use of federal taxation all other means of stabilization such as monetary policy and price controls and subsidies are unavailing all other means in any case must be integrated with federal tax policy if we are to have tomorrow a dollar which has a value near to what it has today the war has taught the government and the government has taught the people that federal taxation has much to do with inflation and deflation with the prices which have to be paid for the things that are bought and sold if federal taxes are insufficient or of the wrong kind the purchasing power in the hands of the public is likely to be greater than the output of goods and services with which this purchasing demand can be satisfied if the demand becomes too great the result will be a rise in prices and there will be no proportionate increase in the quantity of things for sale this will mean that the dollar is worth less than it was before that is inflation on the other hand if federal taxes are too heavy or are of the wrong kind effective purchasing power in the hands of the public will be insufficient to take from the producers of goods and services all the things these producers would like to make this will mean widespread unemployment the dollars the government spends become purchasing power in the hands of the people who have received them the dollars the government takes by taxes cannot be spent by the people and therefore these dollars can no longer be used to acquire the things which are available for sale taxation is therefore an instrument of the first importance in the administration of any fiscal and monetary policy to distribute the wealth the second principal purpose of federal taxes is to attain more equality of wealth and of income than would result from economic forces working alone the taxes which are effective for this purpose are the progressive individual income tax the progressive estate tax and the gift tax what these taxes should be depends on public policy with respect to the distribution of wealth and of income it is important here to note that the estate and gift taxes have little or no significance as tax measures for stabilizing the value of the dollar their purpose is the social purpose of preventing what otherwise would be high concentration of wealth and income at a few points as a result of investment and reinvestment of income not expended in meeting day to day consumption requirements these taxes should be defended and attacked it terms of their effects on the character of american life not as revenue measures the third reason for federal taxes is to provide a subsidy for some industrial or economic interest the most conspicuous example of these taxes is the tariffs on imports originally taxes of this type were imposed to serve a double purpose since a century and a half ago the national government required revenues in order to pay its bills today tariffs on imports are no longer needed for revenue these taxes are nothing more than devices to provide subsidies to selected industries their social purpose is to provide a price floor above which a domestic industry can compete with goods which can be produced abroad and sold in this country more cheaply except for the tariff protection the subsidy is paid not at the port of entry where the imported goods are taxed but in the higher price level for all goods of the same type produced and sold at home the fourth purpose served by federal taxes is to assess directly and visibly the costs of certain benefits such taxation is highly desirable in order to limit the benefits to amounts which the people who benefit are willing to pay the most conspicuous examples of such measures are the social security benefits old age and unemployment insurance the social purposes of giving such benefits and of assessing specific taxes to meet the costs are obvious unfortunately and unnecessarily in both cases the programs have involved staggering deflationary consequences as a result of the excess of current receipts over current disbursements the bad tax the federal tax on corporate profits is the tax which is most important in its effect on business operations there are other taxes which are of great concern to special classes of business there are many problems of state and local taxation of business which become extremely urgent particularly when a corporation has no profits at all however we shall confine our discussion to the federal corporation income tax since it is in this way that business is principally taxed we shall also confine our considerations to the problems of ordinary peacetime taxation since during wartime many tax measures such as the excess profits tax have a special justification taxes on corporation profits have three principal consequences all of them bad briefly the three bad effects of the corporation income tax are

into record territory as the curtain rose on what s expected to be the weakest earnings reporting season in years financial stocks fell even though citigroup said it made more money last quarter than analysts expected energy stocks were also weak but gains for technology and health care stocks helped tip the s p 500 and other indexes past the highs set on friday the s p 500 rose 0 53 points or less than 0 1 to 3 014 30 after drifting between a gain of 0 1 and a loss of 0 2 earlier in the day the dow jones industrial average gained 27 13 or 0 1 to 27 359 16 and the nasdaq composite added 14 04 or 0 2 to 8 258 19 stocks have jumped since early june on increasing expectations that the federal reserve will cut interest rates to help the economy and investors are virtually certain that it will happen at the next fed meeting at the end of this month the only question investors say is how deeply the fed will cut when it lowers rates for the first time in a decade until then the main drivers for the market will likely be the hundreds of earnings reports scheduled to come from big companies showing how much profit they made from april through june it s waiting for this really all important second quarter earnings season to heat up said thomas martin senior portfolio manager at globalt investments expectations are generally dim and wall street is forecasting a 3 drop in earnings per share for s p 500 companies from a year ago that would mark the first back to back drop in three years according to factset this week roughly a fifth of the companies in the s p 500 are set to report their second quarter results citigroup was one of the reporting season s early headliners but its stock initially fell as much as 2 4 after reporting better than expected results its stock recovered as the day progressed and it ended monday down only 0 1 other banks though didn t have as strong a recovery and financial stocks in the s p 500 dropped 0 5 for the second sharpest loss among the 11 sectors that make up the index jpmorgan chase which will report its second quarter results on tuesday fell 1 2 and was the biggest individual drag on the s p 500 every earnings reporting season companies usually turn in results that top analysts expectations that may be even easier to do this time around with analysts forecasting the worst drop in quarterly earnings for the s p 500 in three years at 3 according to factset the bar for corporate earnings has been set quite low and we don t think it will take much to surprise on the upside said jon adams senior investment strategist at bmo global asset management that s why he said he ll be paying close attention to which companies are able to grow their revenues despite the stronger dollar and weakening economic trends around the world and not just which companies are beating earnings forecasts he s also focusing on companies able to keep their profit margins high when wage growth for workers at many companies is starting to nudge higher several economic reports are also on the schedule this week including updates on retail sales the housing industry and shoppers confidence the u s economy has generally remained solid but investors don t expect this week s reports to alter the direction of the fed which has already given hints about rate cuts given weakening economic trends around the world the white house s repeated threats to raise tariffs has made companies at home more hesitant and hurt trade internationally they re a big reason that china on monday reported its weakest quarter of economic growth in at least 26 years you could make a case that the fed shouldn t need to cut in this market but they ve clearly prepared the market for a cut said adams energy stocks fell 0 9 monday for the sharpest

indonesia will require nothing less than a policy overhaul starting with its state owned power utility to meet the target of having 23 per cent of its electricity generated from hydro solar and other renewable sources in 2025 according to a new report released last week unless southeast asia s largest economy radically changes its roll out of renewable energy clean sources will only make up 12 per cent of the energy mix in 2025 said management consulting firm at kearney in its report titled indonesia s energy transition a case for action this means it would only achieve about half its target there are four main barriers to renewable energy growth but at the heart of the issue is that no single agency in indonesia is accountable for the development of renewable energy stated the report done in partnership with the employers association of indonesia or asosiasi pengusaha indonesia apindo which has over 14 000 corporate members across the country the government should make state owned power utility pln or perusahaan listrik negara accountable for the deployment of renewable energy argued the authors we believe that with a new government in place indonesia is now well positioned to drive a targeted initiative to take a fresh look at how it can accelerate the adoption of renewable energy for electricity generation especially through the lens of new policies alessandro gazzini partner at kearney conflict of interest as it stands pln may not be fully incentivised to boost the growth of renewables the authors said it has a monopoly on electricity distribution in the country and is also the largest owner of fossil fuel generation assets historically there have been many cases where pln has not signed a power purchase agreement with renewable energy developers even with feed in tariff schemes noted the authors a feed in tariff is a fixed amount paid to renewable energy producers for the power they export to the grid purchasing more renewable energy might require more subsidies at least until scale is reached and lessons learnt which would weaken pln s financial position noted the report and with pln owning and operating more than half of the coal power plants in indonesia rapid renewable energy growth could pose a direct risk to these assets coal makes up 51 per cent of indonesia s energy mix small renewable energy projects with variable output may also expose pln s grids to stability issues the authors at kearney partners sandeep biswas and alessandro gazzini as well as its principal sayak datta called for the government to provide pln with the tools and incentives to boost renewable energy for instance it should agree on and approve subsidy amounts to pln for renewable energy growth redirecting subsidies some unfavourable policies and regulatory uncertainty are also hindering the growth of hydro solar wind and geothermal power with installed capacity a mere fraction of the total potential estimated by the government in 2017 the installed capacity of solar was 0 01 per cent of the estimated potential while hydro was at 7 per cent the report noted that same year the country invested us 1 billion in renewables a fraction of the us 62 billion that at kearney estimated is needed annually between 2018 and 2025 coal mining groups in indonesia receive sizeable government support in the form of loan guarantees tax exemptions and other fiscal support said the report in 2015 indonesia s post tax energy subsidies amounted to us 97 billion according to a recent international monetary fund working paper which noted that china the united states and russia were among the top subsidisers of fossil fuels this may have been appropriate years ago when indonesia was trying to supply electricity to many more citizens but the government should now direct more subsidies towards renewable energy to achieve long term economic and climate goals said gazzini policies such as the cap on feed in tariffs for wind and solar mean that renewables essentially compete directly with coal rendering many clean energy projects economically unfeasible in contrast southeast asian neighbour vietnam has stipulated feed in tariffs for solar and wind that are higher than the tariff for power generated from conventional sources renewable energy developers in indonesia also struggle with the lack of private financing according to the report to tackle this the government could expand the use of guarantees for renewable energy projects and increase the awareness of local commercial banks of renewable energy technologies and while indonesia s geography an archipelago of 17 000 islands with an estimated 45 per cent of the population living in rural areas poses a challenge to design and operate electricity networks the government can provide pln with the budget to build distribution networks in remote locations for off grid projects off grid projects are standalone power systems that operate independently of the national electricity grid generating more electricity from renewables would not only enable indonesia to reach its energy targets and combat climate change but also enhance the country s fiscal stability as it would make gas and coal available for export improving indonesia s trade balance and strengthening the performance of the indonesian rupiah take a fresh look at policies adoption of renewables in indonesia has lagged strides made by other countries said jakarta based gazzini president joko widodo was re elected this year for a second five year term and gazzini said we believe that with a new government in place indonesia is now well positioned to drive a targeted initiative to take a fresh look at how it can accelerate the adoption of renewable energy for electricity generation especially through the lens of new policies indonesia should transition to renewable energy because it is the wise thing to do marcel silvius country representative for indonesia global green growth institute the indonesian government issued a report earlier this year that showed business as usual practices would lead to stagnation of its economic growth in the longer term noted marcel silvius of the global green growth institute an inter governmental organisation headquartered in seoul in the low carbon development initiative report the government said that less carbon intensive more efficient energy systems can deliver an average of 6 per cent gross domestic product growth per year until 2045 with gains in employment income growth and poverty reduction indonesia should transition to renewable energy because it is the wise thing to do said silvius the institute s indonesia representative renewable energy has also many benefits for public health and offers more inclusive development options

us qualifies uruguay as a safe country to invest but warns about union power 16th tuesday july 2019 10 51 utc full article us embassy in uruguay argues that small and medium sized industrial enterprises smes in the united states describe the uruguayan market as difficult to enter in some sectors of the economy a report issued by the united states department of state on the investment climate in uruguay on monday analyzed the legal political and economic aspects of the country on the one hand it stands the legal security the free movement of capital the preferential regimes and the investment grade on the other it warns about aspects such as labor relations the power of unions the advantage of public companies and the increase of problems in education and security there are 120 us companies with investments in the south american country currently operating in various sectors such as forestry tourism hotels administrative services and telecommunications us firms installed in the country have not identified corruption as an obstacle to investment in this line it was noted that uruguay has laws to prevent bribery and other corrupt practices in turn the document analyzed that there is a deficit and a public debt relatively high compared to its rating group although highlighting that standard poor s and moody s evaluated uruguay two steps above the threshold of the investment grade with a stable perspective however the report argues that small and medium sized industrial enterprises smes in the united states describe the uruguayan market as difficult to enter in some sectors of the economy which they attribute to commercial relations and inherited loyalties along with resistance by distributors and customers to trust new producers regarding uruguayan public companies it was pointed out that they tend to have the highest market share even in sectors open to competition which could produce cross subsidies that probably give these companies an advantage over their private competitors then referring to some social phenomena the report identified that violent crime is increasing in uruguay and that a crisis is being experienced in the public educational system regarding the local capital market the report considered that it is still underdeveloped and highly concentrated in sovereign debt which makes it difficult to finance business through the local stock market and restricts the flow of resources the latter is associated with the fact that uruguay generally receives only active investments aimed at establishing new companies or gaining control over existing ones and lacks the passive investments of the main investment funds the report said that uruguay does not participate in the manipulation of the currency to obtain a competitive advantage letting with the peso floating freely although the intervention of the central bank to reduce the volatility of the price of the dollar the inform added that any currency can be obtained at market rate and there is no black market to exchange money it also detailed some incentives for investments in new and abandoned industrial zones which promote employment decentralization exports and the development of research firms can access a deduction from income tax exemption from duties and vat reimbursement among other incentive measures in march the us department of state published a report on human rights in which it was reported that union leaders were fierce defenders of public policies and even foreign policy and they continued to be very active in the political and economic life of the country that report admitted that workers organizations functioned without governmental or political intervention the broad front governing party gave strong political support to the unions in general the report on human rights stressed on the other hand warned about harsh conditions in some prisons managed by the uruguayan state
before margaret thatcher became prime minister in 1979 britain s epithet was the sick man of europe the preceding drift into ever greater socialism was accompanied by monetary inflation which was driven in part by unionised labour in nationalised industries striking or threatening to do so for wages which were uneconomic the differences between cause and effect during periods of monetary inflation only serve to conceal the root of the problem and that is inflationary financing without any factual basis central bankers claim that some price inflation is a good thing they set an inflation target to aim at commonly agreed at 2 percent there is no control over the expansion of money and credit which is permitted to run riot so long as the inflation target is not too obviously violated but the fact remains that inflationary financing has become central to the state s finances since 2010 the uk s government debt has increased by 59 percent of 2010 s gdp this has been financed by the expansion of money and bank credit while statisticians often argue that so long as government borrowing is financed by private sector savings it is non inflationary but this argument ignores the fact that if savings are diverted from their use in the private sector the gap is filled one way or another by the expansion of bank credit and as we should know the expansion of bank credit is simply monetary inflation therefore the expansion of both bank credit and base money is a good measure of the degree of a government s inflationary financing and we can confidently conclude that the dilution of people s money is far greater than suggested by government price inflation statistics this lack of apparent price inflation can only be for two reasons either statistics fail to reflect the degree of loss of purchasing power of the currency or people have collectively increased their preferences for money over goods and services but given the increase in consumer debt and the inability of eight out of ten british workers to survive between pay days without credit it is hard to see that preferences for money relative to goods have actually increased monetary inflation is barely understood by the public which is why governments love printing money they don t let on that monetary inflation dilutes everyone s earnings and savings instead they promote a belief in easy money and cheap credit for businesses so they can employ more people and because as keynes put it not one man in a million will detect the theft monetary inflation is irresistible to spendthrift governments we can put inflationary financing in the same category of nonsense as believing a weaker exchange rate makes exporters more competitive and stimulates job creation but any economist with a modicum of observation will know that an economy with a strong currency such as germany and japan in the post war years achieves a strong economy more successfully than a state which has a policy of weakening the currency of course the empirical evidence that in the long run a sound currency is always better than a weak one takes some explaining to a neo keynesian audience confusingly japan has managed to expand the quantity of yen in circulation without appearing to undermine its purchasing power much of the explanation is found in the japanese propensity to save which put another way is the same as saying the population of japan uses the expansion of money and bank credit to increase their bank balances instead of spending it this contrasts with keynesian consumption theories that abhor saving preferring inflationary financing it has predictably resulted in persistent trade deficits and a weak currency in the uk a combination of fiscal and monetary policies aimed at discouraging savings dissuades ordinary people from accumulating wealth through thrift no wonder an estimated 78 percent of the uk s working population have no financial reserves and are unable to make ends meet between pay days we appear to have arrived at the end point in keynesian economics unless something is urgently done to reverse this trend the economic condition of low income britons will worsen furthermore in the slightest down turn more of them will become dependent on the state the state then scrambles for more revenue taking it from the productive middle classes by higher taxes and yet more monetary inflation wealth the life blood of any economy is destroyed at an increasing pace and with it the ability of society as a whole to maintain a reasonable standard of living the solution is to halt the destruction of wealth and savings and have faith in the ability of ordinary people to manage their own affairs without government intervention central to these free market policies is sound money there are other policies that must accompany it such as eliminating taxes on savings government must be downsized it must rescind the tide of regulation the banking system must be reformed so as to address destructive cycles of credit expansion and contraction but central to it all is sound money the greatest resistance to a sound money policy will come from neo keynesian economists whose beliefs are riddled with contradictions theirs are the policies that have ensnared the uk and other welfare states in debt traps from which there is no easy escape they are already discredited by the results of their dogmas the political task facing a johnson government will be not so much to convince economists of their errors but to promote the concept of sound money and associated policies over their heads to the general public card carrying socialists may not like it but properly presented the silent majority almost certainly will it may be too late in the cycle to avoid an overdue credit crisis likely to be made worse by american trade policies in which case a proper understanding of the destructive forces of monetary inflation compared with the economic benefits of sound money is urgently required it has been done before the uk emerged from the destruction and debt of the napoleonic wars to a gold standard under which the government reduced its debt burden and the economy boomed in an industrial revolution it defied modern keynesian explanation excerpted from an aide memoire for boris

paris rising anger at the increasing inequality blamed on globalization calls for a change of directions acting imf chief david lipton said tuesday but he said that does not mean there is an inherent flaw in capitalism lipton said in a speech celebrating the 75th anniversary of the creation of the international monetary fund and world bank while capitalism has been the engine behind so much of the success we have experienced lipton said it is an imperfect system in need of a course correction he noted that much of the anger is because of concerns about the fairness of the system part of the problem is the rise of excessive inequality he said although poverty rates have declined worldwide since 1980 the top tenth of the top one percent worldwide has garnered roughly the same economic benefits that have accrued to the bottom 50 percent governments should respond by increasing spending to address inequalities and close corporate tax loopholes and work to prevent corporations from shopping for countries with lower taxes he said the changes from trade globalization and technology are fueling rising anger political polarization and populism lipton warned and while allies at the end of world war ii gathered at the bretton woods conference to create the institutions that would use economic cooperation to prevent future conflicts we are at risk of what one could call a reverse bretton woods moment lipton noted that lagarde s transition to the ecb in november was another change to which the imf is readily able to adapt he said the imf must make changes to maintain a stable and robust international monetary system free trade flexible exchange rates and non disruptive capital movements are essential ingredients for a thriving global economy that is why the role of multilateral institutions and especially the imf will be more relevant than ever if we continue to adapt lipton said lipton who has spent much of his career at the imf and has served since 2011 as the fund s second ranking official praised the bretton woods founders for creating at the end of world war ii a quota based imf shareholding system based on economic influence but he added that the current formula where the united states has a 16 52 share of voting power followed by 6 15 for japan and 6 09 for china the world s second largest economy has not fully kept pace with economic reality we must reckon with the fact that our formulae have not fully kept pace we cannot expect to retain the global reach and resources that we need unless countries gaining in economic importance and ready to take on commensurate responsibility gain appropriately in their say at the fund the imf s bylaws call for the fund to be based in the largest member economy lagarde said two years ago it was possible for the imf to be based in beijing in a decade if growth trends for china and other big emerging markets continued and are reflected in the imf s voting structure lipton said some countries feel they lack the influence they deserve in other multilateral institutions that do not have such a proportional structure a veiled reference to the world trade organization 164 member countries each get an equal vote and rule changes are extremely difficult to make lipton also said the imf sees significant gains from development of new financial technologies to increase efficiency and transparency and benefit people who are currently excluded from the traditional banking system unlike us president donald trump s dismissive comments about facebook inc s libra digital currency plans lipton said such technologies could help re orient the financial services industry closer to better serve the real economy and foster job creation these new instruments may to do for payments what the internet has done for information make transactions secure instantaneous and nearly free but he also outlined risks posed by digital currencies including potential emergence of new monopolies how personal data is monetized impacts on weaker currencies and expansion of dollarization they also create opportunities for illicit activities threats to financial stability and corporation effectively taking on the role of central banks agencies

ll now pass the call over to david david david m solomon chairman and chief executive officer thanks heather and thanks everyone for joining us this morning i m very happy to be here with you advertisement advertisement let me begin on page one we reported second quarter 2019 revenues of 9 5 billion down slightly versus last year but nonetheless reflecting solid franchise performance amid a mixed operating environment net earnings were 2 4 billion resulting in earnings per share of 5 81 all in we posted a return on equity of 11 1 and a return on tangible equity of 11 7 our business performed well and remain solidly positioned for future growth in investment banking we ranked number one in global announced and completed m a and number one in global equity underwritings year to date our equity market making business delivered its second highest quarter in four years and our franchise continues to generate broad based market share gains across regions we produced the highest quarterly i l revenues in eight years aided by significant gains from our private equity investment investing activities reflecting our ability to source opportunities for the firm and our clients and record net interest income in debt i l which annualizes to 3 5 billion lastly our assets under supervision increased by over 60 billion so another record of 1 7 trillion turning to page two our second quarter results were generated in an operating backdrop that presented both opportunities and challenges this quarter perhaps more than others reflected changing market sentiment in each of the three component months against the shift in sentiment we continue to witness relatively solid underlying economic fundamentals this year we expect real gdp growth of approximately 2 5 in the us and 3 4 globally european growth remains a bit more subdued at about 1 5 as recently reported china is running in the low 6 range slower than it has been in many years but still supportive of global growth all in while slowing the global macro backdrop remains broadly constructive advertisement advertisement the strong fundamentals that prevailed across markets were nonetheless overshadowed for most of the second quarter by geopolitical uncertainty client activity in april l turned quiet amid low volatility particularly in fixed income markets conditions in may deteriorated as geopolitical events caused significant shift in risk appetite fears of expanding trade wars draw concerns that new tariffs in china and mexico would erode the prospect for continued growth in response equity volatility there increased global markets turned risk off the us yield curve inverted and client activity slowed across a variety of products as our corporate and investor clients stayed on the sideline the trade issues also catalyzed concern among global central banks prompting dovishness with the bank of japan and the ecb emphasizing potential further stimulus and the us markets now anticipating multiple fed rate cuts this year the articulated dovish sentiment spurred a relief rally and increased client optimism and activity albeit late in the quarter this set up june to be a stronger backdrop to close out the quarter the market sentiment of june has continued through today we ve seen a pause in the us china trade war accommodative views from central banks and a continued march upward in global equity markets credit financing markets remain open and strategic transactions are getting announced as we look ahead we remain cautious on the geopolitical front but optimistic given the resiliency of global markets importantly our clients long term needs for advice financing and access to markets endure across cycles advertisement advertisement switching gears i d like to provide some insights on two important strategic decisions we made in the second quarter and our alternatives and wealth management businesses first on alternatives which is our core strength for goldman sachs for the past 30 years we recently completed an internal reorganization of our investing activities across the firm more specifically we have realigned our special situations group real estate merchant banking and several other investing platforms under common merchant banking business we have a world class investing franchise with a strong track record unique sourcing and execution capabilities and long standing relationships with the largest institutional investors going forward excuse me going forward these teams will operate across four asset classes private equity growth equity private credit and real estate by bringing together our investment professionals we will accelerate our ability to raise significant third party capital we expect this change will enable us to generate more durable recurring fee based revenues over time this will be a transition and we are mindful in protecting the revenue potential of these businesses as we grow third party assets second we announced plans to acquire united capital a registered investment advisor with approximately 25 billion in assets under supervision 220 advisors and 90 offices around the country united capital represents a key step forward toward our long term strategic goal of providing comprehensive wealth management services to individuals across the wealth spectrum advertisement advertisement upon closing the transaction today united capital will become a powerful complement to our ayco business our leading financial executive counseling and investment advisory business it serves many of the largest corporations in the united states we are excited about the incremental scale that united capital brings allowing us to serve a broader set of wealth management clients on a combined basis ayco and united capital will serve clients with over 80 billion of assets under supervision representing a strong base from which to grow our mass affluent wealth franchise it remains ambitious it remains our ambition to continue to serve ultra high net worth individuals through our long standing pwm business individuals with 1 million to 5 million of investable assets to ayco and the broader mass affluent segment through a hybrid of digital and human engagement as an extension of markets over time before turning the call over to stephen i would like to spend a moment on the recent federal reserve stress test results released in late june which showed bank s ability to withstand over 400 billion of stress losses overall the industry fared well in this year s examination from where i sit the results of the stress test clearly demonstrate the overall safety and soundness of the us financial system we also appreciate the ongoing efforts to increase the transparency of the test and very much agree with the fed s overall assessment of the us banking system is sufficiently well capitalized to support the economy even after a severe shock advertisement advertisement turning specifically to our performance on the 2019 ccar examination as you no doubt are aware we disclosed the federal reserve did not object to our plan of up to 8 8 billion of capital return including a 47 increase in our quarterly common stock dividend this change reflects the board and management s view that dividend growth is a critical component to delivering strong shareholder returns and reflects our progress over recent years increasing more durable fee based revenues to support the higher dividend lastly i would like to briefly touch on our strategic communication plan over the coming quarters importantly we continue to work toward providing a strategic update this coming january and will share a specific date once confirm this update will include the financial targets for the firm to which we will hold ourselves accountable and a broader review of our business strategy with that i will turn it over to stephen to walk through the results in each of our businesses stephen m scherr executive vice president and chief financial officer advertisement advertisement thanks david let s run through the numbers let me begin on page three of the presentation as david mentioned the environment in the second quarter turned out to be mix against this backdrop we continue to serve our clients and focus on executing on our strategic priorities let s run through the numbers in detail moving on to page four investment banking produced net revenues of 1 9 billion up 3 versus the first quarter and down 9 versus a robust year ago quarter financial advisory revenues of 776 million were down 3 versus last year during the quarter we participated in announced transactions of approximately 465 billion and closed on 235 billion of deal volume contributing to our number one m a league table rankings year to date client dialogues remain healthy and we are seeing momentum across sectors including tmt healthcare and notably financials which had been rather dormant for a number of years advertisement advertisement moving to underwriting equity underwriting net revenues of 482 million improved significantly versus the first quarter which experienced the government shutdown and held roughly flat versus a strong quarter last year year to date we ranked number one globally in equity underwriting supported by 16 billion of deal volume across over 100 transactions this quarter we held leadership roles in bringing many notable companies to the public markets during the quarter including uber avantor pinterest and slack turning to debt underwriting net revenues were 605 million down 20 from a year ago the second quarter last year included a number of significant contributions from investment grade and leverage finance activity which did not repeat to the same extent this quarter our deal flows in this quarter were consistent with trends across the industry which reflected materially lower volumes in the loan market and lower activity in acquisition related financings particularly with financial sponsors nonetheless our franchise remains well positioned with our high yield league table rank rising to the number two spot year to date further reflecting our competitive strength our investment banking backlog decreased slightly versus the end of the first quarter as we monetized a portion of our pipeline through the completion of several large equity underwritings nonetheless our backlog increased sequentially in both advisory and debt underwriting and while markets can change quickly we are optimistic that our clients will remain active in executing strategic transactions in the coming quarters given healthy levels of client dialog and continued needs to access financing markets moving to institutional client services on page five net revenues were solid at 3 5 billion in the second quarter down 3 versus last year as our diversified business experienced low client activity in ficc offset by strength in equities ficc client execution net revenues were 1 5 billion in the second quarter down 13 year over year reflecting both the mixed operating environment and generally lower client activity despite notable strength in europe overall the opportunity set presented in the second quarter prove more challenging versus a year ago specifically we saw lower volumes in our macro businesses amid low volatility and shifting client sentiment relative to last year client activity in rates and currencies including emerging markets was more subdued as trade and tariff concerns more than economic data drove sentiment and constrained client engagement uncertainty during the quarter around the timing and magnitude of anticipated rate cuts by the fed was also a contributing factor as tariff threats lessened and the direction of rates became more apparent we saw improved client activity particularly late in the quarter in currencies both implied and realized volatility in major fx pairs stood at historic lows throughout the quarter resulting in very low activity levels among our clients commodities performance by contrast was a positive results increased year over year and solid contributions from our investor products oil gas and power businesses in our micro businesses we saw lower activity in credit but better results in mortgages in credit issuance activity and our inventory levels were down relative to a year ago as investors remain more cautious following the spread widening experienced at the end of 2018 and grew more discerning in credit exposure selection we saw lower structured finance client activity versus a year ago while flows in credit came alongside from a more muted origination backdrop particularly in investment grade debt and leverage loans as i had mentioned earlier separately mortgage revenues increased amid better performance the environment notwithstanding and as i have said previously we are investing heavily to automate our workflows serve our clients electronically monitor our cost base and deliver structured solutions in capital efficient formats turning to equities on page six net revenues for the second quarter were 2 billion up 14 sequentially and up 6 versus a year ago we believe our success reflects our continuing consolidation of global market share and a dedication to serving clients across a full suite of cash derivatives and prime services in both high touch and low touch channels equities client execution net revenues of 772 million increased 13 relative to the first quarter and were up 12 versus a year ago results were aided by stronger performance in both cash and derivatives versus the second quarter of 2018 net revenues from commissions and fees were 777 million up 9 sequentially aided by strength in emea we also continue to grow market share in low touch execution security services net revenues of 458 million rose 24 sequentially and 5 year over year sequential improvement was driven by seasonal trends and a rebound in average client balances as sentiments improved moving to investing lending on page seven collectively our activities in i l produced net revenues of 2 5 billion in the second quarter equity securities generated robust net revenues of 1 5 billion driven by company specific events like ipos and the performance of corporates in the portfolio contributing to revaluations second quarter results were up 20 versus a year ago primarily reflecting higher net gains from public equities as you can see on the slide approximately 25 of our net revenues were from real estate and 75 were from our corporate investments within the corporate portfolio nearly half of the performance came from investments that went public during the quarter these results included a gain of approximately 375 million from the ipo of tradeweb our investment in tradeweb which we ve owned since 2008 was accounted for under the equity method given our significant influence at the time of the investment as a consequence we did not recognize revaluation p l on tradeweb over the time of our investment in addition to tradeweb we would draw your attention to several other notable investments that ipo ed this quarter including avantor uber and headhunter which grew the notional size of our public holdings taken together these four investments represent approximately 55 of our 2 6 billion public investment portfolio turning to page eight net revenues from debt securities and loans were 989 million and included 872 million of net interest income and modest mark to market gains our total loan portfolio was 98 billion up 2 billion sequentially driven by corporate loan growth and we note 82 of our total loan portfolio is secured our credit provision was 214 million down 4 versus last quarter our firmwide net charge off ratio remains low at approximately 60 basis points on page nine turning to investment management we produced 1 6 billion of revenues in the second quarter driven by our diversified global asset management business and leading private wealth franchise net revenues included management and other fees of 1 4 billion which were up 5 versus the first quarter and up 4 versus last year reflecting continued growth in assets under supervision by contrast we generated significantly lower incentive fees relative to the outsized 316 million last year incentive fees in the second quarter of last year were driven by the timing of realizations and performance across a variety of our alternative investment funds we also saw lower transaction revenues from pwm client trading activity assets under supervision finished the quarter at a record 1 7 trillion up 61 billion versus the first quarter driven by 17 billion of long term net inflows 12 billion of liquidity inflows and 32 billion of market appreciation now let me turn to expenses on page 10 our total operating expenses of 6 1 billion were flat versus the second quarter of last year reflecting lower litigation and lower compensation and benefits expense offset by increased expense for technology and consolidated investments for the year to date total expenses were 12 billion down 6 year over year our year to date efficiency ratio was 65 6 up 100 basis points versus a year ago driven by lower revenues and ongoing investments partially offset by lower compensation expense on the topic of investment spend as we ve spoken in the past cumulatively we are making very substantial organic investments to build new businesses and digital platforms the depth of that investment cycle will be in 2019 and 2020 investment spending will continue into 2020 when we will also see a more meaningful impact of the reserve build supporting our initial growth in the apple card portfolio following our expected launch later this summer year to date the total pre tax cost from marcus apple card and our new transaction banking platform is approximately 275 million resulting in a drag of roughly 60 basis points on our roe our cumulative pre tax loss for these businesses from the inception of each through the second quarter was approximately 1 3 billion which has been embedded in the performance of the firm as these businesses scale over the coming years this drag should not only reverse but become an accretive contributor to the firm s roe next on taxes our reported tax rate was 23 for the quarter and 20 for the year to date including discrete tax benefits in the first quarter we continue to expect our full year 2019 tax rate to be consistent with our medium term estimate of approximately 22 to 23 on the compensation ratio our philosophy remains steadfast through our principles obtain for performance reduction in the year to date ratio to 36 is a reflection as always of our best estimate of the compensation accrual for the firm which for the full year 2018 was just below 34 also as we have noted in the past as we grow more scale and platform driven businesses it is our expectation that compensation will decline as a proportion of total operating expenses and the efficiency ratio will become a more relevant measure for the firm these platform businesses should carry higher marginal margins at scale and be less reliant on compensation as a cost contributor turning to capital on page 11 our common equity tier 1 ratio was 13 8 using the standardized approach and 13 5 under the advanced approach the ratios each increased by 10 basis points versus the first quarter driven by higher retained earnings our slr was 6 4 flat sequentially in the quarter we returned a total of 1 6 billion to shareholders including stock repurchases of 1 25 billion and 319 million in common stock dividends our basic share count ended the quarter at another record low of 372 million shares our book value per share was 214 up 10 versus a year ago as david mentioned we are pleased that the federal reserve did not object to our 2019 capital plan of up to 8 8 billion of total capital return including share repurchases of up to 7 billion 40 higher than last ccar cycle while we continue to assess capital return in the context of the market environment and opportunities for accretive investment in our business consistent with our long held strategy we are encouraged by the increased flexibility afforded by our strong capital position we enjoy the option of returning a significant portion of our earnings to shareholders over the coming year following our successful completion of the federal reserve s annual stress test let s spend a moment reviewing our philosophy on capital first our long term view on capital allocation remains unchanged we first look for opportunities to invest in our business at attractive returns to the extent we have excess after these investments we will endeavor to return it to shareholders second with respect to dividends versus buybacks we aspire to having a higher dividend long term as it s an important component of total shareholder return and it s further reflective of the firm s confidence in our ability to generate more recurring and predictable sources of revenue that said we continue to value the flexibility of share repurchases as they allow us to be more dynamic with capital allocation based on the environment and business opportunities third regarding the stress capital buffer based on our calculations and the proposed rule which may differ materially in its final form we estimate an scb of approximately 5 5 based on the 2019 stress test results this would imply a total cet1 requirement excluding management buffers in the neighborhood of 12 5 to 13 which compares favorably to our second quarter 2019 standardized ratio of 13 8 while we view the ccar authorization as a ceiling and not a floor on the amount of capital we will return we are pleased to note that the 8 8 billion capacity should position the firm well to manage capital at appropriate levels turning to page 12 for balance sheet and liquidity our balance sheet was 945 billion up 20 billion versus last quarter on the liability side deposits increased to 166 billion including consumer deposits of over 50 billion which we have more than doubled since last year during the quarter we saw further progress migrating businesses into our bank entities to take advantage of their more diversified and lower cost funding our global core liquid assets averaged 225 billion during the quarter which we continue to note may decline as we have opportunities to support client demand before taking questions a few brief closing thoughts while our second quarter performance was solid despite the mixed operating environment we believe as david said the overall economic growth backdrop should remain supportive of our business as we go forward we are executing diligently on three core objectives one serving our clients with excellence and growing our existing business two diversifying our business into adjacent and new businesses and three operating more efficiently in all that we do if we do these things well we are confident we can deliver strong long term returns for our shareholders with that thank you again for dialing in and we ll now open up the line for questions questions and answers operator operator instructions and your first question is from the line of glenn schorr with evercore please go ahead glenn schorr evercore isi analyst thanks very much maybe just start with the real quickly you mentioned providing a strategic update this coming january i m curious what form you re thinking about meaning investor day update slides on the call things like that david m solomon chairman and chief executive officer so thanks glenn and good morning i appreciate the question we are committed to giving the strategic updates and in particular providing targets in january as we re working toward this fall where we ll know the exact format and also the specific date we ll communicate it glenn schorr evercore isi analyst okay well as long as the numbers are good i m cool david m solomon chairman and chief executive officer in i l i m curious i know you re going through the process of consolidating the businesses and i m sure there are some challenges there but my question is on you ve always been good at this but i feel like managing conflicts between advisor balance sheet investment and third party funds will just be that much harder as you bring this altogether and grow third party i wonder if you could talk a little bit about that and how you will allocate investments across on balance sheet versus third party things like that sure and i appreciate the question it s obviously something we spend a lot of time thinking about it we have spent a lot of time thinking about it because when you look at these businesses which in the past i did organized over multiple parts of the firm we re now internally reorganizing and bringing them together but we ve been doing this for 30 years we are one of the largest alternative asset managers in the world we manage a very very significant amount of third party and client capital and i can t say that there are issues from time to time that come out of this business model but we re focused on striking the right balance and have proven over a long period of time that i think we can do this consistently i think one of the things that you get by streamlining the organization and facing our clients as an integrated operation is it actually should make this process the decision making process easier and more clear and so we recognize it s something that we will have to continue to do well over a long period of time we are i m talking to our clients and listening to our clients and they feel bringing the businesses together and organizing them potentially will help us do that operator your next question comes from the line of chris bolu with autonomous please go ahead christian bolu autonomous research analyst good morning david and stephen david m solomon chairman and chief executive officer good morning stephen m scherr executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning christian bolu autonomous research analyst just on the targets we look forward to getting your targets in january but how should we think about the timeframe for achieving targets are you setting targets you can meet over the next one years to two years or should be looking for more long term aspirational targets that could take more like five years to get to stephen m scherr executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks christian i would say that the targets that we will focus on will be both returns and equally efficiency and in the course of putting those out our timeframe will be over the medium to longer term we re in the midst as i said in the prepared remarks of making some meaningful investments in the business the depth of that is going to be over the course of this year and into 2020 and the returns on that will play out over the medium term and so the targets will be that along the way we ll continue to point out as we did on this call with greater clarity as to the precision of what it is we re spending and what we re spending for and the direction of travel and the type of returns we expect to get but in that we re investing in particular businesses like the apple card like marcus like transaction banking those will have return profiles equally we re investing in platforms that will bring greater efficiency to existing businesses those two should have return profiles to them perhaps even inside some of the projects we have but we will give you the medium term targets but take you along in terms of what plays out between now and then christian bolu autonomous research analyst great thank you very much and then on the alternatives business i was excited to see you what does it looks like when you bring it all together i don t know if you can help us just preview maybe the size when you put all those strands together kind of what the size and maybe the growth profile of that business looks like today and then as you look to maybe compete more against the alternative asset managers if we re tricking one here but how do you balance the sort of the delicate issue of doing what s right for goldman versus competing against like a key clientele david m solomon chairman and chief executive officer sure so first with respect to the business broadly we plan to operate across four broad asset classes that we operate in today currently and that includes private equity that includes growth equity private credit and also real estate and so over time we will provide more transparency to you on the assets that currently exist in all four of these channels which are significant and to our aspirations over time to increase the amount of third party capital that we manage in these different asset classes with respect to the balance and operating is as i said to the previous question we have been doing this for 30 years these businesses are very significant in size right now we have said publicly that when you look at the businesses that we operate here collectively they make us one of the top five alternative asset managers in the world today and so we will continue to navigate and execute that the same way we have over the last 30 years and a very very significant business and the fact that we re internally reorganizing it so that we can better serve our clients does not change the process that we ve executed on for a very very long period of time stephen m scherr executive vice president and chief financial officer the one other point i ll add to respond to your question is that as david rightly points out this will be a transition during that transition we do not anticipate a revenue shortfall by this movement meaning we ll maintain balance sheet with the flexibility of reallocating balance sheet into different of these sleeves as david pointed out and it s also worth noting that different sleeves whether it s credit real estate with respect to for example equity carry different capital density and the opportunity to realize higher returns on the balance sheet deployed will be there so we are very well aware of maintaining the revenue flow that s here and as david pointed out this will be a transition over time operator your next question comes from the line of michael carrier with bank of america please go ahead michael carrier bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning thanks for taking the questions first one just on capital so you received the approval for more buybacks plus the dividend capital ratios have improved a lot you are doing some on the m a front still investing in the business so i guess just looking for some color on if this is sustainable meaning being able to do everything given the repositioning of the balance sheet and probably importantly where you are on that front particularly within like the ficc business and the alternative business stephen m scherr executive vice president and chief financial officer sure so i think it s fair to say as a general matter this year s ccar clearly demonstrates the direction of travel that we want to go in terms of overall capital return and the scope of what we asked and what otherwise was approved reflects on our commitment to put capital back to shareholders it s important to note those and as i said in the commentary our posture has not changed meaning as stewards of capital we are looking at and for opportunities where we can invest in an accretive way to generate long term shareholder return we re going to continue to do that and you see that in the investments that we re making away from that and in excess of it we ll continue to return capital back to shareholders and i think what played out in the context of ccar is a reflection of what we are comfortable with in terms of what we re going to look to put out given where the market and circumstances are on the question you raised about ficc the focus for ficc not born of this quarter in particular but since we came on and started to look and reunderwrite the business it s been around capital efficiency and equally cost in the context of delivering in to our clients and so that continues to be a focus of ours in terms of the franchise when you look at ficc in particular i would say that the business is focused on clients in the context of expanding out the corporates transaction banking and the like it s focused on the development of platforms the investment in those platforms such as marquee on pricing engine and investment grade credit equally the e commodities business and equally having the talent to be good calibrators of risk intermediation which is at the core when we do this and we do this right and it is a core historical competency for the firm we re going to continue to look at ways of accomplishing that with greater capital and cost efficiency michael carrier bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay thanks and then just a follow up question just on the strategic review i think there is a lot of focus on sort of the revenue opportunities and where you guys are focused just given some of the investments and then the longer term the focus on the efficiency ratio just wanted to get an update or run through some of the initiatives that are in place and the progress you guys are making to lower the cost base over time and improve the efficiency ratio stephen m scherr executive vice president and chief financial officer sure so i would i ll answer that in kind of in two components one is that the new business is being built whether that s the consumer business credit card business as a part of it or transaction banking those businesses are intended to be built as scaled businesses meaning the compensation component attached to that is lower you have cost and investment made such that the marginal margin in those businesses are operating at full scale continues to grow and so you achieve greater efficiency on a higher revenue number that comes in that s the way i would describe the newer initiatives the second component is what we re doing in and around the introduction of platforms and technology to our standing incumbent businesses i just mentioned a few examples of what we re doing in ficc and in the securities business more broadly these two are lowering the throughput of trades it s lowering the ability where i should say the price point to engage with clients where they want to meet us which is it s less human capital it s more platform driven it carries higher efficiency to it and that s the direction of travel i d also say equally true about the incumbent businesses part of what we re doing in the federation to support the businesses including in places like compliance is the deployment of technology in order to render us more efficient such that we can support the businesses in a much more cost efficient way then where we ve been historically operator your next question is from the line of steven chubak with wolfe research please go ahead steven chubak wolfe research analyst hey good morning david m solomon chairman and chief executive officer good morning steven chubak wolfe research analyst so i appreciate the color on the stress capital buffer certainly the 5 5 reinforces the strength of your capital position given your current ratio is 70 basis points to 120 basis points above that you re likely to accrete additional capital over the next four quarters i m just wondering how you re thinking about sizing the appropriate management buffer and maybe just philosophically what are some of the factors that will impact that calculus stephen m scherr executive vice president and chief financial officer well i think part of the calculus is the direction of travel right of where these regulations are what the final scb ruling looks like equally there is inevitably variability that comes and fluctuation in ccar results and the way in which stresses imposed so we ll maintain a buffer that s sort of mindful of those variabilities in the overall calculus itself in terms of the general direction of capital sort of philosophically it is it really is what i had laid out earlier and that is i think you should take the results in the ccar in particular what we petitioned and what was left unobjective to by the fed as the direction we d like to go we ve got a lot on our plate in terms of investments that are being made but we are quite confident under the circumstances of being able to put a reasonable amount of capital back and i d also point out that the dividend increase for this third quarter now approved by our board is a 47 jump in the dividend which is also a reflection of the confidence in the increasing durability and profile of the revenues of the firm steven chubak wolfe research analyst no thanks for that stephen and just one more for me on efficiency you sized a 1 3 billion investment in some of the newer initiatives given you noted that investment spend will likely peak in 19 and maybe the early part of 2020 i was hoping you could speak to whether we should expect to see some efficiency progress as early as 2020 and what s a reasonable expectation in terms of the marginal margin i know the newer initiatives are tougher to assess but maybe on some of the legacy businesses given some of the changes you plan to implement on the platforms there stephen m scherr executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so obviously the efficiency ratio is in one part a function of revenue so we ll see where the fortunes of the firm take us on the expense base i think in the near term there is sort of quick to be realized certain cost efficiencies in our trading costs meaning what s happening on platforms that are introduced that underpin incumbent businesses that are not looking for if you will new flows to come on but we re transacting with clients in a different manner and form than what we ve done in the past just one really small example if you look at our investment grade business and you look at the bond pricing engine we can then play both sides of a risk trade in a way that would have taken thousands of man hours right in order to compute you would have had inefficiency in terms of its time value now we re able to provide a platform where the client can engage and look to conform and develop a portfolio on a much more efficient basis cost efficient basis than would have happened in the past so i think there are sooner efficiency or i should say efficiency to be realized sooner in the context of platforms underpinning incumbent businesses there ll be a longer timeframe as you note in the context of realizing efficiency in some of the newer initiatives that we re building operator your next question is from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst hi good morning david m solomon chairman and chief executive officer good morning betsy betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst a question on how you re thinking about consumer credit and i ask the question for two parts one is the upcoming apple card and then the marcus portfolio and on the apple card i know you can t go through details we put some estimates together and i know recently where again based on a lot of assumptions i end up with an expectation that you re running at about a that you would expect to run somewhere around a 1 roa now that s again a lot of assumptions but it s based on the information that s out there on lower rates for the credit quality versus peers what peers are charging and no fee and i that another of my question is how are you thinking about consumer lending is it a business that you think is inherently more risky than your current business which is running at about a 1 roa or do you do i have it wrong what am i missing and should this be a business that generates higher than a 1 roa that s basically the another question stephen m scherr executive vice president and chief financial officer sure thank you so let me start by saying there is no denying that the consumer business whether card or marcus is a risk business meaning no matter that it s delivered digitally or that the credit card will take a different digital sort of profile than traditional credit cards this is a risk business and that s where our focus is i would say the risk is not just on credit risk and financial risk but equally operational risk in the context of what we re building and so we re quite conscious on all of those elements what s important for us is that we look at this on a risk adjusted return basis not simply on a return on asset construct and that s what s critical and that s the way we re looking at it it would be betsy for me premature to sort of speculate what the pace of growth looks like on this i would simply say that risk calibration risk decisions in and around the card belong entirely to goldman sachs as the bank and we re set up to make those i d also say that if you look at the level and rate of growth in the marcus loan business while it continues to grow and perform well we have slowed the increase in growth in that in contemplation of taking on increasing consumer credit through the card business so we look at it both in its totality so each is marginally different in the way in which credit is dispersed but this is a risk business and we ll continue to look at it as we grow it out on a risk adjusted return basis betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst so on a really a follow up has to do with the expected at scale efficiency that you think you re going to be running these businesses at when they re at scale given the fact that you did a new build should i be thinking about the efficiency and of these businesses in line with fintechs which run at intermediate expense ratio that s 30 of other legacy competitors or should i look to bank competitors as a more reasonable expense ratio or somewhere in between stephen m scherr executive vice president and chief financial officer i would say that while we ve been in beta now for a couple of months and have grown the portfolio on that basis it s nowhere near at the scale of what our expectations would be as we grow it out and so it would be premature for me to kind of speculate as to the efficiency we ll start to reflect more on that once we launch and once we start to build this portfolio out so it s a little early what i can tell you is that what we have built jointly with apple both on the front end and on the back end is intended to be operationally resilient but equally is intended to be efficient both in terms of the delivery the app i should say the application all through the delivery and on the back end and so my expectation is that the efficiency will be reflected in that but again premature to sort of put numbers around it operator your next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst hi to continue on the investment spend as it relates to expansion of markets outside the us where do you stand with the additional countries and what else might you consider stephen m scherr executive vice president and chief financial officer so i think i think on that mike the press has been sort of ahead of our plans in the context of speculating sort of the next country in which marcus would expand obviously our first place outside the united states was in the uk where the deposit platform has really exceeded our expectations in terms of what has been capable of generating there will be opportunities for us to expand in that market there has been quite a bit of speculation about germany it s not surprising that the speculation goes there both in the context of a growing business that we have in continental europe and the depth of the deposit market in germany but it s too early to forecast as and if and when we would expand there though i understand the speculation on that so for the moment we ve got a lot on our plate in terms of the execution around the platform in the united states and in the uk and we ll continue to pursue that mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst all right and then one follow up unrelated question 1mdb did you take any additional reserves for that what s the status there is a new statement by the head of the sec on july 3rd saying that it might be a little bit easier to resolve these sorts of matters what s your take in all this stephen m scherr executive vice president and chief financial officer so just on the reserves we took incremental legal reserves this quarter of 66 million we don t give detail on what the elements of that reserve are i would say that we are adjusting our rpl to 2 5 billion from 2 billion where it was i should point out that in providing that number to you it s important to recognize that that number is our best estimate as of this date it will be published in the q events that may play out between now and the q could alter that rpl and again there are different accounting regimes and thresholds that apply one probable one possible relating to the rpl and so that s where i can offer you by the way of what s happened financially in terms of statements otherwise being made i think it would be inappropriate for me to sort of speculate on what others intend by statements they make i think as we ve said in the past we re in a cooperative engagement with the authorities we intend to stay that way and as and when there are further developments we ll be in a position to to talk about that a bit more operator your next question is from the line of kian abouhossein with j p morgan please go ahead kian abouhossein j p morgan analyst yes hi i have two questions the first one is related to your equity revenues which were clearly very strong also against some peers reporting so far and i just want to understand where that s coming from because clearly the drivers are more muted such as volatilities down on the equity derivative world transaction volumes are ok ish but nothing in terms of the numbers that you have shown in terms of year on year and quarter on quarter growth rates can you just give a bit more color of where the drivers are and do you see market share movements in this area and secondly just coming back to your ficc business we now heard from you over the last 12 months to 18 months and expansion in more liquid products and traditional client base and can you a bit more detail on the fx and rates expansion both on clients and products and when should we see actually some of that investments having an impact on your revenue base because i don t see you yet outperforming your peers in this area but clearly would be great to get an understanding if you are if you feel differently and why and what investments you re doing in order to close the gaps in those two segments david m solomon chairman and chief executive officer so i ll start with equities i ll make a broad comment on ficc and stephen will give you a little bit more detail we are very pleased with the performance of our equity franchise broadly the performance really was across the franchise it was throughout derivatives and cash i would say given the market dynamics broadly there is some sense of consolidating share and i think we ve been the benefit of that and as we ve been stating on this call and over the handful over the last quarters we continue to make investments in our low touch activity and our low touch capabilities and we are starting to see some benefits from those investments in our low touch capabilities with respect to ficc broadly i do want to highlight as was highlighted i think on page five of the presentation our business is 90 market intermediation a much higher component of market interremediation then the people that we compete or we benchmark against so if you have a 60 40 mix and market intermediation is softer which it clearly was given the environment we had this quarter your nim portion or you re non market intermediation portion has less volatility but we continue to make investments as you highlight in some of these products and in particularly in broadening out the client base i d ask stephen to provide just a little bit more detail on how we think some of that is going through stephen m scherr executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks david so just to pivot to ficc and to be direct to your question if you look at fx in rates part of the progress that we were making is on broadening out the client franchise to more corporates than to the institutional clients to which we typically if not exclusively has engaged and we re starting to see some early progress in that i would say in this quarter in particular within europe i d also say that as part of an effort to expand out and penetrate further the corporate base around fx and rates we re seeing some benefit come to us by way of the joint venture between banking and ficc where banking obviously owns an entry point into the corporates and the ability to carry through those products into the corporate franchise where we have a demonstrably strong set of relationships i think will bear dividend what s more i would say that if you look at a variety of different initiatives and builds including transaction banking or corporate cash management this one s built will carry the potential to bring forward a more captive fx business that didn t exist inside the firm i think that too could prove to be a benefit and just on that particular project goldman sachs is already a customer if you will of our own platform and we aim to bring customers and clients on in across 2020 and so we are seeing early signs of progress on this but there is no running from the observation you make which is we have yet to sort of perform at the potential we are confident this business can show we re very confident in unlocking that potential some of these new initiatives will no doubt take a little bit of time before they bear out but the direction we re moving is a positive one operator your next question comes from the line of brennan hawken with ubs please go ahead brennan hawken ubs analyst good morning guys thanks for taking the question nii as a portion of the i l s debt portfolio could you maybe help us think about rate sensitivity there depending on how you calculate nim if it s 360 or 365 day count and nim is down either a few or upper single digit bps quarter over quarter what are the benchmark rates gents predominantly in that portfolio we should watch how much of the strong nii growth that you guys have seen over the past few years has been balanced versus rate and then how should we think about how the softening rate environment might impact nii growth going forward thanks stephen m scherr executive vice president and chief financial officer sure thanks for the question i think the best way to answer that question is to just point out where we differ if you will from some other bigger commercial banks in the context of both we have a different liability mix and equally a different composition to our assets on the liability side there is a portion of our funding that s fixed a portion that s floating and so it s not as dynamically correlated if you will to the way in which rates otherwise move and i think our nii growth generally speaking will benefit from a liability mix that s starting to skew toward deposits and so that s the perspective i would offer on the liability side on the asset side much of the assets that we have are floating rate based and equally and importantly is a higher velocity turn to the assets that underlie this and that too has a more or leads to a more muted impact to which we otherwise might see in some of the bigger commercial banks as a function of the direction in which rates are moving brennan hawken ubs analyst okay and then the part on how much we ve seen as far as rate or nim improvement versus balances in the last few years is it possible to break that down or is that something that might fall off stephen m scherr executive vice president and chief financial officer i think i would encourage you to follow up sort of with for an answer that s more precise than what i can give you now i would say that some of this has to do with balances in terms of the size and scope recognizing that the lending that we re doing which is generating this net interest income is quite strategic in the context of the clients that are served by the lending itself and i d also point out as i did in the remarks that about 82 of this is secured financing and so i offer that to you but heather and the team can provide you with greater insight onto the particulars operator your next question is from the line of jim mitchell with buckingham research please go ahead jim mitchell buckingham research analyst hey good morning maybe just a quick follow up on the fixed income discussion just want to make sure i understand how do you get your i assume internal roe targets in that business is it do you see it entirely coming from efficiency improvements and expanding the footprint into more flow business or is there some component of capital that comes out whether it s derivatives or something else do you need to see the level of capital declined as well or can it come from those other ways stephen m scherr executive vice president and chief financial officer sure so the way we ve been looking at it as we ve been scrutinizing and reunderwriting that business is we re focused on both the numerator and the denominator of the roe calculation meaning it s important nobody lose focus that we need to mind how much revenue is coming in that is how do we want to define the tangible market that we face what s the revenue capture that we can take in what s the expense as an offset to that revenue to establish the numerator in the calculus and none of that is to ignore capital efficiency in the context of what the denominator contains so this is really as we ve talked about it a wholesale reunderwriting of the business but be assured both of these are in scope in the context of the way in which we re looking at the business both revenue net of expense and looking at capital and the revenue being driven largely by an ambition to have a more expansive addressable market to include corporates in addition to that which we otherwise have focused on historically jim mitchell buckingham research analyst and as you pull that capital out do you worry at all if there is any kind of revenue risk in that pivot to a lower capital or denominator or do you feel that s not really the case stephen m scherr executive vice president and chief financial officer no i mean listen there is never is kind of a linear calculus okay so the businesses for us in ficc are not themselves four wall meaning anything we do with respect to a business in ficc has knock on implications for businesses that fit outside the securities business take for example wherever it is we decide to do around credit for commodities it has knock on implications so the thread on the adjacency of all of our businesses gets pulled so we re mindful of that and need to take stock of what we do around capital the one other thing i would point out which i ve talked about publicly before is in addition to thinking about both the numerator and the denominator embedded in the numerator is equally an effort to sort of optimize our own funding meaning how do we bring our cost of funds down retail deposits has been an example of that but our treasury team is working hard both in terms of the amount of liquidity we run with how that liquidity is managed in addition to identifying more efficient lower cost funding sources in order to render these businesses more competitive operator your next question comes from the line of devin ryan with jmp securities please go ahead devin ryan jmp securities analyst hey great good morning david and stephen david m solomon chairman and chief executive officer hey good morning stephen m scherr executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning devin ryan jmp securities analyst first question just on united capital with the deal closing just look to maybe get a little more perspective on how you re thinking about the business opportunity i guess broadly and as it connects with ayco is there a bigger appetite to expand into the mass affluent segment whether it be adding financial buyers or more m a or does capital really give you just a big enough footprint to achieve what you are looking to do in the business especially with ayco david m solomon chairman and chief executive officer sure i appreciate the question we are excited actually today i believe we re closing the capital acquisition on this very day and obviously it brings with us 220 rias and 90 offices around the united states and what it s really doing is we think we have a very very interesting channel to continue to build the mass affluent segment through ayco but this particular transaction accelerates our ability to do that between ayco and united capital of 80 billion of assets under management that s a good base from which to grow from we think we can continue to make progress and what we ll call the 1 million to 5 million of investable assets mass affluent wealth management category through this channel and that we can have good growth with the extended platform we now have but if another opportunity came up that we thought could further accelerate it because it is still a very fragmented business and we have a very very big infrastructure so we can continue the fee in terms of all the wealth in terms of what the asset management and wealth management products we have in our asset management business we ll consider it this was not something this acquisition was not something that was targeted for a year that we were really running after it came up for sale we looked at it we thought it was a really good fit to accelerate our business and so we decided to act on it devin ryan jmp securities analyst got it very helpful thanks and then just a follow up just to think about the third party alternative capital fund raising any expectations on whether it be the trajectory or cadence of how we should be thinking about that just as we are just starting to think about modeling it david m solomon chairman and chief executive officer yeah i appreciate the question devin and i know that you re all anxious to model it over time we will provide a lot more transparency on how we see that plan rolling out as you would expect we have a lot of businesses across the firm we put them together and the first thing you do when you put those people together is you cast them to develop plans on a go forward basis so we are in the process of that and as those plans come forward we will be more communicative and transparent as to what expectation we think you can have with that business over time operator your next question is from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst thank you good morning david m solomon chairman and chief executive officer good morning stephen m scherr executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst in your comments on the debt underwriting you mentioned deal flows in the quarter were consistent with the trends across the industry which reflected material lower volumes in the loan market in m a activity area and you specifically cited it was with the financial sponsors can you share with us what are the financial sponsors seeing today what do you think will stop them from doing more deal activity in the quarter and any outlook for the second half of the year from those financial sponsors david m solomon chairman and chief executive officer well look in a high end there is no quite at a high level there is no question that that activity has been more muted i guess when you think about the cycle and you think about the continued run in equity markets and the accommodative monetary policy we have which is certainly inflated for assets it s been tougher more competitive you have to pay more in order to succeed i also think the financing environment and in particular the smid ph regulatory overlay it had some impact over this cycle in muting how far the private equity activity may have moved in this cycle had the regulatory environment been different that said the private equity investors still have an enormous arsenal of unspent capital big reserve and i think this business continues to have secular growth and so as the environment evolves i think there will be periods of time where we will see increased activity versus what we ve seen in the first half of the year i don t think we have a great explanation of this specifically has done it but if you think about what the first half of the year has brought in terms of the macro overlay it s not surprising probably that it s been a little bit more muted gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst very good and then as a follow up on slide 12 you gave us your balance sheet of course the allocation and you mentioned that in the quarter there was a 20 billion quarter to quarter increase reflecting client demand to use your balance sheet can you share with us as the total loans or total assets what percentage of it is clients using your balance sheet and then second when you look at the revenues those customers bring to you as a percentage of those assets where do those stand and how does that compare to about a year ago david m solomon chairman and chief executive officer so as always the fluctuation in the balance sheet is a reflection of our ability to respond to opportunities and the interest of our clients and so balance sheet fluctuation is all a function of client service hard to decompose the balance sheet to say what s client what not what is not client truth we know all of it right is in some manner or form related to client activity and across all of our businesses in the firm and so that s really the way i would view sort of balance sheet both in terms of growth size and its composition operator your next question comes from the line of brian kleinhanzl with kbw please go ahead brian kleinhanzl keefe bruyette woods analyst yeah thanks just one quick question on the markets i saw that the rate pay came down toward the end of the quarter can you just walk through what your how you came up with that decision to lower the rates or you just looking at the fed fund s future should we expect more rate cuts there kind of what s been depositor behavior stephen m scherr executive vice president and chief financial officer sure sure so we made a decision and it was the first since we began our retail deposit business we made an adjustment downward we did it in the context of rendering ourselves competitive in light of what others have done it s also worth noting at or around the time we reduced the rate we saw others in the competitive set reduced the rate as well we saw no material adverse reaction to our movement no sort of pronounced outflows nothing to really call attention to i think you should assume that we will be fluid and flexible and agile in rate movement up or down relative to where the competitive set is and we ll sort of comport ourselves that way both in our us platform and in the uk brian kleinhanzl keefe bruyette woods analyst okay thanks operator at this time there are no further questions please continue with any closing remarks david m solomon chairman and chief executive officer okay since there are no more questions i would like to take a moment to thank everyone for joining the call on behalf of our senior management team we hope to see many of you in the coming months if any additional questions arise in the meantime please don t hesitate to reach out to heather otherwise enjoy the rest of your day and we look forward to speaking with you in october operator ladies and gentlemen this does conclude

governments can overtrade just as businesses can both with disastrous consequences in the case of business they collapse and pass into history but for governments their deficits grow and with it their austerity programmes the quality of life for the majority plummet they pay the price for the government s stupidity in chasing gdp growth and following an inappropriate economic policy the mantra chanted by most politicians and governments today is that as long as gdp gross domestic product growth is good things are good because there s increased revenue to meet expenditure if there s no growth or a decline that s bad very bad this belief is entirely wrong and therefore a reckless policy to follow chasing gdp without due financial consideration is pure insanity if the underlying financials do not support growth then growth hurts the average citizen it doesn t benefit them so growth under all circumstances is crazy nonsense only managed growth is beneficial get the full ray dalio series in pdf get the entire 10 part series on ray dalio in pdf save it to your desktop read it on your tablet or email to your colleagues q2 hedge fund letters conference scoops etc there are strong similarities between a business overtrading and governments chasing gdp growth without due consideration for critical underlying financial considerations which if ignored leaves the majority of citizens considerably worse off just as it s bad for business to chase sales ignoring the same financial considerations so too is it financially reckless for governments to chase gdp growth so if it s insanity to chase gdp growth without due consideration of the underlying financials why do we do it because it s another lie fed us by vested interests to serve their needs not ours one of the most effective ways of influencing public opinion is to influence and shape politician s thoughts as they are influential in determining policy they like the general public are bombarded by vested interest to modify their perceptions to see things from their perspective and to influence policy accordingly it s not about the truth and reality but about perceptions created to support their one sided interests it s in the wealthy one per cent s interest to have the economy keep on growing as it supports their short term sales and profit so naturally they tell us that gdp growth is essential for our economy and our well being like all their other lies they promote them vigorously until they enter our conscious mind and we quote them as if they are some law of nature we need gdp growth however would vested interests invest in any business who is knowingly over trading of course not because it spells financial disaster and business failure they won t knowingly over trade but they encourage governments to chase gdp growth in the full knowledge that it will create financial misery if the underlying financials cannot support growth they do it out of self interest with no regard to the hardships the citizens of the country will face as a consequence we have to get politicians to see the light and stop singing vested interests tune which inflicts harm on their constituents businesses prove that by cutting back sales and improving their financial situation is a far more prudent strategy to follow the same applies to governments cutting back on gdp growth can benefit rather than harm as i will explain governments need to grow at a sustainable financial rate as do businesses otherwise they overtrade and fail when a business overtrades it invariably goes under because they didn t plan their financial growth correctly and as a result they run out of cash governments can get into a similar overtrading situation but rather than go under they increase their borrowings thereby increasing their costs which worsens their financial position increased borrowing over an extended period eventually forces the government into austerity programmes involving severe cost cutting unfortunately governments don t address the underlying causes so their austerity programmes have to become even more austere and last longer indefinitely until the fundamentals are addressed such austerity programmes hurt society and drastically lower the quality of life for most citizens the uk is a case in point it has been overtrading and continues to do so thereby perpetuating their austerity programme this is because the fundamentals of the problem have been ignored citizens quality of life has dropped over the decades and will continue to fall rapidly this is a major problem and a screw up which needs to be fixed as it directly affects the quality of life for the majority what s overtrading so what is over trading and how does a government overtrade as it cannot be classified as a trading entity first let s understand how business overtrades and then draw similarities with government business overtrades when it chases sales but does not have the cash resources or access to further borrowings or equity to fund the increased sales as a result the business s cash dries up and it is forced out of business increased sales come at a cost business has to find additional resources to fund growth take the example of an imaginary business shown below to demonstrate where cash is tied up in business raw material stock holding 15 days production cycle 5 days finished stock holding 25 days debtor days 50 days creditor days 35 days conversion cycle 60 days if the business wishes to increase sales it has to find cash to fund this 60 day cycle called the cash conversion cycle so on average this business only gets their cash back in 60 days they have to find cash to fund new sales for up to 2 months every business has a cash conversion cycle ccc which is a measure of its short term cash flow requirements there are many things a business can do to reduce its ccc which means it will require less cash to fund growth and can therefore grow faster the longer the cycle the more working capital the business requires the slower its growth funding working capital because every new sale has to be funded through increased working capital except for those businesses with a negative ccc certain businesses such as cash retailers who buy on credit and have a high stock turn may experience a negative ccc where increasing sales reduces their working capital requirements ideally growth should be funded out of profits the extent to which a business can fund its growth through profit is called it s sustainable growth rate if it exceeds this cash flow starts drying up cash dries up in proportion to the extent that sustainable growth is exceeded if a business exceeds this rate then it has to borrow or raise equity to fund the increase in working capital to prevent a cash flow crisis sales expansion often goes hand in hand with increased infrastructure expansion such as increased expenditure on r d production facilities machinery buildings storage distribution sales marketing and promotions these involve additional expenditure which adds to costs and reduces profitability thereby reducing its sustainable growth rate and the business s ability to fund working capital where a business s margins are low and they require infrastructure expansion to meet additional sales they are particularly vulnerable to market downturns in downturns margins come under competitive attack and are often reduced costs could also rise unexpectedly under such circumstances their margins may be inadequate to produce a profit to service their increased infrastructure costs they will obviously cutback costs where they can but some infrastructure costs may be medium or long term meaning they can t reduce costs enough if the downturn lasts they will face a cash flow crisis and will in all likelihood fail key issues in preventing over trading for a business to ensure it does not over trade it needs to optimise it s ccc i e reduce its working capital through greater efficiencies and improve margins and therefore profits although this is not easy not exceed their sustainable growth rate and ensure infrastructure expansion can be supported through a serious and sustained downturn preferably funded through retained income borrowings or increased equity however it s unlikely any business will be able to borrow or raise equity if they have ignored the three preceding financial considerations businesses who chase sales irrespective of these key issues will fall victim to overtrading and fail governments who chase gdp growth without due consideration for the same key issues will have to borrow to survive thereby worsening their financial position and will eventually introduce austerity programmes to cut costs most will not address the underlying financial causes so austerity deepens and continues until the fundamentals are addressed downgrading or cutting services the result of austerity programmes lowers the quality of life for the average citizen every year these austerity programmes continue there is a progressive decline in quality of life the responsibility of government is to build quality of life not destroy it by chasing gdp growth government equivalents governments don t use the same language to refer to the same things in business so let s look at the government equivalents for these key financial considerations which if not managed effectively will ultimately lead to cuts and extended austerity programmes ccc equates to departmental efficiencies businesses must use their working capital more efficiently i e optimise their ccc to improve profit and therefore their ability to fund growth governments are no different they to must manage their departmental resources more efficiently which leads to an improved surplus or helps reduce their deficit just as a business s profit dictates its growth so too does a governments surplus dictate government growth if a government grows off a deficit their borrowings increase so to their costs with a reduction in their sustainable growth rate continued expansion off a deficit compounds the problem therefore it starts by ensuring government uses their resources efficiently otherwise they will deplete their surplus should they have one and increase their borrowings profit margin equates to tax margins if business makes too little profit from a sale because of small margins its sustainable growth rate will be low it can only grow slowly furthermore if growth requires infrastructure expansion involving medium to long term debt the business is at high risk of failing governments are in the same position if they have a low tax margin i e where their revenue barely covers their cost they can only expand slowly if they expand beyond the rate of their surplus their borrowings will increase and so to their costs at this point their costs may exceed revenue putting them into a deficit future growth can now only be funded through borrowings as there is no surplus the situation gets progressively worse year on year because of their reliance on borrowing to fund growth their debt keeps mounting continuous expansion requires increased infrastructure support this places the finances under even more pressure increasing government debt even more to stop the hole getting even bigger governments go on drastic cost cutting programmes this negatively impacts on the average citizens quality of life business under these circumstances would immediately cut back sales growth cut costs where they can and not undertake any infrastructure programmes as well as limited maintenance of infrastructure they would then consider ways of improving their margins governments on the other hand trundle along making very few critical adjustments apart from cutting costs the critical thing to do is to increase taxes margin address poor tax margins the increasing divide between rich and poor is an indication of government s inadequate tax policy particularly concerning corporate and personal tax of the rich during the reagan presidency in america 1981 1989 he was responsible for supporting and introducing neoliberal economic policies such as privatisation deregulation free trade and reducing the size of government reagan lowered taxes on the wealthy from 70 to only 28 and broke the air traffic union strikes which saw the weakening of collective bargaining he had a major influence on margaret thatcher uk prime minister from 1979 to 1990 who followed his neoliberal economic policies she reduced the tax rate from 83 on the wealthy to 60 which has subsequently been lowered to 45 she also broke the strength of the trade unions this is the era when the rot set in these legacies live on in today s politicians as they follow neoliberal economic policies based on the misinformation fed them of how it serves our needs when the proof that it does not is evident all around us the point i want to make here is that we do not tax the wealthy adequately top tax rate should return to the pre reagan era and be set at over 70 as suggested by leading economist emmanuel saez thomas piketty and stefanie stantchev this and increasing corporation tax will go a long way in lifting tax margins however corporate welfare and the welfare of the rich is deeply embedded in our tax codes because of this and a low top tax rate we have a regressive tax system where the rich pay less tax pro rata than the average person we have the wealth and resources to eliminate poverty and improve everybody s quality of life but can do little about it until we change our economic policy copyright 2019 adrian mark dore

listen to this article listen to this article under sharp criticism from senators a facebook executive on tuesday defended the social network s ambitious plan to create a digital currency and pledged to work with regulators to achieve a system that protects the privacy of users data we know we need to take the time to get this right david marcus the facebook executive leading the project told the senate banking committee at a hearing but that message did little to assure senators members of both parties demanded to know why a company with massive market power and a track record of scandals should be trusted with such a far reaching project given the potential for fraud abuse and criminal activity facebook is dangerous asserted sen sherrod brown of ohio the committee s senior democrat like a toddler playing with matches facebook has burned down the house over and over he told marcus do you really think people should trust you with their bank accounts and their money republican sen martha mcsally of arizona said the core issue here is trust users won t be able to opt out of providing their personal data when joining the new digital wallet for libra mcsally said arizonans will be more likely to be scammed using the currency she said the litany of criticism came as congress began two days of hearings on the currency planned by facebook to be called libra also tuesday a house judiciary subcommittee was extending its bipartisan investigation of the market power of facebook google amazon and apple on the defensive from bursts of aggressive questioning marcus indicated the currency plan is a work in progress we will take the time to ensure the network won t be open to use by criminals and illicit activity like money laundering and financial fraud we hope that we ll avoid conflicts of interest we have a lot of work to do marcus said the grilling followed a series of negative comments and warnings about the libra plan in recent days from president donald trump his treasury secretary and the head of the federal reserve but some senators emphasized the potential positive benefits of facebook s plan meant to bring money transacting at low cost to millions around the globe who don t have bank accounts facebook had its strong defenders of the project too on the panel to strangle this baby in the crib is wildly premature said sen pat toomey r pa in that vein marcus said libra is about developing a safe secure and low cost way for people to move money efficiently around the world we believe that libra can make real progress toward building a more inclusive financial infrastructure the planned digital currency is to be a blend of multiple currencies so that its value will fluctuate in any given local currency because libra will be backed by a reserve and because the group of companies managing it will encourage a competitive system of exchanges the project leaders say anyone with libra has a high degree of assurance they can sell it for local sovereign currency based on an exchange rate promising low fees the new currency system could open online commerce to millions of people around the world who lack access to bank accounts and make it cheaper to send money across borders but it also raises concerns over the privacy of users data and the potential for criminals to use it for money laundering and fraud to address privacy concerns facebook created a nonprofit oversight association with dozens of partners including paypal uber spotify visa and mastercard to govern libra as one among many in the association facebook says it won t have any special rights or privileges it also created a digital wallet subsidiary calibra to work on the technology separately from its main social media business while facebook owns and controls calibra it won t see financial data from it the company says senators demanded to know exactly what that separation will entail facebook isn t a company it s a country said sen john kennedy r la kennedy and other conservative senators took the occasion to air long standing grievances against facebook twitter and google for a perceived bias against conservative views facebook s currency proposal has also faced heavy skepticism from the trump administration trump tweeted last week that the new currency libra will have little standing or dependability both treasury secretary steven mnuchin and fed chair jerome powell have expressed serious concerns recently that libra could be used for illicit activity the treasury department has very serious concerns that libra could be misused by money launderers and terrorist financers mnuchin told reporters at the white house on monday this is indeed a national security issue facebook has a lot of work to do before we get to the point where we re comfortable with it mnuchin said
at the end of this month the federal reserve will decide once again what to do about interest rates virtually everyone thinks it will cut but while the expectation is nearly unanimous it certainly isn t uncontroversial speaking for many mainstream analysts mohamed a el erian a former economic adviser to president obama pointed out that an interest rate cut will come with real trade offs it will leave the central bank less prepared for the next recession or possibly exacerbate the next financial bubble that does not mean the fed shouldn t cut it does mean the fed is stuck in a policy prison where it has very little room to maneuver and where none of its options are great there are two reasons for this the first is congress failure to act on fiscal policy the legislative branch has become so hopelessly deadlocked by republican indifference and obstruction that action in any situation short of a total emergency is a pipe dream but beneath that failure is the whole way u s policymakers conceive of the divide between the fiscal and monetary tool kits at their disposal subscribe to the week escape your echo chamber get the facts behind the news plus analysis from multiple perspectives

briefing to a weekly good news newsletter get the best of the week delivered directly to your inbox sign up as a refresher fiscal policy is what congress does taxes and spending and public investment and all that it can also be what state legislatures do with those same tools monetary policy is what the federal reserve does buying and selling financial assets to adjust various interest rates and keep the overall financial system from seizing up according to the conventional washington wisdom of recent decades fiscal policy s job is to provide various public needs yes but also to keep its own books balanced monetary policy s job is to balance the economy to make sure job and wage growth is running as hot as possible without tipping into overheating and an unsustainable rise in the inflation rate unfortunately for the fed we ve reached the tail end of a multi decade experiment in this division and assignment of roles only to discover it doesn t work for a start the fed s powers are asymmetric it can hike interest rates squashing job and wage growth as much as it wants but it can t cut interest rates and thus boost job and wage growth below zero this leads to el erian s first concern the fed has historically needed to cut interest rates by 4 or 5 percentage points to combat recessions but it s currently setting them at 2 25 to 2 5 percent that s already too low and if the fed starts cutting now it will have even less room to maneuver when the next downturn comes beyond that the economy is a feedback loop between consumption and investment and the fed is only able to affect one side of that feedback loop think of interest rates as a wall between people who want credit and people who supply credit the fed lowers or raises that well depending on how hot it wants the economy to run what the fed can t do is create more demand for credit than is already there if the hunger out in the economy for more credit and investment is already low then it won t really matter how much the fed lowers its wall and if the wall is already torn down there s nowhere left to go in the case of a recession that s basically the trap the federal reserve is in the tool that can create more demand for credit is fiscal policy by pumping more money into people s pockets either through welfare state spending or direct government hiring the government injects more aggregate demand into the economy that gives everyday people more ability to buy goods and services which justifies business expansions and the credit creation needed to fuel that investment unfortunately congress has completely dropped the ball on this front its fiscal stimulus in the immediate aftermath of the great recession was far too small and its done next to nothing since the 2017 tax cut barely made a dent because nearly all its benefits went to the wealthiest who do not need and thus will not spend the additional dollars in fact fiscal policy has arguably under powered the economy ever since the end of the 1970s with every recession since the fed has cut interest rates lower without ever being able to return them to their previous high with the great recession the central bank s interest rate target finally bottomed out at zero fiscal policy can also work the other way when inflation spiked at the beginning of the 1980s congress could have raised taxes or tried other regulatory efforts to slow down prices while putting most of the burden on the wealthy instead we went the monetary policy route and the fed chairman at the time paul volcker massively hiked interest rates destroying millions of jobs and incomes in the process and setting the country on a path toward runaway inequality once the downward spiral set in only fiscal stimulus could reverse it this ties into another one of el erian s concerns today that economic fundamentals like business investment and wage growth remain mediocre despite the recovery while stock and financial markets continue to boom with all their attendant risks of bubbles and busts frankly policymakers shouldn t rely on interest rates to contain financial bubbles in the first place that s a job much better suited to regulatory oversight but if you want higher interest rates either to ward off irrational exuberance in the financial markets or prepare for the next recession you need economic fundamentals that are strong enough to support high interest rates and that means more aggressive fiscal stimulus now the fed might be able to escape this trap if it was willing to get really creative at a recent hearing rep rashida tlaib d mich asked fed chairman jerome powell why the central bank couldn t have backstopped short term borrowing by state governments the same way it backstopped short term borrowing by corporations in the aftermath of 2008 that would ve allowed states to keep borrowing and spending and thus boost the recovery rather than cutting their budgets and thus worsening the downturn powell claimed the fed doesn t have the legal authority which is wrong a more honest answer is that backstopping borrowing by government actors as opposed to private ones comes too close to breaching the fiscal monetary policy divide for comfort for now the central bank remains too institutionally cautious to go there thus the fed is stuck yes an interest rate cut might signal undo subservience to both president trump and wall street investors but ultimately the fed answers to neither its obligation is to its legal charter which obligates it to prioritize job growth as much as price stability all it can do is cut rates now and pray the economy recovers enough to justify higher rates before the next recession the rest is up to congress
