expenditures for full year 2019 were 1 105 2 million compared with 1 043 4 million for 2018 primarily due to increased spending on projects at bald mountain fort knox and round mountain partially offset by lower spending at tasiast capital expenditures were within the company s guidance balance sheet as of december 31 2019 kinross had cash and cash equivalents of 575 1 million compared with 349 0 million at december 31 2018 the increase was primarily due to net operating cash flow inflows partially offset by capital expenditures at the company s development projects the company has available credit of 1 453 1 million as of year end 2019 for total liquidity of 2 028 2 million operating results mine by mine summaries for 2019 fourth quarter and full year operating results may be found on pages 11 and 15 of this news release highlights include the following americas paracatu had an outstanding year in 2019 achieving record annual production of 619 563 au eq oz while lowering costs the strong performance was mainly due to an asset optimization program started in 2018 which resulted in improved mill efficiencies and an enhanced understanding of the orebody full year production increased approximately 98 000 au eq oz or 19 compared with 2018 as both throughput and recoveries improved full year cost of sales per ounce sold decreased by approximately 19 compared with 2018 mainly due to operational efficiencies lower power costs and favourable foreign exchange movements during q4 2019 cost of sales per ounce sold increased versus q3 2019 mainly due to higher maintenance costs as the crusher was repaired during the quarter quarterly production was slightly lower compared with q3 2019 mainly due to lower throughput round mountain performed well for full year 2019 while there was a slight year over year reduction in annual production q4 2019 production increased 26 compared with q3 2019 mainly due to strong performance from the heap leach pads as a result of the phase w project full year cost of sales per ounce sold was lower versus 2018 primarily due to lower operating waste cost of sales per ounce sold in q4 2019 was largely in line quarter over quarter at bald mountain full year production was lower compared with 2018 mainly due to a slower than anticipated ramp up at the vantage complex project and unfavourable weather conditions at the site early in the year as expected production was significantly higher in q4 2019 increasing by 95 compared with q3 2019 as more ounces were recovered from the vantage complex cost of sales per ounce sold for 2019 was higher compared with 2018 mostly due to lower production cost of sales per ounce sold decreased during q4 2019 compared with q3 2019 primarily due an increase in production at fort knox production for 2019 was lower compared with 2018 mainly due to a decrease in mill throughput while 2019 cost of sales per ounce sold increased compared with the previous year mainly due to lower production and higher maintenance costs production and cost of sales per ounce sold for q4 2019 were largely in line with the previous quarter maricunga delivered higher than expected annual production from the rinsing of materials placed on the heap leach pads prior to the suspension of mining activities full year cost of sales per ounce sold were largely in line with 2018 the mine has now transitioned into care and maintenance with final production occurring in q4 2019 for tax planning purposes the sale of residual gold ounces are expected to continue during 2020 russia the russia region continued its strong and consistent performance in 2019 combined full year production at kupol and dvoinoye was 8 higher compared with 2018 primarily due to higher grade ore processed from kupol s northeast extension and moroshka deposits production quarter over quarter was lower primarily due to planned lower mill grades at kupol full year cost of sales per ounce sold was higher compared with 2018 primarily due to an increase in operating waste mined and was largely in line quarter over quarter west africa tasiast outperformed in 2019 achieving record production and a record low cost of sales per ounce sold as the mine continued to benefit from the phase one expansion and the mill s strong performance during 2019 production increased by approximately 140 000 au eq oz or 56 while cost of sales decreased by 374 per ounce sold or 38 compared with 2018 tasiast finished the year strongly achieving a record quarterly production of 102 973 au eq oz at a cost of sales of 494 per ounce sold the lowest in its history the mine also achieved a record average throughput of 15 000 tonnes per day during the quarter higher grades operational efficiencies and lower operating waste during q4 2019 also contributed to a decrease in costs compared with the same period in 2018 at chirano full year production decreased slightly compared with 2018 mainly due to lower grades production for q4 2019 was higher compared with the previous quarter primarily as a result of improved mill throughput cost of sales per ounce sold was higher for full year 2019 mainly due to an increase in operating waste mined associated with the return to open pit mining and was largely in line quarter over quarter 2020 outlook the following section of the news release represents forward looking information and users are cautioned that actual results may vary we refer to the risks and assumptions contained in the cautionary statement on forward looking information on page 21 of this news release in 2020 kinross expects to produce 2 4 million au eq oz 5 from its operations in 2021 annual production is expected to be at or above 2019 levels and is expected to remain at the 2 5 million au eq oz level for 2022 the slight forecast decrease compared to full year 2019 production is primarily due to maricunga transitioning to care and maintenance and expected lower production at paracatu following its record year partially offset by an expected production increase at tasiast and fort knox production is expected to be relatively flat quarter over quarter throughout 2020 with a slight increase in the fourth quarter tasiast is expected to have higher production in the first half of the year mainly as a result of higher grade ore paracatu and round mountain are expected to have higher production in the second half of the year mainly due to anticipated higher grades at paracatu and more ounces recovered at round mountain as the benefits of phase w continue to be realized production cost of sales is expected to be 720 per au eq oz 5 for 2020 the company expects all in sustaining cost to be 970 5 per ounce sold on both a gold equivalent and by product basis for 2020 which is lower than full year 2019 all in sustaining cost per ounce mainly due to the expected lower cost of sales per ounce sold and capital expenditures for 2020 all in sustaining cost per ounce is

of non gaap financial measures the company has included certain non gaap financial measures in this document these measures are not defined under ifrs and should not be considered in isolation the company believes that these measures together with measures determined in accordance with ifrs provide investors with an improved ability to evaluate the underlying performance of the company the inclusion of these measures is meant to provide additional information and should not be used as a substitute for performance measures prepared in accordance with ifrs these measures are not necessarily standard and therefore may not be comparable to other issuers adjusted net earnings attributable to common shareholders and adjusted net earnings per share are non gaap measures which determine the performance of the company excluding certain impacts which the company believes are not reflective of the company s underlying performance for the reporting period such as the impact of foreign exchange gains and losses reassessment of prior year taxes and or taxes otherwise not related to the current period impairment charges reversals gains and losses and other one time costs related to acquisitions dispositions and other transactions and non hedge derivative gains and losses although some of the items are recurring the company believes that they are not reflective of the underlying operating performance of its current business and are not necessarily indicative of future operating results management believes that these measures which are used internally to assess

the company makes reference to a non gaap measure for adjusted operating cash flow adjusted operating cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations excluding certain impacts which the company believes are not reflective of the company s regular operating cash flow and excluding changes in working capital working capital can be volatile due to numerous factors including the timing of tax payments and in the case of kupol a build up of inventory due to transportation logistics the company uses adjusted operating cash flow internally as a measure of the underlying operating cash flow

all in sustaining costs and all in costs to address how the costs associated with leases after a company s adoption of ifrs 16 should be treated the wgc is a market development organization for the gold industry and is an association whose membership comprises leading gold mining companies including kinross although the wgc is not a mining industry regulatory organization it worked closely with its member companies to develop these non gaap measures adoption of the all in sustaining cost and all in cost metrics is voluntary and not necessarily standard and therefore these measures presented by the company may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers the company believes that the all in sustaining cost and all in cost measures complement existing measures reported by kinross all in sustaining cost includes both operating and capital costs required to sustain gold production on an ongoing basis the value of silver sold is deducted from the total production cost of sales as it is considered residual production sustaining operating costs represent expenditures incurred at current operations that are considered necessary to maintain current production

activities are classified as non sustaining 6 reclamation and remediation sustaining is calculated as current period accretion related to reclamation and remediation obligations plus current period amortization of the corresponding reclamation and remediation assets and is intended to reflect the periodic cost of reclamation and remediation for currently operating mines reclamation and

what s new pressure on syrian refugees in lebanon to return home is rising although syria remains unsafe for most refugees are trickling back escaping increasingly harsh conditions in lebanon and hoping that the situation will improve back home procedures that clarify refugees legal status are making return more plausible for some why does it matter while even a small number of successful repatriations represents positive news conditions are too dangerous for mass organised returns yet the syrian government and some lebanese political factions increasingly insist that it is time for large scale returns to begin what should be done donors should plan for many refugees to stay for many years and provide support to help lebanon meet syrians needs ease the burden on lebanon s economy and reduce friction between refugees and their lebanese hosts the lebanese government can take additional administrative steps to ease voluntary returns executive summary the debate over syrian refugees return is tied up with controversies about the political landscape in their home country the staunchest sceptics of near term mass return including western governments argue that such returns can be responsibly pursued only when there is substantive political change in damascus defenders of bashar al assad s regime however argue that the constant trickle of voluntary returnees proves that syria is already safe and that western reluctance to support refugee returns is motivated by political not humanitarian considerations in reality the vast majority of refugees have credible fears that prevent them from returning despite increasing pressures in lebanon even those who do go home engage in laborious deliberation over the security risks and poor living conditions that will await them looking ahead lebanon should support those for whom return seems the best option by facilitating visits that enable refugees to assess and prepare for the possibility of return while donors should be prepared to help blunt the impact of refugee hosting on lebanon with aid packages for years to come from the start of the syrian war lebanon has been a generous host to syrian refugees whose numbers are now estimated at 1 5 million more than a quarter of the overall population yet over time attitudes have grown less welcoming as the syrian regime with substantial support from iran and russia clawed its way back to controlling more and more territory its political allies in lebanon as well as christian parties hostile to refugees have joined their calls for accelerated return populist rhetoric has increased public resentment against refugees particularly as lebanon has suffered a severe economic recession and fiscal crisis for the past two years in october 2019 the country s economic woes gave rise to mass protests that were ongoing at the time of writing against this backdrop tensions with host communities have been building and with them the potential for violence government policies are likewise increasing pressure on an already vulnerable community recent campaigns against syrian labourers in particular could push an ever growing number into utter destitution the combination of hostility from parts of the public and restrictive government policies may soon create conditions for an increasing number of refugees in which survival in lebanon becomes unsustainable or so difficult that return to syria looks like the most viable option some humanitarian advocates have termed this phenomenon constructive refoulement or involuntary repatriation by indirect means the decision to cross the border is irreversible for most and consequences can be grave so far increasing pressures and various facilitation efforts have persuaded only a small number to return to syria refugees are aware that the decision to cross the border is irreversible for most and that consequences can be grave they carefully weigh their difficult often desperate situation in lebanon against the hazards that may await them on the other side threats of detention and conscription weigh most heavily after seven years of war the assad regime and its security agencies still rule violently and are even more arbitrary in their brutality than before the war while actual fighting has mostly abated conscription into the military and reserves still comes with the risk of ending up as cannon fodder in the next military operation many refugees also have reason to fear that returning to syria will make them even poorer significant parts of the country remain out of the government s reach others are inhospitable for returnees if only because they will find their homes destroyed or expropriated and the economy in tatters upon their return many will end up trading their refugee status in lebanon for that of an internally displaced person in syria the regime and its allies say a change in the west s approach to syria s reconstruction would create the conditions for large scale refugee return and turn the trickle of returning refugees into a steady stream but this claim obscures the real obstacles all roads to return lead through and depend on damascus the main determinants of how many refugees dare to travel those roads are how many refugees the regime resolves to give a guarantee for safe return how it treats those who make the gamble to return home to what extent it allows humanitarian organisations to assist returnees in accordance with internationally applied standards in aid delivery and whether it moves toward social and political reconciliation rather than forcibly reimposing control as long as the assad regime shows no sign of changing its ways the vast majority of refugees are likely to stay put in exile making do under ever harsher conditions or to find ways to reach more prosperous third countries lebanese authorities and international donors should develop approaches that acknowledge this reality building on jordan s model the lebanese government should legalise and regulate the existing employment of refugees and open legal avenues for self employment and small business formation to reduce or prevent hostility between refugees and host communities that may be exploited politically donors should support a combination of highly visible projects that benefit communities with large refugee concentrations and a results based program of macro economic support that includes debt refinancing investment and trade preferences that are linked to verifiable indicators of refugee employment beirut may also be able to smooth the path for refugees who wish to return in particular by facilitating go and see visits to assess the viability of such a step but such visits are unlikely to change dramatically the size of the refugee population in lebanon over the next several years that population in all probability will remain quite large until damascus makes significant changes until then beirut and its partners should not let hopes for that brighter day obscure the challenge that lies immediately ahead in helping syrian refugees to live in peace and security in the harsh haven that lebanon has become beirut brussels 13 february 2020 i introduction with an estimated syrian refugee population of 1 5 million on top of its 4 million resident nationals lebanon claims the highest refugee per capita ratio in the world the steady influx which started in 2011 began generating strong apprehension among many lebanese even before its full magnitude became clear tensions are on the rise particularly since 2017 today all political parties in lebanon agree that the refugees should eventually leave though they disagree on the conditions that would need to prevail for them to return home behind the disagreements stand deep seated differences concerning the war in syria and the nature of lebanon s desired relations with bashar al assad s regime in damascus the shiite parties hizbollah and amal say refugee return is safe and critical for rehabilitating a vital ally the sunni future movement of former prime minister saad hariri and other parties opposed to the assad regime such as the progressive socialist party psp of druze leader walid jumblatt and the christian lebanese forces of samir geagea believe that significant political change in syria is a key condition for refugee return the christian free patriotic movement fpm of president michel aoun believes that linking refugee return to change in syria means that most refugees could stay forever a prospect they vehemently reject while the christian kataib abhor the syrian regime as much as do the lebanese forces but reject the refugees just as much unhcr that conditions are not ripe for safe and dignified return as the regime retook territory in 2017 and 2018 calls in lebanon for refugee return grew more frequent and intense against this backdrop russia launched a diplomatic offensive to promote refugee return in july 2018 it initially received support from lebanese leaders who believed across party lines that the initiative was based on an understanding that the u s and russian presidents had ostensibly achieved during their 16 july 2018 helsinki summit in late july a russian delegation headed by president vladimir putin s syria envoy alexander lavrentiev met with lebanese leaders in beirut whereupon the latter announced the formation of a lebanese russian committee to carry out the initiative but no international political or financial backing for the russian plan materialised as a result the apparent lebanese consensus quickly eroded and the russian initiative fizzled international organisations such as the un high commissioner for refugees unhcr maintain to this day that sufficient guarantees are not yet in place for the organisation or facilitation of large scale voluntary safe and dignified return thousands of refugees have nevertheless braved the risks and returned to syria individually over the past year and a half relying on informal networks back home that help them assess general conditions and possible security threats in addition the lebanese general security directorate has set up a formal clearance process that allows refugees to find out whether they are wanted for arrest by the syrian authorities or not syrian community initiatives some sponsored by the syrian embassy offer similar clearance mechanisms and logistical facilitation for an eventual return this report investigates the ways in which refugees deliberate over the decision to stay or return and probes the extent to which voluntary individual returns can at least partly resolve the problem of syrian displacement it argues that these returns are not indicative of any shift in conditions that would make it safe for the majority of refugees to return anytime soon lebanon s external partners will therefore need to help the country support the refugees it is housing including by sponsoring programs that will allow them a degree of self sufficiency the report is based on some 40 individual and group interviews with syrian refugees in lebanon between october 2018 and october 2019 in addition to numerous informal conversations with refugees and nearly 50 interviews with lebanese and international experts humanitarian agency officers and lebanese government officials from october 2018 through december 2019 ii a harsh haven a growing popular hostility the influx of syrian refugees into lebanon started in 2011 and accelerated dramatically in 2012 and 2013 by 2014 it had reached one million the unhcr suspended registration in may 2015 at the request of the lebanese government today there are about 925 000 registered syrian refugees in lebanon down from a peak of 1 185 000 in april 2015 government sources and humanitarian workers often mention a number of 500 000 unregistered refugees though some surmise that the number may also have declined significantly the refugees arrival changed the face of the country in ways that made many lebanese uncomfortable not all refugees are poor but it is the poor who most decisively shape the host society s perceptions wealthy syrians blend effortlessly into privileged urban quarters their impoverished co nationals on the other hand are conspicuous as beggars and menial workers in city streets and by their squalid encampments in the country s predominantly agricultural periphery in particular the beqaa valley and the north in these places they share already inadequate public services and infrastructure with poor lebanese and compete for jobs in the bottom bracket of the labour market many municipalities imposed extralegal restrictions on the movement of syrians as jihadist groups such as jabhat al nusra and the islamic state isis increasingly dominated the syrian revolt after 2012 host communities apprehensions grew further in particular when these groups started to clash with lebanese security forces in border regions christian lebanese reacted particularly strongly many municipalities imposed extralegal restrictions on the movement of syrians additionally some politicians have stoked resentment against refugees raising alarms about alleged plans for permanent resettlement of syrians in lebanon encouraging citizens to take action against illegal syrian labour and blaming the refugees for lebanon s economic crisis the latter accusation is difficult to substantiate lebanon received more than 7 billion in external loans and grants between 2012 and 2018 to cope with the crisis and pledges for another 3 billion for the period 2018 2020 this support likely offsets the direct cost of hosting the refugees which central bank governor riad salamé has estimated at around 1 billion per year the damage that the syrian crisis has caused to the lebanese economy for instance by cutting transit routes for exports and depressing the tourism sector is arguably much larger than this while it appears unfair to blame the refugees for the fallout of a crisis of which they too are victims many lebanese may not care for such distinctions it is also difficult to disaggregate the consequences of the syrian conflict and troubles that lebanon has inflicted upon itself as a result of more than two decades of delayed reforms and unsustainable fiscal policies which in turn tempts politicians to look for scapegoats while incidents of violence against syrians are still limited incitement and pent up pressure may make for a combustible mix clashes between syrians and host communities in mid 2019 could be harbingers of worse to come a senior humanitarian official warned that the level of inter communal tensions is high especially in the north and the beqaa amidst austerity measures dire economic conditions and the political campaign pressing refugees to go home on the other hand and despite repeated attempts by politicians to blame the social crisis on the refugee situation no one has recorded an incident of violence or aggressive behaviour directed at refugees in the course of the protest movement that has engulfed lebanon since 17 october a close observer of events in lebanon remarked the people in the streets know very well who is to blame for the meltdown the politicians not the syrian refugees but the refugees are lying low just in case b restrictive policies growing popular hostility is matched by tighter administrative regulations the first major shift away from a permissive posture came in october 2014 when the lebanese government adopted a policy that called for a reduction of the number of syrian displaced by preventing the entry of more refugees and encouraging those already present to return to their country or other countries to reach these objectives the lebanese authorities introduced visa requirements for arriving syrians demanded that unhcr cease registering refugees and ended the practice of extending refugees visas free of charge while the entry restrictions reduced the influx ending registration and stopping visa extensions only increased the number of unregistered refugees and refugees without valid residency status tougher enforcement of labour restrictions since late 2018 and waves of shelter demolitions since early 2019 have increased pressures on already vulnerable communities without a clear effect on return numbers ending registration and stopping visa extensions only increased the number of unregistered refugees while the message that their time in lebanon may be up has become clear most refugees are still deterred from returning to syria instead some take the high risk of illegally crossing the mediterranean sea to cyprus 1 tightening residency regulations until 5 january 2015 syrians were legally entitled to enter lebanon without a visa and to stay for half a year renewable for another six months without having to pay a fee a yearly residency permit was theoretically available for the equivalent of 200 yet few bothered to obtain one since those who fled the war rather than regime persecution and were not on any of the regime s wanted lists could simply restart the clock with a short round trip to syria according to new regulations issued in january 2015 syrians now have to prove a legitimate purpose for entry such as tourism study transit or business only in exceptional circumstances as determined by the ministry of social affairs can they enter lebanon as refugees these changes formalised measures adopted by the general security directorate after the border clashes in august 2014 entries of syrians dropped by some 45 per cent between 2014 and 2015 and the number of appointments requested for registration with unhcr decreased by 56 per cent in late 2014 and by 78 per cent in january 2015 compared to the previous year for the lebanese authorities crossing the border constitutes return and ends refugee status because of the new regulations syrian refugees can no longer perpetuate their legal stay in lebanon by crossing the border and coming back at the same time the annual residency fee of 200 per family member above fifteen years of age plus administrative costs proved prohibitive for many refugees whose resources are already stretched to the limit furthermore not everyone is eligible to obtain a residency permit syrians must have a lebanese guarantor or another reason to reside in the country that is deemed legitimate such as being of lebanese descent or having close relatives being enrolled in formal education or owning property in lebanon failing any of these conditions they must be registered as refugees with unhcr a residency permit obtained on the basis of unhcr registration does not allow a refugee to cross into syria and come back to lebanon when registered refugees cross the border into syria general security informs unhcr which updates the records of the returnees in its register once it has verified that they returned to syria with the intention to voluntarily repatriate for the lebanese authorities crossing the border constitutes return and ends the right to stay in lebanon as a refugee displaced person an immediate effect of the 2015 policy change was a dramatic increase in the number of syrian refugees without valid residency status surveys show that the ratio ballooned from 9 per cent of registered refugees in january 2015 to 73 per cent in april may 2018 the lebanese government has since waived the 200 fee it previously charged for the annual residency permit although not fees and fines on refugees who either failed to obtain a permit or to renew a permit on time and pledged to facilitate the process of applying for residency permits but the ratio remains at around 70 per cent lack of valid residency status does not by itself expose refugees to deportation but it creates additional pressures such as harassment at checkpoints and temporary detention it also adds another layer of complication to existing difficulties with formal procedures lack of information opaque procedures delays fees such as obtaining documentation marriage and birth certificates and school enrolment while these do not always require a valid residency card public and private lebanese entities often refuse to serve refugees without it make refugees lives even more difficult but they achieve little in terms of encouraging return these measures make refugees lives even more difficult but they achieve little in terms of encouraging return the contrary can be the case as their technically illegal stay persists unpaid fees and fines pile up for every family member fifteen and older for those returnees unable to pay the accumulated fees general security imposes a re entry ban that amounts to another deterrent for many lebanon has largely refrained from deportations and remains committed to the international humanitarian legal principle of non refoulement yet in the spring of 2019 it began engaging in actions that ran afoul of that commitment following a 15 april decision by the higher defence council to deport all syrians who entered the country illegally after 24 april security bodies such as the lebanese armed forces the internal security forces and general security deported more than 2 500 people by the end of august how lebanese authorities establish who entered after the cutoff date remains unclear as does how syrians can appeal deportation orders unlike previous practice deportees are now handed over directly to the syrian authorities making it impossible to sneak back into lebanese territory while the decision in theory should not directly threaten the large majority of refugees already present in lebanon the bulk of whom have been there since 2014 it adds to the general atmosphere of insecurity that convinces refugees that their time in lebanon may be running out 2 tightening labour regulations the new policy adopted in october 2014 also aimed at curbing competition between syrian and lebanese labour by tightening and enforcing existing regulations for foreign workers local resentment of syrian competition increased with the influx and lebanese authorities responded by gradually strengthening regulations ministry of labour decision no 19 of 2 february 2013 authorised syrians to work in construction and its derivative industries in addition to about a dozen mostly manual and semi skilled professions eg tailor storage manager sales representative after the policy change in late 2014 the ministry of labour tightened regulations once more restricting syrians to unskilled labour in construction agriculture and cleaning general security gives syrians 48 hours to close their shops or find a lebanese partner the pressure is on initially enforcement of the new rules remained haphazard and without lasting effect lebanese employers continued to ignore the regulations and shun the laborious and expensive procedures to obtain work permits for their employees as public debate over refugee return increased however so did restrictions upon refugees economic activity since november 2018 general security has conducted several campaigns cracking down on informal syrian owned or run businesses in different parts of lebanon one lebanese civilian official said general security gives syrians 48 hours to close their shops or find a lebanese partner legalise their business pay taxes etc the pressure is on with the inauguration of a new government in january 2019 the campaign acquired additional momentum on 3 june minister of labour camille abu suleiman launched an action plan to combat unauthorised work by foreigners even refugees who previously thought themselves economically secure began to feel vulnerable my brother had a men s hairdressing shop a young syrian said over lunch in a lebanese owned syrian run modest restaurant in the beqaa security closed it down and sealed the door with no prior notice between advance rent outfitting the place and buying equipment he invested 10 000 that s all gone now lebanese businesses that employ syrians have likewise been fined yet to what extent the rules can be enforced remains unclear a human rights researcher said in saida where there was a big campaign last year syrians are now opening in the afternoon once the inspectors day shift is over a syrian owner of a legitimate business in the lower middle class beirut suburb of burj hammoud said when security comes they all close their shops and disappear and once security is gone everyone reopens official efforts are not only hampered by lack of capacity but also by the fact that lebanese as employers and consumers of services depend on syrian labour to perform demanding work for little pay any effective suppression of syrian labour would affect lebanese economic interests as well whether the net effect would benefit lebanese of limited income is difficult to say the presence of large numbers of syrian migrant workers is neither new nor solely the result of the war next door during the early 1990s syria and lebanon signed agreements allowing the free movement of labour syrians unlike other foreigners could acquire work and residency permits quickly and cheaply at the border in reality most worked informally and without any social protection my father came to work here and stayed for fourteen years a syrian student in lebanon said he was able to enter the country merely by showing his id cheap unregulated foreign labour was an essential component of the lebanese post war economic model and allowed syria which wielded extensive political influence in lebanon at the time to export a part of its surplus labour force and receive remittances in return lebanese political leaders for their part were often large scale investors themselves and endorsed the model out of political expediency and personal interest thus already before the syrian crisis a significant part of the lower tier of the lebanese labour market in particular in the building and agricultural sectors was effectively ceded to migrant syrian labour while the mostly informal nature of this work makes obtaining precise figures difficult estimates put the number at around 600 000 at its peak during the reconstruction boom of the mid 1990s and around half that in the years preceding the ongoing war when the boom had come to an end during these two decades however the open border and alternative employment options back in syria allowed the volume of migrant labour to fluctuate according to the lebanese economy s demands and created a bottom line below which wages could not fall refugees have to settle for whatever work and handouts they can get which rarely net them enough to make ends meet with syrian workers now trapped in the country by war fear of the regime and visa regulations these market mechanisms no longer work pressed by the high cost of living and insufficient aid refugees have to settle for whatever work and handouts they can get which rarely net them enough to make ends meet for instance one syrian construction worker reported that the pay for laying one square meter of brick wall which was between 3 and 4 before the war had fallen to less than 2 since then rock bottom wages are the norm for daily labourers who gather at specific spots in lebanese towns and cities to be picked up for hire small businesses like mini markets one dollar shops and restaurants including syrian owned ones hire syrians to work shifts of 10 12 hours for as little as 150 200 per month sometimes less women who mostly work in agriculture earn on average about 160 per month whereas the average for men is around 200 before the war syrian labourers were not paid generously either with wages ranging from 7 to 12 per day or 200 300 per month for unskilled or semi skilled labour yet most were men who came to lebanon alone and used their income to support a family back in syria where the cost of living in particular for basic necessities such as food and shelter was much lower and basic social services schooling health care were available for free with dependents now trapped in lebanon along with the breadwinners reduced incomes have to cover a multiple of the cost turning them into starvation wages even when supplemented by aid c insufficient refugee aid unhcr and the world food programme wfp provide cash and in kind assistance to refugees but few can survive on aid alone in 2018 69 per cent of registered syrians lived below the poverty line 3 41 per person per day while 51 per cent were considered severely economically vulnerable living under the extreme poverty line 2 90 per person per day also known as the survival minimum expenditure basket female headed households have been especially affected with 68 per cent living below that line in 2018 likely because women s employment rate and salaries are around half those of men one immediate effect of the financial pressures is low school attendance in the 2018 2019 school year more than half of 630 000 syrian children were out of school of the remainder about 210 000 attended donor supported public schools and 60 000 private or semi private schools since 2016 cost has been the most frequently cited reason for not attending school even though public schools are free transportation uniforms school supplies and other related costs are not affordable for many families and in many cases school age children have to work for the family to make ends meet lack of access to education for children is a common concern especially for mothers and prompts some to return to syria where education is free and locally made supplies and transportation are much cheaper one syrian refugee working in a women s organisation said some of the women i worked with went back to al moadhamiya because there is no schooling here there are five functioning schools there health care creates an even heavier burden for those who need but cannot afford it in 2018 only 7 per cent of un surveyed refugees reported receiving free primary health care within this group 49 per cent reported that they benefited from subsidies discounted cost sharing primary health care in un terminology and 19 per cent that they never requested primary health care in some cases possibly for fear of being unable pay to for it a senior humanitarian agency representative in lebanon s north warned that even medical aid might not endure for ever forcing those in urgent need of medical care to return to syria we support with kidney problems we have a 2 3 million budget once money dries up syrians will have to go fund themselves they have to make three doctor s visits at 100 each before they can get any treatment those who cannot afford it would have to go back to syria iii considering return most refugees mull the decision to return constantly but end up deferring it time and again rising pressures in lebanon add urgency to their deliberations but do not make reaching a decision any easier refugees have to weigh the hardships of their existence in lebanon against questions about what awaits them back home would they be able to return safely and could they survive there a refugee explained first there are debates in every house whether to return or not the most important thing is to check whether the security services have something against you you also need to see if you have enemies or someone in your area who may want to get back at you for something then come housing and basic utilities and services ending up as internally displaced inside syria that s the biggest mistake you can make and finally you need to find a way to make money obtaining reliable information can be extremely challenging for people already struggling for survival and while desperation may prompt a few to return no matter what cautionary tales from returnees that circulate among refugees deter many more the difficulty is compounded by the fact that return is a one way street for most as registered refugees cannot cross into syria and then come back to lebanon a weighing threats to security for potential returnees the threat to their own security or that of their loved ones is the primary concern it acts as a deterrent that tends to offset even the strong pressure of deteriorating conditions in lebanon active warfare while receding in most parts of syria since mid 2018 remains a worry in particular for men who may have to perform military service upon return while conscription follows written rules the threats from the syrian security state detention torture and death can be unpredictable many refugees reported that refraining from anti regime activities does not guarantee safe return checking and clearing up one s security file is therefore an existential matter 1 detention and taqrir harrowing tales of arrest torture and extrajudicial killings resonate strongly in the refugee community since they are at once the most consequential and least predictable factors weighing on refugees decision making the one group for whom the question of a safe return has a definite answer in the negative are opposition activists as one put it forget about us we are burned but since the regime s concept of who is an opponent is not always clear or more dangerously can change over time there is no certainty about who is safe from arrest while before the 2011 uprising the red lines of the politically permissible were knowable for most syrians eight years into the conflict very little can be taken for granted a syrian community leader in the beqaa said when people are arrested in lebanon you can find out what happened to them but a person who is arrested in syria disappears checking up on your security file is vital when people are arrested in lebanon you can find out what happened to them but a person who is arrested in syria disappears this is why everybody tries to figure out what is in his security file before deciding to return administrative chaos and resulting confusion about a person s identity in particular creates additional risk for people who would otherwise think themselves safe from retribution regime informers are another source of uncertainty writing a taqrir a report meaning reporting people to the security agencies has been a feature of life in baathist syria for decades and it persists among refugees in lebanon many do it for personal gain or to settle scores my brother had no security issues and they still detained him when he returned a divorcée from homs explained it turned out that my ex husband had reported on him others write reports to avoid being targeted themselves even regime officials admit that detentions occur as a result of unfounded denunciations a senior syrian humanitarian agency official narrated the fate of a former employee in opposition held eastern ghouta he was evacuated to idlib but couldn t live there so he decided to return home where he was arrested within a few days it turned out that almost everyone in the neighbourhood had written a taqrir on him by reporting the neighbours wanted to lift doubts about their own loyalty 2 security clearances all roads lead through damascus in order to avoid arrest upon return syrians engage in what is colloquially known as tafyish the act of obtaining information about one s security file and clearing it if possible personal contacts and bribes are the most common channels and means to this end yet due to their informality and the opaque nature of the syrian security sector such information and clearances are not always reliable and not everyone can obtain them two alternatives available to refugees in lebanon are to sign up to return under a process established by the lebanese general security directorate in july 2018 and to rely on a number of syrian community initiatives that include formal clearance procedures with the syrian security authorities even before russia put forward its return initiative in july 2018 lebanese general security had organised voluntary refugee returns in cooperation with syrian authorities on several occasions starting in mid 2017 a pattern emerged by which the gradual recapture of areas near the lebanese border by pro regime forces would lead to negotiations often involving local leaders to secure the safe return of the area s original inhabitants living as refugees in lebanon by july 2018 these mechanisms had become available to any refugee in lebanon considering return individuals can sign up in one of the seventeen designated general security offices for repatriation and once approved are pooled into groups that are supposed to congregate at one of several departure points before crossing into syria several lebanese political parties including hizbollah the free patriotic movement and the lebanese promise party also established return committees which collect names of prospective returnees and forward them to general security in practice these initiatives serve general security s attempt to increase the number of returnees which is in line with these parties general position on the refugee issue the decisive added value of the general security process for refugees is the formal clearance mechanism with the syrian authorities those who sign up have their names forwarded to damascus where the national security bureau the highest security authority in syria runs background checks and returns the lists to beirut indicating who will be able to return unimpeded and who may have problems or face investigation lebanese general security warns those flagged as ineligible by damascus and summons those who have received clearance often at short notice to join the return convoys that it organises at regular intervals a general security spokesperson said we do not want ngos or unhcr to say that we hand over people to the syrians and then terrible things happen that s why we only take people whom the syrian authorities have cleared once they have entered syria safely that s where our responsibility ends nearly 20 000 refugees returned through the general security directorate s facilitation while unhcr maintains that conditions are not right for organised mass returns the agency provides support to refugees who are voluntarily returning individually or through the general security process the un agency helps in particular with obtaining missing documentation such as ids and birth death and school certificates that might be in the lebanese authorities possession as of december 2019 nearly 20 000 refugees had returned through the general security directorate s facilitation since the end of 2018 several syrian community initiatives have established return mechanisms that work along similar lines among them is the association of syrian arab workers in lebanon rabitat al ummal al arab as suriyin which operates under the auspices of the syrian embassy in beirut the association registers names in its headquarters in beirut and through networks across the country and organises group returns for those who have received clearance from damascus other initiatives facilitate returns to specific locales such as al zabadani and moadhamiya reaching out to refugees who came from these areas through social media and word of mouth unlike the returns organised by lebanese parties these initiatives do not go through lebanese general security the rabitat forwards the names it has collected to the security apparatus in damascus through its own channels a senior rabitat official explained we send the names to the amn al watani to be cross checked with all the security branches we have not heard once that someone who was approved faced problems when they returned once the association has consolidated the lists of those eligible to return it coordinates with general security to arrange their departure from lebanon and sort out the paperwork of those whose residency permits have expired all roads to a safe crossing lead through the central intelligence apparatus in damascus regardless of the administrative route a refugee wishing to return takes all roads to a safe crossing lead through the central intelligence apparatus in damascus whose security clearance or refusal to issue one represents the ultimate verdict on a refugee s ability to go home safely while the clearance process does not protect would be returnees from abusive militias or future persecution by a regime that rules violently and arbitrarily it helps reduce the uncertainty that they face thereby removing an element of deterrence judging by the numbers who sign up the various initiatives appear to reach a growing number of refugees and trust in the process is increasing while only 90 and 100 people respectively signed up for the first two rounds of return to al zabadani in late 2018 the third cohort in january 2019 saw 1 000 people registering out of whom 900 received a security clearance as for moadhamiya the first group that returned through the facilitation of the city s reconciliation committee in july 2018 numbered around 50 refugees a list submitted in december 2018 contained around 1 100 names 800 of whom reportedly received clearance from the syrian side one point that remains difficult to ascertain is the percentage of applicants not approved for return some reports covering the early phase of the general security process speak of an acceptance rate of less than 20 per cent some observers and humanitarian workers claim that for applicants from areas identified as anti regime hotbeds the approval rate is nearly zero representatives of the syrian community initiatives and general security interviewed in 2019 on the other hand maintain that the average approval rate is around 80 per cent these figures may be less contradictory than they appear since news that particular identifiable groups are de facto ineligible spreads quickly through social media it appears plausible that over time these people would simply stop applying even a low rejection rate may deter a much larger number of refugees from attempting return most refugees move as families and with the visa and entry restrictions imposed by lebanon leaving behind family members who failed to obtain approval is likely to entail permanent family separation the fact that most of those denied approval are men further militates against such returns in practice it means sending women and children into a volatile situation without male protection in a male dominated society with no option to reverse that decision the general security official said in some cases you may have a family of twelve individuals who stay put because one of the men has a security problem 3 conscription unlike arrest and detention conscription into mandatory or reserve military service in syria is predictable yet its deterrent effect concerns many more refugees mandatory service is required for eligible men age eighteen to 42 and supposed to last for eighteen months but due to the war many serve much longer afterward they may still be called up for reserve duty up to the age of anywhere from 48 to 62 depending on rank in mid october 2018 regime media announced the delisting of about 800 000 men who would no longer be required for reserve duty some observers including pro regime journalists initially interpreted the measure as a step toward removing this deterrent to return a number of syrians saw an opportunity and actually returned sometimes after using relations back home to verify with the general conscription directorate branch in their area of origin that they were indeed no longer wanted for service yet at least some of those who returned found themselves in the army a few weeks later after the defence ministry published new call up lists for reserve duty in december 2018 rescinding its earlier decision the reasons behind this chain of events are difficult to ascertain still it clearly further undermined refugees confidence that they could reliably predict what may be awaiting them upon return active warfare in syria has receded since mid 2018 yet another grim round of fighting may still await in idlib where the regime has conducted several offensives since may 2019 what lies ahead for the north east also remains uncertain serving in the army thus still comes with the risk of being killed or seriously wounded in combat in addition to separation from family for extended periods some of those with no option but to return and then be forced to join the army look at it from the bright side one refugee explained that joining the military security apparatus also offers a sort of protection and access to resources a simple soldier has become something big in society my cousin is in the army and doesn t want to be discharged by wearing the military uniform you have authority you walk with your gun and it is a source of income a simple soldier has become something big in society women are not affected by conscription yet many refrain from returning because they would either have to leave male relatives husbands sons of or approaching conscription age behind in lebanon or see them carried off to the army like for those who fail to obtain security clearances entire families including men no longer required to serve may resist returning out of fear for young males old enough or nearly old enough to be conscripted but too young to be left behind alone b from the frying pan into the fire 1 lawlessness fragmentation and closure syria s geographic and political fragmentation further complicates the decision to return some previously opposition held areas are practically sealed off to anyone wishing to return to their original homes in others the regime seeks to limit the return of the original population to avoid a reconstitution of social environments that supported the uprising some nominally regime controlled areas such as daraa deir al zour city and parts of aleppo and homs are inhospitable for returnees due to heavy destruction the reign of abusive pro regime militias security problems such as isis attacks or a combination of all three for instance the town of al qusayr near homs remained mostly off limits to returning refugees and internally displaced until late 2019 depopulated during intense fighting in 2013 it was a closed zone as the lebanese hizbollah established a military hub there according to unhcr about 55 000 syrian refugees from al qusayr were living in lebanon in 2015 mostly in the impoverished arsal area in the northern beqaa valley only in september 2019 did hizbollah officially allow return to the area many formerly opposition held areas such as daraya near damascus eastern aleppo or certain neighbourhoods of homs have suffered such severe destruction that return is difficult without substantial material support which is mostly unavailable in some of these areas access restrictions that appear geared to prevent a reoccurrence of the social conditions that gave rise to the protests in 2011 further militate against return checkpoints extracting bribes are a common phenomenon across regime held syria de facto rule by abusive militias in many areas adds to the problem checkpoints extracting bribes are a common phenomenon across regime held syria the regime has sometimes demonstrated its capacity to rein in rogue actors but enforcement remains uneven the government held parts of deir al zour province are perhaps the most blatant example more than two years after the regime captured these areas from isis they lack basic services and are controlled by predatory militias militia fighters manning checkpoints positioned on strategic roads levy illegal fees on travellers and transporters of goods and exact bribes from young men on the threat of conscription or arrest a trader from deir al zour explained how government control in effect amounts to rule by protection racket most of the rich businessmen give a part of their profits to senior government security officers to be shielded from harassment by government forces and militiamen the militias became used to looting and now they are prospecting for new financial sources and extract bribes from merchants in exchange for promises not to attack and loot their shops 2 from refugees to idps for refugees who are undeterred by security challenges the question remains whether returning to syria will improve their situation compared with staying in lebanon paltry incomes insufficient aid and high living costs in lebanon push them to return but if economic prospects in syria appear worse they may still choose to struggle on with the little they have in lebanon rather than take the risk of ending up destitute in syria the question of whether refugees can return to their original homes and areas is essential trading the status of refugee in lebanon for that of internally displaced person in syria is unlikely to improve their situation compelled to rent accommodations and with no local networks to facilitate finding work or getting access to public services return to syria may end up making them more not less vulnerable refugees are aware of this problem polls show a clear correlation between the decision to return to syria and the hope to reach the area of one s origin nearly all refugees polled by unhcr in may 2019 who expressed their intention to return in the coming year said they hoped to go to their area of origin conversely nearly two thirds of those not intending to return within the next twelve months stated that their property was either fully destroyed or uninhabitable in addition to the physical destruction of housing some refugees also lack sufficient documentation to assert their property rights or may be in danger of losing their property in the course of regime proposed rezoning and reconstruction schemes one refugee summed up the predicament people don t return to become internally displaced housing and public infrastructure are crucial people don t return to become internally displaced that would be a big mistake you need to be able to pay rent rebuild your social network etc after housing comes the issue of income current economic circumstances do not bode well unemployment rates in syria are estimated at anywhere between 40 and 60 per cent pronounced regional disparities are amplified by the lack of mobility due to security problems and fuel shortages a syrian expatriate with plans to open a small business in aleppo said before workers would commute from rural idlib and aleppo to aleppo city now these distances are prohibitive checkpoints especially those belonging to the national defence forces are horrible people would rather stay home than be humiliated on a daily basis moving to the city is not an option because salaries are insufficient to cover rents there in the public sector still the largest employer in syria even employees with academic degrees and extensive work experience earn a salary of barely 60 000 syrian pounds 100 per month including benefits entry level jobs for university graduates yield less than half of that un estimates put the annual average per capita income in syria at 479 the pay that conscripted soldiers receive 36 500 pounds per month or 65 75 almost looks generous in comparison and while most syrians dread conscription it can nevertheless be a fallback for those who would otherwise have no income the flip side of the misery is the low cost of living prompting some refugees in lebanon to turn to a time tested economic model staying for work in lebanon while sending women and children to syria where basic items are cheap and where public services such as education and health care are perhaps rudimentary but free others are deterred by the prospect that sending their families home alone would leave them without male protection in a country where many areas remain unsafe men who stay behind can come on regular visits only if they have a valid residency card in lebanon based on a guarantor not refugee status and if they are not wanted for military service or political reasons in syria these are conditions that apply only to a few for syria in general the economic outlook remains bleak without political change in damascus or a change in the european or u s approach toward the assad regime western sanctions will remain in place ruling out major investment in labour intensive sectors such as construction industry agriculture and services high unemployment intense destruction in many areas low salaries even lower growth prospects and dismal services combine to make a daunting uphill struggle the most likely scenario for the majority of returnees iv a two pronged approach a international support for refugees and host communities questions relating to refugee return to syria are bound up with unresolved controversies about the country s political order as well as with the personal assessments that refugees themselves make about their safety security and economic prospects should they return the syrian regime and its allies argue that the conflict is over that it is safe to return and that it is time to rebuild the state politically as well as physically according to this view western governments refuse to fund reconstruction and support return to syria because they regard the regime as illegitimate for this reason returnee numbers remain low conversely the return of a substantial number of refugees would support the regime narrative that syria today is back to being a normal country and that the majority of syrians are prepared to live under the current government s rule sceptics of this narrative including western governments argue that it is the regime itself that deters return and that returnees will not be safe as long as it remains in control and unreformed they cite the view of international humanitarian organisations which tie the notion of safe return to a catalogue of conditions that the regime is unlikely even to discuss such as safety guarantees for returnees and monitoring mechanisms to enforce them and the delisting of male returnees from all forms of military service some human rights organisations argue that because refugees are in many cases fleeing dire conditions when leaving lebanon their returns to syria may not be truly voluntary and do not indicate that the time is right to begin organised repatriations it seems unlikely that either facilitation or money will turn the current trickle of returnees into a steady stream for the refugees themselves however the decision about whether to risk return is far removed from these politicised debates and more about a concrete and very personal risk benefit calculation as discussed above some refugees return at their own initiative and against many odds before taking this step which is irreversible for most they tend to engage in drawn out deliberations weighing their increasingly difficult situation in lebanon against the risks that come with returning to syria economic factors in particular accessibility of property play a significant role for refugees who feel confident about a safe return but remain of marginal importance for those who believe that return will put their lives in danger as long as there is no improvement in the regime s brutal conduct toward its perceived opponents and as long as it remains committed to reclaiming all syrian territory by military means it seems unlikely that either facilitation or money will turn the current trickle of returnees into a steady stream by the same token slashing aid for refugees living in lebanon and redirecting it to assist returnees in syria is unlikely to speed up return contrary to claims advanced by some lebanese leaders indeed the research conducted for this report indicates that access to aid barely figures in refugees deliberations whether it might factor more heavily if donors were to significantly increase the volume of assistance delivered in syria is not known that scenario however is unlikely in any case the provision of aid in regime controlled areas of syria is mired in controversy with the regime facing credible allegations that the restrictions it imposes on humanitarian organisations which are among other things denied access to some communities in need and the obligation to partner with certain approved local organisations are designed to allow damascus to co opt the assistance for its own purposes even if concerns over returnees safety could be resolved donor countries and organisations are unlikely to expand or redirect their assistance activities however great the need unless the syrian government can address these legitimate concerns crisis group has elsewhere proposed that european countries consider breaking out of this conundrum by starting to provide funds for small scale rehabilitation projects in regime held areas that could help prevent the collapse of essential public services eg not just repairing the broken windows of hospitals or schools as some eu member states are doing but also rebuilding collapsed walls and roofs on the condition that they are allowed to deliver funds independently without regime interference but even if they do so and damascus cooperates it will take time for the parties to build confidence and it is hard to see donors feeling comfortable with full scale reconstruction funding any time soon in the meantime beirut should be working with donors to improve conditions both for the syrian refugees who are likely to be in the country for years to come and for the lebanese with whom they are living side by side while there are both humanitarian and human rights reasons to move in this direction there are also reasons of self interest for example if beirut appears to be creating or tolerating conditions hostile to refugees in order to force them to return regardless of credible security concerns it may end up jeopardising the funding for the humanitarian refugee response that through investments in infrastructure and other projects has created thousands of jobs for lebanese as well as syrians moreover beirut should be conscious of the role that syrian workers have come to play in the nation s economy and the consequences of driving them precipitously out of it as noted above many employers who now rely on cheap syrian labour might well go out of business unless they can bear the costs of operating illegally with the bribes and fines that entails or switching to more expensive lebanese labour beirut should regularise the already existing employment of syrian refugees rather than making it more difficult for refugees to work beirut should turn this approach on its head and instead regularise the already existing employment of syrian refugees facilitating access to work permits for syrian refugees while enforcing the collection of reasonable fees for such hires can help address domestic equity concerns refugees should also have legal avenues for self employment and small business formation such an approach can make refugees a source of state revenue protect them against potential harassment by public officials and exploitation by unethical employers and provide legal safeguards in line with existing bilateral agreements with damascus importantly these steps will help create a verifiable set of refugee employment indicators against which the lebanese government can negotiate increased international support to stabilise its economy perhaps counterintuitively legalising the work of syrian refugees may also increase returns workers who are legal in lebanon and not wanted by the security agencies or for military service in syria would be able to cross the border for short visits on a regular basis making the difficult but economically plausible decision to let women and children go back alone discussed above appear more viable the syrian government in turn could help along such trends by exempting those who obtain legal work in lebanon from reserve military service thus increasing remittances of sorely needed hard currency of course notwithstanding its benefits legalising the work of syrian refugees will almost certainly be a difficult sell to the lebanese public which is straining under high unemployment and the loss of purchasing power amid a crushing fiscal crisis here donors may be able to help looking to recent precedents for strategic cooperation between external donors and host countries that create situations benefiting both refugees and host populations for instance as a result of the jordan compact announced at the february 2016 syria conference in london the jordanian government agreed to accommodate 200 000 syrian refugees in its labour market in return for improved access to the european market increased investment and loans on concessional terms subsequent trade agreements granted jordanian manufacturers preferential access to european markets provided that syrian refugees account for 15 per cent of their work force increasing to 25 per cent in the third year international organisations such as the international labour organization ilo with funding from european governments support job creation and labour market regulation in the service of implementing these arrangements other foreign funded projects in jordan include labour intensive upgrades for infrastructure in downtrodden areas to which most refugees gravitate with the declared objective of providing work and improved living conditions for both refugees and host communities such projects are also carried out in lebanon albeit on a much smaller scale mostly due to the political sensitivity surrounding the refugee issue an ilo representative at the organisation s beirut office said the infrastructure in these areas where most of the refugees live is in bad shape and the state does not have money to fix it hence on the local level community leaders and mayors welcome our initiatives they want these infrastructural improvements and these jobs for their communities and they realize that the refugees are the reason why these projects are happening once you take out the politics it is just plain obvious that it is a win win situation for everybody to mitigate the likelihood of increasing public hostility toward syrian refugees international donors should embrace a pragmatic approach to their assistance in lebanon that builds on the experience of the jordan compact by supporting highly visible labour intensive projects that benefit communities hosting large refugee concentrations donors can proactively lessen local tensions that political forces might otherwise exploit simultaneously donors should negotiate a results based program of macro economic support for the lebanese economy that includes debt refinancing investment and trade preferences linked to verifiable indicators of refugee employment providing a clear case for political action b facilitating safe return although the vast majority of syrian refugees are unlikely to return any time soon a small number will likely continue to trickle back and there are supportive steps lebanese policymakers could take that might help numbers to rise gradually as and when conditions in syria improve if done responsibly further facilitating voluntary returns could over time both broaden options for the refugees themselves and allow a growing number of lebanese to see that some refugees are already heading home which may contribute to a reduction in tensions between refugees and locals for those refugees whose residency permit in lebanon is tied to their unhcr registration unlike those who obtain it through a lebanese guarantor or who have no valid residency status at all crossing the border to return home is a decision that is often irreversible as the lebanese authorities will not readmit them for many this decision amounts to a dangerous gamble given the fragmentation of syria and significant differences between localities reliable information about the viability of return to a specific area is often difficult to come by facilitating short go and see visits that allow refugees to explore the conditions back home for instance by issuing temporary passes that allow refugees to cross into syria and return may encourage exploration of this possibility by some who are deterred by the prospect of travelling with their family down a one way street into the unknown there are other steps that lebanese authorities could also usefully take at present the high ratio of refugees without legal residency status goes beyond creating hardship for refugees and headaches for their hosts some of its side effects may even work against return as noted above the lack of legal residency results in back fees and fines for overstaying when refugees leave they are required to pay those arrears which can make returning prohibitively expensive or face a re entry ban that is often permanent if they are unable to produce the money waiving these fees without imposing re entry bans on those who cannot pay would remove a deterrent for refugees who hope to return to lebanon at some point or who do not want to lose the option to visit the country the syrian government in turn could help along return by reducing the number of men called up for reserve duty for those who are not exempted guaranteeing a grace period of several months for returnees before calling them up for service would give male heads of household precious extra time to stabilise their dependents situation upon return a renewal of the amnesty for deserters and draft dodgers that expired in april 2019 would also remove a major deterrent that said the fear of being targeted by the regime s security agencies even after clearance and a subsequent safe crossing of conscription into an army that may yet fight new rounds of war and of arbitrary practices by pro regime militias will continue to serve as a major deterrent as long as the regime uses primarily security and military approaches in its quest to regain control over all of syria v conclusion small numbers of syrian refugees are returning home from lebanon but their returns are too few to significantly ease what has become a very tense dynamic between refugees and their hosts moreover neither economic hardship nor growing tension with lebanese has given much extra momentum to repatriation most refugees are still deterred by security conditions in syria in particular the threats of conscription and arbitrary arrest this situation appears unlikely to change as long as the assad regime rules as it does damascus holds the key that can unlock the mass repatriation that both it and beirut would like to see how quickly returns proceed depends largely on questions under the assad regime s control including among other things how many refugees it resolves to clear how it treats those who come back to what extent it allows foreign humanitarian organisations independent access to returnees and provides for the accountability of local organisations and institutions implementing foreign funded assistance and whether it will move toward national and social reconciliation rather than imposing control by force until answers satisfactory to refugees and to some extent donors begin to emerge many refugees will for the medium or long term continue to assess that they have no better option than to stay in lebanon donor organisations governments wishing to assist lebanon and lebanese leaders need to face this reality and muster support that can help to gird both the refugees and their lebanese neighbours for the lengthy period of co existence that almost certainly lies ahead beirut brussels 13 february 2020 appendix a map of lebanon

construction activities in the spring paracatu asset optimization program the paracatu asset optimization program that commenced in 2018 was completed in late 2019 with the successful implementation of a comprehensive grade control program the results of the program include better characterization of the orebody an improved ability to predict and react to ore variability and improvements in throughput and recovery in addition as a result of a focus on continuous improvement programs the site is benefiting from improved mining and processing costs and increased overall productivity lastly site water management activities the addition of renewable power sources with the acquisition of two hydroelectric power plants in 2018 and the continued successful tailings reprocessing project have further contributed to improved site performance a newly updated resource model has resulted in the addition of approximately 828 au koz to estimated mineral reserves more than offsetting 2019

kinross total proven and probable gold reserve estimate was 24 3 million au oz at year end 2019 compared with 25 5 million au oz at year end 2018 the net year over year decrease was mainly due to depletion and was largely offset by additions at paracatu kupol and chirano at paracatu approximately 828 au koz was added to estimated mineral reserves and more than offset depletion of 705 au koz the reserve addition was primarily as a result of an enhanced understanding of the orebody and engineering changes to the mine plan as drilling data from the past two years was incorporated into the resource model the 327 au koz mineral reserve addition at kupol largely offset depletion of 344 au koz and added one year of mine life to 2024 at chirano the 320 au koz mineral reserve addition from exploration more than offset depletion of 207 au koz and added one year of mine life to 2022 measured and indicated mineral resources3 kinross total estimated measured and indicated mineral resources

note to u s investors concerning estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources these estimates have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of canadian securities laws which differ from the requirements of united states securities laws the terms mineral reserve proven mineral reserve and probable mineral reserve are canadian mining terms as defined in accordance with ni 43 101 and the cim definition standards the cim definition standards differ from the definitions in the united states securities and exchange commission sec guide 7 sec guide 7 under the united states securities act of 1933 as amended under sec guide 7 a final or bankable feasibility study is required to report mineral reserves the three year historical average price is used in any mineral reserve or cash flow analysis to designate mineral reserves and the primary environmental analysis or report must be filed with the appropriate governmental authority in addition the terms mineral resource measured mineral resource indicated mineral resource and inferred mineral resource are defined in ni 43 101 and recognized by canadian securities laws but are not defined terms under sec guide 7 or recognized under u s securities laws u s investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of mineral deposits in these categories will ever be upgraded to mineral reserves inferred mineral resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility it cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever by upgraded to a higher category under canadian securities laws estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre feasibility studies except in rare cases u s investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists or is economically or legally mineable accordingly these mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates and related information may not be comparable to similar information made public by u s companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements under the united states federal laws and the rules and regulations thereunder including sec guide 7 5 the company s mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates were prepared under the supervision of and verified by mr

the data used to estimate mineral reserves and mineral resources independent data verification has not been performed 7 mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have to demonstrate economic viability mineral resources are subject to infill drilling permitting mine planning mining dilution and recovery losses among other things to be converted into mineral reserves due to the uncertainty associated with inferred mineral resources it cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to indicated or measured mineral resources including as a result of continued exploration 8 includes mineral resources from the puren deposit in which the company holds a 65 interest 9 chulbatkan was acquired by kinross effective january 16 2020 mineral reserve and mineral resource definitions a mineral resource is a concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in or on the earth s crust in such form grade or quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction the location quantity grade or quality continuity and other geological characteristics of a mineral resource are known estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge including sampling an inferred mineral resource is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling geological evidence is sufficient to imply but not verify geological and grade or quality continuity an inferred mineral resource has a lower level of confidence than that applying to an indicated mineral resource and must not be converted to a mineral reserve it is reasonably expected that the majority of inferred mineral resources could be upgraded to indicated mineral resources with continued exploration an indicated mineral resource is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity grade or quality densities shape and physical characteristics are estimated with sufficient confidence to allow the application of modifying factors in sufficient detail to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit geological evidence is derived from adequately detailed and reliable exploration sampling and testing and is sufficient to assume geological and grade or quality continuity between points of observation an indicated mineral resource has a lower level of confidence than that applying to a measured mineral resource and may only be converted to a probable mineral reserve a measured mineral resource is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity grade or quality densities shape and physical characteristics are estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the application of modifying factors to support detailed mine planning and final evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit geological evidence is derived from detailed and reliable exploration sampling and testing and is sufficient to confirm geological and grade or quality continuity between points of observation a measured mineral resource has a higher level of confidence than that applying to either an indicated mineral resource or an inferred mineral resource it may be converted to a proven mineral reserve or to a probable mineral reserve a mineral reserve is the economically mineable part of a measured and or indicated mineral resource it includes diluting materials and allowances for losses which may occur when the material is mined or extracted and is defined by studies at pre feasibility or feasibility level as appropriate that include application of modifying factors such studies demonstrate that at the time of reporting extraction could reasonably be justified the reference point at which mineral reserves are defined usually the point where the ore is delivered to the processing plant must be stated it is important that in all situations where the reference point is different such as for a saleable product a clarifying statement is included to ensure that the reader is fully informed as to what is being reported the public disclosure of a mineral reserve must be demonstrated by a pre feasibility study or feasibility study a probable mineral reserve is the economically mineable part of an indicated and in some circumstances a measured mineral resource the confidence in the modifying factors applying to a probable mineral reserve is lower than that applying to a proven mineral reserve a proven mineral reserve is the economically mineable part of a measured mineral resource a proven mineral reserve implies a high degree of confidence in the modifying factors cautionary statement on forward looking

notes starting at page 16 ceo commentary j paul rollinson president and ceo made the following comments in relation to kinross development projects we achieved key project and exploration milestones in 2019 to strengthen our portfolio and future production profile significant additions to mineral reserve and resource estimates at paracatu improved the mine s long term production outlook and offset depletion while the mineral reserve additions from our exploration programs at kupol and chirano extended mine life at both operations by one year the tasiast 24k project is proceeding on plan while at the same time the mine continues to achieve record operational results due to the phase one expansion the fort knox gilmore project is on schedule to start stacking on the new heap leach pad in q4 2020 we are excited about our newly acquired high quality chulbatkan project which we expect to be a substantial open pit heap leach mine the project has a strong base case and good upside potential and we have a substantial drilling program planned for 2020 with the goal of adding to its resource estimates by year end we are also proceeding with the la coipa restart project which has strong economics adds to our production profile and provides the option to continue studying opportunities in the area development projects tasiast 24k project the 24k project continues to advance well and remains on budget and on schedule to increase throughput capacity to 21 000 t d by the end of 2021 and then to 24 000 t d by mid 2023 stripping continues on plan detailed engineering is largely complete and procurement and contracting activities are well underway the construction team has mobilized to site and initial debottlenecking work in the processing plant has commenced along with construction activities related to the installation of a power plant the company signed the 300 million project financing for tasiast with the ifc a member of the world bank group export development canada and two commercial banks on december 16 2019 the first funding draw from the loan which is non recourse to kinross is expected later in q1 2020 chulbatkan on january 16 2020 the company completed the acquisition of the high quality chulbatkan project in russia chulbatkan has upside potential and is expected to be a substantial open pit gold mine with low costs the project currently has a large near surface relatively high grade estimated mineral resource the deposit is heap leachable and has potential for additional high grade structures mineralization is open along strike and at depth and is highly continuous the company s initial mineral resource estimate does not include results from the confirmatory drilling program which includes one hole that has encountered a potential high grade structure within the existing mineral resource infill drilling and studies are planned this year to update the high grade portion of the known resource with the goal of defining and further extending the resource base at year end 2020 kinross has also commenced a 10 million exploration drilling program within the under explored highly prospective 120 sq km license area which has numerous untested potential targets and several structural environments analogous to the chulbatkan deposit multiple downstream placer gold occurrences also indicate additional hard

related pumping and piping infrastructure remains on target for completion in q4 2020 procurement for all planned 2020 activities is largely complete and the project is ready to recommence construction activities in the spring paracatu asset optimization program the paracatu asset optimization program that commenced in 2018 was completed in late 2019 with the successful implementation of a comprehensive grade control program the results of the program include better characterization of the orebody an improved ability to predict and react to ore variability and improvements in throughput and recovery in addition as a result of a focus on continuous improvement programs the site is benefiting from improved mining and processing costs and increased overall productivity lastly site water management activities the addition of renewable power sources with the acquisition of two hydroelectric power plants in 2018 and the continued successful tailings reprocessing project have further contributed to improved site performance a newly updated resource model has resulted in the addition of approximately 828 au koz to estimated mineral reserves more than offsetting 2019

kinross total proven and probable gold reserve estimate was 24 3 million au oz at year end 2019 compared with 25 5 million au oz at year end 2018 the net year over year decrease was mainly due to depletion and was largely offset by additions at paracatu kupol and chirano at paracatu approximately 828 au koz was added to estimated mineral reserves and more than offset depletion of 705 au koz the reserve addition was primarily as a result of an enhanced understanding of the orebody and engineering changes to the mine plan as drilling data from the past two years was incorporated into the resource model the 327 au koz mineral reserve addition at kupol largely offset depletion of 344 au koz and added one year of mine life to 2024 at chirano the 320 au koz mineral reserve addition from

from the requirements of united states securities laws the terms mineral reserve proven mineral reserve and probable mineral reserve are canadian mining terms as defined in accordance with ni 43 101 and the cim definition standards the cim definition standards differ from the definitions in the united states securities and exchange commission sec guide 7 sec guide 7 under the united states securities act of 1933 as amended under sec guide 7 a final or bankable feasibility study is required to report mineral reserves the three year historical average price is used in any mineral reserve or cash flow analysis to designate mineral reserves and the primary environmental analysis or report must be filed with the appropriate governmental authority in addition the terms mineral resource measured mineral resource indicated mineral resource and inferred mineral resource are defined in ni 43 101 and recognized by canadian securities laws but are not defined terms under sec guide 7 or recognized under u s securities laws u s investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of mineral deposits in these categories will ever be upgraded to mineral reserves inferred mineral resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility it cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever by upgraded to a higher category under canadian securities laws estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre feasibility studies except in rare cases u s investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists or is economically or legally mineable accordingly these mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates and related information may not be comparable to similar information made public by u s companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements under the united states federal laws and the rules and regulations thereunder including sec guide 7 5 the company s mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates were prepared under the supervision of and verified by mr john sims an officer of kinross who is a qualified person as defined by ni 43 101 6 the company s normal data verification procedures have been used in collecting compiling interpreting and processing the data used to estimate mineral reserves and mineral resources independent data verification has not been performed 7 mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have to demonstrate economic viability mineral resources are subject to infill drilling permitting mine planning mining dilution and recovery losses among other things to be converted into mineral reserves due to the uncertainty associated with inferred mineral resources it cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to indicated or measured mineral resources

2020 mineral reserve and mineral resource definitions a mineral resource is a concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in or on the earth s crust in such form grade or quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction the location quantity grade or quality continuity and other geological characteristics of a mineral resource are known estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge including sampling an inferred mineral resource is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling geological evidence is sufficient to imply but not verify geological and grade or quality continuity an inferred mineral resource has a lower level of confidence than that applying to an indicated mineral resource and must not be converted to a mineral reserve it is reasonably expected that the majority of inferred mineral resources could be upgraded to indicated mineral resources with continued exploration an indicated mineral resource is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity grade or quality densities shape and physical characteristics are estimated with sufficient confidence to allow the application of modifying factors in sufficient detail to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit geological evidence is derived from adequately detailed and reliable exploration sampling and testing and is sufficient to assume geological and grade or quality continuity between points of observation an indicated mineral resource has a lower level of confidence than that applying to a measured mineral resource and may only be converted to a probable mineral reserve a measured mineral resource is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity grade or quality densities shape and physical characteristics are estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the application of modifying factors to support detailed mine planning and final evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit geological evidence is derived from detailed and reliable exploration sampling and testing and is sufficient to confirm geological and grade or quality continuity between points of observation a measured mineral resource has a higher level of confidence than that applying to either an indicated mineral resource or an inferred mineral resource it may be converted to a proven mineral reserve or to a probable mineral reserve a mineral reserve is the economically mineable part of a measured and or indicated mineral resource it includes diluting materials and allowances for losses which may occur when the material is mined or extracted and is defined by studies at pre feasibility or feasibility level as appropriate that include application of modifying factors such studies demonstrate that at the time of reporting extraction could reasonably be justified the reference point at which mineral reserves are defined usually the point where the ore is delivered to the processing plant must be stated it is important that in all situations where the reference point is different such as for a saleable product a clarifying statement is included to ensure that the reader is fully informed as to what is being reported the public disclosure of a mineral reserve must be demonstrated by a pre feasibility study or feasibility study a probable mineral reserve is the economically mineable part of an indicated and in some circumstances a measured mineral resource the confidence in the modifying factors applying to a probable mineral reserve is lower than that applying to a proven mineral reserve a proven mineral reserve is the economically mineable part of a measured mineral resource a proven mineral reserve implies a high degree of confidence in the modifying factors cautionary statement on forward looking

million related to the decision by the administrative court in april 2 2019 to reduce the eur 1 7 million tax increase imposed in 2015 by the finnish customs to approximately eur 60 000 aki ojanen ceo of aspo group comments on full year 2019 and the fourth quarter our expectations for 2019 were exceptionally high in terms of increase in both net sales and operating profit as the year went on we were however forced to lower our guidance due to operational challenges faced by telko and weakening market conditions in esl shipping s business in 2019 our net sales were at a record high of eur 588 million and our operating profit improved slightly to eur 21 1 million net cash from operating activities developed very positively reaching a new record of eur 52 5 million in 2019 of which the positive effect of the adoption of the ifrs 16 standard was approximately eur 14 million strong net cash from operating activities is in a key position in increasing our distributed dividends reducing our indebtedness and carrying out future investments aspo s businesses have analyzed the external and internal factors that have slowed the increase in our operating profit and corrective actions have been taken we believe that these corrections help us to increase our results to the level enabled by aspo s current structure in 2019 unexpected industrial stoppages and lower transportation volumes in the steel industry in particular had a negative impact on the profitability of our shipping company s operations and on aspo s total results on the other hand positive factors were the development of the results of atob c a shipping company acquired in sweden particularly during the final quarter i am also very satisfied with the operational efficiency and low energy consumption of our lng fueled vessels unfortunately other shipping company operations suffered from the exceptionally steep decline in transportation volumes in the steel and energy industries due to which part of the fleet was kept at port during the final quarter considering how challenging the market situation was esl shipping s operating profit for the final quarter can be regarded as a good achievement telko reached an unusually low operating profit during the final quarter this was primarily a result of the actions taken by the company s new management that aim to improve the efficiency of the working capital by optimizing the stock levels and to reduce price and currency risks the aim of these actions is to ensure that telko s profitability improves in 2020 leipurin s operations developed positively during the final quarter of 2019 the net sales and profitability of bakery operations improved with development being particularly strong in eastern markets as bakery operations continued to grow and the operating profit rate of entire leipurin business in eastern markets climbed over 11 although 2019 did not meet our expectations in terms of operating profit i firmly believe in aspo s long term profitability and the effectiveness of our strategy major investments have been made in recent years and in the near future we will focus on improving our profitability in all our business operations

reach these financial targets in 2023 following the adoption of ifrs 16 aspo changed its long term financial target for the gearing ratio to up to 130 on april 29 2019 aspo s earlier financial target for gearing was up to 100 the target for the operating profit was changed in at the aspo capital markets day in november 2019 aspo s previous target was an operating profit of 7 the changed target is based on the operating model of atob c a shipping company acquired by esl shipping in 2018 through which a large part of esl shipping s fleet is leased and not owned the higher percentage of leased vessels reduces esl shipping s operating profit rate the operating profit rate for january december 2019 was 3 6 3 8 return on equity was 13 5 12 4 and gearing was 162 2 154 4 the comparability of gearing is affected by the adoption of ifrs 16 leases referred to above as it increased the company s gearing by some 30 percentage points at the date of transition outlook for 2020 global economic growth is expected to continue to slow down economic growth in russia and in the entire eastern market area will continue but on a more moderate level political risks and international sanctions imposed on russia have maintained risk levels in the market area which is why it remains challenging to forecast future development the risk of increasing obstacles to international free trade has increased or remained and negative development may also be rapid which may affect the international freight rates customer companies aspo s principals or the operating prerequisites of aspo s businesses growth in finnish export volumes has decelerated in addition the labor market situation has become more unstable in finland the increase in industrial production is expected to slow down in the main market areas of aspo s businesses in northern europe economic conditions will remain unchanged in aspo s businesses although there is a risk of rapid changes the prices of production raw materials important to aspo have decreased in general prices are expected to remain low or increase in 2020 dry bulk freight rates in sea transportation important to esl shipping fell steeply at the beginning of 2020 and it is difficult to forecast future price development aspo s business operations esl shipping esl shipping is the leading dry bulk cargo company in the baltic sea region at the end of the review period the shipping company s fleet consisted of 51 vessels with a total capacity of 468 000 dwt of the vessels 24 are wholly owned 75 of the fleet two are minority owned 2 and the remaining 24 are time chartered 23 esl shipping s competitive edge is based on its ability to secure product and raw material transportation for industries and energy production year round even in difficult weather conditions the shipping company loads and unloads large ocean liners at sea as a special service 10 12 2019 10 12 2018 change 1 12 2019 1 12 2018 change net sales meur 45 3 46 4 2 4

made in august esl shipping s operating profit during the fourth quarter increased to eur 4 4 4 2 million regardless of the unusually steep decline in transportation volumes in the steel industry and strikes that hindered operations during the final quarter net sales decreased by 2 from the comparative period and stood at eur 45 3 46 4 million the operating profit rate during the quarter improved to 9 7 9 1 the shipping company s cost efficiency improved from the comparative period particularly regarding the technical maintenance of vessels and operating personnel during the final quarter the cargo volume carried by esl shipping decreased slightly to 4 0 4 5 million tonnes in addition to the steel industry transportation volumes also decreased in the energy industry from the comparative period during the final quarter the shipping company s vessels primarily operated in contract traffic in the baltic sea and in northern europe and also performed loading and unloading operations at sea due to the difficult market situation in the steel industry one of the two pusher systems was exceptionally kept at port in december supramax vessels operated in the canadian arctic and afterwards in international traffic the results of these vessels were poor reducing the shipping company s relative profitability general international dry bulk freight rates decreased considerably in the largest vessel categories towards the end of the review period esl shipping s operations in the baltic sea and the north sea are primarily based on long term customer agreements and established customer relationships as contractual transportation volumes were significantly lower than what was previously estimated for the quarter the shipping company s vessels were forced to operate more than expected in weaker spot markets in the larger vessel category of more than 10 000 dwt operations succeeded fairly well considering the low volumes during the quarter the operating profit level was also as expected in the smaller vessel category of less than 10 000 dwt loading and unloading operations for large ocean liners at sea were much busier during the quarter than during the comparative period the energy efficiency of the new lng fueled vessels improved the operating profit during the final quarter together with the good results of atob c which developed positively from the comparative period and meet the expectations set for the business acquisition the ending customer agreements of atob c were renewed and contract traffic was expanded particularly in industrial markets in sweden in the vessel categories of atob c raw material and product transportation volumes in the forest industry were as planned during the fourth quarter raw mineral and fertilizer transportation volumes developed positively from the comparative period in the smaller vessel category balance improved in contract traffic the cranes of the new lng fueled vessels have operated normally the deployment of crane automation has been delayed significantly due to previous extensive warranty repairs in 2019 esl shipping purchased m s alppila in accordance with the terms and conditions of the leasing agreement signed in 2011 the transfer of the vessel under esl shipping s ownership improves the company s profitability the net sales of esl shipping in january december increased from the previous year by 46 to eur 175 0 120 1 million primarily as a result of the acquisition of atob c the weak first half of the year and the difficult market climate in the steel industry during the last part of the year reduced the operating profit by 3 to eur 14 6 15 1 million in 2019 the cargo volume carried by esl shipping amounted to 15 9 13 4 million tonnes esl shipping has taken steps to restructure its swedish shipping companies into a single company as a result the operations of atob c switched to the swedish tonnage tax system from the beginning of 2020 outlook for esl shipping for 2020 the global market prices of dry bulk cargo at the beginning of 2020 were as low as at the beginning of the comparative period stricter global sulfur regulations on ship fuels entered into force at the beginning of the year potentially leading to higher fluctuations in price levels and occasional shortages in the availability of fuel that is compliant with the new regulations however vessels equipped with a sulfur scrubber can continue to use high sulfur fuel the final determination of differences in prices of different fuels may have a particular impact on the competitiveness and profitability of the shipping company s supramax vessels which primarily operate over longer distances high fluctuations in prices may have a short term impact on profitability even though the fuel price risk is controlled profitability through fuel clauses in transportation agreements all esl shipping s vessels are fueled by environmentally friendly low sulfur oil or nearly sulfur free liquefied natural gas which significantly reduces carbon dioxide emissions economic growth is slow in the shipping company s primary market areas however the general outlook for industrial sectors important to esl shipping has brightened from the situation at the end of last year and previous restrictions in industrial production have been dissolved most of the shipping company s transportation capacity has been secured in the baltic sea and northern europe through long term agreements production in the steel industry in northern europe is expected to settle at a satisfactory level and estimated transportation volume for 2020 is higher than the realized volume of 2019 the general transportation volume estimates of contractual partners are at a satisfactory level in the most important customer segments transportation volumes in the energy industry will most likely decrease as a result of the exceptionally warm weather in northern europe the transportation of iron pellets from russia to central europe via finland using esl shipping s vessels has restarted markets continue to show signs of general uncertainty in demand and price levels however positive or negative measures directed at international free trade and increasing political risks have an impact on global material flows the general development of cargo markets in 2020 will have the highest impact on the financial performance of the shipping company s largest supramax vessels the cargo volumes of large vessels returned to a historically low level at the beginning of 2020 during spring finland may face large scale strikes that may have a significant impact on the operations of esl shipping s customer companies and their supply chains these potential strikes may also affect the availability of ship fuels in finland demand for loading and unloading operations for large ocean liners at sea a segment important to the shipping company is expected to remain at least satisfactory contractual transportation volumes in the shipping company s smaller vessel category are expected to be good and contractual coverage is expected to be better than in the previous year in the smaller vessel category the price level of renewed and new time chartering agreements is lower than last year overall which improves the shipping company s profitability esl shipping is actively investigating different opportunities to have a broader presence in growing markets in the russian arctic the shipping company will also continue its development activities to offer the most effective and environmentally friendliest future transportation solutions in the markets as well as in the smaller vessel category of atob c at the same time esl shipping is investigating opportunities to use different new solutions related to the ownership and financing of vessels used broadly in international shipping company operations to speed up its operational development esl shipping has improved the efficiency of its operations by deploying a new erp system the new system covers all vessel operations and combines cargo operations in finland and sweden into a single data system the shipping company will strengthen its sales resources to reach its strategic goals and has appointed a new commercial director who will take over the post at the beginning of march in 2020 three larger vessel units will be docked as planned during the second quarter and one of the two pusher systems will be docked completely during the third quarter at least two smaller vessels will be docked during the third quarter during these scheduled dockages new ballast water treatment systems that meet new environmental regulations will be installed in the vessels the pusher unit kept at port returned to

market position of leipurin is expected to remain strong in the industrial baking sector in finland russia and the baltic region continuously improved customer experiences effective operating practices growth projects in eastern markets increasing baker s story operations and returning the machinery business back to a profit making track are focus points in operations in 2020 in russia consumer confidence is low and international sanctions and their possible increase have added to the uncertainties regarding the development of the country s economy the development of local

are expected to maintain their current equipment investment level in finland in the baltic countries equipment investments are expected to decrease in the near future no significant changes are expected in investment levels in russia in leipurin s own machine production sales will be expanded to new export markets and the efficiency of operations will be improved by further modifying processes and operating practices the changes in principals taken place in principal machinery operations during 2019 are expected to have a negative impact on principal machinery operations especially in russia in machinery operations the high fluctuation in net sales and profitability will continue due to the nature of the operations at the end of the review period the order book was reasonable for the first half of 2020 partly as a result of the postponement of significant machine deliveries planned for the final quarter of 2019 in russia to the second quarter of 2020 the cost efficiency of leipurin s own machine production has been improved and focusing more on the product range for the food industry s chilling and freezing solutions will significantly increase the market

group s ceo is in charge of the management of aspo s sustainability the ceo reports to the company s board of directors in accordance with the risk management policy aspo s code of conduct lays down a shared set of rules for sustainable operations in all the group s subsidiaries aspo s board of directors approved the revised code of conduct in december 2019 since 2018 aspo has been a member of the un s global compact initiative now the group s operations are steered by the ten global compact principles related to human rights working life principles the environment and the prevention of corruption in 2019 aspo also became a member of finnish business society fibs and aims to actively develop its sustainability at a group and subsidiary level aspo acts as a good corporate citizen in all of its operating countries being a good corporate citizen is part of social responsibility and means for example that aspo always pays its taxes in the country in which it has made its profit aspo treats its employees and stakeholders in a just and equal manner in all countries where it operates key aspects of corporate responsibility in the fields in which the businesses aspo owns operate are reductions in energy consumption and the volume of waste the wellbeing of employees and safe working conditions equality and good governance aspo s sustainability report will be included in aspo s year 2019 publication risks and risk management decreases in global trade as a result of decelerated growth in the global economy and increased uncertainties in economic development have reduced exports and the investment outlook the decrease in global purchasing manager indices has stopped while the situation continues to deteriorate in key production countries in the eu such as germany these changes have affected industrial production in the eurozone and can be seen in increased risks in aspo s market areas even though finnish exports are showing signs of growth particularly in terms of exports outside the eu despite growing uncertainties economic growth has continued in the eurozone albeit slowly however the continuous while decelerating increase in employment and continuously rising salaries support economic stability in the eurozone political tension and resulting risks have increased but they are not expected to have any impact on aspo s business operations in the short term the trade war between the usa and china including the resulting import duties which limit international free trade and has already decelerated economic growth in china have not directly affected aspo s operations aspo does not have any business operations that are or would also be affected directly by brexit or its implementation but there may be an indirect impact through the principals or customers of aspo s businesses following the financial crisis the global economy has grown simultaneously in all aspo s market areas albeit at different rates in different areas while however being largely slow in speed in the eurozone growth has slowed down due to growing political tension related to trade in addition brexit increases uncertainty the russian gdp increased by roughly 1 and industrial production by approximately 2 meaning that both have increased more slowly as a result of decelerated growth in the global economy the russian ruble has become stronger partly as a result of elevated oil prices russia s foreign exchange reserves and oil assets have increased as the economy has returned to normal in logistics chains the dry bulk freight rates of sea transportation increased steeply during the first half only to turn into a decline at the beginning of september ending up at the april level at the end of the year financial risks in all aspo s businesses are slowly increasing even though the markets are relatively stable however any unexpected changes in international politics and trade policies combined with rapid changes in exchange rates or commodities markets may have an impact on demand for and competitiveness of the products of aspo s businesses in russia increased real salaries and decelerated inflation supported increases in private consumption as there have been no structural economic reforms in russia economic growth is only expected to be moderate primarily resulting from government steered investment projects the price of oil has a significant impact on the russian economy strategic risks political and financial risks have grown globally which may have a rapid impact on aspo s operating environment free trade has already decreased and these changes may also have an impact in the long term the economic and political situation in aspo s market areas may have made it more difficult to make structural changes as part of aspo s strategy the situation may continue unchanged but as the economic and political pressure varies it may change rapidly an unfavorable turn in the situation may lead to aspo being unable to achieve its financial targets in the time it has set for it the russian economy has stabilized and inflation has decelerated while economic growth is slow the long term deterioration in consumption demand has affected trade in general and after a brief upswing the natural increase in purchasing power fluctuated strengthening towards the end of the review period no signs of weakening have been seen in the financial markets and payment transactions of russia but they involve risks that are reflected for example in the russian banking sector the ukrainian economy is still in a weak state and the macroeconomy is showing signs of weakening in nearly all sectors apart from construction inflation has slowed down but is still relatively high the increase in purchasing power combined with a favorable development in salaries has increased consumption demand the central bank s reference rate is still high although it was lowered considerably at the end of the year the promotion of local production has further increased the volume of raw materials and items produced in russia in industrial production despite the decrease in quality this may further reduce the position of imported raw materials in the value chain and lower the margin level but correspondingly an increase in import volumes may increase demand for foreign raw materials and reduce related risks for aspo economic sanctions their increase or other obstacles arising from the economic or political situation in russia may in part reduce transportation volumes originating from russia and the demand for unloading services for large ocean liners at sea protectionist actions may decrease sea transportation in the russian arctic if russia sets stricter regulations on internal transportation for example regarding the transportation of energy products in finland and the rest of europe social pressures to reduce the use of fossil energy sources in energy production are constantly increasing which has already reduced coal transport volumes and will continue to reduce them in the future correspondingly the transport volumes of replacement energy products will increase due to this change it is difficult to estimate future transportation volumes fluctuations in international freight indices their extended low level and the previous global increase in the number of vessels particularly in large size categories have increased uncertainty over the long term profitability of shipping companies strategic risks may be caused by the deterioration of the global economic situation the political atmosphere protectionism and the outlook and production choices of industrial customers decisions regarding energy production structures affected by environmental policy and other political choices cause changes in industry and energy production that will decrease the use of fossil fuels and increase the use of alternative forms of energy the flow of goods in the baltic sea may change as a result of steel production cost structures changes in the customer structure such as centralization or other reasons lower demand for metal products in global markets may cause changes in demand for sea freights in the future as well these changes may have negative consequences on operations as the need for transportation decreases but they can also be seen as significant opportunities as a result of low cargo prices in international shipping competition over cargoes may also become fiercer in the baltic sea mild ice free winters may also increase competition esl shipping received two new low emission vessels with better fuel economy for this region and customer base these will also be able to operate in ice conditions the shipping company also completed an acquisition in 2018 that significantly improved its competitiveness strategic risks are influenced by long term changes in cargo prices the building of new vessels and the removal of others from the markets investment trends and changes in trade structures especially in western markets in eastern markets risks are increased by such factors as political instability social structures or the lack of reaction to the difficulties encountered by business operations the accumulation and discharge of investments may cause long term changes in the competitive situation and customer behavior trade between eastern and western markets may suffer from restrictions on free trade as a result of which there may be a decrease in the sales of goods and services rapid changes in economic structures may cause risks due to changes in the customer or principal structure or technologies and due to unused opportunities that require a quick response changes in demand as a result of various megatrends may cause changes in the product and service ranges of aspo s subsidiaries due to which it may be difficult to replace their current products disruptive changes may be very rapid aspo s strategic risks are evened out by the distribution of business operations over three segments its engagement in business operations in a broad geographical area and its ability to react quickly to changing situations in addition to western markets aspo operates in areas where economic trends or the political atmosphere may turn rapidly positive or negative which could significantly change the prevailing operating conditions operational risks economic uncertainty in aspo s operating environment increased during the review period from the comparative period as a result operational risks have also increased these include risks related to supply chains goods and services and persons selections made by principals regarding their distribution networks may have a positive or negative impact on the representation of aspo s subsidiaries and therefore on their financial results the threat of different kinds of misuse from outside the group has increased further as a result of the development and increased activity of electronic media for a long time the focus of aspo s growth has been on emerging market areas where risks decelerating growth are affected by factors such as exchange rate fluctuations and interest rates the level of and changes in the global market prices of raw materials industrial and commercial investments customer liquidity changes in legislation and import regulations and inactivity bias or corruption among public authorities economic growth and alternatively any decrease in production may have an impact on demand for raw materials political instability makes commercial activities more difficult and if the situation prolongs it may also decelerate the growth of aspo s businesses consumer behavior and confidence are also reflected in risks associated with b to b customers and their risk levels the growth opportunities presented by emerging markets are encouraging interest among competitors in starting or expanding business operations in these areas the challenging emerging markets and their escalated situations have also caused competitors to withdraw from these markets which has created new potential for aspo s businesses and has increased their market shares hedging against exchange rate changes is not possible in all conditions or in particular at all times changes in exchange rates may reduce profit and equity on the balance sheet as a result of translation differences then again changes in exchange rates may also strengthen results and the balance sheet as changes in credit loss risks are diversified across businesses and customers aspo s businesses have not been subjected to any significant credit losses related to their customers even though credit loss risks have increased and provisions are made for them in accordance with principles of ifrs 9 standard the technical products or applications deployed by aspo s businesses may break or malfunction due to which the increase in profit based on these products or applications may slow down or be delayed sales margins may be reduced and financial claims related to deliveries may emerge if aspo s products are not suited for the customers production processes or do not have the correct technical properties operational risks have also increased as a result of cybercrime malware and the increased number of fraud attempts if realized these risks may mean financial losses for aspo aspo has appropriate information security and internal training arrangements but individual cases may occur due to the decentralized structure of operations any deviations in internal processes may result in losses for example in the form of taxes or official fees the quantity and probability of the group s loss risks are regularly assessed bidding processes are arranged for general insurance policies and the amounts insured are regularly updated the amounts insured are sufficient in view of the scope of aspo s operations but insurance companies may restrict the validity of insurance policies as a result of risks increasing for various reasons such as in conflict areas internal control and risk management one of the responsibilities of aspo s audit committee is to monitor the efficiency of the group s internal control internal audits and risk management systems the audit committee monitors the risk management process and instructs necessary measures to prevent strategic risks in particular in accordance with the internal control principles approved by the board of directors risk management is part of aspo s internal control and its task is to ensure the implementation of the group s strategy development of financial results shareholder value dividend payment ability and continuity in business operations the operational management of each business is responsible for risk management the management is responsible for specifying sufficient measures and their implementation and for monitoring and ensuring that the measures are implemented as part of day to day operational management aspo s cfo who reports to the group ceo is in charge of risk management aspo group s financing and financial risk management are centralized in the parent company in accordance with the treasury policy approved by the board of directors a more detailed account of the risk management policy and the most significant risks has been published on the company s website more detailed

commitments 2019 consists mainly of commitments relating to temporary maritime personnel of time chartered vessels in 2018 these commitments were reported as part of operating lease commitments the change in presentation is due to the adoption of ifrs 16 leases standard accounting principles aspo plc s financial statement release has been prepared in accordance with the principles of ias 34 interim financial reporting as of january 1 2019 aspo applies certain new or amended ifrs standards and ifric interpretations as described in the 2018 consolidated financial statements in other respects the same accounting principles have been applied as in the consolidated financial statements of december 31 2018 the information in this report is unaudited aspo plc applies the guidance on alternative key figures issued by the european securities and market authority esma in addition to ifrs figures the company releases other commonly used key figures which are mainly derived from the statement of comprehensive income and balance sheet according to the management key figures clarify the view drawn by the statement of comprehensive income and balance sheet of aspo s financial performance and financial position the calculation principles of key figures are explained on page 48 of the aspo s year 2018 publication adoption of new or amended standards the group has applied the ifrs 16 leases standard starting from january 1 2019 under ifrs 16 all leases are recognized on the lessee s balance sheet and the classification between operating and finance leases according to ias 17 is no longer valid in accordance with the new standard all assets related to lease agreements right of use assets and future lease payment obligations lease liabilities are recognized on the balance sheet the only exceptions are short term leases and leases for which the underlying asset is of a low value the accounting treatment for lessors remains largely in line with ias 17 aspo group acts mainly as a lessee the group has customary business related leases such as contracts related to office and warehouse premises as well as transportation vehicles and cars part of the office technology is also leased transition aspo has chosen a simplified method of transition to ifrs 16 aspo recognized on the opening balance sheet of january 1 2019 the right of use assets which consisted of the lease liabilities and prepayments related to these leases recognized on the balance sheet at the time of transition the liabilities and assets of contracts previously classified as finance leases under ias 17 were included at the time of transition on january 1 2019 in the lease liabilities and right of use assets in accordance with ifrs 16 financial leases that were subject to exemptions as short term or low value or related to intangible assets were derecognized and the difference was recognized in equity the difference recognized in equity was not material aspo applied the following practical expedients in the adoption of ifrs 16 leases with a lease term less than 12 months remaining at the date of transition on january 1 2019 were accounted for as short term leases and not recognized on the balance sheet the selection was made by class of underlying asset and was applied to all other classes except cars which were recognized on the balance sheet even if their remaining lease term would have been less than 12 months at the time of transition the lease liability and the right of use asset were not recognized on the balance sheet in respect of leases relating to low value assets aspo uses a threshold of eur 5 000 for low value assets the leasing expenses of the two above mentioned practical expedients are recognized in other operating expenses on a straight line basis over the lease term lease agreements with reasonably similar characteristics were subject to one predetermined discount rate the criteria used to determine the discount rate were the class of underlying asset the geographic location the currency the maturity of the risk free interest rate and the lessee s credit risk premium at the time of the transition the weighted average of interest on incremental borrowing was 2 33 in case of leases in which the lease term included extension options or termination options current knowledge was used in the determination of the lease term the initial direct costs were not included in the right of use asset at the time of transition in january 1 2019 management judgements aspo complies with ifrs 16 guidance for determining the lease term in case of lease agreements where the lease term is defined to be valid until further notice the expected lease term is based on management judgement the financial impact of the sanctions included in the leases such as those related to the early termination of the contract has also been taken into account in determining the expected lease term for the contracts with a lease term defined to be valid until further notice the most significant impact relates to vessels leased if a vessel is leased for approximately a year the lease term used to calculate the lease liability is 13 months ongoing month the next 12 months as a significant part of the fleet is leased it is likely that at the end of the lease term the same or a similar vessel will be leased again in case this does not apply the agreement will be treated as a fixed term lease contract the procedure has been designed to give investors a better understanding of the obligations associated with the lease liability and the significance of the right of use asset on the balance sheet according to the standard guidance the option to extend or terminate the lease is taken into account in determining the lease term the period covered by an option to extend the lease is included into the lease term if it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised and and correspondingly if it is reasonably certain that the option to terminate the lease is not exercised the remaining period is included in the lease term when the agreement includes a lease component and a non lease component aspo separates the non lease components such as maintenance services or crew based on either the stand alone prices given in the lease agreement or by using estimates impact of the adoption of ifrs 16 the adoption of the standard has a significant impact on the balance sheet of aspo group and key figures derived from it as well as the structure of the income statement and cash flow statement the group s interest bearing liabilities and non current assets recognized on the balance sheet according to the standard are significantly higher than when applying ias 17 with regard to key figures the adoption has the most significant impact on gearing which increased by approximately 30 percentage points expenses previously recognized as leases in the statement of comprehensive income are reversed depreciation expense is recognized from right of use asset items and interest included in leases is recognized in financial expenses in the cash flow statement the transfer of payments of lease liabilities to cash flows from financing activities increases cash flows from operating activities while the total cash flows remain unchanged the impact of the adoption of ifrs 16 on aspo group s opening balance sheet on january 1 2019 is presented in the table below the value of the right of use asset items recognized on the opening balance sheet was approximately eur 38 5 million the value of leases paid in advance was approximately eur 0 9 million and the amount of lease liabilities was approximately eur 37 6 million the expedients permitted by the standard regarding intangible assets and items of a low value reduced the number of financial leasing items recognized in accordance with ias 17 by eur 1 2 million non current lease liabilities accounted for eur 10 4 million and current lease liabilities made up eur 27 2 million of the total lease liabilities on the opening balance sheet impact of the adoption of ifrs 16 standard on the opening balance sheet dec 31 2018 addition of right of use assets

the euro dollar exchange rate has slumped to its lowest level against the us dollar in thirty three months since the middle of 2017 largely owing to downside concerns for eurozone growth germany and the region as a whole narrowly avoided a q4 fall in gdp but activity seemingly stalled in december say currency analysts at lloyds on friday february 14 as january business surveys pointed to only a modest improvement the coming week s february ifo survey tue and eurozone pmis fri will be watched for signs of an uptick however we think that modest declines in both the manufacturing and services pmis are more likely everyone wants to know how much further the euro can fall says fx analyst kathy lien on thursday february 14 not only has it been in a downtrend since the beginning of the month but it lost value 8 out of the last 9 trading days and on the one day that it rallied the increase was modest at best why has the euro to us dollar exchange rate fallen so low and how far can the euro fall from here eur usd slide to 33 months low risks president trump retaliation euro exchange rate sentiment will remain negative in the short term given persistent growth concerns and appetite for carry trades funded through the currency if short positions become over extended there will be the risk of a sharp corrective reversal and aggressive us rhetoric but an improved euro zone outlook will be needed to secure a sustained recovery euro under sustained pressure the euro x rates have come under sustained pressure during february 2020 with significant losses against major currencies and losses have accelerated over the past few days eur usd dipped below 2019 lows of 1 0880 which triggered further selling pressure to the weakest level since may 2017 at 1 0835 advertisement eur gbp declining to 8 week lows near 0 8300 and gbp eur breaking above the key 1 2000 level eur chf has declined to 4 year lows near 1 06 with eur jpy below 120 00 image euro to dollar exchange rate chart here are 9 reasons behind this decline ecb will maintain zero interest rates the ecb main refi rate was cut to 0 0 in march 2016 and has therefore now been held at this level for close to four years making it impossible to justify it as a temporary move in september 2019 the central bank cut the deposit rate further to 0 50 from 0 40 and also re introduced the quantitative easing programme with the bank buying eur20bn of government bonds every month in the latest forward guidance the bank remains committed to keeping rates at least as low as now until inflation projections near the target reported inflation has remained below target and the ecb has expressed further dissatisfaction with trends the ecb has also started a wider review into its inflation target and monetary policy there are some expectations that the bank will effectively increase its inflation target to 2 from the current target of below but close to 2 any upward shift in the target would increase pressure for the bank to remain extremely low interest rates market expectations of euro zone inflation have declined to 2 month lows reinforcing expectations that further easing could be sanctioned and further undermining support the euro has been taught a lesson since the ecb s last meeting while the market s hopes for a sustained recovery of the euro area economy appear to be waning says marc andré fongern head of fx research keynote speaker at maf global forex this may be interpreted as a wake up call for the european central bank to reconsider its monetary policy course it might indeed turn out to be a tightrope act for the ecb to envisage another rate cut continues fongern fiscal stimulus can be expected to be preferred over an even looser monetary policy and precisely this would be the glimmer of hope for the euro global central banks resist easing the latest us economic data has been generally favourable with solid gains in employment and a headline 225 000 increase in non farm payrolls for january the federal reserve continues to indicate that no change in interest rates is likely in the short term with the fed funds rate at 1 75 markets are still expecting a further cut in rates before the end of 2020 but yield spreads will remain against the euro other global central banks have been slightly more optimistic over the outlook the reserve bank of new zealand for example left interest rates unchanged at 1 00 following the latest meeting and dropped the easing bias if other central banks are more optimistic relative selling will tend to weaken the euro given the very loose ecb policy euro as a global funding currency in global currency trading one currency has to be bought against another one a popular trading strategy is to buy currencies with a high yield and sell or fund the deal through ones with low yields this process earns a net premium even if there is no capital appreciation and is known as a carry trade with euro interest rates at 0 0 the currency is vulnerable as a global funding trade institutions and hedge funds will sell the euro and buy a higher yield currency such as the us dollar and canadian dollar the euro also tends to be sold against higher yielding emerging market currencies market conditions favour carry trades current market conditions are attractive for carry trades with most global equity markets trading at record highs despite fears surrounding the coronavirus the gains in global equities have boosted risk appetite and encouraged carry trades very low interest rates globally have also increased pressure for institutions to boost yields these pressures encourage carry trades to boost returns the recent euro decline will boost net returns on existing short positions and tend to reinforce selling pressure on the currency currency volatility at record lows another important element in currency trading is volatility the yields from carry trades are clearly attractive but earnings can easily be wiped out by capital losses if the funding currency strengthens in periods of high volatility there will be much greater caution over engaging in carry trades given the risk of capital losses on sharp currency moves when volatility is low however the potential for carry trades will increase image currency volatility index there has been a sustained decline in volatility across major currencies over the past few years indeed the latest data has registered a record low for eur usd volatility despite stresses from the us china trade war underlying market conditions are therefore favourable for carry trades further concerns over german industry after a torrid 2019 german business confidence registered a recovery in early 2020 amid hopes that the downturn was coming to an end especially with a truce in the us china trade war overall confidence has however dipped again due to china s coronavirus aka covid 19 there are still major uncertainties over developments within china but it is clear that there will be a sharp dip in domestic activity for the first quarter of 2020 retail activity will tend to be confined to basic items and purchases of high value goods will inevitably decline sharply there will therefore be a renewed decline in high end consumer goods which will undermine sectors such as the german car industry and french luxury goods producers the euro continues to struggle said neil wilson chief markets analyst at markets com on thursday the disruption to supply chains from the coronavirus could hardly come at a worse time he said overall confidence in the german and euro zone economy has therefore weakened again the latest data recorded a sharp german industrial production decline for december and a sharp drop in italian industrial production economic surprises have been negative for the euro area at the same time as us data has improved image citi economic surprise indices europe and germany in particular have very strong trade linkages to asian markets and specifically with china said mazen issa senior fx strategist at td securities in new york coming into the year expectations were for a moderate growth rebound while it did seem reasonable at the time the disruptions are going to delay that narrative in the short term expectations of us relative out performance will continue us anger will increase concerns over trade policies will also remain an important factor following the us china trade truce there are increased fears that the us administration will target the eu for tariffs further damaging the euro zone outlook us president trump has already protested strongly against the eu for maintaining under valued currencies and looking to secure an unfair competitive advantage if the euro continues to weaken us protests will increase with the risk of direct action to prevent further weakness the eu could face trade tariffs if the euro continues to weaken which paradoxically from the us point of view would risk further currency losses euro not acting as a safe haven given that global economic concerns have been concentrated around trade policies and chinese demand the euro has not been able to generate significant defensive demand the euro zone economy remains more sensitive to trade and the us economy and trade stresses therefore tend to undermine the euro it is telling that the euro has declined sharply against the swiss franc over the past few weeks the swiss franc remains a key global defensive asset and the sharp euro slide illustrates that the single currency is not being seen as a safe haven asset at this time brexit concerns also damaging the main focus on brexit tends to be on the uk impact but there will also be an important impact on the eu economy especially the euro zone formal talks between the uk and eu over the future relationship are due to start at the beginning of march the rhetoric from both sides has inevitably been tough as governments and negotiating teams look to secure a strategic advantage serious tensions over reaching a deal would increase concerns over the euro zone manufacturing sector domestic german politics have also tended to undermine the euro with no clear succession plans for german chancellor merkel marshall gittler head of investment research at bd swiss commented that the political problems in germany may also be weighing on the currency german chancellor merkel s heir apparent annegret kramp karrenbauer resigned on monday as the chair of merkel s cdu party leaving the leadership of the ruling coalition in europe s leading economy in disarray the problem is not only who will succeed merkel but also whether the ruling coalition will even remain in power after the next federal elections which are scheduled for september 2021 but could be called earlier there is an important risk that euro zone countries will fragment if there is no strong leadership from germany is the euro exchange rate undervalued in pure purchasing power terms the euro exchange rate does appear to be significantly undervalued with a fair value of around 1 3000 according to oecd estimates there has however been deterioration in the euro terms of trade and estimates of real exchange rates suggested that the euro is not significantly undervalued a recent survey from ing suggested fair value for eur usd rate is around 1 10 according to ing importantly eur usd no longer screens as undervalued based on our medium term beer valuation framework this is a meaningful change from the period of 2015 17 when at that time eur usd around 1 10 screened as heavily cheap what has changed is the eur usd fair value which has deteriorated by around 7 since 2017 largely due to the terms of trade dynamics the lack of undervaluation also limits the scope for any meaningful eur usd upside such as the one observed in 2017 what could reverse the trend it should be noted that the euro zone runs a substantial current account surplus of close to 2 5 of gdp if therefore there are no net capital outflows from the euro area the currency will tend to appreciate any increase in overall market volatility could also trigger a sharp reversal in carry trades and a liquidation of short euro positions if the short euro trade becomes over crowded there would also be the potential for a sharp euro gains as stop loss euro buying intensifies us anger could trigger direct treasury intervention to weaken the dollar which would trigger a sharp reversal in eur usd from a longer term perspective evidence of a meaningful recovery in the euro zone economy would be needed to trigger a shift in sentiment any concerted move to expand fiscal policy would also be an important positive factor kathy lien s take on the 6 reasons for the euro s decline fx analyst at bk asset management kathy lien wrote on thursday february 14 we can identify at least six reasons for eur usd s decline and they mostly have to do with divergence between the ez and us economies ecb defends the need for low rates and teases the possibility of more stimulus whereas the fed is comfortable maintain steady policy eurozone data taken a turn for the worse with ez industrial production tumbling sharply concerns that friday s ge and ez q4 growth will be weak while us retail sales could be strong the ez economy is more manufacturing driven and therefore more vulnerable to chinese slowdown than the us low interest rates makes euro attractive funding currency whereas dollar catches safe haven bid as coronavirus intensifies live eur exchange rates today updated 14 02 2020 try 6 5563786845 0 1 chf 1

tel aviv israel feb 13 2020 prnewswire icl nyse icl tase icl a leading global specialty minerals and chemicals company today reported its unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended december 31 2019 successfully completed the planned potash capacity upgrade of the dead sea facilities which reduced production during q4 2019 lower production the absence of a potash supply contract to china and weak commodity markets resulted in a significant impact on results quarterly sales of 1 1 billion compared to 1 4 billion in q4 2018 led to a decrease in annual sales from 5 6 billion in 2018 to 5 3 billion in 2019 operating income and adjusted operating income of 88 million in q4 2019 compared to operating income and adjusted operating income of 166 and of 214 million respectively in q4 2018 2019 operating income of 756 million compared to 1 519 million in 2018 which also included a capital gain of 841 million from divestments adjusted operating income of 760 million in 2019 surpassed the 753 million recorded in 2018 value of icl s specialty businesses reflected in the stability of 2019 adjusted operating income and in a 3 growth in adjusted ebitda to approximately 1 2 billion continued strong cash generation in q4 2019 resulted in an annual increase of 60 in operating cash flow to 992 million extended existing policy of returning up to 50 of adjusted net income to shareholders through dividends dividends for 2019 amounted to approximately 0 18 per share similar to 2018 the results for the fourth quarter of 2019 were significantly impacted by the planned shutdown and upgrade of icl s facilities at the dead sea which is expected to increase annual potash production by approximately 5 the dead sea facilities upgrade the nearly one month shutdown resulted in a significant decrease in potash production and also impacted bromine operations icl s results were also negatively impacted by the continued delay in the signing of a potash supply agreement in china and the weak commodity fertilizer market environment despite these factors icl s operating cash flow and adjusted ebitda increased in 2019 due to icl s strategic focus on value added specialties which have favorable pricing dynamics relative to commodity products and on cost controls and operating efficiencies icl s president ceo raviv zoller stated icl achieved several important milestones in 2019 the most recent of which was the upgrade of our dead sea facilities while icl s results for the fourth quarter were impacted by disruptions associated with the upgrade a weak environment for commodity fertilizers and the unfavorable impact of exchange rates we believe that the actions we have taken throughout 2019 have significantly strengthened icl s position and prospects to create value for our shareholders for years to come zoller continued in addition to upgrading our capacity in the dead sea we also completed the construction of our new food grade phosphoric acid plant in china that will allow us to shift from commodity phosphates to specialty products we also introduced breakthrough solutions for plant based meat alternatives and executed strategic long term agreements with bromine compounds customers which further demonstrates our ability to execute on our specialty focused growth strategy icl s business mix continues to strengthen as we increase our focus on developing innovative products novel materials and cost effective processes that will create competitive advantages for icl zoller concluded of all of the actions that icl has taken i am particularly proud of our initiatives focused on sustainable development goals and the recognitions we have received based on the rising quality of our work environment

income non gaap quantity the negative impact on operating income was primarily related to lower production and sales volumes of potash mainly as a result of the dead sea facilities upgrade a lack of shipments to china due to the delay in the signing of new supply contracts and weak market conditions sales volumes of bromine based flame retardants and industrial solutions mainly elemental bromine also decreased as the dead sea facilities upgrade impacted bromine production and its availability for the production of bromine compounds the pending antidumping claim against icl s magnesium business in the us resulted in lower magnesium production which impacted bromine production due to lower chlorine availability in addition weak commodity market conditions led to lower sales volumes of phosphate fertilizers price the negative impact on operating income was primarily related to a 18 decrease in the average realized price per tonne of potash compared to the same quarter last year and a decrease in phosphate commodities prices this decrease was partly offset by an increase in the selling prices of bromine based industrial solutions bromine based flame retardants and specialty phosphates exchange rates the negative impact on operating income was primarily related to the appreciation of the average exchange rate of the shekel against the dollar which increased operational costs in dollar terms in addition the depreciation of the euro against the dollar decreased revenues more than it contributed to operational cost saving raw materials the positive impact of raw materials prices on operating income was primarily related to lower prices of sulphur consumed during the quarter partly offset by higher costs of acids acquired from external sources financing expenses net net financing expenses in the fourth quarter of 2019 amounted to 25 million compared to 66 million in the same quarter last year financing expenses were primarily impacted by three factors a decrease of 42 million resulting from profit recorded this quarter attributable to hedging transactions and balance sheet revaluation due to the weakening of the dollar against the shekel versus losses recorded in the same quarter last year due to the strengthening of the dollar against the shekel interest expenses of 7 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018 related to past royalties an increase of 11 million in employee benefits and leases ifrs 16 impact on finance expenses attributable to the weakening of the dollar against the shekel at the end of 2019 compared to the strengthening of the dollar against the shekel at the end of last year tax expenses tax expenses in the fourth quarter of 2019 amounted to 15 million reflecting an effective tax rate of about 24 the company recorded a higher tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2019 and in 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 this was mainly due to the impact of shekel dollar exchange rate fluctuations appreciation of the shekel against the dollar during the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to depreciation of the shekel against the dollar during the same quarter last year segment information industrial products the industrial products segment sales and operating income decreased year over year in the fourth quarter of 2019 due to lower bromine production and sales volumes mainly as a result of the dead sea facilities upgrade and the pending magnesium antidumping claim which led to a temporary reduction in the availability of chlorine a major raw material for bromine production however clear brine fluids sales increased in the fourth quarter of 2019 driven by higher activity in the north sea leading to a record year for icl s clear brine fluids business the segment s value oriented approach in addition to resource depletion and environmental pressure in china led to a 65 million contribution from higher prices which along with record sales of clear brine fluids led to a record operating income and profit margin for the segment in 2019 a number of significant strategic milestones were also achieved in 2019 including the signing of long term agreements with major customers and the implementation of innovative approaches for the development of new bromine applications industrial products accounted for 26 of the company s sales and 68 of adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 22 of sales and 33 of adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter of 2018 significant highlights and business environment during the fourth quarter of 2019 market prices of elemental bromine in china remained stable compared to the third quarter of 2019 and were lower compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 due to lower production of brominated flame retardants in china which resulted in lower domestic demand for elemental bromine the decrease in the production of brominated flame retardants was caused by environmental related regulatory pressure which together with depletion in chinese bromine resources led to a shift in the production of flame retardants from china to producers in the western hemisphere icl s sales prices of elemental bromine remained stable compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 remained stable compared to the third quarter of 2019 and were lower compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 due to lower production of brominated flame retardants in which resulted in lower domestic demand for elemental bromine the decrease in the production of brominated flame retardants was caused by environmental related regulatory pressure which together with depletion in chinese bromine resources led to a shift in the production of flame retardants from to producers in the western hemisphere icl s sales prices of elemental bromine remained stable compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 global demand for flame retardants remained stable and following the usual seasonal decrease in the fourth quarter of 2019 shipments returned to normal levels in early 2020 icl concluded annual supply agreements for 2020 with moderate price increases during the fourth quarter of 2019 icl s sales volume of elemental bromine in china and of bromine flame retardants decreased compared to same period last year mainly as a result of the dead sea facilities upgrade which negatively impacted elemental bromine production and its availability for the production of icl s flame retardants elemental bromine production was also negatively impacted by the pending magnesium antidumping claim which forced the magnesium business to reduce production resulting in lower availability of chlorine which is a necessary raw material for bromine production and of bromine flame retardants decreased compared to same period last year mainly as a result of the dead sea facilities upgrade which negatively impacted elemental bromine production and its availability for the production of icl s flame retardants elemental bromine production was also negatively impacted by the pending magnesium antidumping claim which forced the magnesium business to reduce production resulting in lower availability of chlorine which is a necessary raw material for bromine production clear brine fluids sales increased in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter last year driven by higher activity in the north sea and higher prices phosphorus based flame retardants sales and operating income for the fourth quarter of 2019 decreased slightly compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 due to lower sales volumes as a result of increased chinese competition partly offset by higher prices the annual operating income of phosphorus based flame retardants increased significantly compared to 2018 mainly due to the continuing implementation of icl s value over volume strategy sales of specialty minerals increased slightly in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 due to higher prices mgcl sales for de icing and de dusting reached record levels in 2019 following a capacity expansion results of operations 10 12 2019 10 12 2018 1 12 2019 1 12 2018 millions millions millions

impact on the segment s operating income was primarily related to a decrease in the quantities sold of bromine based industrial solutions mainly elemental bromine and bromine based flame retardants mainly due to the dead sea facilities upgrade as well as weak sales in december price the positive impact on the segment s operating income was primarily related to an increase in the selling prices of bromine based industrial solutions and bromine based flame retardants exchange rates the unfavorable impact on the segment s operating income was primarily related to the appreciation of the average exchange rate of the shekel against the dollar which increased operational costs additionally the depreciation of the average exchange rate of the euro against the dollar decreased the segment s revenue more than it contributed to operational cost saving potash the potash segment s sales decreased by 49 and operating income decreased by 86 in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter last year the decrease was caused by lower potash production and sales volume due to a combination of the impact on production of the dead sea facilities upgrade lack of shipments to china due to the delay in the signing of new supply contracts and weak market conditions lower production also resulted in unfavorable fixed costs absorption which together with lower prices resulted in significant profit margin erosion potash accounted for 24 of icl s sales and 25 of adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 33 of sales and 64 of adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter of 2018 significant highlights and business environment the grain price index increased towards the end of the fourth quarter of 2019 mainly due to a decrease in wheat production

adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 33 of sales and 7 of adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter of 2018 sales of phosphate specialties of 262m in the fourth quarter of 2019 were approximately 2 lower than the fourth quarter of 2018 the decrease was mainly driven by lower demand for dairy proteins in a softening chinese market and the depreciation of the euro and chinese yuan against the dollar adjusting for exchange rate fluctuations revenues of phosphate specialties were almost flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 sales of phosphate commodities amounted to 155 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 approximately 32 lower than the fourth quarter of 2018 the decrease was due to a decrease in sales volume and prices sales volumes of phosphate fertilizers in the fourth quarter of 2019 decreased by 24 to 407 thousand tonnes primarily driven by market conditions in addition results of the yph jv were lower in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the same period last year due to lower sales and production quantities and higher costs mainly maintenance significant highlights and business environment revenues from phosphate salts increased moderately in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter last year driven by higher prices and increased sales volumes of food grade phosphates in north america and europe and phosphoric acid revenues decreased slightly in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the same period last year primarily due to a competitive environment resulting in lower sales volumes in north america revenues in europe were higher due to increased volumes with key accounts sales in south america decreased driven by lower sales volumes primarily due to general market conditions sales in

ended december 31 2019 successfully completed the planned potash capacity upgrade of the dead sea facilities which reduced production during q4 2019 lower production the absence of a potash supply contract to china and weak commodity markets resulted in a significant impact on results quarterly sales of 1 1 billion compared to 1 4 billion in q4 2018 led to a decrease in annual sales from 5 6 billion in 2018 to 5 3 billion in 2019 operating income and adjusted operating income of 88 million in q4 2019 compared to operating income and adjusted operating income of 166 and of 214 million respectively in q4 2018 2019 operating income of 756 million compared to 1 519 million in 2018 which also included a capital gain of 841 million from divestments adjusted operating income of 760 million in 2019 surpassed the 753 million recorded in 2018 value of icl s specialty businesses reflected in the stability of 2019 adjusted operating income and in a 3 growth in adjusted ebitda to approximately 1 2 billion continued strong cash generation in q4 2019 resulted in an annual increase of 60 in operating cash flow to 992 million extended existing policy of returning up to 50 of adjusted net income to shareholders through dividends dividends for 2019 amounted to approximately 0 18 per share similar to 2018 the results for the fourth quarter of 2019 were significantly impacted by the planned shutdown and upgrade of icl s facilities at the dead sea which is expected to increase annual potash production by approximately 5 the dead sea facilities upgrade the nearly one month shutdown resulted in a significant decrease in potash production and also impacted bromine operations icl s results were also negatively impacted by the continued delay in the signing of a potash supply agreement in china and the weak commodity fertilizer market environment despite these factors icl s operating cash flow and adjusted ebitda increased in 2019 due to icl s strategic focus on value added specialties which have favorable pricing dynamics relative to commodity products and on cost controls and operating efficiencies icl s president ceo raviv zoller stated icl achieved several important milestones in 2019 the most recent of which was the upgrade of our dead sea facilities while icl s results for the fourth quarter were impacted by disruptions associated with the upgrade a weak environment for commodity fertilizers and the unfavorable impact of exchange rates we believe that the actions we have taken throughout 2019 have significantly strengthened icl s position and prospects to create value for our shareholders for years to come zoller continued in addition to upgrading our capacity in the dead sea we also completed the construction of our new food grade phosphoric acid plant in china that will allow us to shift from commodity phosphates to specialty products we also introduced breakthrough solutions for plant based meat alternatives and executed strategic long term agreements with bromine compounds customers which further demonstrates our ability to execute on our specialty focused growth strategy icl s business mix continues to strengthen as we increase our focus on developing innovative products novel materials and cost effective processes that will create competitive advantages for icl zoller concluded of all of the actions that icl has taken i am particularly proud of our initiatives focused on sustainable development goals and the recognitions we have received based on the rising quality of our work environment

shipments to china due to the delay in the signing of new supply contracts and weak market conditions sales volumes of bromine based flame retardants and industrial solutions mainly elemental bromine also decreased as the dead sea facilities upgrade impacted bromine production and its availability for the production of bromine compounds the pending antidumping claim against icl s magnesium business in the us resulted in lower magnesium production which impacted bromine production due to lower chlorine availability in addition weak commodity market conditions led to lower sales volumes of phosphate fertilizers price the negative impact on operating income was primarily related to a 18 decrease in the average realized price per tonne of potash compared to the same quarter last year and a decrease in phosphate commodities prices this decrease was partly offset by an increase in the selling prices of bromine based industrial solutions bromine based flame retardants and specialty phosphates exchange rates the negative impact on operating income was primarily related to the appreciation of the average exchange rate of the shekel against the dollar which increased operational costs in dollar terms in addition the depreciation of the euro against the dollar decreased revenues more than it contributed to operational cost saving raw materials the positive impact of raw materials prices on operating income was primarily related to lower prices of sulphur consumed during the quarter partly offset by higher costs of acids acquired from external sources financing expenses net net financing expenses in the fourth quarter of 2019 amounted to 25 million compared to 66 million in the same quarter last year financing expenses were primarily impacted by three factors a decrease of 42 million resulting from profit recorded this quarter attributable to hedging transactions and balance sheet revaluation due to the weakening of the dollar against the shekel versus losses recorded in the same quarter last year due to the strengthening of the dollar against the shekel interest expenses of 7 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018 related to past royalties an increase of 11 million in employee benefits and leases ifrs 16 impact on finance expenses attributable to the weakening of the dollar against the shekel at the end of 2019 compared to the strengthening of the dollar against the shekel at the end of last year tax expenses tax expenses in the fourth quarter of 2019 amounted to 15 million reflecting an effective tax rate of about 24 the company recorded a higher tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2019 and in 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 this was mainly due to the impact of shekel dollar exchange rate fluctuations appreciation of the shekel against the dollar during the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to depreciation of the shekel against the dollar during the same quarter last year segment information industrial products the industrial products segment sales and operating income decreased year over year in the fourth quarter of 2019 due to lower bromine production and sales volumes mainly as a result of the dead sea facilities upgrade and the pending magnesium antidumping claim which led to a temporary reduction in the availability of chlorine a major raw material for bromine production however clear brine fluids sales increased in the fourth quarter of 2019 driven by higher activity in the north sea leading to a record year for icl s clear brine fluids business the segment s value oriented approach in addition to resource depletion and environmental pressure in china led to a 65 million contribution from higher prices which along with record sales of clear brine fluids led to a record operating income and profit margin for the segment in 2019 a number of significant strategic milestones were also achieved in 2019 including the signing of long term agreements with major customers and the implementation of innovative approaches for the development of new bromine applications industrial products accounted for 26 of the company s sales and 68 of adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 22 of sales and 33 of adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter of 2018 significant highlights and business environment during the fourth quarter of 2019 market prices of elemental bromine in china remained stable compared to the third quarter of 2019 and were lower compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 due to lower production of brominated flame retardants in china which resulted in lower domestic demand for elemental bromine the decrease in the production of brominated flame retardants was caused by environmental related regulatory pressure which together with depletion in chinese bromine resources led to a shift in the production of flame retardants from china to producers in the western hemisphere icl s sales prices of elemental bromine remained stable compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 remained stable compared to the third quarter of 2019 and were lower compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 due to lower production of brominated flame retardants in which resulted in lower domestic demand for elemental bromine the decrease in the production of brominated flame retardants was caused by environmental related regulatory pressure which together with depletion in chinese bromine resources led to a shift in the production of flame retardants from to producers in the western hemisphere icl s sales prices of elemental bromine remained stable compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 global demand for flame retardants remained stable and following the usual seasonal decrease in the fourth quarter of 2019 shipments returned to normal levels in early 2020 icl concluded annual supply agreements for 2020 with moderate price increases during the fourth quarter of 2019 icl s sales volume of elemental bromine in china and of bromine flame retardants decreased compared to same period last year mainly as a result of the dead sea facilities upgrade which negatively impacted elemental bromine production and its availability for the production of icl s flame retardants elemental bromine production was also negatively impacted by the pending magnesium antidumping claim which forced the magnesium business to reduce production resulting in lower availability of chlorine which is a necessary raw material for bromine production and of bromine flame retardants decreased compared to same period last year mainly as a result of the dead sea facilities upgrade which negatively impacted elemental bromine production and its availability for the production of icl s flame retardants elemental bromine production was also negatively impacted by the pending magnesium antidumping claim which forced the magnesium business to reduce production resulting in lower availability of chlorine which is a necessary raw material for bromine production clear brine fluids sales increased in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter last year driven by higher activity in the north sea and higher prices phosphorus based flame retardants sales and operating income for the fourth quarter of 2019 decreased slightly compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 due to lower sales volumes as a result of increased chinese competition partly offset by higher prices the annual operating income of phosphorus based flame retardants increased significantly compared to 2018 mainly due to the continuing implementation of icl s value over volume strategy sales of specialty minerals increased slightly in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 due to higher

s revenue more than it contributed to operational cost saving potash the potash segment s sales decreased by 49 and operating income decreased by 86 in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter last year the decrease was caused by lower potash production and sales volume due to a combination of the impact on production of the dead sea facilities upgrade lack of shipments to china due to the delay in the signing of new supply contracts and weak market conditions lower production also resulted in unfavorable fixed costs absorption which together with lower prices resulted in significant profit margin erosion potash accounted for 24 of icl s sales and 25 of adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 33 of sales and 64 of adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter of 2018 significant highlights and business environment the grain price index increased towards the end of the fourth quarter of 2019 mainly due to a decrease in wheat production

compared to the same quarter last year exchange rates the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on the segment s operating income was primarily related to the appreciation of the average exchange rate of the shekel against the dollar which increased operational costs operating and other expenses the negative impact of operating and other expenses on the segment s operating income was primarily related to higher operating costs due to the dead sea facilities upgrade partially offset by lower labor costs and income related to changes in pension liabilities phosphate solutions higher prices and reduced costs led to higher profit in phosphate specialties in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the same period last year partially offsetting the impact of significantly lower phosphate commodity selling prices and sales quantities the segment demonstrated resilience throughout 2019 as icl s focus on specialty products and improvements at yph jv s operations offset accelerating weakness in the commodity market environment during 2019 the segment also reached several important strategic milestones including the launch of the new food grade phosphoric acid plant in china and

commodities amounted to 155 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 approximately 32 lower than the fourth quarter of 2018 the decrease was due to a decrease in sales volume and prices sales volumes of phosphate fertilizers in the fourth quarter of 2019 decreased by 24 to 407 thousand tonnes primarily driven by market conditions in addition results of the yph jv were lower in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the same period last year due to lower sales and production quantities and higher costs mainly maintenance significant highlights and business environment revenues from phosphate salts increased moderately in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter last year driven by higher prices and increased sales volumes of food grade phosphates in north america and europe and phosphoric acid revenues decreased slightly in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the same period last year primarily due to a competitive environment resulting in lower sales volumes in north america revenues in europe were higher due to increased volumes with key accounts sales in south america decreased driven by lower sales volumes primarily due to general market conditions sales in

contributed significantly to inferred mineral resources of the mine at year end 4 on a 50 basis the zone added 12 8 million tonnes of inferred resources at 3 34 grams per tonne g t for a total of approximately 1 37 million ounces of gold the zone continues to be open in all directions evaluating scenarios to optimize canadian malartic underground the partnership is evaluating scenarios to optimize the project which includes discussions with royalty holders and other stakeholders to enhance the economics of the project given the company s robust pipeline of development projects the company does not currently anticipate approving the project for development unless these discussions are successful and the project economics are improved daniel racine president and chief executive officer commented our fourth quarter capped off an exceptional year for yamana we significantly strengthened our balance sheet by lowering debt and increasing free cash flow our operations executed extremely well with jacobina posting record fourth quarter and full year production and el peñón enjoying its strongest quarter since we rightsized the operation three years ago minera florida also performed well particularly in the month of december something we believe is a sign of things to come we are carrying this momentum into 2020 using our improved financial flexibility to further reduce debt advance our organic growth projects and exploration program and continue to increase shareholder returns free cash flow cash balance and liquidity rise sharply the company s primary objective is to maximize free cash flow and 2019 was a particularly strong year in this regard full year cash flow from operating activities increased 29 to 521 8 million while net free cash flow 5 rose 63 to 358 4 million from 219 8 million the growth in free cash flow contributed to a sharp rise in yamana s cash balance which increased to 158 8 million at the end of the fourth quarter compared to 98 5 million a year earlier as of december 31 2019 yamana had available credit of 750 0 million which when combined with the company s cash balance brings total available liquidity to 908 8 million up from 803 5 million a year earlier free cash flow growth enabled further significant net debt reduction the company nearly halved its net debt 5 in 2019 significantly strengthening its balance sheet and financial flexibility the debt reduction primarily reflects the retirement of 800 0 million of debt announced in august 2019 and importantly growth in free cash flow has allowed the company to use its rising cash balance to continue to meaningfully lower debt during the fourth quarter the company s net debt 5 further decreased by 59 8 million as a result of increased cash flows from operations as of december 31 2019 yamana s net debt 5 was 889 1 million down 46 from 1 660 2 billion a year earlier increased annual dividend cumulatively by 150 effective in the first quarter of 2020 the company will have increased its annual dividend cumulatively by 150 to 0 05 per share from 0 02 per share in the third quarter the company has adopted a policy of treating dividends on a per ounce basis and established a program pursuant to which it would create a reserve fund to protect the dividend for a minimum of three years given the significant increase in free cash flow which yamana believes is sustainable the company is targeting the payment of a dividend between the current rate of approximately 50 per geo 1 and 100 per geo 1 the company will continue to maintain a balance between the payment of sustainable dividends reinvestment in the business and further improvements to its balance sheet costs in line with previous guidance and adjustments total yamana 2 cash costs 5 for the quarter and full year of 656 and 667 per geo 1 respectively were in line with previous guidance and adjustments as were total yamana 2 aisc 5 for the quarter and full year of 1 012 and 978 per geo 1 respectively strong production and cost performance were observed particularly at el peñón and jacobina in the fourth quarter costs were in line with expectations notwithstanding a higher geo 1 ratio relative to initial guidance the removal of production from chapada in the second half of the year which increased costs by 30 per geo 1 and a decision to spend more on exploration to further advance the robust drilling results being obtained across the company s operations the additional spend did not impact margins which improved due to the rise in metal prices the decision to concentrate sustaining capital spending in the second half of the year further impacted aisc 5 in the fourth quarter in particular additional capital development at jacobina and el peñón in the second half supported high quarterly rates of mining and production in 2019 and is expected to improve access and flexibility in mining operations during 2020 jason leblanc chief financial officer commented our free cash flow and cash balances have grown to a point where we are now able to meaningfully reduce debt as we did during the fourth quarter while supporting a substantially higher dividend and continuing to grow the business we are confident that this is sustainable and as our free cash profile continues to improve that we will be an in even better position to generate growth and increase

strategic developments jacobina brazil during the year the company announced significant increases to mineral reserves at jacobina of 8 6 versus year end 2018 the operation also reported an all time high for full year production of 159 499 ounces of gold which was also well above guidance of 152 000 ounces with continued improvements to the sustainable cost structure and development productivity at the mine jacobina was able to incorporate ore previously categorized as mineral resources in the mineral reserve category the conclusion to include lower grade supplemental ore encountered as a halo to the core mineral reserves had the impact of slightly decreasing total mineral reserve grade but significantly increasing economical mineral reserve ounces this supplemental ore halo has been effectively and profitably mined over the past few quarters the updated mineral reserves of jacobina comprise 29 17 million tonnes at a grade of 2 40 g t in the core zone for a total of 2 25 million ounces 5 01 million tonnes at a grade of 1 53 g t in the supplemental halo zone for a total of 246 thousand ounces for a total mineral reserve of 34 18 million tonnes at a grade of 2 27 g t for a total of 2 49 million ounces the company s mine plan prioritizes the mining of the core mineral reserves with a grade of 2 40 g t and defers the majority of the mining and processing of the supplemental halo mineral reserves until late in the mine life the observed increase in mineral reserves and mineral reserves grade during the mid year and year end update supports annual gold production above 170 000 ounces which was previously guided as the target after the completion in mid 2020 of phase 1 a modest plant optimization with a sustainable level of 6 500 tonnes per day tpd the increase also further supports the potential for phase 2 where production is expected to increase to between 200 000 and 225 000 ounces per year with a likely scenario for plant throughput in the range of 7 500 tpd to 8 500 tpd while maintaining gold recoveries of between 96 97 a pre feasibility study pfs to identify optimum mining and processing expansion scenarios evaluate project economics and determine a project development schedule including the timing for permit applications is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2020 investment for phase 2 is expected to occur mostly in 2021 and 2022 with the objective of being at the higher throughput level at the beginning of 2023 no expansionary capital will be committed to the plant expansion until the pfs is completed the company s hurdle requirement for expenditure on the phase 2 expansion is an after tax internal rate of return exceeding 15 the decision to proceed with the investment will be driven by the expansion of the plant throughput thus bringing forward cash flows but also an extension of mine life from continued exploration success and improvements to jacobina s average mineral reserve grade which would support the investment decision agua rica argentina during the year the company announced an integration agreement with glencore international ag and newmont corporation collectively the parties pursuant to which the agua rica project would be developed and operated using the existing infrastructure and facilities of minera alumbrera limited alumbrera in the catamarca province of argentina the company would own 56 of the integrated project the parties established a technical committee to direct the advancement of the integrated project the integration is expected to significantly de risk the development of agua rica due to the ability to rely on the current alumbrera plant and infrastructure the integrated project is also expected to generate significant synergies by bringing together the extensive mineral reserves of agua rica with the existing infrastructure of alumbrera to create a unique high quality low risk brownfield project with an optimized environmental footprint that is expected to bring significant value to shareholders local communities and stakeholders on july 19 2019 the company announced positive pfs results that underscored agua rica as a long life low cost project with robust economics and opportunities to realize further value including the opportunity to convert economic grade inferred mineral resources and expanding throughput scenarios to increase metal production and returns among other opportunities the pfs highlights include a long mine life of 28 years annual production for the first 10 full years increased to 533 million pounds of copper equivalent i production cash costs 5 decreased to 1 29 per pound aisc 5 decreased to 1 52 per pound for the first ten years of production net present value increased to 1 935 billion and an increased internal rate of return of 19 7 ii furthermore proven and probable copper mineral reserves increased by 21 from year end 2018 to 11 8 billion pounds and gold mineral reserves increased by 13 to 7 4 million ounces the company believes agua rica represents one of the lowest capital intensity copper development projects in the world with capital intensity measured based on the amount of copper produced and the amount of copper in the ground copper equivalent metal includes copper with gold molybdenum and silver converted to copper equivalent metal based on the following metal price assumptions 6 614 per tonne of copper 3 per pound 1 250 per ounce for gold 24 250 per tonne for molybdenum and 18 00 per ounce for silver assuming metal prices of 3 00 per pound of copper 1 300 per ounce of gold price 18 00 per ounce of silver 11 00 per pound of molybdenum and using an 8 discount rate expansion opportunities at canadian malartic canada exploration programs are ongoing to evaluate several deposits and prospective exploration areas to the east of the canadian malartic open pit including the new mineralized zone discovery of east gouldie as well as the odyssey east malartic sladen sheehan and rand zones these discoveries have the potential to provide new mostly underground sources of mineralization for the canadian malartic mill replacing a portion of the lower grade open pit ores and thereby increasing production and extending mine life access for additional underground drilling and possible mining would be by ramp extending from the odyssey zone the permit allowing for the development of an underground ramp was received in december 2018 drilling at east gouldie has yielded a number of positive intercepts and results indicate that the east gouldie east malartic and sladen zones are converging at depth increasing the level of confidence in the economic potential of overall mineral resources below 1 000 meters east gouldie contributed to the meaningful increase in inferred mineral resource figures for east malartic at year end 2019 this increase comes after only one year of exploration since the initial discovery hole in november 2018 the east gouldie zone remains open and exploration continues to investigate probable extensions of the known mineral envelope see further details in the company s september 9 2019 press release yamana gold provides exploration update on the canadian malartic mine announces discovery of east gouldie zone available on sedar sale of chapada brazil and related consideration on july 5 2019 the company completed the sale of the chapada mine the company received total consideration of 865 5 million including initial upfront cash consideration of 800 0 million on closing in addition consideration includes a 100 million cash payment contingent on the development of a pyrite roaster at chapada and a 2 net smelter return nsr royalty on the suruca gold project in the chapada complex with regards to the suruca nsr the company is considering a possible monetization of the royalty which would allow the significant gain on realization on the sale of chapada to have further upside potential and add to the already monetized 865 5 million in cash obtained on sale exploration the 2019 exploration program focused on finding higher quality ounces improving mine grade infill drilling to replace production by upgrading existing mineral resources and exploring the yamana property portfolio as well as several joint venture opportunities the company continues its exploration programs at existing operations the company increased its exploration spending in 2019 with a goal of further building mineral reserves and mineral resources at key operations as well as building a pipeline of exploration opportunities to ensure future growth exploration plans are focused on extending mine life at cerro moro el peñón and minera florida while increasing grade mineral resources and mine life at jacobina and canadian malartic to allow increases in production at low costs over the course of the year exploration spending at jacobina was allocated to support the planned expansion and the program added new mineral reserves at a grade of 3 0 g t or better henry marsden senior vice president of exploration commented all five of our mines issued positive exploration updates in the second half of 2019 i would like to highlight el peñón our most mature mine which increased gold and silver mineral reserves well beyond depletion for the third consecutive year given this ability to consistently grow mineral reserves beyond depletion the mine life of this our most resilient operation is expected to be considerably longer than suggested by its mineral reserves inventory at any given point in time generative exploration program the company believes that it is important to invest prudently and responsibly today to lay the foundation for the yamana mines of tomorrow to that end a generative exploration program is in progress to advance several highly prospective opportunities in the company s existing portfolio the key objectives of the program are as follows target the company s most advanced exploration projects while retaining the flexibility to prioritize other projects in the portfolio as and when merited by drill results advance one or more projects to an inferred mineral resource of at least 1 5 million ounces of gold within the next three years on a long term basis advance at least one project to a mineral inventory that is large enough to support a mine with annual gold production of approximately 150 000 ounces for at least eight years advance both gold only and copper gold projects and in the latter case consider joint venture agreements aimed at increasing mineral resource and advancing the project to development while yamana maintains an economic interest in the project the company is budgeting 14 million in 2020 the first year of what will initially be a three year program the company expects most of the remaining budget for the program to be derived from monetizations of non cash producing assets that are currently in progress creating an optimum balance between investing in new projects and maximizing free cash flow the generative exploration program targets advanced and advancing exploration projects in yamana s existing portfolio particularly canada and brazil these projects include lavra velha lavra velha is a near surface advanced exploration project located in the lavra velha district in brazil s bahia state there are significant drill targets on the 55 000 hectare property and lavra velha is highly prospective to meet the company s long term objectives as it is near to surface open pittable and as a possible heap leach operation it can more easily be put into production with low capital costs monument bay yamana is actively exploring its 31 000 hectare monument bay project which is located in northeast manitoba the project covers the twin lakes shear zone a strongly developed regional structure that hosts gold mineralization along a three kilometre strike length drilling on the core twin lakes shear zone will continue and exploration has recently expanded to other targets within the existing exploration permit using reverse circulation drilling to collect basal till and top of bedrock samples jacobina norte the jacobina norte project located in brazil s bahia state just a few kilometres away from the jacobina mine is one of yamana s most promising advancing exploration projects the 78 000 hectare property covers over 150 kilometres of strike extent of the serra do corrego formation which hosts paleoplacer gold mineralization at the jacobina mine surface exploration along strike has defined mineralization at jacobina norte along a 15 kilometre trend with significant gold grades borborema the borborema project is a 25 000 hectare land package in the borborema district in brazil s pernambuco state the project is located in a proterozoic magmatic arc environment that is similar to the belt hosting the chapada mine a large copper gold mine developed by yamana and put into production in 2007 originally explored for narrow high grade veins exploration also identified strong copper gold anomalies in both rocks and soils initial drill testing of the são francisco target in 2019 generated near to surface very high grade copper intercepts from massive sulphide mineralization ivolandia the ivolandia project is located in brazil s goias state south of the chapada mine gold

canavieiras south canavieiras central and serra do córrego mines the conversion of measured and indicated mineral resources to mineral reserves is partially responsible for a modest decrease in gold measured and indicated mineral resources inferred mineral resources increased by 398 000 ounces of gold up 39 from year end 2018 in the exploration update provided in the third quarter of 2019 the company announced increases to mineral reserves and mineral reserve grades at jacobina of 8 6 and 2 6 respectively versus year end 2018 which added to overall mineral reserve grade growth in 2018 which when combined with the mid year update represents a 5 3 increase from year end 2017 at year end the company further increased mineral reserves by 22 or 490 000 ounces from the mid year update such increase is related to mineral reserves with a lower average grade of 1 41 g t the company anticipates that it would defer mining of these low grade reserves until late in the mine life and instead mining and processing would be in association with the mineral reserves at a grade of 2 40 g t a photo accompanying this announcement is available at adjustments are the inclusion of lower

been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the securities laws in effect in canada which differ in certain material respects from the disclosure requirements of united states securities laws contained in industry guide 7 the terms mineral reserve proven mineral reserve and probable mineral reserve are canadian mining terms as defined in accordance with canadian national instrument 43 101 standards of disclosure for mineral projects ni 43 101 and the canadian institute of mining metallurgy and petroleum the cim cim definition standards on mineral resources and mineral reserves adopted by the cim council as amended these definitions differ from the definitions in the disclosure requirements promulgated by the securities and exchange commission the commission contained in industry guide 7 under industry guide 7 standards a final or bankable feasibility study is required to report mineral reserves the three year historical average price is used in any mineral reserve or cash flow analysis to designate mineral reserves and the primary environmental analysis or report must be filed with the appropriate governmental authority in addition the terms mineral resource measured mineral resource indicated mineral resource and inferred mineral resource are defined in and required to be disclosed by ni 43 101 however these terms are not defined terms under industry guide 7 investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into mineral reserves inferred mineral resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility it cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category under canadian rules estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre feasibility studies except in rare cases investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists or is economically or legally mineable disclosure of contained ounces in a mineral resource is permitted disclosure under canadian regulations in contrast issuers reporting pursuant to industry guide 7 report mineralization that does not constitute mineral reserves by commission standards as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures accordingly information contained in this news release may not be comparable to similar information made public by u s companies reporting pursuant to industry guide 7 non

following cash costs per geo sold all in sustaining costs per geo sold net debt net free cash flow and free cash flow average realized price per ounce of gold silver sold average realized price per pound of copper and adjusted earnings the company believes that these measures together with measures determined in accordance with ifrs provide investors with an improved ability to evaluate the underlying performance of the company non gaap financial measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under ifrs and therefore they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by

geo production and sales production and sales of silver are treated as a gold equivalent in determining a combined precious metal production or sales unit commonly referred to as gold equivalent ounces geo specifically guidance geo produced are calculated by converting silver production to its gold equivalent using relative gold silver metal prices at an assumed ratio and adding the converted silver production expressed in gold ounces to the ounces of gold production actual geo production and sales calculations are based on an average realized gold to silver price ratio for the relevant period cash costs and all in sustaining costs the company discloses cash costs because it understands that certain investors use this information to determine the company s ability to generate earnings and cash flows for use in investing and other activities the company believes that conventional measures of performance prepared in accordance with ifrs do not fully illustrate the ability of its operating mines to generate cash flows the measures as determined under ifrs are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flows from operating activities the measure of cash costs and all in sustaining costs aisc along with revenue from sales is considered to be a key indicator of a company s ability to generate operating earnings and cash flows from its mining operations this data is furnished to provide additional information and is a non gaap financial measure the terms cash costs per geo sold cash costs per pound of copper sold aisc per geo sold and aisc per pound of copper sold do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under ifrs and therefore they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies non gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with ifrs and are not necessarily indicative of operating costs operating profit or cash flows presented under ifrs cash costs include mine site operating costs such as mining processing administration production taxes and royalties which are not based on sales or taxable income calculations but are exclusive of amortization reclamation capital development and exploration costs the company believes that such measure provides useful information about its underlying cash costs of operations cash costs are computed on a weighted average basis as follows cash costs per geo sold the total costs used as the numerator of the unitary calculation represent cost of sales excluding dda net of treatment and refining charges these costs are then divided by geo sold in the case of chapada costs directly attributable to geo and copper will be allocated on that attributable basis non attributable costs will be allocated based on the relative value of revenues for each metal which will be determined annually at the beginning of each year cash costs of copper attributable copper sales costs divided by commercial copper pounds sold aisc figures are calculated in accordance with a standard developed by the world gold council wgc a non regulatory market development organization for the gold industry adoption of the standard is voluntary and the cost measures presented herein may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies aisc per sold seeks to represent total sustaining expenditures of producing and selling geo from current operations the total costs used as the numerator of the unitary calculation represent cash costs defined above and includes cost components of mine sustaining capital expenditures including stripping and underground mine development corporate and mine site general and administrative expense sustaining mine site exploration and evaluation expensed and capitalized and accretion and amortization of reclamation and remediation aisc do not include capital expenditures attributable to projects or mine expansions exploration and evaluation costs attributable to growth projects income tax payments borrowing costs and dividend payments consequently this measure is not representative of all of the company s cash expenditures in addition the calculation of aisc does not include depletion depreciation and amortization expense as it does not reflect the impact of expenditures incurred in prior periods aisc per geo sold reflect allocations of the aforementioned cost components on the basis that is consistent with the nature of each of the cost component to the geo production and sales activities aisc per

adjusted earnings or loss per share do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by ifrs and therefore the company s definitions are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies management uses these measures for internal valuation of the core mining performance for the period and to assist with planning and forecasting of future operations management believes that the presentation of adjusted earnings or loss and adjusted earnings or loss per share provide useful information to investors because they exclude non recurring items items not related to or not indicative of current or future period s results and or not directly related to the core mining business and are a better indication of the company s profitability from operations as evaluated by internal management and the board of directors the items excluded from the computation of adjusted earnings or loss and adjusted earnings or loss per share which are otherwise included in the determination of net earnings or loss and net earnings or loss per share prepared in accordance with ifrs are items that the company does not consider to be meaningful in evaluating the company s past financial performance or the future prospects and may hinder a comparison of its period to period profitability additional line items or subtotals in financial statements the company uses the following additional line items and subtotals in the consolidated financial statements as contemplated in ias 1 presentation of financial statements gross margin excluding depletion depreciation and

increase in free cash flow total debt decreased by 710 8 million during 2019 while net debt 5 fell by 771 1 million due to increased cash balances resulting from significantly higher free cash flow as of december 31 2019 net debt 5 was 889 1 million increased dividend increased annual dividend by 25 to 0 05 per share effective in the first quarter of 2020 the increase follows a 100 increase to the annual dividend in the third quarter of 2019 to 0 04 per share from 0 02 increased mineral resources mineral reserves replaced depletion on a consolidated basis excluding assets disposed of in 2019 more than replacing 2019 mineral depletion inferred mineral resources increased by 27 4 from year end 2018 while measured and indicated mineral resources were relatively unchanged from year end 2018 while measured and indicated mineral resources were relatively unchanged jacobina increased gold mineral reserves by 19 over and above 2019 depletion based on updated models from the morro do vento joão belo canavieiras central and serra do córrego mines el peñón mineral reserves increased by 15 for gold and 21 for silver in 2019 over and above depletion due to positive infill drilling and mine design optimization maiden resource for east gouldie discovery the company is disclosing a maiden mineral resource estimate for east gouldie a new mineralized zone at the canadian malartic mine that contributed significantly to inferred mineral resources of the mine at year end 4 on a 50 basis the zone added 12 8 million tonnes of inferred resources at 3 34 grams per tonne g t for a total of approximately 1 37 million ounces of gold the zone continues to be open in all directions evaluating scenarios to optimize canadian malartic underground the partnership is evaluating scenarios to optimize the project which includes discussions with royalty holders and other stakeholders to enhance the economics of the project given the company s robust pipeline of development projects the company does not currently anticipate approving the project for development unless these discussions are successful and the project economics are improved daniel racine president and chief executive officer commented our fourth quarter capped off an exceptional year for yamana we significantly strengthened our balance sheet by lowering debt and increasing free cash flow our operations executed extremely well with jacobina posting record fourth quarter and full year production and el peñón enjoying its strongest quarter since we rightsized the operation three years ago minera florida also performed well particularly in the month of december something we believe is a sign of things to come we are carrying this momentum into 2020 using our improved financial flexibility to further reduce debt advance our organic growth projects and exploration program and continue to increase shareholder returns free cash flow cash balance and liquidity rise sharply the company s primary objective is to maximize free cash flow and 2019 was a particularly strong year in this regard full year cash flow from operating activities increased 29 to 521 8 million while net free cash flow 5 rose 63 to 358 4 million from 219 8 million the growth in free cash flow contributed to a sharp rise in yamana s cash balance which increased to 158 8 million at the end of the fourth quarter compared to 98 5 million a year earlier as of december 31 2019 yamana had available credit of 750 0 million which when combined with the company s cash balance brings total available liquidity to 908 8 million up from 803 5 million a year earlier free cash flow growth enabled further significant net debt reduction the company nearly halved its net debt 5 in 2019 significantly strengthening its balance sheet and financial flexibility the debt reduction primarily reflects the retirement of 800 0 million of debt announced in august 2019 and importantly growth in free cash flow has allowed the company to use its rising cash balance to continue to meaningfully lower debt during the fourth quarter the company s net debt 5 further decreased by 59 8 million as a result of increased cash flows from operations as of december 31 2019 yamana s net debt 5 was 889 1 million down 46 from 1 660 2 billion a year earlier increased annual dividend cumulatively by 150 effective in the first quarter of 2020 the company will have increased its annual dividend cumulatively by 150 to 0 05 per share from 0 02 per share in the third quarter the company has adopted a policy of treating dividends on a per ounce basis and established a program pursuant to which it would create a reserve fund to protect the dividend for a minimum of three years given the significant increase in free cash flow which yamana believes is sustainable the company is targeting the payment of a dividend between the current rate of approximately 50 per geo 1 and 100 per geo 1 the company will continue to maintain a balance between the payment of sustainable dividends reinvestment in the business and further improvements to its balance sheet costs in line with previous guidance and adjustments total yamana 2 cash costs 5 for the quarter and full year of 656 and 667 per geo 1 respectively were in line with previous guidance and adjustments as were total yamana 2 aisc 5 for the quarter and full year of 1 012 and 978 per geo 1 respectively strong production and cost performance were observed particularly at el peñón and jacobina in the fourth quarter costs were in line with expectations notwithstanding a higher geo 1 ratio relative to initial guidance the removal of production from chapada in the second half of the year which increased costs by 30 per geo 1 and a decision to spend more on exploration to further advance the robust drilling results being obtained across the company s operations the additional spend did not impact margins which improved due to the rise in metal prices the decision to concentrate sustaining capital spending in the second half of the year further impacted aisc 5 in the fourth quarter in particular additional capital development at jacobina and el peñón in the second half supported high quarterly rates of mining and production in 2019 and is expected to improve access and flexibility in mining operations during 2020 jason leblanc chief financial officer commented our free cash flow and cash balances have grown to a point where we are now able to meaningfully reduce debt as we did during the fourth quarter while supporting a substantially higher dividend and continuing to grow the business we are confident that this is sustainable and as our free cash profile continues to improve that we will be an in even better position to generate growth and increase

strategic developments jacobina brazil during the year the company announced significant increases to mineral reserves at jacobina of 8 6 versus year end 2018 the operation also reported an all time high for full year production of 159 499 ounces of gold which was also well above guidance of 152 000 ounces with continued improvements to the sustainable cost structure and development productivity at the mine jacobina was able to incorporate ore previously categorized as mineral resources in the mineral reserve category the conclusion to include lower grade supplemental ore encountered as a halo to the core mineral reserves had the impact of slightly decreasing total mineral reserve grade but significantly increasing economical mineral reserve ounces this supplemental ore halo has been effectively and profitably mined over the past few quarters the updated mineral reserves of jacobina comprise 29 17 million tonnes at a grade of 2 40 g t in the core zone for a total of 2 25 million ounces 5 01 million tonnes at a grade of 1 53 g t in the supplemental halo zone for a total of 246 thousand ounces for a total mineral reserve of 34 18 million tonnes at a grade of 2 27 g t for a total of 2 49 million ounces the company s mine plan prioritizes the mining of the core mineral reserves with a grade of 2 40 g t and defers the majority of the mining and processing of the supplemental halo mineral reserves until late in the mine life the observed increase in mineral reserves and mineral reserves grade during the mid year and year end update supports annual gold production above 170 000 ounces which was previously guided as the target after the completion in mid 2020 of phase 1 a modest plant optimization with a sustainable level of 6 500 tonnes per day tpd the increase also further supports the potential for phase 2 where production is expected to increase to between 200 000 and 225 000 ounces per year with a likely scenario for plant throughput in the range of 7 500 tpd to 8 500 tpd while maintaining gold recoveries of between 96 97 a pre feasibility study pfs to identify optimum mining and processing expansion scenarios evaluate project economics and determine a project development schedule including the timing for permit applications is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2020 investment for phase 2 is expected to occur mostly in 2021 and 2022 with the objective of being at the higher throughput level at the beginning of 2023 no expansionary capital will be committed to the plant expansion until the pfs is completed the company s hurdle requirement for expenditure on the phase 2 expansion is an after tax internal rate of return exceeding 15 the decision to proceed with the investment will be driven by the expansion of the plant throughput thus bringing forward cash flows but also an extension of mine life from continued exploration success and improvements to jacobina s average mineral reserve grade which would support the investment decision agua rica argentina during the year the company announced an integration agreement with glencore international ag and newmont corporation collectively the parties pursuant to which the agua rica project would be developed and operated using the existing infrastructure and facilities of minera alumbrera limited alumbrera in the catamarca province of argentina the company would own 56 of the integrated project the parties established a technical committee to direct the advancement of the integrated project the integration is expected to significantly de risk the development of agua rica due to the ability to rely on the current alumbrera plant and infrastructure the integrated project is also expected to generate significant synergies by bringing together the extensive mineral reserves of agua rica with the existing infrastructure of alumbrera to create a unique high quality low risk brownfield project with an optimized environmental footprint that is expected to bring significant value to shareholders local communities and stakeholders on july 19 2019 the company announced positive pfs results that underscored agua rica as a long life low cost project with robust economics and opportunities to realize further value including the opportunity to convert economic grade inferred mineral resources and expanding throughput scenarios to increase metal production and returns among other opportunities the pfs highlights include a long mine life of 28 years annual production for the first 10 full years increased to 533 million pounds of copper equivalent i production cash costs 5 decreased to 1 29 per pound aisc 5 decreased to 1 52 per pound for the first ten years of production net present value increased to 1 935 billion and an increased internal rate of return of 19 7 ii furthermore proven and probable copper mineral reserves increased by 21 from year end 2018 to 11 8 billion pounds and gold mineral reserves increased by 13 to 7 4 million ounces the company believes agua rica represents one of the lowest capital intensity copper development projects in the world with capital intensity measured based on the amount of copper produced and the amount of copper in the ground copper equivalent metal includes copper with gold molybdenum and silver converted to copper equivalent metal based on the following metal price assumptions 6 614 per tonne of copper 3 per pound 1 250 per ounce for gold 24 250 per tonne for molybdenum and 18 00 per ounce for silver assuming metal prices of 3 00 per pound of copper 1 300 per ounce of gold price 18 00 per ounce of silver 11 00 per pound of molybdenum and using an 8 discount rate expansion opportunities at canadian malartic canada exploration programs are ongoing to evaluate several deposits and prospective exploration areas to the east of the canadian malartic open pit including the new mineralized zone discovery of east gouldie as well as the odyssey east malartic sladen sheehan and rand zones these discoveries have the potential to provide new mostly underground sources of mineralization for the canadian malartic mill replacing a portion of the lower grade open pit ores and thereby increasing production and extending mine life access for additional underground drilling and possible mining would be by ramp extending from the odyssey zone the permit allowing for the development of an underground ramp was received in december 2018 drilling at east gouldie has yielded a number of positive intercepts and results indicate that the east gouldie east malartic and sladen zones are converging at depth increasing the level of confidence in the economic potential of overall mineral resources below 1 000 meters east gouldie contributed to the meaningful increase in inferred mineral resource figures for east malartic at year end 2019 this increase comes after only one year of exploration since the initial discovery hole in november 2018 the east gouldie zone remains open and exploration continues to investigate probable extensions of the known mineral envelope see further details in the company s september 9 2019 press release yamana gold provides exploration update on the canadian malartic mine announces discovery of east gouldie zone available on sedar sale of chapada brazil and related consideration on july 5 2019 the company completed the sale of the chapada mine the company received total consideration of 865 5 million including initial upfront cash consideration of 800 0 million on closing in addition consideration includes a 100 million cash payment contingent on the development of a pyrite roaster at chapada and a 2 net smelter return nsr royalty on the suruca gold project in the chapada complex with regards to the suruca nsr the company is considering a possible monetization of the royalty which would allow the significant gain on realization on the sale of chapada to have further upside potential and add to the already monetized 865 5 million in cash obtained on sale exploration the 2019 exploration program focused on finding higher quality ounces improving mine grade infill drilling to replace production by upgrading existing mineral resources and exploring the yamana property portfolio as well as several joint venture opportunities the company continues its exploration programs at existing operations the company increased its exploration spending in 2019 with a goal of further building mineral reserves and mineral resources at key operations as well as building a pipeline of exploration opportunities to ensure future growth exploration plans are focused on extending mine life at cerro moro el peñón and minera florida while increasing grade mineral resources and mine life at jacobina and canadian malartic to allow increases in production at low costs over the course of the year exploration spending at jacobina was allocated to support the planned expansion and the program added new mineral reserves at a grade of 3 0 g t or better henry marsden senior vice president of exploration commented all five of our mines issued positive exploration updates in the second half of 2019 i would like to highlight el peñón our most mature mine which increased gold and silver mineral reserves well beyond depletion for the third consecutive year given this ability to consistently grow mineral reserves beyond depletion the mine life of this our most resilient operation is expected to be considerably longer than suggested by its mineral reserves inventory at any given point in time generative exploration program the company believes that it is important to invest prudently and responsibly today to lay the foundation for the yamana mines of tomorrow to that end a generative exploration program is in progress to advance several highly prospective opportunities in the company s existing portfolio the key objectives of the program are as follows target the company s most advanced exploration projects while retaining the flexibility to prioritize other projects in the portfolio as and when merited by drill results advance one or more projects to an inferred mineral resource of at least 1 5 million ounces of gold within the next three years on a long term basis advance at least one project to a mineral inventory that is large enough to support a mine with annual gold production of approximately 150 000 ounces for at least eight years advance both gold only and copper gold projects and in the latter case consider joint venture agreements aimed at increasing mineral resource and advancing the project to development while yamana maintains an economic interest in the project the company is budgeting 14 million in 2020 the first year of what will initially be a three year program the company expects most of the remaining budget for the program to be derived from monetizations of non cash producing assets that are currently in progress creating an optimum balance between investing in new projects and maximizing free cash flow the generative exploration program targets advanced and advancing exploration projects in yamana s existing portfolio particularly canada and brazil these projects include lavra velha lavra velha is a near surface advanced exploration project located in the lavra velha district in brazil s bahia state there are significant drill targets on the 55 000 hectare property and lavra velha is highly prospective to meet the company s long term objectives as it is near to surface open pittable and as a possible heap leach operation it can more easily be put into production with low capital costs monument bay yamana is actively exploring its 31 000 hectare monument bay project which is located in northeast manitoba the project covers the twin lakes shear zone a strongly developed regional structure that hosts gold mineralization along a three kilometre strike length drilling on the core twin lakes shear zone will continue and exploration has recently expanded to other targets within the existing exploration permit using reverse circulation drilling to collect basal till and top of bedrock samples jacobina norte the jacobina norte project located in brazil s bahia state just a few kilometres away from the jacobina mine is one of yamana s most promising advancing exploration projects the 78 000 hectare property covers over 150 kilometres of strike extent of the serra do corrego formation which hosts paleoplacer gold mineralization at the jacobina mine surface exploration along strike has defined mineralization at jacobina norte along a 15 kilometre trend with significant gold grades borborema the borborema project is a 25 000 hectare land package in the borborema district in brazil s pernambuco state the project is located in a proterozoic magmatic arc environment that is similar to the belt hosting the chapada mine a large copper gold mine developed by yamana and put into production in 2007 originally explored for narrow high grade veins exploration also identified strong copper gold anomalies in both rocks and soils initial drill testing of the são francisco target in 2019 generated near to surface very high grade copper intercepts from massive sulphide mineralization ivolandia the ivolandia project is located in brazil s goias state south of the chapada mine gold in soil anomalies and surface gold mineralization were drill tested in wide spaced exploration holes in 2011 12 and more recently in 2019 results to date suggest lower grade although very near to

december 31 2019 are presented below jacobina brazil jacobina increased gold mineral reserves by 19 over and above 2019 production depletion based on updated models from morro do vento joão belo canavieiras south canavieiras central and serra do córrego mines the conversion of measured and indicated mineral resources to mineral reserves is partially responsible for a modest decrease in gold measured and indicated mineral resources inferred mineral resources increased by 398 000 ounces of gold up 39 from year end 2018 in the exploration update provided in the third quarter of 2019 the company announced increases to mineral reserves and mineral reserve grades at jacobina of 8 6 and 2 6 respectively versus year end 2018 which added to overall mineral reserve grade growth in 2018 which when combined with the mid year update represents a 5 3 increase from year end 2017 at year end the company further increased mineral reserves by 22 or 490 000 ounces from the mid year update such increase is related to mineral reserves with a lower average grade of 1 41 g t the company anticipates that it would defer mining of these low grade reserves until late in the mine life and instead mining and processing would be in association with the mineral reserves at a grade of 2 40 g t a photo accompanying this announcement is available at adjustments are the inclusion of lower grade halo reserves additions from infill drilling and mine design optimization canadian malartic including odyssey canada 50 gold mineral reserves reflect depletion associated with 2019 production at canadian malartic the objective of the 2019 exploration program at canadian malartic was to define and increase underground mineral resources with a focus on odyssey east malartic and the newly discovered east gouldie zone the drilling performed particularly at east malartic and east gouldie resulted in a 111 increase in inferred mineral resources at east malartic mineral resources below 1 000 metres in depth were reported for the first time at east gouldie inferred mineral resources are relatively high grade at 3 34 g t diluted on a 100 basis the overall underground project has increased by more than 5 000 000 ounces of inferred mineral resources significantly improving the economic potential of the project additional exploration in these areas is planned for 2020 a photo accompanying this announcement is available at adjustments to pit design modifications and increased cut off grade el peñón chile el peñón s mineral reserves both replaced 2019 depletion and further increased such mineral reserves by 15 and 21 for gold and silver respectively as the result of positive infill drilling and mine design optimization it is the third consecutive year that el peñón has replaced mineral reserves above and beyond depletion gold measured and indicated mineral resources increased by 66 while silver increased by 70 compared to the prior year due to the positive exploration results from numerous secondary vein structures in the east mine lower gold and silver inferred mineral resources reflect the conversion to indicated mineral resources and adjustments to mineral resource classification criteria in a recent exploration update the company indicated that new structural interpretations of faulting of the mine s deep orito vein helping to define new high grade mineralization the use of machine learning technology to improve exploration targeting is also yielding meaningful increases in mineral resource inventory a photo accompanying this announcement

adjustments to mineral resource classification criteria additions through infill drilling and mine design optimization cerro moro argentina at cerro moro mineral reserves changed due to 2019 depletion and given the company s expanded experience with mining cerro moro ore bodies over the past year and a half the company was able to further refine its geological understanding and incorporate that understanding into the geological model improving model predictability inferred mineral resources increased by 29 and 10 for gold and silver respectively compared to the prior year from the addition of promising new structures the main increases came from the new naty discovery and agostina naty is a recent discovery made late last year and exploration is expected to continue to expand this mineralized zone the structures of naty michelle extension martina tres lomas deborah link and other zones are expected to undergo further drilling in 2020 as part of the aggressive exploration budget allocation to the mine a photo accompanying this announcement is available at adjustments to block models a photo accompanying this announcement is available at adjustments to block models minera florida chile at minera florida the increase in mineral reserves reflects an increase due to positive drilling results at pataguas don leopoldo fantasma and pvo sur amongst others and block model revisions these increases were partially offset by mine depletion mineral resources remained relatively unchanged as infill drilling resulted in conversion from inferred mineral resources to measured and indicated mineral resources other changes to calculation parameters also had the impact of modestly decreasing inferred mineral resources which was partially offset by new discoveries a photo

been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the securities laws in effect in canada which differ in certain material respects from the disclosure requirements of united states securities laws contained in industry guide 7 the terms mineral reserve proven mineral reserve and probable mineral reserve are canadian mining terms as defined in accordance with canadian national instrument 43 101 standards of disclosure for mineral projects ni 43 101 and the canadian institute of mining metallurgy and petroleum the cim cim definition standards on mineral resources and mineral reserves adopted by the cim council as amended these definitions differ from the definitions in the disclosure requirements promulgated by the securities and exchange commission the commission contained in industry guide 7 under industry guide 7 standards a final or bankable feasibility study is required to report mineral reserves the three year historical average price is used in any mineral reserve or cash flow analysis to designate mineral reserves and the primary environmental analysis or report must be filed with the appropriate governmental authority in addition the terms mineral resource measured mineral resource indicated mineral resource and inferred mineral resource are defined in and required to be disclosed by ni 43 101 however these terms are not defined terms under industry guide 7 investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into mineral reserves inferred mineral resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility it cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category under canadian rules estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre feasibility studies except in rare cases investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists or is economically or legally mineable disclosure of contained ounces in a mineral resource is permitted disclosure under canadian regulations in contrast issuers reporting pursuant to industry guide 7 report mineralization that does not constitute mineral reserves by commission standards as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures accordingly information contained in this news release may not be comparable to similar information made public by u s companies reporting pursuant to industry guide 7 non gaap performance measures the company has included certain non gaap performance measures to supplement its consolidated financial statements which are presented in accordance with ifrs including the following cash costs per geo sold all in sustaining costs per geo sold net debt net free cash flow and free cash flow average realized price per ounce of gold silver sold average realized price per pound of copper and adjusted earnings the company believes that these measures together with measures determined in accordance with ifrs provide investors with an improved ability to evaluate the underlying performance of the company non gaap financial measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under ifrs and therefore they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies the data is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with ifrs management s determination of the components of non gaap and additional measures are evaluated on a periodic basis influenced by new items and transactions a review of investor uses and new regulations as applicable any changes to the measures are duly noted and retrospectively applied as applicable for definitions and descriptions of the non gaap measures other than those noted and reconciled below and additional subtotals in financial statements refer to section 11 of the company s md a for the year ended december 31 2019 which is available on the company s website and on sedar geo production and sales production and sales of silver are treated as a gold equivalent in determining a combined precious metal production or sales unit commonly referred to as gold equivalent ounces geo specifically guidance geo produced are calculated by converting silver production to its gold equivalent using relative gold silver metal prices at an assumed ratio and adding the converted silver production expressed in gold ounces to the ounces of gold production actual geo production and sales calculations are based on an average realized gold to silver price ratio for the relevant period cash costs and all in sustaining costs the company discloses cash costs because it understands that certain investors use this information to determine the company s ability to generate earnings and cash flows for use in investing and other activities the company believes that conventional measures of performance prepared in accordance with ifrs do not fully illustrate the ability of its operating mines to generate cash flows the measures as determined under ifrs are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flows from operating activities the measure of cash costs and all in sustaining costs aisc along with revenue from sales is considered to be a key indicator of a company s ability to generate operating earnings and cash flows from its mining operations this data is furnished to provide additional information and is a non gaap financial measure the terms cash costs per geo sold cash costs per pound of copper sold aisc per geo sold and aisc per pound of copper sold do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under ifrs and therefore they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies non gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with ifrs and are not necessarily indicative of operating costs operating profit or cash flows presented under ifrs cash costs include mine site operating costs such as mining processing administration production taxes and royalties which are not based on sales or taxable income calculations but are exclusive of amortization reclamation capital development and exploration costs the company believes that such measure provides useful information about its underlying cash costs of operations cash costs are computed on a weighted average basis as follows cash costs per geo sold the total costs used as the numerator of the unitary calculation represent cost of sales excluding dda net of treatment and refining charges these costs are then divided by geo sold in the case of chapada costs directly attributable to geo and copper will be allocated on that attributable basis non attributable costs will be allocated based on the relative value of revenues for each metal which will be determined annually at the beginning of each year cash costs of copper attributable copper sales costs divided by commercial copper pounds sold aisc figures are calculated in accordance with a standard developed by the world gold council wgc a non regulatory market development organization for the gold industry adoption of the standard is voluntary and the cost measures presented herein may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies aisc per sold seeks to represent total sustaining expenditures of producing and selling geo from current operations the total costs used as the numerator of the unitary calculation represent cash costs defined above and includes cost components of mine sustaining capital expenditures including stripping and underground mine development corporate and mine site general and administrative expense sustaining mine site exploration and evaluation expensed and capitalized and accretion and amortization of reclamation and remediation aisc do not include capital expenditures attributable to projects or mine expansions exploration and evaluation costs attributable to growth projects income tax payments borrowing costs and dividend payments consequently this measure is not representative of all of the company s cash expenditures in addition the calculation of aisc does not include depletion depreciation and amortization expense as it does not reflect the impact of expenditures incurred in prior periods aisc per geo sold reflect allocations of the aforementioned cost components on the basis that is consistent with the nature of each of the cost component to the geo production and sales activities aisc per pound of copper reflect allocations of the aforementioned cost components on the basis that is consistent with the nature of each of the cost component to geo or copper production activities net debt the company uses the financial measure net debt which is a non gaap financial measure to supplement information in its consolidated financial statements the company believes that in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with ifrs the company and certain investors and analysts use this information to evaluate the company s performance the non gaap financial measure of net debt does not have any standardized meaning prescribed under ifrs and therefore it may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies the data is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with ifrs net debt is calculated as the sum of the current and non current portions of long term debt net of the cash and cash equivalents balance as at the balance sheet date a reconciliation of net debt at december 31 2019 and 2018 is provided in section 11 of the company

financial measures average realized gold price average realized silver price and average realized copper price which are non gaap financial measures to supplement in its consolidated financial

company and certain investors and analysts use this information to evaluate the company s performance the presentation of adjusted measures are not meant to be a substitute for net earnings or loss or net earnings or loss per share presented in accordance with ifrs but rather should be evaluated in conjunction with such ifrs measures adjusted earnings or loss and adjusted earnings or loss per share

adjustments calculated at the statutory effective rate for the same jurisdiction as the adjustment non recurring adjustments from unusual events or circumstances are reviewed from time to time based on materiality and the nature of the event or circumstance earnings adjustments for the comparative period reflect both continuing and discontinued operations the terms adjusted earnings or loss and adjusted earnings or loss per share do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by ifrs and therefore the company s definitions are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies management uses these measures for internal valuation of the core mining performance for the period and to assist with planning and forecasting of future operations management believes that the presentation of adjusted earnings or loss and adjusted earnings or loss per share provide useful information to investors because they exclude non recurring items items not related to or not indicative of current or future period s results and or not directly related to the core mining business and are a better indication of the company s profitability from operations as evaluated by internal management and the board of directors the items excluded from the computation of adjusted earnings or loss and adjusted earnings or loss per share which are otherwise included in the determination of net earnings or loss and net earnings or loss per share prepared in accordance with ifrs are items that the company does not consider to be meaningful in evaluating the company s past financial performance or the future prospects and may hinder a comparison of its period to period profitability additional line items or subtotals in financial statements the company uses the following additional line items and subtotals in the consolidated financial statements as contemplated in ias 1 presentation of financial statements gross margin excluding depletion depreciation and

drilling services and completion and production services segments were 429 million and 24 million respectively representing a 4 and 62 increase from 2018 we commercialized our alphaautomation technology offering with our 32 field deployed systems earning commercial rates drilling approximately 613 wells in 2019 an increase of 69 over the prior year precision s president and ceo kevin neveu stated during the fourth quarter precision s strong financial results were led by rising canadian activity in our contract drilling services and completion and production services segments firm international activity and flattening customer demand in the u s as a result of precision s high performance high value strategy market positioning in key basins commercialization of alphaautomation intense cost control and cash management efforts we generated adjusted ebitda of 105 million and cash provided by operations of 75 million results delivered this quarter demonstrate precision s ability to consistently generate cash reduce debt and repurchase shares in canada precision maintained its record level market share supported by leading market positions in the montney duvernay and heavy oil regions our 26 ac super triples and over 60 super singles provide precision an unmatched scale efficiency and competitive advantage throughout all key regions in the western canadian market this momentum has continued into the first quarter of 2020 as seasonal customer demand has remained strong well into february the company reached a peak of 83 active rigs in january compared with a peak of 62 up 34 from the first quarter of 2019 and has 80 rigs running today compared to 55 this time last year although longer term canadian demand will be driven by customer capital discipline and commodity prices we expect our market positioning and scale in our canadian drilling segment to continue to generate strong cash flows throughout the course of the year in the u s precision s fourth quarter average rig count was in line with our expectations and generated sequentially improved margins supported by firm day rates and aggressive cost management our rig count ended the year softer than anticipated due to a large customer reducing operations and idling three contracted ac st 1500 s precision remains confident in its ability to redeploy these rigs as the oil and gas operators continue to high grade drilling operations in 2020 we anticipate capital discipline operating efficiency and industrial scale will remain central themes in the u s market and customer spending behavior will be largely defined by remaining within cash flow and maximizing drilling efficiencies these market trends align well with precision s high performance high value strategy our alpha technologies offering and our ability to deliver industrial efficiencies to our customers internationally the business remains a stable source of cash generation looking to 2020 precision will continue to leverage its expanded scale in kuwait and will prioritize reactivating idle assets in the middle east region precision s completion and production services segment finished the year on firm footing generating strong free cash flow improved margins and good progress on both pricing and market share despite a highly fractured market our team has focused and delivered on effectively managing all elements within their control including reducing fixed and variable costs strong operational performance training and crewing rigs and ensuring the integrity of the assets all while continuing to effectively manage customer relationships we expect customer spending in 2020 will largely be tied to the commodity macro and our scale and operational efficiency will continue to support free cash flow generation in the current environment precision delivered on its 2019 strategic priorities established at the beginning of the year first the company generated substantial free cash flow allowing us to exceed our annual debt repayment targets for the second consecutive year by paying down 205 million of debt since the beginning of 2018 precision has reduced its debt levels by 412 million already eclipsing the low end of our four year targeted debt reduction range of 400 million to 600 million by end of year 2021 for 2020 we plan to reduce debt by 100 million to 150 million and are now providing guidance for an additional year with a goal to reduce debt by 700 million between 2018 and 2022 second precision continued to leverage its scale and high performance super series fleet to drive both strong operating margins and market share gains in the u s and canada finally the company delivered on its technology initiatives for the year achieving full commercialization of our alphaautomation system achieving our alphaautomation commercialization milestone was a result of three years of field hardening the technology with over 1 100 wells drilled to date extensive training of over 100 crews and close collaboration with our customers to demonstrate the efficiency and value this technology delivers looking to 2020 we plan to deploy an additional 24 alphaautomation systems driven by continued customer demand to maximize drilling efficiencies additionally precision remains focused on commercializing 15 or more alphaapps which will further expand

summary for the three months ended december 31 2019 revenue was 372 million 13 lower than the fourth quarter of 2018 revenue decreased due to lower activity in the u s and canada partially offset by higher average day rates in the u s and higher international activity compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 our drilling activity decreased 21 in the u s 13 in canada and grew 11 internationally our 2019 fourth quarter revenue from our contract drilling services and completion and production services segments decreased 14 and 5 respectively from the comparable 2018 quarter general and administrative expenses were 26 million 4 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2018 excluding the effect of share based incentive compensation expense for the quarter our general and administrative expenses decreased by 8 million from 2018 the lower expenses in the current quarter were primarily the result of continued fixed cost control initiatives and the impact of lease related charges due to the adoption of ifrs 16 see discussion on share based incentive compensation under other items later in this release for additional details adjusted ebitda see non gaap measures was 105 million a decrease of 29 million from the fourth quarter of 2018 our adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenue was 28 this quarter compared with 31 in the comparative quarter of 2018 operating earnings see non gaap measures were 8 million compared with negative 172 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 lower adjusted ebitda and operating earnings in 2019 were primarily due to reduced u s and canadian activity higher share based incentive compensation expense and the non recurring receipt of the transaction termination fee in the fourth quarter of 2018 in the 2019 quarter we decommissioned 29 drilling rigs resulting in a loss on asset decommissioning of 20 million with the adoption of ifrs 16 lease related charges of 3 million in the quarter were recognized through finance charges and depreciation and amortization expense historically these charges were reflected in operating and general and administrative expense total share based incentive compensation expense for the quarter was 7 million compared with a recovery of 12 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 see discussion on rig decommissioning and share based incentive compensation under other items for additional details net finance charges were 28 million a decrease of 4 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 primarily due to a reduction in interest expense related to retired debt partially offset by 1 million of lease accretion charges resulting from the adoption of ifrs 16 revenue per utilization day in the u s increased in the fourth quarter of 2019 to us 23 949 from us 23 369 in the prior year quarter the increase was the result of higher day rates idle but contracted rig revenue and rig technology revenue partially offset by lower turnkey activity during the quarter we had us 3 million of revenue from each of idle but contracted rigs and turnkey projects as compared with fourth quarter 2018 idle but contracted rig and turnkey revenue of us 0 3 million and us 11 million respectively on a sequential basis revenue per utilization day excluding revenue from turnkey and idle but contracted rigs was consistent with the third quarter of 2019 operating costs on a per day basis decreased to us 14 073 in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with us 15 042 in 2018 the decrease was mainly due to lower turnkey activity the impact from the reversal of prior period provisions and the componentization of rig recertification costs excluding the impact of the provision reversals and componentization of recertification costs our operating costs on a per day basis for the quarter were us 14 974 see discussion on change of rig components under other items for additional details in canada average revenue per utilization day for contract drilling rigs was 22 182 compared with 22 802 in the fourth quarter of 2018 the lower average revenue per utilization day in the fourth quarter of 2019 was primarily due to lower rates from a higher proportion of super singles in our rig mix and lower shortfall payments partially offset by higher technology revenue we did not receive shortfall payments in the fourth quarter of 2019 as compared to 1 million in the 2018 quarter average operating costs per utilization day for drilling rigs in canada decreased to 14 791 compared with the prior year quarter of 15 115 the decrease was mainly caused by the impact of lower repair and maintenance costs due to the componentization of rig recertification costs excluding the impact of componentization of recertifications our operating costs on a per day basis for the quarter were 15 044 we realized revenue from international contract drilling of us 43 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 an increase of us 4 million over the prior year period average revenue per utilization day in our international contract drilling business was us 52 283 compared with us 51 982 in the respective prior year quarter the higher average rate in 2019 was primarily due to day rate increases from the renewal and extension of drilling contracts and the deployment of our sixth kuwait rig funds provided by operations see non gaap measures in the fourth quarter of 2019 were 76 million a decrease of 17 million from the prior year comparative quarter cash provided by operations was 75 million versus 93 million in the prior year quarter the decrease in funds and cash provided by operations was primarily the result of lower activity and the non recurring transaction termination fee that was received in the fourth quarter of 2018 capital expenditures were 22 million in the fourth quarter 8 million lower than the same period in 2018 capital spending for the quarter included 8 million for upgrade and expansion capital and 14 million for the maintenance of existing assets infrastructure spending and intangibles summary for the year ended december 31 2019 revenue for the year ended december 31 2019 totaled 1 541 million consistent with 2018 operating earnings see non gaap measures were 95 million an increase of 293 million from 2018 as a percentage of revenue operating earnings improved to 6 compared to negative 13 in 2018 in 2019 operating earnings were positively impacted by increased international drilling activity higher u s and international average day rates gains on asset disposals partially offset by lower canadian drilling activity the non recurring transaction termination fee and loss on asset decommissioning and higher share based compensation expense in addition during the fourth quarter of 2018 we incurred goodwill impairment charges of 208 million general and administrative costs were 104 million a decrease of 8 million from 2018 the decrease in costs was primarily the result of continued fixed cost control initiatives and the impact of lease related charges due to the adoption of ifrs 16 partially offset by higher share based incentive compensation and the weakening of the canadian dollar on our u s dollar denominated costs see other items later in this release net finance charges were 118 million a decrease of 9 million from 2018 primarily due to a reduction in interest expense related to debt retired in 2018 and 2019 partially offset by the weakening of the canadian dollar on our u s dollar denominated interest expense funds provided by operations see non gaap measures in 2019 were 293 million a decrease of 19 million from 311 million in the prior year cash provided by operations was 288 million in 2019 as compared to 293 million in 2018 the decrease in funds and cash provided by operations was primarily the result of the non recurring transaction termination fee that was received in the fourth quarter of 2018 capital expenditures were 161 million in 2019 an increase of 35 million over 2018 capital spending for 2019 included 121 million for upgrade and expansion capital and 40 million on the maintenance of existing assets infrastructure and intangibles our 2019 upgrade and expansion capital were mainly comprised of one u s new build one u s scr to ac triple upgrade the kuwait new build rig and long lead capital items our new build and upgraded rigs were backed by long term drilling contracts strategy precision s strategic priorities for 2019 were as follows generate strong free cash flow and utilize 200 million to reduce debt in 2019 in the fourth quarter of 2019 we generated 75 million in cash provided by operations and further reduced our debt balance by 59 million through open market repurchases and redemptions of our unsecured senior notes for the full year 2019 precision exceeded our 2019 debt reduction target with total debt repayments of 205 million maximize financial results by leveraging our high performance high value super series rig fleet and scale with disciplined cost management in the fourth quarter of 2019 precision continued operating at record market share levels in the u s and canada and have leveraged our size and scale to maximize cash flow in the u s operating margins revenue less operating costs were up 19 compared to the prior year quarter despite decreased canadian industry activity levels our canadian drilling operations generated strong cash flow and our completion and production services business contributed 6 million of adjusted ebitda precision also continued to leverage its expanded footprint in kuwait with our sixth kuwait rig commencing drilling on july 1 2019 increasing our economies of scale and operating margins in the region for the full year 2019 precision reported adjusted ebitda of 392 million up 5

compared with 81 for the u s and 60 for canada at the same time last year industry conditions we expect tier 1 rigs to remain the preferred rigs of customers globally the economic value created by the significant drilling and mobility efficiencies delivered by the most advanced xy pad walking rigs has been highlighted and widely accepted by our customers the trend to longer reach horizontal completions and importance of the rig delivering these complex wells consistently and efficiently has been well established by the industry we expect demand for leading edge high efficiency tier 1 rigs will continue to strengthen relative to less capable rigs as drilling rig capability has been a key economic facilitator of horizontal unconventional resource exploitation development and field application of drilling equipment process automation coupled with closed loop drilling controls and de manning of rigs will continue this technical evolution while creating further cost efficiencies and performance value for customers capital spending capital spending in 2020 is expected to be 95 million and includes 58 million for sustaining infrastructure and intangibles and 37 million for

utilization day excluding revenue from turnkey and idle but contracted rigs was consistent with the third quarter of 2019 in canada average revenue per utilization day for contract drilling rigs was 22 182 compared with 22 802 in the fourth quarter of 2018 the lower average revenue per utilization day in the fourth quarter of 2019 was primarily due to lower rates from a higher proportion of super singles in our rig mix and lower shortfall payments partially offset by higher technology revenue we did not receive shortfall payments in the fourth quarter of 2019 as compared to 1 million in the 2018 quarter average revenue per utilization day in our international contract drilling business was us 52 283 compared with us 51 982 in the respective prior year quarter the higher average rate in 2019 was primarily due to day rate increases from the renewal and extension of drilling contracts and the deployment of the sixth kuwait rig partially offset by lower amortization of the initial upfront mobilization revenue directional drilling services realized revenue of 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 consistent with 2018 in the u s 66 of utilization days were generated from rigs under term contract as compared with 70 in the fourth quarter of 2018 in canada 9 of our utilization days in the quarter were generated from rigs under term contract compared with 15 in the fourth quarter of 2018 operating costs were 64 of revenue for the quarter 2 lower than the prior year quarter our u s operating costs on a per day basis decreased to us 14 073 in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with us 15 042 in 2018 the decrease was mainly due to lower turnkey activity the impact from the reversal of prior period provisions and the componentization of rig recertification costs excluding the impact of the provision reversals and componentization of recertification costs our operating costs on a per day basis for the quarter were us 14 974 in the u s on a sequential basis operating costs per day decreased by us 414 due to lower repair and maintenance costs third party charges partially offset by higher turnkey costs average operating costs per utilization day for drilling rigs in canada decreased to 14 791 compared with the prior year quarter of 15 115 the decrease was mainly caused by the impact of lower repair and maintenance costs due to the componentization of rig recertification costs excluding the impact of componentization of recertifications our operating costs on a per day basis for the quarter were 15 044 depreciation expense in the quarter was 26 lower than the fourth quarter of 2018 the lower 2019 expense was primarily due to asset sales assets becoming fully depreciated and non recurring accelerated depreciation of excess spare equipment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018 in 2019 we recognized a loss on the decommissioning of drilling rigs and ancillary equipment of 20 million see discussion on rig decommissioning

production services decreased 2 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 due to lower activity in our rental and camp and catering divisions and the impact of the disposal of our snubbing units and waste water assets partially offset by higher well service activity in canada and the u s our service rig operating hours in the quarter were up 11 from the fourth quarter of 2018 while average service rig revenue per operating hour decreased slightly to 746 excluding the impact of snubbing assets which were disposed in the first quarter our fourth quarter 2019 service activity and rates increased 20 and 5 respectively over the comparative 2018 period approximately 78 of our fourth quarter canadian service rig activity was oil related adjusted ebitda see non gaap measures of 6 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 11 lower than the 2018 quarter primarily due to lower activity in our non well servicing divisions and the impact of asset disposals partially offset by higher well service activity and lower costs resulting from our cost control measures during the fourth quarter the segment generated 81 of its revenue from canadian operations and 19 from u s operations compared with 90 from canada and 10 in the u s in the 2018 quarter operating costs as a percentage of revenue was 77 compared with the prior year comparative quarter of 78 the reduction of operating costs as a percentage of revenue was primarily the result of a higher proportion of 24 hour well service work and continued cost control depreciation expense in the quarter was 20 lower than the prior year comparative period the decrease in depreciation expense was primarily due to a lower capital asset base resulting from the disposition of snubbing units and waste water assets and assets becoming fully depreciated in the first quarter of 2019 as a cost control measure precision did not renew the registration of 75 canadian based well service rigs with industry associations due to low anticipated activity levels for the year segment review of corporate and other our corporate and other segment provides support functions to our operating segments the corporate and other segment had negative adjusted ebitda see non gaap measures of 14 million compared with adjusted ebitda of 5 million in the comparative 2018 quarter the lower adjusted ebitda in 2019 was primarily the result of higher share based incentive compensation in the current quarter and the non recurring receipt of the transaction termination fee in the fourth quarter of 2018 other items share based incentive compensation plans we have several cash settled share based incentive plans and two equity settled share based incentive plans details of vesting conditions fair value determination and

fourth quarter of 2019 was an expense of 4 million compared to a recovery of 14 million in the comparable 2018 quarter the higher share based compensation expense in 2019 was the result of our share price increasing in the 2019 fourth quarter versus a decline in the 2018 quarter executive psu share based incentive compensation expense for the quarter was 3 million compared with 2 million in the same quarter in 2018 the increased compensation expense was the result of additional executive psus granted in 2019 offset partially by lower fair values for the 2019 grants finance charges net finance charges were 28 million a decrease of 4 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 primarily due to a reduction in interest expense related to the debt retired in 2018 and 2019 partially

2019 we decommissioned certain drilling and ancillary equipment that no longer met our high performance technology standards included in the decommissioned assets were those drilling rigs previously held for sale we recognized a 20 million loss on the decommissioning of these assets change in rig components in the fourth quarter of 2019 we performed our annual review of estimated useful lives residual values and methods and components of depreciation of property plant and equipment due to changes in circumstance surrounding the timing nature and complexity of rig recertifications we determined the associated costs represent a separate component of property plant and equipment this change has been recognized prospectively and is expected to increase our 2020 depreciation expense by approximately 3 million income tax income tax recovery for the quarter was 12 million compared with 2 million in the same quarter in 2018 in 2019 the province of alberta announced various reductions to corporate income tax rates that when fully implemented over the next three years will decrease the provincial corporate income tax rate from 12 to 8 by 2022 the increase in the income tax recovery for the quarter was mainly due to a larger fourth quarter loss prior to the non taxable portion of the goodwill impairment in 2018 adjustments for prior period taxes reversal of unrecognized tax benefits and u s tax reform legislation clarification enacted in december 2019 offset by a reduction in the benefit from the alberta income tax rate reductions liquidity and capital

is impacted under ifrs 16 leases classified as operating leases were recognized on our statement of financial position with a right of use asset and corresponding lease obligation representing the present value of precision s future lease payments once recognized right of use assets are depreciated over the shorter of their useful life and the term of the lease the lease obligation is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method under this approach an interest charge is applied to accrete the lease obligation to the present value of future lease payments as lease payments are made the lease obligation is reduced historically operating lease obligations were accounted for as off balance sheet and lease expenses were only recognized at the time of payment in either operating or general and administrative expense however under ifrs 16 lease costs are reflected on the statement of earnings loss through depreciation and interest expense resulting in an increase to adjusted ebitda upon transition we recognized right of use assets and corresponding lease obligations of 73 million for the three months and year ended december 31 2019 we recorded lease interest charges of 1 million and 3 million and depreciated our right of use assets by 2 million and 8 million respectively as a result of the new lease standard our adjusted ebitda was positively impacted for

calculated after excluding the impacts of exchange rate movements and acquisitions and disposals exchange rates impact is calculated by translating the current year results at the prior year s exchange rates for acquisitions in the current year the post acquisition results are excluded from the organic movement calculations for acquisitions in the prior year post acquisition results are included in the prior year but are included in the organic movement calculation from the anniversary of the acquisition date in the current year where a business brand brand distribution right or agency agreement was disposed of or terminated in the prior year the group in the organic movement calculations excludes the results for that business from the prior year for disposals or terminations in the current year the group excludes the results for that business from the prior year from the date of the disposal or termination this measure enables to focus on the performance of the business

sterling has rallied on the expectation that there will now be aggressive fiscal stimulus measures to boost the economy stock markets did not show any dismay at mr javid s departure you have to go back a long way to october 1989 for the last time that a chancellor of the exchequer resigned over the influence of an advisor on that occasion nigel lawson resigned from margaret thatcher s government following a clash over the interference of her chief economic adviser sir alan walters history does not repeat itself but it rhymes as mark twain said sajid javid s resignation followed a refusal to sack his advisers at the behest of boris johnson the parallels with mr lawson s resignation end though with the market reaction on each occasion back in 1989 investors were horrified at mr lawson s resignation with the ftse 100 falling by 2 2 while the pound fell sharply against the us dollar and against the deutschemark today market reaction has been very different yes the ftse 100 is lower but so are equity markets everywhere due to news of a rise in new cases of the coronavirus covid 19 in china the footsie s reverse if it does seem more exaggerated reflects the heavy weighting in the index of oil and mining stocks whose fortunes are strongly influenced by china s economy advertisement there is nothing in the ftse 100 s performance today to imply any similar dismay at mr javid s departure the more telling reaction has been in the pound and in gilts uk government bonds although sterling fell briefly on news that mr javid had resigned making him the first chancellor since the late iain macleod 50 years ago not to have presented a budget it later rallied against the us dollar and the euro rising by more than 1 against the latter a significant move the reaction suggests investors expect mr javid s successor rishi sunak to be less fiscally prudent mr javid was known to have argued against turning on the spending taps as aggressively as mr johnson and his chief adviser dominic cummings wanted image the pound climbed against the us dollar mr sunak is seen as someone more likely to do mr johnson s bidding adam seagrave head of global sales trading at saxo markets said the initial reaction has been weaker sterling but we are now seeing a rally to a new high this is presumably the market interpreting the announcement as boris wanting advisors who are more willing to back aggressive fiscal stimulus on that basis a big increase in public spending aimed at stimulating the economy would make an interest rate cut from the bank of england less necessary which all other things being equal is supportive for the pound the same reasoning underpins moves in the gilt market the yield on 10 year uk government bonds bond yields rise as the price falls rose to its highest level for more than three weeks on today s events in other words because investors expect a big increase in public spending at the budget they also expect more gilt issuance as chancellors unless they already have money in the kitty either pay for extra spending with more borrowing or higher taxes so the market is anticipating higher gilt issuance the big question is the extent to which the budget presented next month by mr sunak a former employee of the wall street banking giant goldman sachs and the hedge fund tci is his as mr javid and his treasury officials had prepared a budget to be prepared last autumn before mr johnson called a general election the chances have to be that a lot of the ground work had already been done please use chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1 18 what does change of chancellor mean for investors nimesh shah a partner at the accounting and tax advisory firm blick rothenberg said we would expect a lot of the budget material will already be in place more so because a budget was already planned before the election which had to be postponed however any major changes and decisions that were to be announced would presumably need to be put on hold and assessed by the new chancellor although markets are assuming mr sunak will be more profligate than mr javid as mr johnson seeks to reward northerners who voted conservative for the first time with extra spending in their area there is now uncertainty about specific policy measures chancellors quite often like to test the popularity of measures they are planning in their budget by leaking details of them to the newspapers and seeing how they play some of the kites flown very publicly by mr javid recently included the possibility of a mansion tax and of further cuts to the tax relief enjoyed by higher earners on their pension contributions a particularly disastrous policy of the former chancellor george osborne which has created a staffing crisis in the nhs mr shah said there has been suggestion higher or additional rate relief for pension contributions could be scrapped and a wealth tax on property introduced but surely such significant proposals would almost certainly need to be reconsidered by the new chancellor savvas savouri the influential chief economist at the hedge fund manager toscafund is confident that mr sunak will do a good job he told clients this afternoon no doubt the news that we now have a new chancellor to take this on so close to the budget will have shocked many to my mind rishi sunak is educationally and professionally suited for the role he has been rightly elevated to after two questionable tory chancellors and one who never actually delivered a budget i have no doubt fourth time is a charm image could a plan to raise the threshold for the 40p rate of income tax be revived dr savouri said that far from introducing a mansion tax he expected mr sunak to boost the property market by addressing the damage done to housing market activity by mr osborne s increases at the top end he added this brand new and extremely capable chancellor is justified in providing our property market with a boost not least by announcing an immediate end to mr osborne s ill conceived stamp duty surcharge more broadly i have full confidence that we are about to be presented with a budget fundamentally good for the uk economy including an environmentally and economically sensible generous car scrappage scheme mr shah said it was also possible that now mr javid had been replaced some of the prime minister s pledges when running for conservative party leadership such as raising to 80 000 the threshold at which the 40p rate on income tax kicks in could yet be revived he added this was expected to cost the treasury around 8bn and it still remains difficult to see how such a tax cut could be justified given the significant spending plans however nothing should be ruled out now as boris johnson could finally get his way with this measure as george buckley economist at japanese bank nomura put it i suspect is likely to do whatever boris johnson tells him to do i doubt it will mean tighter fiscal policy the backdrop to all of this is that with interest rates low across the world markets are no longer punishing profligate government spending in the manner that they were in the years immediately after the financial crisis that was when gordon brown s government and later the coalition government were forced to take action to bring the budget deficit down or for example when the eurozone sovereign debt crisis forced countries like greece portugal spain and ireland to introduce austerity measures these are different times as the experience in the united states shows donald trump having introduced big tax cuts for businesses and the wealthy has allowed the budget deficit to let rip and markets are perfectly relaxed about it messrs johnson and cummings have doubtless noticed

eq ounces gold production during the quarter was impacted by lower throughput at the mill facility and the expected lower grade ore from phase 2 as the ore from phase 1 was mined out as planned operating expenses were 1 278 per gold eq ounce for the quarter and 962 per gold eq ounce for the year and included a non cash inventory write down of 14 million primarily related to the derecognition of the low grade stockpile as inventory operating expenses per gold eq ounce for the three months and year ended december 31 2019 increased when compared to the prior year periods as lower grade gold ore was mined and processed total cash costs were 1 032 per gold eq ounce for the quarter and 910 per gold eq ounce for the year achieving guidance of 870 to 950 per gold eq ounce total cash costs per gold eq ounce for the three months and year ended december 31 2019 increased when compared to the prior year periods as lower grade gold ore was mined and processed sustaining capital net of proceeds from disposal of assets and sustaining lease payments for the quarter increased to 79 million which primarily related to the completion of the stage 2 tailings management area tma dam construction installation of wick drains for stabilization of the east waste dump ongoing renovations of the camp facility and construction work for the rescoped maintenance and warehouse facilities and 12 million of capitalized mining costs sustaining capital net of proceeds from disposal of assets and sustaining lease payments for the year were 189 million including 32 million of capitalized mining costs in line with reduced annual sustaining capital estimates of 175 to 190 million from 210 230 million due to cost reductions of approximately 15 million related to the tma and the rescoped maintenance and warehouse facilities as well as the deferral of capital to 2020 of approximately 20 million aisc were 2 429 per gold eq ounce for the quarter impacted by higher sustaining capital spend during the quarter primarily related to the completion of substantially all deferred construction capital projects as noted above as well as higher capitalized mining costs aisc for the year was 1 630 per gold eq ounce below guidance of 1 690 to 1 790 per gold eq ounce due to lower than planned sustaining capital for the year growth capital for the year was 6 8 million higher than annual guidance of approximately 3 million primarily related to the purchase of underground infrastructure during the quarter approximately 1 8 million ore tonnes and 10 7 million waste tonnes including 3 9 million capitalized waste tonnes were mined from the open pit at an average strip ratio of 5 99 1 as phase 2 waste stripping continued to be prioritized during the quarter earlier in the year the decision was made to prioritize waste stripping in order to prepare ore faces in anticipation of the updated life of mine plan additionally 0 8 million tonnes of out pit material were mined during the quarter for use in planned dam raises total tonnes mined per day for the quarter averaged 136 124 tonnes per day an increase of more than 20 over the prior three quarters mill throughput for the quarter averaged 22 521 tonnes per day as previously disclosed due to an extended period of heavy rainfall in the area the mill operated at lower capacity in october in order to manage water levels in the tma once the stage 2 tma dam construction was completed in late october which provided approximately 7 to 8 million cubic meters of additional tma capacity mill throughput increased to average 24 858 tonnes per day for november and december exceeding the target range of 24 000 tonnes per day original design was 21 000 tonnes per day mill availability for the quarter averaged 89 achieving target levels with all major mill upgrades substantially completed as the mill has demonstrated consistent operations at target levels there remains potential for further increases in mill throughput in the coming quarters as mill availability improves and the pebble crusher is commissioned gold recovery averaged 91 for the quarter in line with plan subsequent to period end the company completed a comprehensive mine optimization study that includes a review of alternative open pit and underground mining scenarios which achieved the overall objective of improving the return on investment over the life of the mine the results of the study were released on february 13 2020 as operational performance has improved over the past five quarters the focus is now shifting from stabilizing operations to optimizing operational and cost performance to support this initiative the company has engaged an external consultant to support improved overall equipment efficiencies with the objective of optimizing open pit

annual guidance of 250 000 to 275 000 gold eq ounces gold production during the quarter was impacted by lower throughput at the mill facility and the expected lower grade ore from phase 2 as the ore from phase 1 was mined out as planned operating expenses were 1 278 per gold eq ounce for the quarter and 962 per gold eq ounce for the year and included a non cash inventory write down of 14 million primarily related to the derecognition of the low grade stockpile as inventory operating expenses per gold eq ounce for the three months and year ended december 31 2019 increased when compared to the prior year periods as lower grade gold ore was mined and processed total cash costs were 1 032 per gold eq ounce for the quarter and 910 per gold eq ounce for the year achieving guidance of 870 to 950

tailings management area tma dam construction installation of wick drains for stabilization of the east waste dump ongoing renovations of the camp facility and construction work for the rescoped maintenance and warehouse facilities and 12 million of capitalized mining costs sustaining capital net of proceeds from disposal of assets and sustaining lease payments for the year were 189 million including 32 million of capitalized mining costs in line with reduced annual sustaining capital estimates of 175 to 190 million from 210 230 million due to cost reductions of approximately 15 million related to the tma and the rescoped maintenance and warehouse facilities as well as the deferral of capital to 2020 of approximately 20 million aisc were 2 429 per gold eq ounce for the quarter impacted by higher sustaining capital spend during the quarter primarily related to the completion of substantially all deferred construction capital projects as noted above as well as higher capitalized mining costs aisc for the year was 1 630 per gold eq ounce below guidance of 1 690 to 1 790 per gold eq ounce due to lower than planned sustaining capital for the year growth capital for the year was 6 8 million higher than annual guidance of approximately 3 million primarily related to the purchase of underground infrastructure during the quarter approximately 1 8 million ore tonnes and 10 7 million waste tonnes including 3 9 million capitalized waste tonnes were mined from the open pit at an average strip ratio of 5 99 1 as phase 2 waste stripping continued to be prioritized during the quarter earlier in the year the decision was made to prioritize waste stripping in order to prepare ore faces in anticipation of the updated life of mine plan additionally 0 8 million tonnes of out pit material were mined during the quarter for use in planned dam raises total tonnes mined per day for the quarter averaged 136 124 tonnes per day an increase of more than 20 over the prior three quarters mill throughput for the quarter averaged 22 521 tonnes per day as previously disclosed due to an extended period of heavy rainfall in the area the mill operated at lower capacity in october in order to manage water levels in the tma once the stage 2 tma dam construction was completed in late october which provided approximately 7 to 8 million cubic meters of additional tma capacity mill throughput increased to average 24 858 tonnes per day for november and december exceeding the target range of 24 000 tonnes per day original design was 21 000 tonnes per day mill availability for the quarter averaged 89 achieving target levels with all major mill upgrades substantially completed as the mill has demonstrated consistent operations at target levels there remains potential for further increases in mill throughput in the coming quarters as mill availability improves and the pebble crusher is commissioned gold recovery averaged 91 for the quarter in line with plan subsequent to period end the company completed a comprehensive mine optimization study that includes a review of alternative open pit and underground mining scenarios which achieved the overall objective of improving the return on investment over the life of the mine the results of the study were released on february 13 2020 as operational performance has improved over the past five quarters the focus is now shifting from stabilizing operations to optimizing operational and cost performance to support this initiative the company has engaged an external consultant to support improved overall equipment efficiencies with the objective of optimizing open pit mining productivity and unit cost performance exploration activities continued in the fourth quarter with the completion of the

gold and 79 4 million pounds of copper for the year achieving production guidance of 215 000 to 245 000 gold eq ounces production in the quarter was impacted by unscheduled belt repairs that resulted in mill feed being supplemented by the intermediate grade stockpile gold eq production was impacted by the lower realized copper price operating expenses were 678 per gold eq ounce for the quarter and 517 per gold eq ounce for the year impacted by costs related to belt repairs noted above and lower gold eq ounces due the lower copper price total cash costs were 833 per gold eq ounce for the quarter and 647 per gold eq ounce for the year slightly above guidance of 600 to 640 per gold eq ounce primarily due to the lower gold eq ounces related to the lower copper price the increase in operating expenses per gold eq ounce total cash costs per gold eq ounce for the three months and year ended december 31 2019 when compared to the prior year periods was primarily driven by higher operating expenses associated with the mining and processing of lower grade gold and copper ore sustaining capital and sustaining lease payments for the quarter were 10 7 million and 38 0 for the year below annual guidance of 45 to 55 million due to improved cost efficiencies realized on development meters as well as the impact of working capital as payments for capital projects incurred later in the fourth quarter are expected in the first quarter of 2020 sustaining capital was primarily related to b3 mine development and a tailings dam raise aisc were 1 076 per gold eq ounce for the quarter and 829 per gold eq ounce for the year achieving guidance of 810 to 890 per gold eq ounce the increase in aisc per gold eq ounce for the three months and year ended december 31 2019 when compared to the prior year periods was primarily driven by higher total cash costs and sustaining capital expenditures growth capital was 10 5 million for the quarter and 24 1 million for the year primarily related to c zone development below annual guidance of 40 to 45 million this was due to realized cost efficiencies in development metres as well as the impact on working capital as payments for capital projects incurred later in the fourth quarter are expected in the first quarter of 2020 the supergene recovery circuit is complete and operating at target recoveries and utilization efforts during the quarter continued to focus on de risking the execution of the c zone project primarily focusing on the finalization of the tailings disposal plan and advancing permitting efforts sub level cave slc

in a post colonial world the views on the issue are conflicting divisive and constantly evolving global voices follow published in adinkra 8 min read feb 11 2020 listen share by filip noubel françafrique is a term that describes the historical relationship between france and its former colonies in sub saharan africa like most colonial and post colonial constructs it was rarely challenged in france for decades but today the idea of françafrique is highly contested in both france and africa a portmanteau linking france and the french word for africa its earliest use dating back to 1955 is attributed to then ivoirian president félix houphouët boigny who used the term to highlight the good relations between france and its former colonies in its broadest definition it encompasses the political financial military cultural and linguistic relations between france and the countries that came under french rule or influence benin burkina faso central african republic chad comoros côte d ivoire djibouti gabon guinea madagascar mali mauritania niger and senegal those 21 countries gained independence mostly in the 1960s but the concept of françafrique continues to be debated around the following questions who designed the framework for these multiple relations who benefits and how what are the motivations both declared and hidden of the actors involved where is the future of this relationship in the 21st century is françafrique still relevant and needed in a post colonial world the views on this issue are of course numerous but also conflicting divisive and constantly evolving across time and language the process of acknowledging assessing and overcoming the trauma of colonization is indeed a long and painful one the evolution of a concept in the aftermath of world war ii a wave of pro independence movements swept across french colonies in africa and asia eventually forcing france to recognize the legitimacy of their right to self determination france however having enriched itself by exploiting energy resources and mines in its colonies was eager to keep privileged access to such resources paris was also preoccupied with its image as a world power and saw sub saharan africa as its pré carré own backyard from which to protect against both soviet and american influence by maintaining military bases general charles de gaulle then president of france saw an opportunity to maintain his country s influence in sub saharan africa by creating a web of relations that would serve its economic diplomatic ideological and domestic political goals boulevard du general charles de gaulle is the main street of pointe noire republic of congo photo by david stanley april 9 2015 cc by 2 0 boulevard du general charles de gaulle is the main street of pointe noire republic of congo photo by david stanley april 9 2015 cc by 2 0 well into the 1990s african money was also used in generally undisclosed ways to finance france s political parties with african emissaries traveling to france with suitcases full of cash seeking regardless of who won the election to cement french politicians loyalty and support for certain african heads of state legislation on the financing of french political parties was amended in the 1990s but there is evidence that this practice continued after that period it was not until the late 1990s however that the concept of françafrique began to be challenged in france in an influential 1998 essay titled la françafrique le plus long scandale de la république françafrique the longest scandal of the republic french economist and activist françois xavier verschave unpacked the aspects of this web of policies that were kept carefully invisible for a long period of time for verschave the term also included a humorous wordplay fric is a french slang word for cash no french president however would question the concept of françafrique publicly until 2012 when president françois hollande stated it was time to end françafrique nevertheless maintaining france s influence particularly to advance its security interests remains a priority for french politicians to this day views of françafrique in france vary from nostalgia from the colonial period especially among the right wing to outright criticism of its policies often sparked by media investigations but increasingly so by academics civil society ngo activists and french african community leaders this increasing rejection of french influence is also exemplified by the movement toward restitution of african artworks and advanced by activists like kemi seba a controversial pan african activist from benin who has become the face of rising anti french sentiment in francophone west africa a key pillar of françafrique the cfa franc cfa francs photo by kaysha january 24 2010 cc by nc nd 2 0 cfa francs photo by kaysha january 24 2010 cc by nc nd 2 0 one of the central elements of french policy in sub saharan africa was the creation in 1945 of the cfa franc franc de la communauté financière africaine or franc of the african financial community which became the currency of sub saharan africa s french colonies the cfa franc was pegged to the french franc and later to the euro two separate currencies were created the central african franc for cameroon the central african republic chad republic of the congo equatorial guinea and gabon and the west african franc for benin burkina faso côte d ivoire guinea bissau mali niger senegal and togo in practice however both currencies were at parity and interchangeable paris mandated that the african central banks maintain between 50 to 65 percent of their foreign reserves in france s central bank to guarantee the convertibility of the cfa at a fixed exchange rate on december 22 2019 france and eight west african governments announced that they would replace the cfa franc with a new currency still pegged to the euro called the eco the announcement created some confusion as the eco was first launched by six member states of one of the largest economic unions in africa the economic community of west african states ecowas the ultimate goal is to have one common currency for most of central and western africa as cameroonian economist martial ze belinga explains in a way we now have two ecos one that the 15 african countries voted for and whose name was already decided in 2003 and today there is a new eco which france and the west african economic and monetary union waemu countries have chosen independently of the others this seems astonishing one could at least have waited for them to give their approval assessment of the role of the cfa franc the announcement of the end of the cfa franc has reactivated the debate about the legacy of french colonialism the main question has been whether the cfa franc benefitted the development of western and central african economies or whether it had in fact allowed france to manipulate local economies and political systems and stifled the development of this region supporters of the cfa franc policy argue that the system allowed for relatively low inflation and financial stability and that funds deposited in the french central bank generated interest that was transferred back to the african governments any country could have left the cfa franc zone temporarily as mali did from 1962 to 1984 or irrevocably as was the case with guinea mauritania and madagascar supporters also argue that while the cfa franc might be printed in france other african nations currencies are printed in countries such as the united kingdom and germany nigerian journalist david hundeyin cautions that the debate around the cfa franc is often hijacked by populist leaders a rather unhelpful effect of the framing around the cfa conversation is that france is often typecast as the quintessential colonial power hanging on to its empire by all means which fits in neatly with the narrative of the cfa franc being a tool for french neo colonial subjugation in the 21st century in fact france is a remarkably different country now to what it was in the mid 20th century critics of the cfa franc policy on the other hand decry it as a form of hidden financial colonialism while some have used the catchphrase french colonial era tax to describe the mandatory deposit of financial reserves in france s central bank which in 2015 represented 14 billion euros it is true that for years paris required representatives on the boards of many african central banks raising legitimate concerns about the independence of the decision making process also noted by senegalese economist demba moussa dembele is the fact that under this system african countries are deprived of their liquid assets dembele points out that the convertibility system has allowed the flight of massive amounts of african capital back to france in times of crisis overall he concludes that the issue is about sovereignty namely that each country should have full control over its own currency for togolese economist kako nubukpo the main issue is that financial policies continue to be dictated by the central european bank and reflect a model of european development that was of little relevance to african economies i don t think our countries can develop by practicing the monetary policies of germany yet this is the situation by being pegged to the euro we have forced the monetary policy of a strong country to a weak economy this amounts to taxing exports and subsidizing imports echoing dembele s concerns nubukpo also notes that since there is no limit to convertibility local elites are free to put their money on an overseas account or to buy a flat in paris this is the central issue we have elites who live off the income from their properties and have no interest in changing the system in equatorial guinea half of the gdp is transferred abroad to support property purchase that s quite considerable senegalese economist ndongo samba sylla makes a comparison with france s former north african colonies noting that the cfa franc is characterised as a credible and stable currency a significant virtue given the experience of most currency issuing african nations this counter argument is however flawed experience shows that nations like morocco tunisia and algeria which post independence withdrew from the franc zone and minted their own currency are stronger economically than any user of the cfa franc beyond the economic arguments the issue is also about a public debate of france s colonial past or lack thereof as boubacar boris diop a senegalese writer and journalist observes

annual guidance of 250 000 to 275 000 gold eq ounces gold production during the quarter was impacted by lower throughput at the mill facility and the expected lower grade ore from phase 2 as the ore from phase 1 was mined out as planned operating expenses were 1 278 per gold eq ounce for the quarter and 962 per gold eq ounce for the year and included a non cash inventory write down of 14 million primarily related to the derecognition of the low grade stockpile as inventory operating expenses per gold eq ounce for the three months and year ended december 31 2019 increased when compared to the prior year periods as lower grade gold ore was mined and processed total cash costs were 1 032 per gold eq ounce for the quarter and 910 per gold eq ounce for the year achieving guidance of 870 to 950

processed sustaining capital net of proceeds from disposal of assets and sustaining lease payments for the quarter increased to 79 million which primarily related to the completion of the stage 2 tailings management area tma dam construction installation of wick drains for stabilization of the east waste dump ongoing renovations of the camp facility and construction work for the rescoped maintenance and warehouse facilities and 12 million of capitalized mining costs sustaining capital net of proceeds from disposal of assets and sustaining lease payments for the year were 189 million including 32 million of capitalized mining costs in line with reduced annual sustaining capital estimates of 175 to 190 million from 210 230 million due to cost reductions of approximately 15 million related to the tma and the rescoped maintenance and warehouse facilities as well as the deferral of capital to 2020 of approximately 20 million aisc were 2 429 per gold eq ounce for the quarter impacted by higher sustaining capital spend during the quarter primarily related to the completion of substantially all deferred construction capital projects as noted above as well as higher capitalized mining costs aisc for the year was 1 630 per gold eq ounce below guidance of 1 690 to 1 790 per gold eq ounce due to lower than planned sustaining capital for the year growth capital for the year was 6 8 million higher than annual guidance of approximately 3 million primarily related to the purchase of underground infrastructure during the quarter approximately 1 8 million ore tonnes and 10 7 million waste tonnes including 3 9 million capitalized waste tonnes were mined from the open pit at an average strip ratio of 5 99 1 as phase 2 waste stripping continued to be prioritized during the quarter earlier in the year the decision was made to prioritize waste stripping in order to prepare ore faces in anticipation of the updated life of mine plan additionally 0 8 million tonnes of out pit material were mined during the quarter for use in planned dam raises total tonnes mined per day for the quarter averaged 136 124 tonnes per day an increase of more than 20 over the prior three quarters mill throughput for the quarter averaged 22 521 tonnes per day as previously disclosed due to an extended period of heavy rainfall in the area the mill operated at lower capacity in october in order to manage water levels in the tma once the stage 2 tma dam construction was completed in late october which provided approximately 7 to 8 million cubic meters of additional tma capacity mill throughput increased to average 24 858 tonnes per day for november and december exceeding the target range of 24 000 tonnes per day original design was 21 000 tonnes per day mill availability for the quarter averaged 89 achieving target levels with all major mill upgrades substantially completed as the mill has demonstrated consistent operations at target levels there remains potential for further increases in mill throughput in the coming quarters as mill availability improves and the pebble crusher is commissioned gold recovery averaged 91 for the quarter in line with plan subsequent to period end the company completed a comprehensive mine optimization study that includes a review of alternative open pit and underground mining scenarios which achieved the overall objective of improving the return on investment over the life of the mine the results of the study were released on february 13 2020 as operational performance has improved over the past five quarters the focus is now shifting from stabilizing operations to optimizing operational and cost performance to support this initiative the company has engaged an external consultant to support improved overall equipment efficiencies with the objective of optimizing open pit mining productivity and unit cost performance exploration activities continued in the fourth quarter with the completion of the

advance one or more projects to an inferred mineral resource of at least 1 5 million ounces of gold within the next three years on a long term basis advance at least one project to a mineral inventory that is large enough to support a mine with annual gold production of approximately 150 000 ounces for at least eight years advance both gold only and copper gold projects and in the latter case consider joint venture agreements aimed at increasing mineral resource and advancing the project to development while yamana maintains an economic interest in the project the company is budgeting 14 million in 2020 the first year of what will initially be a three year program the company expects most of the remaining budget for the program to be derived from monetizations of non cash producing

the extension project in 2020 the operation will continue to evaluate several deposits and prospective exploration areas to the east of the canadian malartic open pit including the new mineralizes zone discovery of east gouldie as well as the odyssey east malartic sladen sheehan and rand zones these discoveries have the potential to provide new mostly underground sources of mineralization for the canadian malartic mill replacing a portion of the lower grade open pit mineralization which would increase production and mine life jacobina guidance for jacobina in 2020 is similar to that of 2019 in terms of production and unitary costs the 2020 forecast also includes expansionary development to support the higher phase 1 throughput rate on a sustainable basis the investment in the phase 1 expansion which is on track to be finalized in mid 2020 is expected to add consistency and stability to the plant process increasing capacity to a sustainable 6 500 tonnes per day alongside this stability the 8 6 increase to mineral reserves and the 2 6 increase to mineral reserve grade at jacobina in the high grade core zone reported in the mid year mineral reserve and mineral resource

sponsored content as we enter 2020 not only a new year but also a new decade we see can see that the mainstream perception of gold probably hasn t changed all that much gold outpaces inflation s decadelong growth let s take a look at some facts as reported in a but despite the ongoing back and forth debate between sound money vs the dollar let s get real for a moment and look at the scorecard how has gold performed from december 2009 to december 2019 what does gold s performance have to tell us let s take a look at some facts as reported in a cfra sector watch report on december 23 2019 the us economy grew 25 this is good news except for one fundamental factor that may be hitting americans pocketbooks inflation rose 20 so as the economy grew prices increased making goods and services more expensive but gold rose 35 outpacing inflation so despite whatever reservations many in the investing public may hold against gold the results speak for themselves and if anything it comes to show that as we ve always said gold is both an effective safe haven against purchasing power decline and a solid additional return source over the last decade so despite whatever reservations many in the investing public may hold against gold the results speak for themselves and if anything it comes to show that as we ve always said gold is both an effective safe haven against purchasing power decline and a solid additional return source but let s take a moment to address common misconceptions about gold why are so many economists hesitant to support sound money initiatives myth 1 most economists are opposed to gold despite what several of the mainstream financial media sources report this is simply not true these articles talk about how economists say that a return to the gold standard would have disastrous effects on the global economy but are they talking about the economy or the capacity to alter the economy or its perception sure it might be disastrous to those who hold power over their local and collectively global economy through money supply manipulation i e most central banks and the governments who can manipulate them but it s just simply not true that all economists are saying that a return to the gold standard would be a horrible thing there are plenty of economists and surprisingly politicians who believe the exact opposite that precious metals as currency would ultimately stabilize and safeguard the world economy this isn t just a crackpot theory of far out politicians and businesspeople it is a view that a number of economists hold as well it s also a view that america s founding leaders held when they wrote article 1 section 10 of the us constitution myth 2 gold made the great depression possible when talking about the gold standard many detractors will bring up the claim that gold caused the great depression yes the gold standard was in place then and it was a factor in the economic crash but it was by no means the primary cause for instance take the 1929 stock market crash the crash didn t cause people to lose fortunes investors exuberance over a market that did nothing but climb and the leveraged stock purchases that resulted from that exuberance caused the downfall of many to use a metaphor the market didn t cause the illness rather the investors who overbought had to be somewhat weak to begin with to invite such an illness to spread it s simply the reversal of cause and effect now the gold standard had been around for a very long time at that point and while there have been peaks and valleys prior nothing like the financial crash in 1929 has ever happened before the gold standard didn t allow governments to print money to stimulate the economy of course this is the market punishing those who overspend or malinvest if you are broke and deep in debt borrowing more money might not help counterfeiting money would land you in jail sadly without the gold standard governments resort to both of those measures once president roosevelt abandoned the gold standard in 1933 the depression continued for another decade or so yet another sign that it was not the root problem gold isn t the problem the problem is how people use and abuse money the market is supposed to purge itself but that s hard to do when the financial system has been artificialized nevertheless the cure for debt can never be more debt myth 3 gold reduces free market choice another argument you hear against gold is from the libertarian camp in other words who has the right to tell us what money is and what kind of money should be used with the recent movement toward cryptocurrency adoption we can see this argument playing out in the space of real world transactions however nascent or volatile such a solution may be the gold standard does not reduce free choice it does not hamper free markets in an ideal world banks would be completely decentralized free to issue their own gold backed tender without regulation or special treatment from the government the economy would be better off the key phrase here is gold backed tender without it there s nothing to link the bank s issuance to a real and natural economy because such a scenario isn t realistic at least for now having governments support a gold standard may be the best option even though governments and central banks may still be involved it would be to stop centralized national banks like the federal reserve from interfering with a market driven economy by means of monetary policy monetary policy tends to line the pockets of bankers as it also allows governments to run up massive amounts of debt such as what we see in the us today myth 4 government would set the price of gold yes the government would set the initial price for gold and create dollars to match but that is not the same as the government coercively dictating price controls such as those for minimum wage once set the market would dictate gold prices and the government will have to react accordingly not the other way around they would not threaten fines or jail time if people do not follow the price of gold the market would take care of it also as opposed to the current system where the fed sets interest rates and adjusts reserves to match the gold standard would be very similar except for the fact that a tangible asset is backing it up not faulty economic theories developed by a bunch of out of touch ph d s passing themselves off as economists the bottom line despite the myths that gold critics are trying to sell you many americans are coming around to the fact that the gold standard would be a good thing the fact that critics are doubling down on pushing these myths only shows that sound money advocates are on the right track call 833 gsi gold or visit us

alphaautomation technology offering with our 32 field deployed systems earning commercial rates drilling approximately 613 wells in 2019 an increase of 69 over the prior year precision s president and ceo kevin neveu stated during the fourth quarter precision s strong financial results were led by rising canadian activity in our contract drilling services and completion and production services segments firm international activity and flattening customer demand in the u s as a result of precision s high performance high value strategy market positioning in key basins commercialization of alphaautomation intense cost control and cash management efforts we generated adjusted ebitda of 105 million and cash provided by operations of 75 million results delivered this quarter demonstrate precision s ability to consistently generate cash reduce debt and repurchase shares in canada precision maintained its record level market share supported by leading market positions in the montney duvernay and heavy oil regions our 26 ac super triples and over 60 super singles provide precision an unmatched scale efficiency and competitive advantage throughout all key regions in the western canadian market this momentum has continued into the first quarter of 2020 as seasonal customer demand has remained strong well into february the company reached a peak of 83 active rigs in january compared with a peak of 62 up 34 from the first quarter of 2019 and has 80 rigs running today compared to 55 this time last year although longer term canadian demand will be driven by customer capital discipline and commodity prices we expect our market positioning and scale in our canadian drilling segment to continue to generate strong cash flows throughout the course of the year in the u s precision s fourth quarter average rig count was in line with our expectations and generated sequentially improved margins supported by firm day rates and aggressive cost management our rig count ended the year softer than anticipated due to a large customer reducing operations and idling three contracted ac st 1500 s precision remains confident in its ability to redeploy these rigs as the oil and gas operators continue to high grade drilling operations in 2020 we anticipate capital discipline operating efficiency and industrial scale will remain central themes in the u s market and customer spending behavior will be largely defined by remaining within cash flow and maximizing drilling efficiencies these market trends align well with precision s high performance high value strategy our alpha technologies offering and our ability to deliver industrial efficiencies to our customers internationally the business remains a stable source of cash generation looking to 2020 precision will continue to leverage its expanded scale in kuwait and will prioritize reactivating idle assets in the middle east region precision s completion and production services segment finished the year on firm footing generating strong free cash flow improved margins and good progress on both pricing and market share despite a highly fractured market our team has focused and delivered on effectively managing all elements within their control including reducing fixed and variable costs strong operational performance training and crewing rigs and ensuring the integrity of the assets all while continuing to effectively manage customer relationships we expect customer spending in 2020 will largely be tied to the commodity macro and our scale and operational efficiency will continue to support free cash flow generation in the current environment precision delivered on its 2019 strategic priorities established at the beginning of the year first the company generated substantial free cash flow allowing us to exceed our annual debt repayment targets for the second consecutive year by paying down 205 million of debt since the beginning of 2018 precision has reduced its debt levels

summary for the three months ended december 31 2019 revenue was 372 million 13 lower than the fourth quarter of 2018 revenue decreased due to lower activity in the u s and canada partially offset by

our 2019 fourth quarter revenue from our contract drilling services and completion and production services segments decreased 14 and 5 respectively from the comparable 2018 quarter general and administrative expenses were 26 million 4 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2018 excluding the effect of share based incentive compensation expense for the quarter our general and administrative expenses decreased by 8 million from 2018 the lower expenses in the current quarter were primarily the result of continued fixed cost control initiatives and the impact of lease related charges due to the adoption of ifrs 16 see discussion on share based incentive compensation under other items later in this release for additional details adjusted ebitda see non gaap measures was 105 million a decrease of 29 million from the fourth quarter of 2018 our adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenue was 28 this quarter compared with 31 in the comparative quarter of 2018 operating earnings see non gaap measures were 8 million compared with negative 172 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 lower adjusted ebitda and operating earnings in 2019 were primarily due to reduced u s and canadian activity higher share based incentive compensation expense and the non recurring receipt of the transaction termination fee in the fourth quarter of 2018 in the 2019 quarter we decommissioned 29 drilling rigs resulting in a loss on asset decommissioning of 20 million with the adoption of ifrs 16 lease related charges of 3 million in the quarter were recognized through finance charges and depreciation and amortization expense historically these charges were reflected in operating and general and administrative expense total share based incentive compensation expense for the quarter was 7 million compared with a recovery of 12 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 see discussion on rig decommissioning and share based incentive compensation under other items for additional details net finance charges were 28 million a decrease of 4 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 primarily due to a reduction in interest expense related to retired debt partially offset by 1 million of lease accretion charges resulting from the adoption of ifrs 16 revenue per utilization day in the u s increased in the fourth quarter of 2019 to us 23 949 from us 23 369 in the prior year quarter the increase was the result of higher day rates idle but contracted rig revenue and rig technology revenue partially offset by lower turnkey activity during the quarter we had us 3 million of revenue from each of idle but contracted rigs and turnkey projects as compared with fourth quarter 2018 idle but contracted rig and turnkey revenue of us 0 3 million and us 11 million respectively on a sequential basis revenue per utilization day excluding revenue from turnkey and idle but contracted rigs was consistent with the third quarter of 2019 operating costs on a per day basis decreased to us 14 073 in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with us 15 042 in 2018 the decrease was mainly due to lower turnkey activity the impact from the reversal of prior period provisions and the componentization of rig recertification costs excluding the impact of the provision reversals and componentization of recertification costs our operating costs on a per day basis for the quarter were us 14 974 see discussion on change of rig components under other items for additional details in canada average revenue per utilization day for contract drilling rigs was 22 182 compared with 22 802 in the fourth quarter of 2018 the lower average revenue per utilization day in the fourth quarter of 2019 was primarily due to lower rates from a higher proportion of super singles in our rig mix and lower shortfall payments partially offset by higher technology revenue we did not receive shortfall payments in the fourth quarter of 2019 as compared to 1 million in the 2018 quarter average operating costs per utilization day for drilling rigs in canada decreased to 14 791 compared with the prior year quarter of 15 115 the decrease was mainly caused by the impact of lower repair and maintenance costs due to the componentization of rig recertification costs excluding the impact of componentization of recertifications our operating costs on a per day basis for the quarter were 15 044 we realized revenue from international contract drilling of us 43 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 an increase of us 4 million over the prior year period average revenue per utilization day in our international contract drilling business was us 52 283 compared with us 51 982 in the respective prior year quarter the higher average rate in 2019 was primarily due to day rate increases from the renewal and extension of drilling contracts and the deployment of our sixth kuwait rig funds provided by operations see non gaap measures in the fourth quarter of 2019 were 76 million a decrease of 17 million from the prior year comparative quarter cash provided by operations was 75 million versus 93 million in the prior year quarter the decrease in funds and cash provided

charges of 208 million general and administrative costs were 104 million a decrease of 8 million from 2018 the decrease in costs was primarily the result of continued fixed cost control initiatives and the impact of lease related charges due to the adoption of ifrs 16 partially offset by higher share based incentive compensation and the weakening of the canadian dollar on our u s dollar denominated costs see other items later in this release net finance charges were 118 million a decrease of 9 million from 2018 primarily due to a reduction in interest expense related to debt retired

active land drilling rig count was up approximately 8 furthermore approximately 85 of the u s industry s active rigs and 61 of the canadian industry s active rigs were drilling for oil targets compared with 81 for the u s and 60 for canada at the same time last year industry conditions we expect tier 1 rigs to remain the preferred rigs of customers globally the economic value created by the significant drilling and mobility efficiencies delivered by the most advanced xy pad walking rigs has been highlighted and widely accepted by our customers the trend to longer reach horizontal completions and importance of the rig delivering these complex wells consistently and efficiently has been well established by the industry we expect demand for leading edge high efficiency tier 1 rigs will continue to strengthen relative to less capable rigs as drilling rig capability has been a key economic facilitator of horizontal unconventional resource exploitation development and field application of drilling equipment process automation coupled with closed loop drilling controls and de manning of rigs will continue this technical evolution while creating further cost efficiencies and performance value for customers capital spending capital spending in 2020 is expected to be 95 million and includes 58 million for sustaining infrastructure and intangibles and 37 million for

million lower than the fourth quarter of 2018 while adjusted ebitda see non gaap measures decreased 8 to 113 million the lower revenue in 2019 was primarily due to lower u s and canada utilization days partially offset by higher international activity and u s pricing during the quarter we had us 3 million of revenue from each of idle but contracted rigs and turnkey projects as compared with fourth quarter 2018 idle but contracted rig and turnkey revenue of us 0 3 million and us 11 million respectively drilling rig utilization days drilling days plus move days in both the u s and canada

22 182 compared with 22 802 in the fourth quarter of 2018 the lower average revenue per utilization day in the fourth quarter of 2019 was primarily due to lower rates from a higher proportion of super singles in our rig mix and lower shortfall payments partially offset by higher technology revenue we did not receive shortfall payments in the fourth quarter of 2019 as compared to 1 million in the 2018 quarter average revenue per utilization day in our international contract drilling business was us 52 283 compared with us 51 982 in the respective prior year quarter the higher average rate in 2019 was primarily due to day rate increases from the renewal and extension of drilling contracts and the deployment of the sixth kuwait rig partially offset by lower amortization of the initial upfront mobilization revenue directional drilling services realized revenue of 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 consistent with 2018 in the u s 66 of utilization days were generated from rigs

compared with us 15 042 in 2018 the decrease was mainly due to lower turnkey activity the impact from the reversal of prior period provisions and the componentization of rig recertification costs excluding the impact of the provision reversals and componentization of recertification costs our operating costs on a per day basis for the quarter were us 14 974 in the u s on a sequential basis operating costs per day decreased by us 414 due to lower repair and maintenance costs third party charges partially offset by higher turnkey costs average operating costs per utilization day for drilling rigs in canada decreased to 14 791 compared with the prior year quarter of 15 115 the decrease was mainly caused by the impact of lower repair and maintenance costs due to the componentization of rig recertification costs excluding the impact of componentization of recertifications our operating costs on a per day basis for the quarter were 15 044 depreciation expense in the quarter was 26 lower than the fourth quarter of 2018 the lower 2019 expense was primarily due to asset sales assets becoming fully depreciated and non recurring accelerated depreciation of excess

million in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 11 lower than the 2018 quarter primarily due to lower activity in our non well servicing divisions and the impact of asset disposals partially offset by

operations compared with 90 from canada and 10 in the u s in the 2018 quarter operating costs as a percentage of revenue was 77 compared with the prior year comparative quarter of 78 the reduction of operating costs as a percentage of revenue was primarily the result of a higher proportion of 24 hour well service work and continued cost control depreciation expense in the quarter was 20 lower than

financial statements that could materially affect the amounts recognized our judgments and estimates are based on our past experiences and assumptions we believe are reasonable in the circumstances the critical judgments and estimates used in preparing the condensed interim consolidated financial statements are described in our 2018 annual report and there have been no material changes to our critical accounting judgments and estimates during the three months and year ended december 31 2019 except for those impacted by the adoption of new accounting standards changes in accounting policy new standards adopted the following standards became effective on january 1 2019 ifrs 16 leases ifric 23 uncertainty over income tax treatments precision adopted these standards using the modified retrospective method on january 1 2019 please see the unaudited september 30 2019 condensed interim consolidated financial statements and related notes for further details on the adoption of these standards impact of ifrs 16 leases on adjusted ebitda with the adoption of ifrs 16 the accounting treatment for operating leases when precision is the lessee changed effective january 1 2019 precision adopted ifrs 16 using the modified retrospective approach and our comparative information was not restated as a result the comparability of our 2019 adjusted ebitda to periods prior to january 1 2019 is impacted under ifrs 16 leases classified as operating leases were recognized on our statement of financial position with a right of use asset and corresponding lease obligation representing the present value of precision s future lease payments once recognized right of use assets are depreciated over the shorter of their useful life and the term of the lease the lease obligation is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method under this approach an interest charge is applied to accrete the lease obligation to the present value of future lease payments as lease payments are made the lease obligation is reduced historically operating lease obligations were accounted for as off balance sheet and lease expenses were only recognized at the time of payment in either operating or general and administrative expense however under ifrs 16 lease costs are reflected on the statement of earnings loss through depreciation and interest expense resulting in an increase to adjusted ebitda upon transition we recognized right of use assets and corresponding lease obligations of 73 million for the three months and year ended december 31 2019 we recorded lease interest charges of 1 million and 3 million and depreciated our right of use assets by 2 million and 8 million respectively as a result of the new lease standard our adjusted ebitda was positively impacted for the three months and year ended december 31 2019 by 3 million and 11 million respectively non gaap measures in this release we reference non gaap generally accepted accounting principles measures adjusted ebitda covenant ebitda operating earnings loss funds provided by used in operations and working capital are terms used by us to assess performance as we believe they provide useful supplemental information to investors these terms do not have standardized meanings prescribed under international financial reporting standards ifrs and may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies adjusted ebitda we believe that adjusted ebitda earnings before income taxes gain on repurchase and redemption of unsecured senior notes finance charges foreign exchange impairment of goodwill reversal of impairment of property plant and equipment loss on asset decommissioning gain on asset disposals and depreciation and amortization as reported in the interim consolidated statement of earnings loss is a useful measure because it gives an indication of the results from our principal business activities prior to consideration of how our activities are financed and the impact of foreign exchange taxation and depreciation and amortization charges covenant ebitda covenant ebitda as defined in our senior credit facility agreement is used in determining the corporation s compliance with its covenants covenant ebitda differs from adjusted ebitda by the exclusion of bad debt expense restructuring costs certain foreign exchange amounts and with the adoption of the new lease standard ifrs 16 leases the deduction of cash lease payments incurred after december 31 2018 operating earnings loss we believe that operating earnings loss is a useful measure because it

significant undertaking in 2016 bombardier s commercial aerospace business lost approximately 400 million and was consuming approximately 1 billion in cash addressing this challenging portfolio was a fundamental step in the company s turnaround plan we are incredibly proud of the many achievements and tremendous impact bombardier had on the commercial aviation industry said alain bellemare

sale to mitsubishi heavy industries inc and sale of the aerostructures business to spirit aerosystems holding inc are expected to close in the first half of 2020 1 as previously announced the company is actively pursuing options that would allow it to accelerate deleveraging paydown debt and position the business for long term success with greater operating and financial flexibility this process remains ongoing however the company does not intent to provide any further updates at this time overview financial performance bombardier s consolidated revenues for the year were 15 8 billion highlighted by an 8 5 growth in business aircraft activities the growth in aviation revenues were offset by the lower contribution from commercial aircraft businesses following their divestitures revenues at transportation also decreased mainly due to contract estimate revisions consolidated adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebit for the year were 896 million and 470 million respectively reflecting i improvements at aviation as it exits underperforming commercial programs and ramps up production on the global 7500 aircraft and ii additional charges and investments at transportation to complete challenging projects reported ebit loss for the year of 498 million includes a 1 6b impairment charge related to the aclp investment fourth quarter cash generation reached 1 0 billion reducing free cash flow usage to 1 2 billion for the year higher than anticipated cash usage was driven by additional investments made to address challenging rail projects as well as the deferral of deliveries mainly at transportation cash usage from operating activities amounted to 680 million for the full year 2020 outlook revenues from our sustaining business aircraft and transportation activities in 2020 are expected to grow organically by double digit percentage over the 13 7 billion revenues recorded from these businesses in 2019 1 this strong growth is driven mainly from the acceleration of global 7500 deliveries contributing to a total of 160 aircraft or more for the year at aviation the consolidated revenue growth is also supported by the ongoing production ramp up of transportation driven by the solid orders from the past few years adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebit are expected to increase to approximately 7 0 and 3 5 respectively mainly from the acceleration of global 7500 deliveries at aviation and gradual margin normalization at transportation the adjusted ebit margin expansion includes a higher amortization expense as global 7500 deliveries increase the full year outlook for earnings reflects the partial year contribution from ongoing divestitures of the crj program and aerostructures businesses 1 free cash flow is expected to be positive in 2020 excluding credit and rvg payments these residual liabilities related to the exit of commercial aircraft are estimated to be approximately 200 million for the year and are expected to be paid from the crj

estimated at 700 million 1 bombardier will also transfer aerostructures activities and employees supporting the a220 and a330 in st laurent québec to airbus subsidiary stelia aerospace finally the agreement provides for the cancelation of 100 000 000 bombardier warrants owned by airbus bombardier s decision to sell its stake in the a220 partnership completes its exit from commercial aerospace a significant undertaking in 2016 bombardier s commercial aerospace business lost approximately 400 million and was consuming approximately 1 billion in cash addressing this challenging portfolio was a fundamental step in the company s turnaround plan we are incredibly proud of the many achievements and tremendous impact bombardier had on the commercial aviation industry said alain bellemare president and chief executive officer bombardier inc we are equally proud of the responsible way in which we have exited commercial aerospace preserving jobs and reinforcing the aerospace cluster in québec and canada and we are confident that the a220 program will enjoy a long and successful run under airbus and québec s stewardship acceleration of deleveraging phase of turnaround the sale of our interest in the aclp combined with the previously announced aerospace divestitures will generate more than 1 6 billion in cash proceeds and eliminate close to 2 billion in liabilities and future commitments liquidity remains strong with pro forma cash on hand of more than 4 billion and 5 5 billion in liquidity providing the necessary flexibility to complete the turnaround both the crj program sale to mitsubishi heavy industries inc and sale of the aerostructures business to spirit aerosystems holding inc are expected to close in the first half of 2020 1 as previously announced the company is actively pursuing options that would allow it to accelerate deleveraging paydown debt and position the business for long term success with greater operating and financial flexibility this process remains ongoing however the company does not intent to provide any further updates at this time overview financial performance bombardier s consolidated revenues for the year were 15 8 billion highlighted by an 8 5 growth in business aircraft activities the growth in aviation revenues were offset by the lower contribution from commercial aircraft businesses following their divestitures revenues at transportation also decreased mainly due to contract estimate revisions consolidated adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebit for the year were 896 million and 470 million respectively reflecting i improvements at aviation as it exits underperforming commercial programs and ramps up production on the global 7500 aircraft and ii additional charges and investments at transportation to complete challenging projects reported ebit loss for the year of 498 million includes a 1 6b impairment charge related to the aclp investment fourth quarter cash generation reached 1 0 billion reducing free cash flow usage to 1 2 billion for the year higher than anticipated cash usage was driven by additional investments made to address challenging rail projects as well as the deferral of deliveries mainly at transportation cash usage from operating activities amounted to 680 million for the full year 2020 outlook revenues from our sustaining business aircraft and transportation activities in 2020 are expected to grow organically by double digit percentage over the 13 7 billion revenues recorded from these businesses in 2019 1 this strong growth is driven mainly from the acceleration of global 7500 deliveries contributing to a total of 160 aircraft or more for the year at aviation the consolidated revenue growth is also supported by the ongoing production ramp up of transportation driven by the solid orders from the past few years adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebit are expected to increase to approximately 7 0 and 3 5 respectively mainly from the acceleration of global 7500 deliveries at aviation and gradual margin normalization at transportation the adjusted ebit margin expansion includes a higher amortization expense as global 7500 deliveries increase the full year outlook for earnings reflects the partial year contribution from ongoing divestitures of the crj program and aerostructures businesses 1 free cash flow is expected to be positive in 2020 excluding credit and rvg payments these residual liabilities related to the exit of commercial aircraft are estimated to be approximately 200 million for the year and are expected to be paid from the crj

cash addressing this challenging portfolio was a fundamental step in the company s turnaround plan we are incredibly proud of the many achievements and tremendous impact bombardier had on the commercial aviation industry said alain bellemare president and chief executive officer bombardier inc we are equally proud of the responsible way in which we have exited commercial aerospace preserving jobs and reinforcing the aerospace cluster in québec and canada and we are confident that the a220 program will enjoy a long and successful run under airbus and québec s stewardship acceleration of deleveraging phase of turnaround the sale of our interest in the aclp combined with the previously announced aerospace divestitures will generate more than 1 6 billion in cash proceeds and eliminate close to 2 billion in liabilities and future commitments liquidity remains strong with pro forma cash on hand of more than 4 billion and 5 5 billion in liquidity providing the necessary flexibility to complete the turnaround both the crj program sale to mitsubishi heavy industries inc and sale of the aerostructures business to spirit aerosystems holding inc are expected to close in the first half of 2020 1 as previously announced the company is actively pursuing options that would allow it to accelerate deleveraging paydown debt and position the business for long term success with greater operating and financial flexibility this process remains ongoing however the company does not intent to provide any further updates at this time overview financial performance bombardier s consolidated revenues for the year were 15 8 billion highlighted by an 8 5 growth in business aircraft activities the growth in aviation revenues were offset by the lower contribution from commercial aircraft businesses following their divestitures revenues at transportation also decreased mainly due to contract estimate revisions consolidated adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebit for the year were 896 million and 470 million respectively reflecting i improvements at aviation as it exits underperforming commercial programs and ramps up production on the global 7500 aircraft and ii additional charges and investments at transportation to complete challenging projects reported ebit loss for the year of 498 million includes a 1 6b impairment charge related to the aclp investment fourth quarter cash generation reached 1 0 billion reducing free cash flow usage to 1 2 billion for the year higher than anticipated cash usage was driven by additional investments made to address challenging rail projects as well as the deferral of deliveries mainly at transportation cash usage from operating activities amounted to 680 million for the full year 2020 outlook revenues from our sustaining business aircraft and transportation activities in 2020 are expected to grow organically by double digit percentage over the 13 7 billion revenues recorded from these businesses in 2019 1 this strong growth is driven mainly from the acceleration of global 7500 deliveries contributing to a total of 160 aircraft or more for the year at aviation the consolidated revenue growth is also supported by the ongoing production ramp up of transportation driven by the solid orders from the past few years adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebit are expected to increase to approximately 7 0 and 3 5 respectively mainly from the acceleration of global 7500 deliveries at aviation and gradual margin normalization at transportation the adjusted ebit margin expansion includes a higher amortization expense as global 7500 deliveries increase the full year outlook for earnings reflects the partial year contribution from ongoing divestitures of the crj program and aerostructures businesses 1 free cash flow is expected to be positive in 2020 excluding credit and rvg payments these residual liabilities related to the exit of commercial aircraft are estimated to be approximately 200 million for the year and are expected to be paid from the crj transaction proceeds 1 selected results results for the fiscal years ended december 31 2019 4 2018 variance revenues 15 757 16 236 3 adjusted ebitda 5

the adjusted ebit margin of 7 1 is up 70 bps year over year reflecting the early production ramp up and higher amortization associated with global 7500 deliveries as well as the dilution from

project delivery schedules while also investing to support in service reliability improvements and funding additional manufacturing and engineering capacity the higher than anticipated cost to implement these initiatives and to address late stage legacy projects mainly concentrated in the u k switzerland and germany led to lower earnings and free cash flow for the segment over 500 million in cost estimate changes embedded in 2019 earnings completed delivery of several large legacy projects including metropolitan transportation authority mta in new york city crossrail in the u k and

joshua kurlantzick state capitalism how the return of statism transformed the world oxford oxford university press 2016 for much of the left since the 1980s neoliberalism has been an all encompassing term to identify the character of contemporary capitalism neoliberalism has been defined as the privatization of public property and services deregulation free market trade and globalization since the 2008 economic crisis however with the collapse of the neoliberal model or washington consensus some leftist as well as liberal analysts have argued that this concept is not adequate for defining the current character of global capitalism 1 it does not explain the statist character of the emerging economies and most recently the rise of authoritarian statism in western countries the author of the book under review argues that a new era state capitalism is on the rise all over the world pp 3 7 he offers some important facts and analyses on the direction of the global economy enumerates the features that are new in this new type of state capitalism and argues that it is more resilient to capitalist crises although he writes from the vantage point of a fellow of the council on foreign relations he can give socialist readers some insights about the current direction of global capitalism what is the new type of state capitalism how is it different from pre 20th century forms of state intervention as well as 20th century forms of state capitalism that existed in the former ussr maoist china or the east asia development model or western welfare states and mixed economies kurlantzick defines state capitalism as state ownership or significant influence over more than one third of the 500 largest companies by revenue in a country this state ownership or control is not limited to sectors such as energy defense and communications it is not based on isolation from the world market but is open to global trade and technological innovation it also uses modern management techniques similar to any multinational giant and fires managers who do not promote profitability based on kurlantzick s definition china is the most prominent state capitalist country in the world however in order of efficiency from the most to the least efficient the following states fall into this category singapore norway malaysia thailand turkey united arab emirates qatar china south africa brazil indonesia india vietnam argentina kazakhstan venezuela russia saudi arabia iran uzbekistan egypt algeria kurlantzick argues that although states have interfered in their economies for centuries state intervention has become far more extensive on a global scale in the past two decades since the late 1990s this intervention is not limited to state spending and work projects protecting domestic industries through tariffs and subsidies and controlling strategic industries it is not an emergency measure such as the 2008 bailout of bankrupt companies in the u s and state ownership of general motors it is also not aimed at autarky or creating a pure state owned economy instead this new state capitalism combines statist strategies with aspects of free market strategies used by multinational companies thus it may have a better chance of surviving over the long term compared to strategies pursued by maoist china the soviet union and even a more democratic state capitalism in the 20th century like france p 22 this state capitalism is also not monolithic but is better understood as a continuum p 7 with the exception of norway it includes mostly authoritarian and nominally democratic states within this continuum kurlantzick concentrates on china and the emerging economies 2 what factors have brought about this new type of state capitalism since the late 1990s the two most important factors in the author s estimation are the 1997 asian financial crisis and the 2008 financial and economic crisis in the 1990s the former states of the collapsed ussr as well as india african and latin american countries that had followed the centrally planned import substitution and autarky model experimented with the prescription of the washington consensus proposed by economist john williamson for latin america in the 1980s according to joseph stiglitz however the washington consensus which aimed to reduce government intervention and state spending and promote private domestic and foreign investment as well as trade liberalization failed to promote significant growth in most nations p 54 kurlantzick acknowledges that the neoliberal model in the 1990s in africa latin america south asia and east asia pushed people into poverty increased unemployment for the majority of the laboring populations of emerging countries and also led to increasing speculation and bubbles which in turn led to the 1997 asian financial crisis by contrast malaysia and china which shunned imf advice and kept their currencies pegged and protected and many of their banks and large companies in state hands survived the crisis far stronger initially than thailand or indonesia p 75 they did not face an upsurge of poverty capital flight and speculation their debts increased but their economies grew kurlantzick concludes the moral of the asian financial crisis of 1997 was that only countries that had not given in to liberal economic reforms had survived without a heavy dose of pain p 75 following the model of state intervention after the 2008 economic and financial crisis the u s government also bailed out banks and companies that were too big to fail western observers began to argue that a more centralized model as practiced in china or singapore might avoid the short term profit orientation that created the maze of gambling type derivatives and mortgage investments that sparked the 2008 2009 financial crisis kurlantzick argues that rapid economic decision making of the chinese leadership that did not have to deal with the impediments of the legislative and judicial branches or a free media seemed more effective he also cites thomas friedman one of the strongest advocates of neoliberalism praising the process of economic decision making in china one party autocracy certainly has its drawbacks but when it is led by a reasonably enlightened group of people as in china today it can also have great advantages one party can just impose the politically difficult but critically important policies needed to move a country forward p 77 even john williamson author of the washington consensus was asking is the beijing consensus now dominant and arguing that china s economic strategy had proven far more effective p 77 by 2011 india reversed some of the neoliberal reforms of the early 1990s and early 2000s narendra modi governor of gujarat and leader of the extreme nationalist bjp became president in 2014 and partially owed his support to his advocacy of a return to more state intervention in russia the utter poverty experienced by the majority of the population following the introduction of neoliberal measures in the 1990s created the condition for the rise to power of vladimir putin in 2000 putin also partially owed his support to his advocacy of more state ownership and control as the basis for making russia great again in brazil and south african the increasing poverty and hardships which the masses experienced after the introduction of the neoliberal measures in the 1990s led to the rise of more state interventionist governments such as those of lula da silva in brazil in 2003 and jacob zuma in south africa in 2009 in the wake of the 2008 economic and financial crisis china further increased its emphasis on state ownership and state intervention the chinese communist party relied heavily on nationalism as a unifying ideology xi jinping who became the chairman of the cpc in 2013 launched a maoist style campaign against neoliberalism and liberal democracy p 82 china also gained an important role as a lender of capital at a time when the 2008 economic crisis led to a sudden drop in international capital flows to developing nations 3 how has this new type of state capitalism proved to be more resilient in china the main point argued in this book is that the new state capitalism especially as it is practiced in china and singapore can perform better than neoliberalism in terms of productivity profitability employment and efficiency it is also more resilient to economic crises china s experience since the late 1990s is cited as proof kurlantzick argues that china was able to avert an economic collapse in 2013 and a stock market collapse in 2015 in 2015 its production of goods and services grew by 6 p 18 and its state firms still represented 89 of 500 slots in fortune s 2015 annual ranking of largest revenue p 96 in his opinion the key to the success of state capitalism as practiced in china is the following full ownership or ownership of a majority share or voting class share or control through party and army appointment of board and ceos of strategic industries such as energy communications transportation automobile and auto parts production all heavy industry and banking tax breaks low interest or no interest loans and no rent for state owned companies if they maintain standards of profitability and efficiency closing companies that do not produce profitability and punishing their managers allowing the private sector to enter industries that are not deemed strategic such as light industry or the service sector in many cases nominally private companies are subsidiaries of state companies even private companies are highly dependent on the state for tax breaks loans government contracts and have army and party members on their boards introduction of international technologies through allowing foreign multinational corporations to participate in joint ventures which help chinese partners become more technologically advanced buying western companies and using their patents or stealing patents funding research and development through collaboration between universities industry and state controlling the export of capital and requiring that ordinary people deposit their savings in state banks which in turn use the cash to invest in infrastructure manufacturing and as seed capital for new investment ideas that might be profitable to the state in the long range but may not receive private capitalist funding in the short range using economies of scale to compete with other large firms on a global scale especially in auto manufacture and aviation no large dependence on natural resource extraction pp 104 105 minimal welfare state benefits thus what makes china competitive now is no longer only cheap labor but technology skilled labor efficiency and precision manufacturing china is competing with the u s in artificial intelligence self driving cars and the aerospace industry p 106 it will soon be the largest economy in term of gross domestic product p 17 it is also boosting its military budget and building its influence in other countries through its loans investments and infrastructure building project according to kurlantzick the chinese government has also been able to co opt eighty percent of the urban middle class which currently support the state because they are satisfied to see that the bulk of the large profits made are going back into infrastructure development and manufacturing and thus producing capitalist development and employment the rural population however is very dissatisfied and is organizing tens of thousands of protests per year pp 30 188 china s income inequality level is not higher than the u s but similar p 181 in general kurlantzic believes that this new type of state capitalism though not without flaws has proven more resilient complex and multifaceted than many previous challenges to the free market economics model because of its adaptability today because it has combined traditional state economic planning with elements of free market competition modern state capitalism has genuine strengths that earlier challenges to free market economics did not contain p 22 4 what are the dangers of this new type of state capitalism the main dangers kurlantzick argues arise from the fact that the concentration and centralization of capital in the hands of the states would allow states to threaten democracy use state companies to destroy labor and environmental regulations and declare actual shooting wars on other states for instance he cites russia s denial of heating gas to ukraine when ukraine sought to join the european union or china s military actions and use of state companies to set up oil rigs in the south and east china sea and to claim islands and economic zones pp 204 207 while not mentioning china s one belt one road project the author does discuss the ways in which china s building of infrastructure for countries in asia africa latin america with loans from its state companies is allowing it to practically own these countries and shut them down if they challenge it p 213 furthermore he points out that as of 2016 the largest recipients of chinese overseas investments were australia u s canada u k and brazil kurlantzick also points out that evidence calls into question the theory that economic freedom and affluence will bring political freedom indeed the chinese government may be able to survive indefinitely without opening up its political system p 187 in general he concludes a country can have relatively efficient state capitalist economics and some degree of political freedom or it can have real political freedom and only some degree of economic efficiency but it cannot have both p 134 the arguments that he offers about the concentration of money and power allowing leaders and states to buy and purge or repress critics or act as imperialist powers and start wars are also true about free market capitalism he does admit that western liberal democratic states have also used their capital to violate labor environmental and human rights he has also written a book on the u s war in laos and the role of the cia however in general kurlantzick is far less critical of western capitalism p 219 he does not address the rise of authoritarian statism in the west and specifically in the u s in this book in a different book democracy in retreat 2014 he has addressed the global decline of democracy but with a focus on emerging economies 5 what is missing in this book the author seems to think that politics can inhabit a realm over and above economics in order to prevent the concentration and centralization of capital from leading to authoritarianism thus he argues that if we only had free elections and independent political institutions and media we could make state capitalism democratic with the exception of norway and brazil under lula and rousseff which suffered from major corruption problems however the examples of democratic state capitalism which he offers are not so democratic indonesia and singapore p 151 indeed he does not address the ways in which the logic of capital itself thwarts genuine democracy although kurlantzick implicitly admits that capitalism moves in the direction of the concentration and centralization of capital in fewer hands his work suffers from any engagement with marx s capital for marx the logic of capital is the accumulation of capital as an end in itself it is the result of the capitalist mode of production labor which is alienated not only from its products but its process from other human beings and from the human potential for free and conscious activity 2 whether capital is owned privately or by the state its logic is the same it leads to crises and wars marx discussion of capitalist accumulation had predicted that within different capitalist states operating in the context of the world market the means of production could become concentrated in the hands of a single capitalist or a single capitalist corporation in order to increase the rate of extraction of surplus value from living labor 3 nevertheless he argued that capitalism s own tendency toward the concentration and centralization of capital in fewer hands leads to crises mainly in the form of the tendency toward a decline in the rate of profit this tendency toward crisis marx argued could be periodically but not entirely overcome through countervailing factors such as increasing the rate of exploitation of labor including the use of slave labor decreasing the value of the means of production or the outright destructive effects of war 4 kurlantzick does not see crises as organic to the capitalist mode of production itself but thinks that greater state intervention if not isolated from world trade and technological innovation can largely avert crises thus he does not address the fact that china s growth continues to rely to a large extent on the high rate of exploitation of labor including the use of slave labor in prisons note the existence of a million uighur muslims in concentration camps in xinxiang he also does not address the ways that china s efficient capitalism s destroys human lives and nature kurlantzic would have also benefited from consulting various marxist theories of state capitalism such as those developed by raya dunayevskaya c l r james and tony cliff which though not alike and concerned with a different period still offer important questions for us to consider in analyzing state capitalism today 5 6 lessons for socialists despite kurlantzick s lack of any serious critique of capitalism his assessment of the new features of state capitalism today need to be examined by socialists he thinks that these new features can allow for a more resilient capitalism in fact like many others he argues that the era of neoliberalism has ended this new type of state capitalism is the wave of the future it is not democratic but is efficient and can provide growth it does not have most of the social benefits that welfare states offered but guarantees that the bulk of profits go back into the production of infrastructure and more advanced technology for the state and not private gain that is precisely how marx defined the accumulation of capital an increasing portion of the profits go back into the production of the means of production at the expense of humanity and nature efficient capitalism is about production for the sake of production 6 indeed this efficiency is being tested now as china faces the spread of a new coronavirus in epidemic proportions despite its current 6 annual economic growth rate china does not have a functioning primary care system the spread of the virus could have been avoided if authoritarian capitalist practices were not in place the chinese government s current quarantining of 56 million people in hubei province also promises to have disastrous consequences 7 either we develop a humanist alternative to capitalism private and state or we are doomed to live under this new efficient state capitalism endnotes bill dunn against

the fourth anniversary of the brexit referendum in the uk is just four months away while the official separation of the uk from the eu was only a few short weeks ago three prime ministers stood at the head of the british government since a majority of the electorate delivered instructions to declare independence from the european union more than the english channel divided the uk from the other european union when members abandoned their currencies at the turn of this century in favor of the euro the british refused and hung onto their pound sterling i always viewed the refusal to jump into the economic union with both feet as a sign of uncertainty when it came to the globalist experiment the grand experiment of the european union that combined the economies of nations was that it would put in a position to compete with the united states china and japan however the melding of cultures and diverse attitudes when it comes to managing economies and political systems caused more than a few teething pains time will tell if the european union survives and thrives over the coming years but the uk made its exit on the final day of january 2020 as the uk picks up the pieces after brexit

prime minister boris johnson became the leader that fulfilled the will of the british people while the brexit vote in 2016 provided a narrow margin for leaving the union the december 2019 election left no doubt prime minister johnson had advocated for brexit and he won the election in a landslide when it comes to the currency market the pound versus the us dollar relationship rallied sharply following the december election after brexit became official the pound fell against the dollar source cqg as the daily chart shows the pound rose to a high of 1 3548 after the december election the

with the european union took over three and one half years prime minister theresa may reached a deal with the eu but could not sell the proposal to her parliament at the end of last summer she resigned in frustration boris johnson took over promising to deliver brexit with or without an agreement however the parliament put roadblocks in front of the new prime minister preventing a hard exit from the union prime minister johnson scrambled and negotiated a compromise over the irish border which had been a sticking point for the uk parliament a dual customs zone solution still was not enough and the parliament triggered a general election in mid december the election was the final event as it was a referendum on the new prime minister and his brexit plan the final agreement on brexit took years of excruciating negotiations and political wrangling now comes the hard part as the uk must establish trade protocols with partners around the world the agreements are critical when it comes to the future health and well being of the british economy a dispute between the prime minister and the president us president trump had advocated for brexit one of the us leader s staunchest supporters in the uk is the leader of the brexit party nigel farage in the december election president trump stood squarely behind prime minister johnson however negotiating a bilateral trade deal with the us could be a challenge for prime minister johnson on february 11 president trump said that the us would prioritize a trade deal with the eu over the uk the statement came on the heels of a conflict between trump and johnson the prime minister decided to give chinese tech company huawei a role in the uk s 5g telecoms network despite significant opposition from the us president trump and the us view huawei as a threat to national security as the company is controlled by the chinese communist party when the two leaders discussed the prime minister s decision president trump slammed down the phone on johnson negotiating a trade agreement with the us will not be a walk in the park for the uk president trump has europe in his crosshairs after achieving successes on trade with the usmc and the phase one trade deal with the chinese president trump appears ready to turn his attention to europe based on the negotiations between the us and canada and mexico to replace nafta and the trade war with china that led to the phase one agreement the us will play hardball with the european union president trump has already slapped tariffs on france and we could see similar protectionist measures on european car exports to the us over the coming months the success of other trade negotiations will encourage president trump in his stance with the eu however the europeans will likely wait until after the november 2020 election for any agreement in the hope that they will not need to negotiate with the sitting president us economic growth and sluggish conditions in europe give america an edge in the negotiations meanwhile the strong us dollar and weak euro currency work in favor of the eu on february 11 as the chairman of the us federal reserve jerome powell testified before the house banking committee the president took to twitter source twitter the president continued to push for lower rates and a weaker dollar as he prepares to negotiate a new trade protocol with europe over the coming weeks and months i believe that the president will eventually settle his differences with the uk and use a trade deal with the british as a model for a far more significant

forward looking statements i will now turn the call over to mr alejandro elsztain ceo please go ahead sir alejandro g elsztain chief executive officer thank you very much good morning everybody we are beginning our first six months of 2020 we can begin in page number 2 to see the main events of the six months we see that the adjusted ebitda for the period made in the agribusiness segment at ars2 6 billion that is a little drop comparing to last year numbers mainly explained because of less real estate transactions in the first semester and expected to have in the second in the case of the urban of argentina there is a small drop of 6 6 comparing to last year it s ars3 4 billion and this is mainly explained because of the adjustment of the inflation results in the case of the shopping centers the sales were a little below this adjustment and it is bringing a negative and later we are going to see some positive coming from the office buildings but the shopping centers are little more negative making a small negative and a positive adjusted ebitda in the case of israel explained mainly because of the good results on pbc and cellcom a change in the ifrs of cellcom the net result for the six months gives us a positive of ars1 7 billion comparing to a negative of last year and if we see the net result attributable to controlling company it is a negative ars4 7 billion comparing to the ars6 billion of last year we have a record planted area in the region we are achieving almost 270 000 hectares it is a growth of 9 comparing to last year numbers in the case of sales i said that this year we are below last year numbers we had only cases in brazil through brasilagro brl28 2 billion sales and this is only small portions of jatoba and alto taquari and we are expecting more sales for the second semester in this semester we distributed shares up to the 2 6 of the capital of cresud and subsequently we did two three things more cresud sold in the market 6 of the stake of brasilagro for 15 6 million this was an auction in a day and from other side brasilagro merged agrifirma it s an agricultural company based in brazil and we did that through issuing shares not paying cash through issuing new shares of brasilagro and including almost 29 000 hectares of land to the brasilagro portfolio and finally after selling the 6 and the dilution of agrifirma cresud reduced its stake to 33 6 we can move to the next page and we can speak about this merge that we are doing meantime we are selling some farms in bahia we were reducing last year s mainly through the sale of the jatoba and we have the chance of including this stake of a company that was an important on the past but failed in its operation and finally decided to receive the payment on shares and give us scale and synergies we are not almost hiring no one is in the same region of our funds and we are doing through issuing new shares this transaction it s an issuance of almost 9 5 of the company new shares this is not finalized still it s going to finalize very soon and this is here an evolution of what is after this the portfolio hectares of brasilagro rose from 185 000 hectares to 214 000 hectares and they accepted our the two were done at the fair value of each of the companies so that was a very good and interesting transaction for us and so this is the first time in the history of the company that we are able to acquire through the issuance of new shares if we go to the next page we can see the portfolio of the planted area we are arriving to our record of 269 000 between the four countries and 9 growth comparing to last year numbers here we see that the soybeans represents 51 corn 24 sugarcane is 12 and the others are 13 and this is a combination of owned and leased land between the four countries the two countries that they are doing that are argentina and brazil the other two are doing only in bolivia we have a small leasing too related to farmland sales we see the evolution of the last 10 years we can see that this year up to now the first six months is a small gain majority is gain the yield they are green you cannot almost kind of relook at the cost of the land that we sold so you see the majority of the sales are a gain and so these are two small transactions of 1 080 hectares so really very small to the portfolio but with very interesting yields of 14 and 21 in the reals or 7 or 13 in dollars after the big devaluation that brazil received so we keep that track of buying and selling land and in brazil today is very active because of the benefits of the buying and selling land for the farmers after having good results they normally take more the profits of the year they buy more land so now i will introduce mr carlos blousson that will explain about the commodity prices and the world carlos blousson general manager of argentina bolivia good morning everybody thanks alejandro well let s go to the page number 6 about farming commodity prices and global stocks we can see in the graph the prices were kept at the low levels the reasons are following considering the supply the condition of the crops in south america are foreseen as good generating incremental levels of stocks let s now have a look at the fact that the stock related trade especially soybean are still high because the delay in exports due to the tardiness in the agreement with china regarding the demand despite the agreement phase 1 has been signed last january between the united states and china also are delayed and we need to wait for the impact of coronavirus in the china s economy and of the demand so far prices are on hold regarding soybean stock consumption ratio we can see in the graph a decrease in the world ratio except for the united states due to the reasons mentioned before talking about corn we see that the corn stock consumption ratio decreased in the world s ratio except for the united states because of the delays in exports since brazil and the rest of south america was more competitive the reason is that china is charging a surplus import tax to american crops and not to brazilian and latin american ones as you may see on the top of the right graph we appreciate that the fob soybean prices in brazil and argentina were more competitive than in united states the reason being the delay in the agreement united states china not reaching an agreement on the import tax reductions currently current regional hedge campaign 2018 2020 the current hedge level is 73 in soybean in the over the budget price in case of the corn the regional level is of 65 we remain 4 over the budget in soybean and 9 in corn it s clear that this high hedge happened because we anticipate to our use of electricity foreseeing that market was going down particularly in argentina this happened because we anticipate to the change in the export tax we will provide further details later on let s go the next page the good prospects farming activity in the fiscal year 2020 as you can see in the top of the graphic the evolution of the weather in south america was normal but we need the rain to continue at the same pace for the next 45 days to finally refine the volume of productions the forecast predicts the rain will continue related to the exchange rate evolution you can see that the evolution rate has increased in the last six months we can see 5 in brazil and 41 in argentina allowing an improvement in the compatibility in the export sector next page crop tax exports increased in argentina macri administration and regulation were to reduce the export tax since december 2019 the new government has changed this by increasing them to levels resembling the ones exiting when they were in the office before in the case of soybean the new tax export increased to 30 and they set the congress approval to one additional 3 due to this fact they will be able to reach a rate today like the rate exiting when they were in power before regarding corn the new tax export increased to 12 and they have a congress approval to one additional 3 this will increase to 15 the rate is lower than the rate exiting when they were in the office before the last one in case of the wheat it increased to 12 same allowance of the 3 that have the congress approval too this will increase to 15 the situation shows the increment will not be alarmingly high as opposed to what happened when they were in the office before the next page about our investment in agrofy as you may see agrofy the pioneer company of e commerce and agribusiness it was cresud owns 22 25 and by brasilagro 1 89 continuing its growth its business model the news is the capital round has increased to 23 million mean that cresud subscribed 2 million and brasilagro 1 million the company current valuation is of 53 million related to the kpis as i show in the right of the graphic the additional the monthly visit to be 139 in comparison to the december 2018 the monthly contract went up to make it 2 as well as the revenues in dollars that were higher 106 agrofy is present in five in seven countries today we intend to be the leaders in the latam in the three years present in nine countries this year s goal is to incorporate colombia and mexico thank you everybody matias matias i gaivironsky chief administrative and financial officer thank you carlos if we move to the next page we can see the news in our argentina business segment basically our stake in irsa so in shopping malls we can see a recovery after 18 months then we have decreases against inflation in our tenant sales so past inflation for the first time at 3 6 in the quarter if we consider the semester 0 4 probably this is attributable to the problem with credit cards out of those that allow consumers to pay in installments without interest rates so we will see if that is a sustainable trend or was just three months of improvement occupancy remains at levels of 95 in the malls in the offices in aaa at 97 1 with the rent in dollars to stable 26 9 per square meter we are finishing the development of the della paolera doscientos so we will deliver we started to deliver the units and we plan to have it ready by the end of this fiscal year so everything on the commercialization is in good shape so good news in that segment hotels during the quarter we have lower sales because of the flag process on one of our hotels that used to be sheraton and now we have our own brand so that we have lower sales but the rest remain in good shape land reserves with some barter agreements during the semester so we did one in abasto that was to be in a space close to one of our shopping centers that we have for a while and now we signed it with our developer to exchange land for the square meters so we will receive around 4 5 million in square meters also in caballito that is a big plot of land that we have in that neighborhood that we started to do some swaps so we started with the plot 1 of 11 400 square meters but also we will receive apartments for that exchange and we have much more land to keep doing the same in the future and regarding the financial and the international part in banco hipotecario this semester we have some losses because of an impairment of the government notes and financial instruments and some doubtful accounts and in the international part we expect to the disposal of condor will be settled during the quarter if we move to the rest of the sector the israeli business center during the semester we finished with a concentration law adoption now so finally what we did was to dispose shares of gav yam so we lost control on gav yam shares we privatized the debt of ispro and then we distributed the shares of mehadrin as a dividend so with that now we are in compliance with the law the rest of the important part there was regarding clal during the semester we sold shares of clal so now our direct stake is at 8 5 i mean with the swaps we are around 16 so that was the other important news in israel if we move to the financial statements in page 13 here we have a complex semester with us we have some extraordinary or some effects that i will try to explain so if we started with the line if we start with the line 17 the net income of the company we finished the semester with a gain of almost ars1 7 billion against the loss last semester of sorry ars8 6 billion if we see the attributable part to our controlling shareholders it s a negative result of ars4 7 billion against a loss of ars6 0 billion last year and when we analyze the effects we have several the first one is the change in the fair value in the line 6 in the part of the argentina business segment that we can see a gain this semester of ars3 8 billion against a loss of ars9 6 billion last year that is the first effect the second effect is in the financial line in the net financial results in line 13 that we have during the semester ars19 3 billion against ars11 5 billion that i will explain in the following pages other effect is in the line 14 the income tax that we are recognizing a loss of ars3 1 billion against a gain last year of ars3 4 billion here is more related to the recognition at fair value of our property it s not this is a deferred tax it s not a cash effect and also here we have the starting of the implementation of the inflation adjustment in our tax balance sheet that also generate a loss during the year if we move to the following page on page 14 we can see the breakdown on the adjusted ebitda by segment and here we can see a very good performance in agriculture so leaving aside the farmland sales that last year we recognized it here the gain of jatoba that is included in the ars1 5 billion of the previous year against a small recognition this year then the rest of the segment we see that our results almost doubling in farming the previous year and this is adjusted by inflation so we can see in grains better performance in the sugarcane in cattle a lower loss and the agriculture and rent services flat and then the others that include the mid packing facility and our brokerage firm we are a little above inflation that is more related here to the mid packing facility then in field we have good results but part that recognized in the financial part and not here in the adjusted ebitda then as i mentioned in the urban segment shopping malls we have a lag against inflation so this year this semester we are 18 almost 19 below the previous year this is more related to stronger revenues that are part of our revenues are not surpassing the minimum rent so we are recognizing only minimum rent and not percentage so we will see the trend if the sales continue to perform well i believe that this line will improve then in offices we have a much better result 13 38 1 that is related to a set of building that now we have a new building operative so we are growing those results plus the valuation that help us because our agreements are in dollars the hotels a decrease of 29 that is related to deflag of sheraton and also an extraordinary income last year and then in sales and development no major news in real estate in the israeli business segment we are 26 8 above this is more related to cost reductions part is the devaluation between the shekel and the peso that is 13 5 the rest is more related to cost reductions and in the telecommunication also is more related to the implementation of ifrs 16 we have part of the cost that now are recognized as amortizations and is not included here finally in page 15 we have the other effect that is in the net financial results here when we separate in the different business segments in argentina we have the impact of the devaluation if you see below in the graph we have a devaluation this semester of 41 but in real terms it s 13 against 30 last year but in real terms only 3 so that effect is affect directly our dollar denominated debt and is included in the line 2 the net exchange differences that you can see that we have lower results in cresud and in irsa then in the israeli business segment the important part is regarding the clal shares that we see a drop during the semester of 15 against a gain of 3 last year that has an impact that is reflected in the line 4 that you can see a drop or negative result of ars2 8 billion against a gain of ars57 million last year and the other positive affect is in line 3 in israel that we have a gain of ars2 billion that is related to the buyback of bonds in vac that generate a profit so most of the effect that i described are non cash effects the most relevant part is on the operational side adjusted ebitda then i try to make it simple to describe the main impact that affect our net income this semester if we move to the final page in the debt profile we have today the debt remains stable at 443 million we have the debt amortization scale this is as of december after that in january we issue a new bond so we issue three series of a new bond for 51 million and also we have the disposals of the 6 of the shares of brasilagro that generate 15 6 million of cash so those two effects will impact in the next quarter or already impacting in january but it s not reflected in this slide so with this we finish the formal presentation now we open the line to receive your questions questions and answers operator showing no questions this concludes our question and answer session at this time i would like to turn the floor back to mr alejandro elsztain for any closing remarks alejandro g elsztain chief executive officer just to finalize we are in the middle of our crop season and we are now in the time that we are confirming the yields of the crops we are in a good shape in the plantation having the highest the record size of plantations of the company and we expect normal yield for the year we expect that it keep raining on the south american region and to keep doing transactions on the real estate arena and each of the companies that are consolidating cresud and following their own missions so thank you very much and we see you next quarter bye operator duration 27 minutes call participants alejandro g elsztain chief executive officer carlos blousson general manager of argentina bolivia matias i gaivironsky chief

earnings within our existing store base as we also accelerate their acquisition growth our industry remains fragmented with the top 10 companies controlling less than 8 of the total us market and no single company controlling more than 2 this highly fragmented market has allowed us to consistently invest in increasing the reach and density of our physical network by acquiring strong assets for more than a decade we have successfully purchased and integrated acquisitions that has yielded an after tax return of over 25 annually with our most recent fundraising costing below 5 interest that s a massive return and unrealized impact to earnings with more than 1 billion in available liquidity almost 300 million in annual free cash flows and an adjusted leverage ratio below two times we are well positioned for continued growth assuming an average equity investment of approximately 20 of revenues our available liquidity and annual free cash flows could add up to 6 5 billion in revenues or 50 growth in november we acquired the williams automotive group in florida which consisted of three high performing stores in the southeast entering the desirable greater tampa market expanded our network coverage from 82 to 92 of the us and establish teams to springboard from in the southeast though 2019 was a light year we added nine locations totaling over 825 million in revenue or about 6 more volume to our network we continue to seek acquisitions to improve our reach more conveniently serve our customers and grow our highest margin business lines our customers proximity to our physical network is a key element of our growth strategy as it enables us to supply convenient touch points throughout the ownership life cycle lithia now has the broadest coast to coast network of any auto retailer in the united states and it is yet to be fully activated with over 1 billion of liquidity leadership expertise accessible to all 50 states and an active market we expect 2020 to be a banner year of growth for our company despite another successful year of earnings and revenue growth in 2019 we re just getting started our company and its 15 000 team members live our mission of growth powered by people and the corresponding value to constantly improve as such we remain humble and never quite satisfied and are tenaciously committed to improve grow and find new opportunities

in the quarter total sales increased 7 and gross profit grew 10 and pre tax income improved 16 following this additional color on each of our six business lines the new vehicle business line which is top of funnel for consumers in automotive retail grew 4 our average selling price increased 5 and unit sales decreased 1 slightly better than national average gross profit per unit increased to 20 2 267 compared to 2 127 last year an increase of 140 while our team balances volume and gross profit and evolving regional market conditions they continue to find new ways to leverage our 40 000 new vehicles in inventory and our massive selection of oem branded products and services to reach the entire country our used vehicle business line was up 17 comprised of a 16 increase in unit sales and a 1 increase in average selling prices used retail gross profit per unit was 2 088 similar to last year our used vehicle mix was 24 certified 55 core or vehicles three to seven years old and 21 value auto or vehicles older than eight years we ended the year with a used to new ratio of almost one to one up from point eight to one in 2018 which as a reminder is less than half of the national average of two point three to one our experienced used car managers remain focused on leveraging innovation to expand procurement of more used vehicles which is the primary path to improving volumes in addition we are looking closely at the 50 000 used vehicles we wholesale annually to ensure we capitalize on every opportunity we have to retail those vehicles given the confidence we are gaining in the digital solutions that enable us to buy and sell more used vehicles we have increased our target to sell at least 100 used units per location per month an 18 increase over our previous target of 85 units in the quarter we reached 77 used units per store per month an increase of 12 over the prior year new and used vehicle sales are supported by our experienced financing specialists that help match consumer needs with the lending options at over 200 financial institutions with over 70 of consumers having average this equity in their trade in vehicle of 55 100 financing experts capture the additional earnings potential by providing transparent product offerings and purchase options at all levels of the credit spectrum our france and insurance business line continued the incremental improvement we have seen in the last several quarters averaging 1 526 per unit retail compared to 1 388 an increase of 138 per unit over the prior year this growth was due to higher penetration rates and per unit profitability in nearly all of our product offerings overall new and used vehicle sales create incremental profit opportunities through the resale of additional trade in vehicles greater manufacturer incentives f i sales and future parts and service work we continue to monitor this due to growth of our total gross profit per unit which was 3 705 this quarter or an increase of 185 per unit over last year we remain focused on highest margin business lines our service parts and collision centers in 2019 the us recorded the oldest on record with the average age of a vehicle at nearly 12 years our stores continue to offer a full spectrum of service and product offerings that are convenient and affordable creating a one stop shopping experience for all consumers our state of the art facilities create a wonderful atmosphere for quick service needs including our oil changes tire replacement wiper blades and more we expect continued growth in the competitive express service offerings which increased almost 20 in 2019 overall our service parts and collision center revenue increased 6 over the prior year customer pay work which represents over half of our fixed operations revenue stream increased 6 warranty increased 5 and wholesale parts grew 4 and our collision centers increased 8 same store adjusted sg a to gross profit was 70 4 in the quarter which was similar to last year bringing our improvement for the year to 70 basis points our highest performing stores maintained an sg a to gross profit metric of approximately 60 significantly lower than acquired stores that are typically 90 or higher obviously this adversely impacts our overall sg a performance until those stores are seasoned in summary our team delivered solid increases in revenue and gross profit in 2019 while delivering sg a at an industry leading level however significant opportunity remains to improve the consumer experience through incremental steps that will expand the reach of our products and services throughout the nationwide footprint of us consumers we now touch this focus will support the plans our stores have to drive additional profits and eventually attain each store s potential with that i d like to turn the call over to tina tina miller senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you chris for the quarter we generated free cash flows of 63 million bringing our total to 286 million for the year we define free cash flow as adjusted ebitda plus stock based compensation less the following items paid in cash interest income taxes dividends and capital expenditures in december we took action to strengthen our balance sheet to support the company s future growth plans we amended the terms of our syndicated credit facility increasing the size to 2 8 billion extending the maturity to 2025 increasing maximum allowable leverage by nearly one full turn and reducing the interest rates on the new vehicle used vehicle and working capital lines of credit additionally we raised approximately 400 million through issuing 4 625 senior notes due in 2027 as a result we ended the year with over 1 billion in available liquidity in the forms of cash available credit and unfinanced real estate with additional liquidity available through accessing the debt and equity markets we target 65 investment in acquisitions 25 investment in capital expenditures modernization and diversification and 10 in shareholder return in the form of dividends and share repurchases as of december 31st we have 3 5 billion outstanding in debt of which 2 2 billion was floor plan used vehicle and service loaner financing a unique aspect of debt in our industry is the financing of vehicle inventory with floor plan debt this financing is integral to our operations and collateralized by these assets the industry treats the associated interest expense as an operating expense and ebitda and excludes this debt from the balance sheet leverage calculation unadjusted our total debt to ebitda is overstated at six times adjusted to treat these items as an operating expense our net debt to adjusted ebitda is 1 9 times earlier this morning we announced a dividend of 0 30 per share related to our fourth quarter results additionally we have approximately 234 million in remaining availability under our existing share repurchase authorization our adjusted tax rate was 28 2 in the quarter and 27 6 for the full year changes in certain state tax laws negatively impacted our rate during the quarter we anticipate our tax rate to be approximately 29 for the next year due to state loss changes enacted in 2020 as bryan and chris mentioned earlier we are well positioned for growth in 2020 we have 1 billion in available liquidity to deploy in acquisitions that meet our hurdle rates additionally in the upcoming year we plan to pragmatically invest in modernizing the consumer experience through digital solutions and building the teams needed to support new opportunities for growth through aligning our core values with the key metrics that drive success and having an efficient support structure we have the talent and discipline to achieve our aspirational goal of 5 market share this concludes our prepared remarks we would now like to open the call to questions operator questions answers operator our first question comes from rick nelson with stephens please proceed rick nelson stephens inc analyst thanks i d like to have some parts through the nine months same store sales protracting 8 7 and in the fourth quarter that slowed to 3 7 and if you could speak to the drivers there warranty did warm weather impact and how you re thinking about 2020 bryan deboer president and chief executive officer sure rick i think let me this is bryan i think to start as a reminder we were actually up 6 so it s not quite as big a contrast as what it was from the year to date number at 8 and that was because of a reclassification of our tire sales i think in the quarter we re still seeing good growth in most areas specifically in regards to service customer pay work let me just give you that information we were up and these are unadjusted as well so you can add about 3 to each of these numbers i would assume customer pay was up 3 or relatively 6 about the same as what the company was warranty was up 5 or about 8 parts wholesale was up 4 or relatively 7 and as we mentioned body was up 8 and tires don t really affect that rick nelson stephens inc analyst ok also the acquisition environment you point to it being very robust you acquired 825 million of revenue last year what are you seeing that there what you if you could reasonably accomplished in 2020 and the multiples tampa sounds like it s a well run operation what multiple was bryan deboer president and chief executive officer rick rick nelson stephens inc analyst yes bryan deboer president and chief executive officer sure let me talk about a couple of different things here i think most importantly our pipeline is pretty packed ok we re excited about that and i think you could get the tone from our remarks i think it s important always to remember what our long term goal is of achieving 5 market share within the united states which means we have the ability to grow about three times our current size obviously if you then extrapolate what that means to acquisitions it s important to remember that we do produce a considerable amount of money we just did a debt offering and we had a fair amount of money in the piggybank which will allow us to grow almost 6 5 billion in revenues if we were to utilize all of that capital that would increase our leverage about two times if you notice we talked specifically about that our leverage ratio went up in our new bank deal about one full turn so some pretty exciting stuff as you begin to think about how do we put our balance sheet to work we also restructured our teams six months ago to be able to accelerate growth most importantly i think it s important to pay attention to page 8 which is how we buy acquisitions and what opportunities come to be from those acquisitions in each of those departments and i think at any given time you can also extrapolate on page 16 which is a sum of parts analysis that really talk about each of the different departments and where value is created so i think when we think about acquisitions it s clear to us that it s something that we re good at that we re experienced at and that we can accelerate and we even readjusted things to be able to do just that rick nelson stephens inc analyst that s helpful also finally i d like to ask you early learnings in pittsburgh what you re picking how cheap it to use and costs and attachment to and how that s working and any update on shift also would be helpful bryan deboer president and chief executive officer great rick this is bryan again and i m going to spin it to chris after i m done with some fun facts on the pittsburgh market i think most importantly what we re seeing is pretty good demand from our consumers and maybe a new segment of consumers that we really haven t attracted in the past which is exciting for us i think that the technologies we continue to perfect whether it s pricing or valuations or experience with our consumers those technologies as well as experiences stay tuned on because we ll be deploying those into new channels that are not typically through our existing footprint so we can then touch a broader reach of consumers across the country as well as have higher density than what we currently have to be able to really leverage our inventory our experienced personnel of 15 000 people and ultimately that network chris do you want to give us some context on pittsburgh too chris holzshu chief operating officer you bet i think when we look at some of the digital solutions that we re offering and being able to see how consumers respond to those here are some kind of cool things that we re learning real quickly is one over 90 of all the traffic coming from mobile devices so this is from phone and tablets so not from a pc it s coming from phones and tablets second is when customers actually book appointments at home they re keeping our employments 92 of the time versus 53 of the time when they book those in the dealership and then when appointments take place at home on the acquisition side we re acquiring the vehicle 83 of the time or 15 percentage points higher than we do when they come into the store and lastly when customers only book home appointment is about 30 of the time with the remaining 70 choosing to come into our facilities which is a real testament to continuing to think about the bricks to click model that we re focused on and giving consumers the choice of either doing business in their home or at the dealership rick nelson stephens inc analyst great thanks a lot good luck chris holzshu chief operating officer thank you operator our next question comes from rajat gupta with jp morgan please proceed rajat gupta j p morgan analyst hey good morning thanks for taking my questions i just wanted to follow up on the acquisition commentary you ve closed a number of deals in 2019 including the one in florida or late in the year which i believe is immediately accretive like a little unlike some of the other deals that you have done in the past could you give us a sense of how we should think about the accretion from all these acquisitions from a year over year perspective in 2020 and we including the florida one dealers that you ve done and i have a follow up bryan deboer president and chief executive officer sure rajat this is bryan again i think if you think about the williams deal it s probably 0 25 or so accretive to eps i do think that as we think about acquisitions we re going to have both williams type acquisitions as well as what we would call our traditional value based investing where there s where they re usually still accretive but usually they ramp up over time and that s back to the slide 8 i think if we think about longer term in 2020 and 2021 right now the acquisitions leads have increased about two times over where they were last year this time and it s mostly driven in the southeast we were shocked to find that there was many acquisitions available they are definitely priced on the upper end of our return expectations but we seem to be able to find those opportunities that are still highly accretive given that our cost of funds are only 4 625 as of a few months ago that we believe that there s going to be good opportunities for growth going into 2020 rajat gupta j p morgan analyst understood just to clarify on the accretion you said a quarter eps you mean like 0 25 bryan deboer president and chief executive officer yeah 0 25 rajat gupta j p morgan analyst got it got it and just on f i again continued solid execution here in the past you ve talked about some potential on the captive side could you provide an update on that and how should we think about any contribution to earnings in the near to medium term chris holzshu chief operating officer yeah this is chris so i mean as far as our own in house finance portfolio we have about 70 million of assets under management but we do continue to look at the opportunities to expand that business go further upstream right now that is probably a deep sub prime portfolio and we re figuring out ways to have adjacent businesses in addition to the auto retail and parts and service business and collision centers that we have that can bring incremental profit and so we do expect to continue to pursue those opportunities and are investigating out of this time rajat gupta j p morgan analyst got it just lastly for me on sg a to gross profit it was down pretty nicely here in 2019 overall what should is there like a range you could provide us for 2020 or like what kind of decline expectations should we have that will be all from my side chris holzshu chief operating officer yeah this is chris again we re not going to give guidance really on the 2020 year but i will tell you as we mentioned a bit go that we ve prided over 7 billion in acquisitions and those acquisitions under the traditional model that we have acquired have been in that 90 range and so we re still incorporating a lot of those stores in and while we saw a 70 basis point reduction year over year we are going to continue to stay focused on the three core line items that make that up which really come down to our personnel costs advertising and facility costs and so as we mentioned in the prepared remarks our stores have aops and their aops are about generating top line growth as well as leveraging cost and getting back to that 50 throughput number that we re focused on where we bring 0 50 in every dollar of growth to the bottom line so we ll continue to see i hope our efforts on that and continued progress rajat gupta j p morgan analyst great thanks a lot operator the next question is from armintas sinkevicius with morgan stanley please proceed armintas sinkevicius morgan stanley analyst good morning thank you for taking the question you mentioned the digital rollout here how should we be thinking about that for the course of 2020 bryan deboer president and chief executive officer this is bryan again armintas i think that it is incremental improvements so i think today when we look at the pittsburgh market and a few adjacent markets it s really a what we would call light sales to consumers currently that will get a lot heavier and more robust where it s full transparency and full interaction and full choice for the consumer whether they d like to do business at home or in the dealerships i think as well right now it s also full capacity buying of vehicles from consumers and that can be done in multiple ways and that s being well accepted which is helping accelerate not only the pittsburgh market but there are markets that are starting now to dip their foot into this arena we re very fortunate that we re purchasing of the vehicles we purchase about 60 of them our core product and the other 40 which is almost the entire tranche is value auto which are very difficult cars to find so as we think about furthering our digital efforts i think what you re going to see as pittsburgh will put on more content and more options for consumers as many other lithium markets start with those light solutions and then begin to fulfill the promise to the consumers to be able to go to them wherever whenever and however they may choose armintas sinkevicius morgan stanley analyst but do you have any sense on you re in pittsburgh as you launch other markets do you think you ll get to half of your footprint with the other markets or a quarter just i get the sense it might be a bit more measured at maybe bryan deboer president and chief executive officer yeah i hear you i hear you i think i don t think we look at it that way because i think as chris spoke to i think we think about annual operating plans and today in 2020 i think we think about how do we get incremental improvement in our existing store and how do we start to change behaviors in our consumers as well as those that deliver experiences to the consumers our employees and i think we re at that stage throughout most of the year i think you ll see us leverage our technologies and begin to step into different consumer demographics or bases where we re going to attract a less traditional consumer but that will be later in the year in q3 q4 type of things armintas sinkevicius morgan stanley analyst ok and then just last one sg a here in the fourth quarter was sequentially higher did it have to do with the acquisitions sort of phasing in or was there something else that we should be mindful of bryan deboer president and chief executive officer armintas this is bryan again i think the biggest thing to think about with sg a that we train our leaders today to be top of funnel sensitive meaning that we expect that they grow their used car business their new car business which ultimately will push the higher margin businesses of service and parts so if you see slowing sg a like we did in q4 where we were only saving 30 basis points relative to the 80 basis points same throughout the year it s because there is a conscious effort to be able to provide offerings to consumers that may be more affordable and may not be as lean as they will be in the future now as chris said there s ultimately that value based investing that comes into the fold as well that helps offset some of that and i think as we were talking about the williams acquisition those acquisitions in self help us balance things to be able to redeploy capital in not only our stores but on global initiatives to be able to further our modernization efforts armintas sinkevicius morgan stanley analyst ok great appreciate it then operator our next question comes from john j murphy with bank of america please proceed john j murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning guys just a first question on the new use targets of 100 vehicles per store i m just curious i mean what is the age bucket that you think you can expand into or is that really sort of the wrong way to think about it and it s just a gross increase i m just trying to understand if you guys are going a little bit older in the age spectrum i think there s more opportunity there just how you re going to drive that growth chris holzshu chief operating officer yeah john this is chris i mean obviously we do remain focused on expanding that used car business and our target now when you think about the national used to new ratio of two point three to one even at one to one we really see there s a huge opportunity but as you re mentioning i think that opportunity is going to come from that core and value auto line and it s going to come down to procurement and bryan talked a lot about the digital solutions that are going to help us with procurement but right now while we re fortunate enough to have 63 of our current used vehicles coming in on trade in order to push that envelope further we re going to have to go out and procure cars and i think it s getting away also from the branded products so we now our average stores are selling 60 branded products so the same make is what s on their single outside and 40 off brand but our top used car store in the company that are well above that two point three to one ratio about 20 brand and 80 off brand so we re trying to balance that mix out a little bit more and focus on the procurement side bryan deboer president and chief executive officer john this is bryan just one other piece of incremental information i think when we think about our used vehicle sales we always think it a bit in conjunction with our financing ok and i think when we build our inventories we think our value is typically about 50 finance and about 50 cash as we get into core it s like 80 financed it s a massive amount and that s where there s lots of profit opportunities i really believe that and it s where scarcity matters a bunch in terms of the vehicles because if you can track consumers with scarce product it typically builds margin an example of that would be in value auto for the quarter we were actually up 148 per unit or 2 203 we averaged 20 088 a unit whereas in certified and core we were actually down about 50 but we re trying to build value and it comes from the ability to buy vehicles that are more scarce than what s typically found at auctions or available to businesses that are further downstream as chris mentioned than we are john j murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst and then just a follow up to that i mean sort of most people think about f i and parts and service as a lower opportunity on those older vehicles but the reality is that it actually might be sort of think flip that thinking on its head and there actually might be more of an opportunity i mean how do you think about the finance insurance and partner service attach rate and then just absolute opportunity on some of those older vehicles bryan deboer president and chief executive officer john it s bryan again i think we look at things holistically in a whole deal average rather than specifically f i so i think we build things around that i think it s the disadvantage that you get in f i on a value auto product is that you re bringing someone into your business life cycle earlier in their life which is something that is easy to discount and say that you shouldn t do it because it s bringing your f i average down but ultimately if it brings dollars to the bottom line or expands your customer base which is how we look at everything then it s an important give and take that you always need to balance between john j murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok that s helpful and then just a second question on when you re talking about adjacencies it seemed to sound like that you were alluding to a potential captive finco or growth there is that something you guys are kind of kicking around and looking at a model like a carmax particularly on the use side is something that s working fairly well chris holzshu chief operating officer yeah john this is chris definitely something that we re kicking around in exploring further for several years we ve been in we ve had our own finance company it s been in the deep subprime segment and i think we re just looking at if there s ways to profitably move upstream with that business since we re top of funnel we have the opportunity to look at those deals and if they re profitable for us why not add them onto our prop stream also in terms of if you think about digital strategies and the ability to be able to be hyper responsive to the consumers the ability to have your own financing takes out a lot of the apis that need to occur between us and the 200 lenders that we currently are signed up with and simplify things and is more transparent to the consumer the other thing i think that s important to remember is and you mentioned it that carmax does produce 40 of their profits in their finance companies so how much low hanging fruit is there for a lithia motors to be able to capture at some point which can make us more competitive in terms of what our rois are and our acquisition aggressiveness as well as the ability to diversify to some extent now i think you know lithia well enough that we will incrementally grow into something much like we ve done with the 70 million portfolio that we have today we ll move slowly and learn from our experiences and perfect and ultimately if we do end up going in that direction it will be something that will be profitable and a positive thing for all of us john j murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst this would be organic off the current platform or would there be a small acquisition or i mean how would you handle that chris holzshu chief operating officer i i think if look at lithia s history i think it does typically come organically because it is how you learn the knowledge that you need to be able to really further the business and i mean i would say this the expertise within lithia motors and regarding finance is deep and broad we have almost 600 finance specialists that we can tap into to gain knowledge plus we have 200 lenders that have taught us a lot about the world of finance and so on so i would believe that it would be organic john j murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok and then just lastly i mean you set out sort of long term goals that are big and there are days that you ve been hitting those so we have to take everything you re saying very seriously but the 5 market share nationally in the new vehicle market does sounds a bit high and what we ve understood from sort of the automation experience i mean framework agreements can be prohibitive as far as making acquisitions and kind of growing significantly above 2 so i mean is there something going on in the framework agreements or relationship with automakers that you think might make it easier than it has been in the past to kind of grow that much because it s a big number but like i said you ve hit long term targets before so just curious how are you thinking about that bryan deboer president and chief executive officer john great that s a really great question and i think it identifies the differences between how lithia motors has built a value based strategy that typically buys underperforming strong assets and then improve them so the relationship that we have built with our manufacturers is deep and strong because of that ability to bring value to them ok and i think framework agreements albeit have limited some of our peer group in fact at times it can limit our growth as well and i think we always have our partners in mind when we buy acquisitions and balance those things and i think that s why many people invest in lithia motors because of that ability not only to bring shareholder value but bring value to our partners which is our manufacturers that ultimately hold the keys to the kingdom to get to 5 growth lastly our current framework agreements in their entirety allow us to get considerably beyond 5 so as long as our performance stays or at the levels that we re currently at and we re able to bring value and improvement then there shouldn t be framework limitations like others may or may not have john j murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst very helpful thank you very much bryan deboer president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from bret jordan with jefferies please proceed bret jordan jefferies analyst good morning guys back to the finance for a moment i guess what do you see as far as the credit availability trends and obviously you ve got some real experience on the subprime where are you seeing the subprime mix right now and i guess maybe any trends on delinquencies just around the borrower chris holzshu chief operating officer bret this is chris our trends are pretty consistent we re seeing about 15 of our business in the subprime speed it really hasn t shifted much at all over the last several years so continuing to see that space stay where it s at and then as far as overall finances what bryan has mentioned we have over 200 lenders available and they come and go at different paces but our job is to make sure that whether it s an internal finance company or an external finance company that we have the breadth of lenders available for our stores to be able to put transactions together and meet customers needs and continue to see that going forward into 2020 bret jordan jefferies analyst ok great and the question i guess you commented on collision being up 8 which is i think a whole lot better than repairable claims growth in the period what s driving that are you guys focusing more there is that sort of taking share from independents given vehicle complexity or how much is price versus traffic i mean a little background on that number bryan deboer president and chief executive officer sure bret this is bryan i think on collisions 85 90 of our work is driven off drps in the insurance company partnerships so i think that combined with our ability to put the right people in the right jobs is the biggest driver for that the market is definitely robust it s a matter of us capturing a larger portion of that i believe we have we ll push in mid 20s in terms of collision centers and a number of those are actually independent and it s a 7 part of our fixed operations and i think i d leave you with this final thought our relationships with our consumers are deep we provide offerings that are expansive and complete so the business is really ours to lose including the collision repair centers that many consumers typically call us to be able to ensure that their vehicles are repaired at a standard that is as good as it was prior to the rec or need assistance when it comes to valuations to be able to determine a total salvage type of vehicle ok and i think that s something that we re getting more involved with and it is profitable and it is something that is right in our wheelhouse bret jordan jefferies analyst do you see that being an area of growth i guess mid 20 stores is that something you re expanding or is it just relative too small to move the needle bryan deboer president and chief executive officer i believe that lithia motors has the ability to grow people and grow businesses because of our basic mission of growth powered by people and that s obviously a little ethereal but i think when you manage performance by the numbers and through people i think anything is possible and i think body shops are something that we see as attractive as lucrative and as part of the customer fulfillment of their life experience with personal transportation bret jordan jefferies analyst right thank you bryan deboer president and chief executive officer thanks bret operator our next question comes from derek glynn with consumer edge research please proceed derek glynn consumer edge research analyst good morning i had a follow up on used you spoke about moving across the age spectrum to older vehicles how has the competitive environment changed on the procurement side over time it just seems like there s a lot of investment from others into digital marketplaces or platforms and there s arguably more price transparency today for both dealers and consumers and so what do you view as your advantages in procuring bryan deboer president and chief executive officer this is bryan again derek i would say this getting into scarcer vehicles has lots of risk and without massive expertise in reconditioning in sales in guarantees and promises to our consumer it s not something that most people want to get into because it s messier it also requires deeper financing sources more specific or more unique financing sources that what you re starting to see is the new entrants are pretty good at the one to five year old vehicles which is something that is attractive and there s a plentiful supply of vehicles and many of those don t necessarily come from new car dealership it comes after new car dealers have decided they don t want the car and they re able to buy those cars at auction so it s the easy entrance point whereas we believe that the profitability in both reconditioning as well as in having people enter the lithia family earlier comes from those lower priced vehicles and our people are excellent at being able to recondition those vehicles and find those vehicles our new technology that we re utilizing now in the northeast is also pinpointing those vehicles so we re more aggressive in terms of procurement of those vehicles which is allowing us to increase that as well and we believe that core and value are part of the promise that lithia motors gives to our customers when we re a new car store there are tendencies that consumers believe that they can t buy cars that are of value or within their price range so and what we provide is a great experience for them to be able to buy at a professional facility and be serviced in a professional manner whereas we re typically competing in value in core products with more of the joe s used cars and small used car lots not so much national retailers at this stage now i believe lithia motors can move into those channels and become the national retailer in those categories and i think you ll see our strategies and pulled over the coming three to four quarters derek glynn consumer edge research analyst ok great and when i look at parts and service the growth there has generally been above that of your new comp units it s been more varied relative to use but you re growing units you have this opportunity within your own existing car park so to speak but i m curious if you could share what portion of your parts and service business is derived from vehicles that you did not previously retail and how that s changed over time bryan deboer president and chief executive officer derek we ll take that off line and try to get to some of that data derek glynn consumer edge research analyst ok appreciate that thanks for all the commenter bryan deboer president and chief executive officer you bet operator our next question comes from david whiston with morningstar please proceed david whiston morningstar analyst thanks good morning can you talk about a bit more about what tools you ll use to get to this new used target of 100 units per store per month and is shift involved in at all chris holzshu chief operating officer yeah david this is chris i mean right now what we have is we have a core group of stores that are performing well above that goal of 100 units per rooftop and they re the stores that are going above the national average of two point three to one used to new and so what we re going to do is do what we always do is leverage our top talent our top teams to support our other stores to show people the way on how to do it and as bryan mentioned there s a lot of work that goes with it where our used car managers have to in some ways roll up their sleeves get out and buy vehicles right now only third one third of the used cars in the us are sold through new car dealers and there s no reason that number shouldn t be much higher and our whole focus right now is just to educate our stores on what the opportunity is make sure that they have the resources the capital the expertise the technicians the reconditioning to be able to get those vehicles through the shops on the front lines and get them financed so there s a lot of pieces that go into that but it s really about the people and the talent david whiston morningstar analyst so it sounds like it s not really a massive ai or big data type issue it s more of just an effort and attention issue right bryan deboer president and chief executive officer david this is bryan i think it s multiple pronged i mean i think you may know that my love at the honda store that i ran for six years that we were a three and a half to one used to new ratio and it was primarily about three categories it was about procurement it was about your staff and it was about your ability to price and match cars in the proper manner i think when you think about how do we plan on doing that the nuance is that occur in procurement are massive there s lots of different ways to procure vehicles and to pinpoint those i think today when we think about procurement i think it s driven 50 by people and 50 by technology i don t know that we knew that until we began to partner with shift and began to think about the decisioning that our own used car managers go through and started to extract that knowledge from them to begin to build the foundation of our own ai at barrel com in pittsburgh that we re now starting to perfect that and that s what s bleeding into a lot of the other stores even though there s not customer offerings what is there is ai that s pointing our store leaders which typically there s two or three experts in the store that are buying cars to go buy more of the right cars and then on the pricing side our pricing models now are able to scrape the web they re then able to provide competitive pricing to consumers and i think lastly as we think about valuation and pricing if we can expand our reach meaning that the footprint that we can deliver a car to expand from our current approximately 50 miles to 500 miles now you re able to turn cars quicker command even higher margins and create experiences with consumers for your higher profitability businesses in a little bit easier way and i think that s when we think about the 100 cars that chris talked to you these are the new portions of what were different than when i was running a store 20 years ago david whiston morningstar analyst ok that s helpful florida you finally entered the market something we ve talked about before do you ultimately want to be only in metro areas or both metro and rural bryan deboer president and chief executive officer david this is bryan again definitely we want to be in both ok because we believe proximity is important to capture the high margin businesses because mobile service probably has a 50 to 100 mile effective range and that s something that rural markets can help fill in we have realized that the metropolitan markets are probably just as attractive and have a lot of profit upside and also typically take a management team of five to seven people to be able to lead the store the same as a smaller store in a rural market does but remember lithia is built on a traditional world strategy and those hometown values and those experiences and bonds with our consumers is what we perpetrate throughout the metro markets as well and i think that s something that is unique on how we approach things with our relationships with our consumers as well as our employees and new members david whiston morningstar analyst ok and just one more question off the wall here but in your you guys are an expert of selling pickups to rural customers and small cities and i m just curious if your store gms in those markets have heard any feedback on the tesla fiber truck from those customers is that the kind of truck that they would ever want bryan deboer president and chief executive officer david this is bryan i think if you look at pickup sales i think that the footprint of who those customers are and how they re built i m not positive that that s the right attraction yet i think in metropolitan areas it could be i think most importantly it s a massive market and pickup trucks sell nicely in our typical rural markets as well as in the metropolitan areas david whiston morningstar analyst ok thanks guys operator our next question comes from chris bottiglieri with wolfe research please proceed chris bottiglieri wolfe research analyst a couple of questions i wonder if i can give the mix on the kind of value cpo core did you give the growth rates and if not is that s something you can provide context for chris holzshu chief operating officer chris this is chris value auto was up 12 our core product was up 21 and our cpo business was up 8 so our focused units in corn value auto definitely outpaced what was going on with certified chris bottiglieri wolfe research analyst got you that s helpful and then obviously the used growth has been really explosive in 2019 i was wondering if you could help them rationalize that growth for us like where it s coming from helping us think through 2020 and then specifically if you re able to i was wondering if you can quantify the contribution from the 2018 acquisitions that had on the 2019 growth chris holzshu chief operating officer yeah this is chris again i think just going off the unit growth that we saw in the quarter represents really what we saw in the year our focus is definitely on the core and value auto product it will continue to be so going forward into 2020 and then as far as specifics on the acquisition it s a mixed bag i mean a lot of the larger stores had focused on cpo units so they had never actually even heard of value auto value auto is for the store down the street that is selling out of a trailer but as you know 21 of our vehicles that we sell are value auto product and we have great finance specialists to help our people that a lot of time to need support in their financing options on those value autos and as it s our highest profit gross profit per unit vehicle and margin vehicle it s something that we re very focused on and bringing into the fold of those new acquisitions whether they ve been in the used car business in the past or not chris bottiglieri wolfe research analyst got you and then one last one for me for the spring market you gave a lot of interest in kpis i was wondering if there s anything you can give like kind of any other way to frame it in terms of contribution like how quickly they grew relative to the company average or their used to new ratio in that market relative to other markets just some way to help us frame for how big of a lift the investments have been bryan deboer president and chief executive officer chris this is bryan i think the easiest way to think about it is incremental and it s integrated into everything that we do so when you look at an 18 growth rate in used vehicles i think you have to year mark a good portion of that is because of modernization and whether it s in the pittsburgh market and that s why when we talk about we re not really planning on rolling these things out its incremental improvements that the stores are starting to use valuation models at some point they ll start to use pricing models at some point they ll be able to provide consumers direct offerings and in home service and in home sales those type of things so it s hard to really year mark what specifically it is and that s not really how we manage our company we manage it based off these incremental improvements i think as we look forward you will begin to see that we ll have multiple channels of how we go to market and those will be easily detectable and easily discern between what is driven through that channel and we ll be able to provide you that information as well chris bottiglieri wolfe research analyst that s helpful thanks for the help bryan deboer president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you we have the end of our question and answer session so i d like to pass the floor back over to management for any additional concluding comments bryan deboer president and chief executive officer thank you everyone for joining us today and we look forward to updating you again on our first quarter in april bye everyone operator duration 64 minutes call participants eric pitt vice president of investor relations and

global equity markets slumped on thursday after a new methodology that boosted the death toll in china from the coronavirus unnerved investors putting the brakes on a rally that had lifted north american and european stocks to record peaks chinese officials said 242 people died in hubei province on wednesday the biggest daily rise since the virus emerged in the provincial capital of wuhan in december hubei had previously only allowed infections to be confirmed by rna tests which can take days and began using computerized tomography ct scans to identify and isolate cases faster the move effectively lowered the bar for classifying new infections as a result 14 840 new cases were reported in the province on thursday up from 2 015 new cases nationwide a day earlier investors sought safety in u s assets pushing the yield on the 10 year u s treasury note lower as the euro plunged to a more than two year low against the dollar the euro fell to a four and a half year low against the swiss franc the united states is expected to weather the economic impact of the virus better than the euro zone the chief economist of axa investment managers gilles moec said the impact of the virus could be part of a perfect storm for europe that hurts the economy for months before being compounded by a heated trade battle with the united states we started with the premise that this virus would be worse than sars and that has now become consensus moec said so attention turns to who is hit the hardest and europe is among the usual suspects and germany in particular given china is its biggest

dfms are humming and hawing over their emerging market bond exposure as they weigh the allure of attractive currency valuations against the unknowns of the coronavirus investors snapped up 118bn worth of new issuance from emerging market governments and companies in january data from dealogic cited in the financial times shows despite the emergence of the coronavirus this was up from 70bn in the same period last year and an all time high for the month we have been surprised by the ease at which the markets have shrugged off concerns around the coronavirus says psigma head of investment strategy rory mcpherson to us this seems overly complacent chase de vere research manager justine fearns says debt issuance has remained relatively high as emerging market countries and corporates spy an opportunity to refinance on low yields and make use of currency swings the record borrowing was mostly in euros and dollars the ft reported the dollar had remained relatively soft throughout january trading around 0 76 against the pound but this week surged against other major currencies as the coronavirus death toll surpassed 1100 and investors sought out safe haven assets it is possible that the spread of the coronavirus is at an early stage so it may be that emerging markets are looking to capitalise on what has been a relatively benign period in markets despite the announcement of the virus and a flare up in tensions between the us and iran in anticipation of a potentially greater impact fearns says coronavirus impact could be huge willis owen head of personal investing adrian lowcock says plummeting yields across bond markets and rate cutting from the federal reserve and ecb have kept demand for emerging market bonds high with so much debt yielding zero or negative rates this forces investors to take on more risks and look overseas to markets such as em debt says lowcock uk domiciled em debt funds brought in net inflows of 36bn in 2019 data from morningstar shows em debt was the third most popular fixed income asset class last year taking in 41bn of aggregate net flows across uk and european funds which was ahead of govvies and high yield 23bn and 21bn respectively but behind corporates 42bn and unconstrained bonds 61bn china is very different now lowcock thinks the potential for the coronavirus to have a negative impact on emerging market debt is huge but adds equally the outcome is unknown if the virus does breakout further then we could see sharp sell offs and given the markets tend to over react there is likely to be opportunity for fleet of foot investors comparisons to sars and previous epidemics are useful but limited mcpherson says china is very different to what it was back in 2002 3 it is eight times the size now the second biggest economy globally and the biggest contributor to global growth also it is very much service led as opposed to manufacturing hence it is less responsive to changes in macro policy he adds local currency valuations tempting despite the dangers of the unknown some managers have been content to hold their ground whilst we continue to monitor the impact of coronavirus closely at this stage i don t think there will be a sustained material impact on the asset class and i m happy to continue holding my exposure says tilney head of multi asset funds ben seager scott prashant chandran who co manages the legg mason western asset macro opportunities fund has around two fifths of his fund in emerging market debt speaking at a roundtable event in legg mason s london offices on 30 january 2020 chandran predicted riskier assets would continue to do well over h1 2020 as central banks continue to cut rates and inflation stays flat he only expects to see volatility seeping into the markets toward the end of q3 around the time of the 2020 us election fearns expects local currency bond funds in particular to continue to attract investor flows but she adds that she would expect managers to invest selectively due to weaker corporate earnings as default rates are expected to rise over the next two years tilney gains exposure to the region through the ashmore emerging market local currency bond fund chandran has a fair amount of local currency exposure with 9 of the fund s assets denominated in the russian ruble and the brazilian real and 6 in the mexican peso indirect em debt exposure psigma has not added to its em debt position which is around 7 of its balanced fund instead it has been taking risk off the table by selling down some of its us growth stocks which delivered strong performance in 2019 whilst the valuation case for emerging debt is strong notably on the local currency side we are not adding at the moment says mcpherson these assets tend to do best when the dollar is weakening and emerging market sentiment is high not a dynamic we are seeing at the moment mcpherson invests in the neuberger short duration emerging market debt fund which is 100 hard currency as well as the ashmore emerging market total return fund which provides a blend of hard and local currency exposure chase de vere does not own emerging market debt funds directly fearns says preferring to gain exposure to the region through flexible mandates like ariel bezalel s jupiter strategic bond fund bezalel s 4 4bn fund currently holds 18 in asia ex japan 6 in european emerging markets 3 in latin america and minimal amounts in africa and the middle east according to trustnet

itaãº unibanco holding s a itau unibanco nyse nyse itub is one of the largest non state owned financial institutions in brazil along with a growing presence across latin america while itau has faced a difficult operating environment over the past decade given the weak macro conditions in brazil we highlight stronger operational trends more recently supporting a positive outlook the company just reported its latest quarterly results that showed continued growth and profitability one of the favorable themes has been an ongoing digital transformation with more of the banking business moving online driving efficiency gains we think the stock presents some compelling value at the current level and is set to benefit from improving economic conditions in brazil source finviz com itub q4 and 2019 earnings recap itau reported its fiscal 2019 q4 earnings on february 11 with eps of brl 0 77 revenue of brl 31 8 billion increased 11 8 year over year while net income in the quarter of brl 7 3 billion was up by 12 6 year over year highlights in the quarter include 20 basis point expansion in roe to 23 7 at the consolidated level and 50bps for brazil operations loans portfolio increased by 11 year over year and 2 6 quarter over quarter non performing loans have been relatively stable at 3 0 across the firm while declining by 30bps to 3 4 in brazil from 3 7 in the quarter last year margin with clients the company s financial metric based on a combination of net interest margin and related credit spreads reached brl 18 1 billion up 2 9 quarter over quarter and 11 7 year over year source company ir overall this was a solid quarter although some line items were on the lower range of previous guidance the cost of credit was slightly higher than expected driven by the increase in the loan portfolio and higher provisions for loan losses outside of brazil for the year the margin with clients grew by 8 6 and slightly below estimates between 9 and 12 in 2019 service fee revenue was a strong point increasing by 5 9 year over year source company ir digital transformation one of the trends we are looking at as a positive is an improving efficiency ratio that reached 44 in q4 from 48 7 in q4 2018 this metric is the non interest expense as a proportion of net income with a lower number being better in brazil and latin america as more customers are using online services itau has been able to reduce costs with reduced headcount and less need for brick and mortar branches the share of total payments transactions in value conducted online reached 81 in 2019 from 68 in 2017 source company ir the company ended the year with 94 6k employees down 5 4 from 100 3k to end 2018 the company also closed 372 branches in the year the result is that non interest expense increased by just 2 5 which was below the inflation rate and also lower than previous guidance the company notes that its digital platform is a higher margin business and a continued transition of customers towards the online services will support earnings going forward source company ir 2020 guidance for the year ahead the management does not offer earnings guidance but instead provides target ranges for various operational and financial metrics on a consolidated basis the company sees the total credit portfolio increase between 8 5 and 11 5 which compares to 10 9 in 2019 targeted growth in financial margin with clients between brl 5 7 billion and brl 6 7 billion for 2020 at the midpoint compares to brl 6 2 billion in 2019 what stands out in the 2020 guidance is an estimate for non interest expenses between a decline of 2 and an increase of 1 at the consolidated level the implication here is that higher earnings would be driven by lower costs and expenses overall this is a continuation of the trend observed in 2019 supported by another improvement in the efficiency ratio source company ir at the macro level an expectation for gdp growth in brazil to rebound to 2 2 in 2020 from 1 2 in 2019 is also positive for the business outlook the economy is seen benefiting from a benign interest rate environment and accelerating job creation an estimate of 938k formal jobs to be added in brazil in 2020 up from 641k if confirmed would be the highest since 2013 source company ir dividend it s important to note that itau is also an interesting dividend stock the company distributes a small fixed monthly dividend of brl 0 015 per share or approximately 0 0035 per adr at the current exchange rate there is also a larger semi annual dividend that is variable according to a targeted payout ratio range depending on return on equity roe and risk weighted asset rwa growth levels for 2019 roe of 23 7 with rwa growth of 9 dictated payout ratio on earnings between 60 and 65 source company ir the dividend yield noted by the company for shares trading in the local brazil market is currently 5 5 considering the depreciation of the brazilian real currency over the past year the effective yield on the distribution is closer to 8 8 we calculate this by considering usd 0 655 per adr share in total dividends paid over in the calendar year 2019 assuming a flat fx rate and the share price at the current level we estimate a forward yield of about 6 for 2020 given a recent decline in the share price the table below presents the dividend data for itub over the past year itub adr share distribution history from dr bank source bnymellon analysis and forward looking commentary we like itub s leadership position in various banking segments and think the efficiency gains with continued progress at cost cutting measures support a positive operational and earnings outlook that being said itub in many ways is a macro trade and a bet on the future of brazil for itub adr shareholders continued weakness in the brazilian real remains a risk and has pressured the share price in terms of u s dollars indeed the current exchange rate represents a record low for the brazilian currency as it now trades at brl 4 35 per usd source xe com the trend of depreciation over the past several years has been based on a combination of economic growth below expectations and a technical consequence of the narrowing spread between brazil s interest rates and u s dollar yields essentially as inflation in brazil trended lower the central bank was able to cut the monetary policy rate known as selic to record low levels currently at 4 5 the effect has been to diminish the relative yield spread advantage in brazil s interest rates compared to dollar debt markets thereby pressuring the currency on the other hand there are reasons to believe that depreciation in the brl will be more limited going forward the central bank has signaled a pause to the rate cutting cycle with a view that the lagged effect of last year s cuts should begin to support economic growth going forward in our view there is no reason to suspect brazil is vulnerable to a currency crisis type scenario that has gripped other emerging markets in recent years like argentina or turkey favorably brazil continues to generate a trade surplus narrow current account deficit and improve fiscal indicators in 2019 the level of gross public debt to gdp declined for the first time since 2014 in december s p ratings changed the outlook on brazil s bb sovereign credit to positive citing improving economic conditions for itub the stock would benefit from a stronger brl going forward on better than expected economic growth in brazil gains in the labor market suggest continued credit growth and higher demand for related banking services supporting its operating profile the other consideration here is valuation for the year ahead current market consensus estimates eps of 0 73 representing a forward p e multiple of 11x and about flat compared to the 2019 result total revenue forecasts at 27 8 billion represent a 2 9 year over year increase and a forward p s multiple of 2 8x source seeking alpha premium for context the average p e ratio over the past three years is 12 5x while itub traded with a p e ratio as high as 15x as recently as early 2019 we rate shares of itub as a buy based on the combination of an improving macro outlook for brazil favorable trends in operating metrics and relative value in valuations a strengthening brl from current levels would drive the earnings estimates in usd comparatively higher representing more upside for the stock price the stock s forward dividend yield at 6 0 is also compelling data by ycharts takeaway despite challenging macro conditions in recent years brazil s itau has delivered consistent growth and profitability we think the stock will benefit going forward as it consolidates its market leadership position with earnings supported by continued improvements in efficiency as it shifts to more online and digital services while the brazilian real has been weak we think further depreciation from current levels should be limited and a reversal stronger from here would represent further upside for itub adrs apart from risks such as a global cyclical slowdown or weaker than expected macro data in brazil monitoring points going forward include trends in credit growth and non interest expenses as key metrics

to be between 11 million and 12 million primarily from the triple t joint venture timberland sales targets of 15 million to 17 million remain in the range of 1 to 2 of fee acreage davis said our outlook does not include potential contributions from future acquisitions and investments and does not include any additional potential capital recycling which we continue to pursue as part of our ongoing growth strategy and capital allocation model we project higher harvest ebitda in 2020 primarily driven by increased harvest volumes and steady pricing while investment management ebitda will decrease due to decreased contributions from dawsonville bluffs which effectively wrapped up in 2019 adjusted ebitda the discussion below is intended to enhance the reader s understanding of our operating performance and ability to satisfy lender requirements ebitda is a non gaap financial measure of operating performance ebitda is defined by the sec as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization however we have excluded certain other expenses which we believe are not indicative of the ongoing operating results of our timberland portfolio and we refer to this measure as adjusted ebitda see the reconciliation table below as such our adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to the significant amount of timber assets subject to depletion significant income losses from unconsolidated joint ventures based on hypothetical liquidation book value or hlbv and the significant amount of financing subject to interest and amortization expense management considers adjusted ebitda to be an important measure of our financial performance by providing this non gaap financial measure together with the reconciliation below we believe we are enhancing investors understanding of our business and our ongoing results of operations as well as assisting investors in evaluating how well we are executing our strategic initiatives items excluded from adjusted ebitda are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance adjusted ebitda is a supplemental measure of operating performance that does not represent and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to or substitute for net income cash flow from operations or other financial statement data presented in accordance with gaap in our consolidated financial statements as indicators of our operating performance adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap some of the limitations are adjusted ebitda does not reflect our capital expenditures or our future requirements for capital expenditures adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in or our interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt although depletion is a non cash charge we will incur expenses to replace the timber being depleted in the future and adjusted ebitda does not reflect all cash requirements for such expenses although hlbv income and losses are primarily hypothetical and non cash in nature adjusted ebitda does not reflect cash income or losses from unconsolidated joint ventures for which we use the hlbv method of accounting to determine our equity in earnings and adjusted ebitda does not reflect the cash requirements necessary to fund post employment benefits or transaction costs related to acquisitions investments joint ventures or new business initiatives which may be substantial due to these limitations adjusted ebitda should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business our credit agreement contains a minimum debt service coverage ratio based in part on adjusted ebitda since this measure is representative of adjusted income available for interest payments we further believe that our presentation of this non gaap financial measurement provides information that is useful to analysts and investors because they are important indicators of the strength of our operations and the performance of our business for the three months ended december 31 2019 adjusted ebitda was 15 1 million a 5 7 million increase from the three months ended december 31 2018

looking ahead india in a changing world as prepared for delivery introduction good afternoon i am honored by your invitation to deliver the 8th c d deshmukh memorial lecture the late chintaman deshmukh a towering figure as rbi governor and later finance minister helped guide india s economy through the immense challenges of independence perhaps less well known he also holds a place in the annals of the imf as a senior member of india s delegation to the 1944 bretton woods conference which laid the foundations of the post war economic order there c d deshmukh had the foresight to insist that the imf and world bank address the development needs of the countries that would soon emerge from colonialism john maynard keynes deeply impressed by his contributions is reported to have recommended that he run the imf i hope that one day we will have an indian managing director last year at this podium martin wolf spoke of the challenges to india from global economic upheavals since then we have seen the threat of two of those upheavals recede if not fade the u s china trade conflict and a hard brexit but new uncertainties always arise casting a cloud over the global economy for example we are only beginning to see the impact of the coronavirus epidemic which has struck at the heart of global value chains but beyond these headline grabbing problems governments around the world are struggling to solve a complex policy problem how to address the secular stagnation that is reflected in anemic productivity growth falling inflation and weakening global trade this is in part the legacy of the global financial crisis but it is also the new normal of a maturing globalized world reinforced by aging societies in japan europe and the u s and posing the fiscal challenge of meeting the needs of their senior citizens for the most part secular stagnation is an advanced economy issue but one with spillovers that concern the rest of the world moreover secular stagnation may be a preview of coming attractions for some rising and aging middle income countries that said many of you may be correct in thinking that all of this is a long way from india which in recent years was the fastest growing large economy in the world indeed your country with its young and growing population and a reservoir of untapped demand already has shown the potential to play an increasingly important role in the global economy that is surely the case despite the recent slowdown the latest imf forecast for the global economy underlined the impact on global growth of india s sharp slowdown in the second half of 2019 which was caused by weak domestic demand and falling credit growth and problems in the financial system clearly there are significant balance sheet challenges that must be addressed to return to the levels of growth that india has enjoyed in recent years if this happens and india achieves a sustained takeoff your country can play a unique role india could be in a position to help invigorate global growth transform global patterns of trade and spur investment and innovation with the right policies and a supportive global environment india could become a source of secular dynamism if you will allow me to coin a phrase if other countries can find their way as well secular dynamism in the developing world would become the needed counterweight to the secular stagnation of the advanced economies these are the topics that i would like to focus on today an important part of the global economy struggling with secular stagnation how in this setting india and other countries can achieve sustained dynamism and the crucial role for multilateral cooperation in preserving the integration that will best promote both of these efforts secular stagnation and productivity let s begin with the advanced economies which have been stuck in low gear for a decade leaving it to the emerging markets to lift global demand at the heart of secular stagnation has been lagging productivity and flagging investment opportunities along with demographic change and the effects of the global financial crisis that i mentioned another factor that has been singled out is the waning effect of the it revolution that began 30 years ago we may only be witnessing a pause in this revolution the full impact of big data artificial intelligence and other innovations on productivity may still lie ahead but it is too soon to know how that will play out for better or for worse then there is the slowdown in global trade this trend was already evident before the recent upsurge of trade tensions but it has gathered such force and breadth that we must reassess our assumptions about the immutability of open markets and cross border production chains that have helped drive decades of unprecedented global growth this is not just a matter of the u s and china whose phase i agreement certainly has been welcome in the year to october 2019 alone wto members enacted restrictions covering about 750 billion of trade reducing investment slowing job growth and unmooring global value chains the imf predicts a 0 5 percent hit to global growth this year as a result the global trading system as we know it is under threat and we could come to regret this road we have embarked upon unless cooler heads prevail reinvigorating global growth and restoring support for integration is the best remedy to these dangerous trends and in recent years the imf the g 20 and individual governments have devoted time and resources to that challenge we ve advocated structural reforms that can potentially strengthen confidence and boost investment that is to say initiatives ranging from infrastructure development to tax incentives for innovation education and health spending and product and labor market reforms we ve seen some successes but not enough results too often it has been left to the central banks to be the first and main responders to the lassitude of private investment in national economies they have done heroic work and it has mattered we reckon that last year global growth would have been 0 5 percent lower without their support but despite those efforts and vigilance growth remains subdued and financial vulnerabilities are building again especially sovereign and corporate debt markets with their vast stores of capital signal that they have low expectations that business investment will take off again as a result the search for yield wherever it can be found in a world of low interest rates has become a fact of life as investors seek out new sources of higher returns emerging markets have seen portfolio capital inflows and not a little capital flow volatility yet many developing countries still hunger for stable investment capital that could support faster sustained growth investors including advanced economy pension funds placing much of the savings of the growing population of the soon to be elderly are hesitant to make long term investments in the developing world these are the very places where large scale infrastructure projects could make such a difference and where sustained growth could help offset secular stagnation too many developing countries in need of capital and the technology that comes with it have just not reached the point of being truly investable the obstacles include opaque and inadequate legal frameworks corruption and other governance shortcomings and in some cases import restrictions and onerous regulation the potential exists for a high rate of return but the risks to realizing the fruits of your investment are still too high driving convergence without addressing these issues it will be much harder for developing countries to attract the stable long term capital that could boost economic dynamism and drive convergence of living standards with the advanced economies all of which brings me back to india and its great potential to become a source of secular dynamism this country has long worked to address its home grown challenges of development and to be investable reforms have produced high growth and lifted millions out of poverty and the indian economy has made great strides in global integration the success of your service sector is especially noteworthy india has become one of the largest exporters of information computer and telecommunications services and those services have been a key driver of productivity growth this may be the modern path to development these successes have positioned india to take advantage of the demographic dividend presented by your growing population by investing in that young workforce and advancing reforms that stimulate investment and trade india could pursue a road to convergence that was unimaginable a generation ago the stakes are high how long will it take for per capita gdp in india to reach half of the level of the united states in preparation for this event my colleagues ran some numbers at an average of 9 percent growth a year it would take 15 years at 7 percent that would be 19 years but at 5 percent growth just a bit over last year s fourth quarter growth it would be 23 years clearly 5 percent growth isn t ideal and higher growth is better what s behind the most recent numbers while credit availability and financial sector bottlenecks are often cited issues along with impaired balance sheets in parts of the corporate and financial sectors there are still other longer standing issues providing a drag on growth for one indian agriculture has lagged the impact of which was evident last year in falling rural consumption export growth has slowed over the past decade most troubling unemployment has risen and labor force participation has fallen it is particularly low for women who should be a source of economic dynamism as they have proved to be in many other economies india also needs to fully realize its comparative advantage in manufacturing where it remains constrained by the small scale of production low productivity trade restrictions infrastructure gaps and a host of other shortcomings this is the case even as engineering electronics and pharmaceuticals have emerged as leading exports and while services have boomed india s links to global value chains one route to a stronger manufacturing sector is to deepen linkages to global value chains especially the use of foreign intermediate goods in producing exports policies that limit these linkages for example tariffs on those intermediate goods constrain the emergence of the vibrant and globally competitive manufacturing that can create indian jobs so far the impact of global trade tensions on india has been limited ironically because its trade integration remains relatively limited compared with other asian exporters nonetheless the potential for reverberations through the investment channel could be significant over the medium term especially if those trade tensions worsen nonetheless india has an opportunity to emerge as a global manufacturing hub as foreign companies reassess their production base in china but so far india appears to be lagging asean in this respect for example a recent nomura securities study of 56 companies that had relocated from china found that 26 moved their factories to vietnam but only three to india what will it take to play a more important role in global value chains the answer is a combination of infrastructure investments a reduction of tariff and non tariff barriers and reforms that encourage the emergence of larger and more productive manufacturers at the end of the day success requires creating employment as argued in a recent imf study india s investment in tertiary education has been associated with strong growth in the high skilled service sector a demographic dividend can only materialize if india can complement this by spending directed at primary education to broaden access to quality education and reducing the still large gender gaps in labor force participation without these efforts together with labor market reforms aimed at protecting people versus protecting jobs a growing population could become a drag on growth and income inequalities will only widen let me offer one caveat on labor force skills technological innovation is rapidly driving down the cost of capital goods and the growth of automation and artificial intelligence potentially threatens the business model of low wage labor intensive industries the experience of the past 30 years suggests that disruptions caused by new technology come in ways we cannot predict and with a speed that leaves assumptions of best practice in ruins by one estimate 14 percent of the global workforce that is to say 375 million workers could lose their jobs in this decade as a result of automation while the advanced economies are more exposed india won t be exempt some 9 percent of indian workers could lose their jobs regardless it is important to remove the constraints that have limited integration into global value chains indian businesses must become more agile in a world in where constant innovation will determine the winners so far i spoken about what countries can do to help themselves but in my tale of two economic realities secular stagnation in aging advanced economies and potential secular dynamism in youthful developing economies most prominently india the prospects for success of each depends on both and thus on an international system that ensures integration and cooperation let me end by turning to the crucial role of multilateral cooperation the role of multilateral cooperation why is cooperation so important at this juncture india and other countries aspire to rising living standards for their people living standards that over time converge toward those of the richer countries it is hard to see how that can happen smoothly and reasonably quickly without global markets for their goods and services and capital and technology to spur the growth of production and employment for advanced economies if u s and european bond yields are any indication of returns at home their savers would benefit greatly from the opportunity to invest in profitable enterprises in fast growing and dynamic economies for all this to happen we will need to address the misgivings about multilateralism and economic integration that have arisen those misgivings arise from genuine concern about the disruptions and spillovers that accompany tighter global economic integration or that stem from inappropriate trade policies but they also arise from fear of the impacts of technological change on the future of work there is not time today to delve deeply into the question of how best to address these concerns and fears suffice it to say that the history of the 75 years since the end of world war ii has shown that our differences can be bridged by cooperation and particularly in a multilateral setting i began today by citing india s role at bretton woods where countries with common purposes charted a new course for the international community if anything there is as great a need as ever for cooperation so for the sake of this discussion let me conclude by describing the core issues that demand our common attention where solutions can help promote a stronger global economy first we cannot ignore the frictions surrounding economic integration we have to solve the conflicts emerging over trade and global value chains we need to ensure that the global cross border flow of capital is not destabilizing but produces benefits for all countries this means working together constructively to find practical solutions on protection of intellectual property unfair competitive practices unreasonable restrictions on investments and the buildup of tax havens that benefit multinational corporations and deprive resources to countries large and small if all of this means serious wto reforms then we need to get to it second we ve paid a lot more attention over the past decade to addressing the spillovers that have proven so disruptive to global growth and stability but there is much more work to do especially to ensure that secular stagnation and disinflation do not spread this relates to the capital flows i just mentioned how to mitigate the disruptive shifts in market sentiment that can send economies reeling the imf is taking the lead trying to develop a more robust set of policy tools that can be used to promote stability in the face of spillovers in a volatile world that work needs to be taken forward finally we face a host of existential threats that can only be addressed by the provision of global public goods each of these could be the subject of a separate speech climate change cyber threats the ownership and use of data new pandemics and migration these 21st century problems will not solve themselves especially if we stick our heads in the sand it is clear that individual countries cannot address them on their own yes each country can put its own house in order to create an investable business climate and secure a stable economy but that will not be enough we have to move beyond squabbling to carve out room for multilateral problem solving we know what happens when countries squabble when they go it alone working to a common purpose is the most effective means of building prosperity in the present moment to address secular stagnation and to create room for new dynamic economies like india to emerge to the benefit of all there is a great deal of work to do work that will require a commitment to our future commensurate with the commitment that c d deshmukh and his peers brought to an earlier era i hope that our children and grandchildren can look back on how we respond to these challenges with the same respect that this lecture series embodies thank you

chairman and ceo stated our fourth quarter results were as we expected with sales flat to last year and very strong cash generation operating and free cash flow for the quarter were 440 million and 300 million respectively for the full year operating and free cash flow were about 1 4 billion and 870 million respectively our leverage is approaching historical lows which provides us with the flexibility to pursue additional opportunities under our stock repurchase program we bought approximately 23 million in the fourth quarter for a total of about 375 million since the inception of the buyback program as we anticipated our businesses remained challenged by soft demand greater competition and reduced production volume in the u s markets continued to be influenced by the strong dollar the impact of lvt on other products and positive trends in housing that should be a tailwind competition has increased in our global markets impacting our pricing and mix as we leverage investments in sales and marketing to drive growth many countries where we operate are stimulating their economies with lower interest rates to encourage greater consumer spending and economic growth this year in the near term we still anticipate that most of our markets will have continued pressure in our product categories throughout the period we implemented changes to increase sales and reduce costs we have enhanced our lvt manufacturing in the u s and europe and realigned our u s carpet operations we have decreased our ceramic production and inventories and are taking out wood flooring plants in the u s and europe we are reducing the complexity of our operations enhancing processes to reduce costs and increasing automation to improve efficiencies we continue to improve the productivity and volume of our new lvt u s countertop russian sheet vinyl and european carpet tile investments our acquisitions in australia and brazil are installing state of the art equipment that will expand their product portfolios we are introducing new design and performance innovations to enhance our market positions and broaden our customer base to promote both new and existing products we are making higher levels of sales and marketing investments for the quarter our global ceramic segment sales were flat as reported and decreased 1 5 on a constant currency and days basis the segment s operating margin was 6 as reported declining year over year primarily due to inflation and lower production rates partially offset by productivity most of the segment s markets faced soft demand and excess industry capacity that is compressing market prices and margins our u s ceramic business remained under pressure from lvt taking share and high industry inventories from ceramic purchases ahead of tariffs to align our own inventory levels we meaningfully reduced production in our north american ceramic plants which increased our costs to improve sales we are rolling out multiple new products and adding sales representatives and design consultants in major markets we have begun manufacturing our proprietary new click tile in multiple sizes and designs and we have already received commitments from major customers our quartz countertop sales increased as we ramped up productivity at our new plant in mexico we continued to gain market share by expanding our brands distribution and product offering with larger sizes porcelain products and a more comprehensive wall tile collection in brazil we had good sales growth in the period and initiated a new porcelain line to create larger sizes for our premium collections the southern european economies remain slow impacting our primary ceramic markets and industry pricing in europe we increased our volume and are expanding our activities in the commercial and outdoor channels in russia we grew our sales in a soft market and we are starting up additional porcelain production to make super large sizes as well as a new plant to produce coordinated premium sanitary ware during the quarter our flooring north america segment s sales decreased 4 as reported and 5 on a constant days basis with an operating margin of 3 as reported and 7 excluding restructuring and other charges operating income for the segment declined primarily due to lower volume price and mix we have executed many initiatives to align the business with the present conditions including closing three plants consolidating high cost operations and reducing wood manufacturing the effects of these actions will increase and flow through inventory with full cost benefit in the third quarter of 2020 in the quarter our residential carpet sales performed best in the new home construction and multi family channels we are leveraging our strengths in design and fiber technology to deliver differentiated new collections in both premium and value carpet categories to create greater value for our commercial customers and improve our cost we invested in new design capabilities proprietary carpet tile backings and material manufacturing we have increased the production and speeds of our lvt operations and ongoing initiatives will further improve formulations and throughput during the period u s tariffs on click lvt were removed and the market has adjusted pricing to reflect this change to expand our price points and highlight our unique visuals and features we are introducing new rigid and flexible lvt collections for both residential and commercial markets the virus in china is postponing the start up of some production and could potentially disrupt some lvt service depending on when product shipments resume sales of our water proof laminate products are expanding and we anticipate continued growth due to their realistic appearance durability and ease of installation to support higher laminate sales we are upgrading our hdf board production to expand capacity and improve our costs for the quarter our flooring rest of the world segment s sales increased 3 as reported and 4 on a constant currency and days basis the segment s operating margin was 13 as reported and 14 excluding restructuring and other charges due to volume growth reduced start up cost and lower inflation partially offset by price and mix across the segment our investments in product innovation cost improvements acquisitions and new businesses strengthened our results we are outperforming the european laminate market and sales of our new signature collection are ramping up quickly due to an enhanced level of sophistication we announced the consolidation of wood manufacturing to our facility in malaysia which will improve our costs and increase our flexibility to better satisfy our customers our lvt sales grew as our manufacturing productivity significantly improved our new rigid collections are being well received and our next generation of flexible lvt provides our most realistic wood and stone visuals our panels and insulation businesses had good results in a more competitive environment in australia and new zealand our soft and hard surface sales grew in a difficult environment and we are launching many new carpet collections to enhance our offering market conditions remain challenging across most of our businesses and geographies in response we are adjusting our business strategies enhancing our product offering and restructuring operations we are increasing our investments in sales and marketing expanding our commercial participation and enhancing both our premium and value collections to broaden our distribution into new channels and geographies we are bringing many new product innovations and categories to market our new lvt countertop sheet vinyl and carpet tile plants are improving their productivity as we invest to expand our customer base and sales volume as our lvt manufacturing capacity grows with higher speeds and efficiencies we are enhancing design and features and increasing sales of our rigid and flexible offerings we are limiting the traditional inventory build that we typically do in the first quarter as we manage our production with market demand taking all of this into account our eps guidance for the first quarter of 2020 is 1 90 to 2 00 excluding any one time charges lvt growth in the u s exchange rates and excess global capacity continue as headwinds for our businesses we are executing specific initiatives to adapt to shifting consumer preferences changing markets and competitive pressures for the full year of 2020 we expect that our actions to increase sales and distribution reduce costs and enhance utilization of our new plants will deliver improved year over year results with our performance accelerating during the second half of the year our

argentina s debt load was unsustainable and warned that the restructuring would likely be frustrating for bondholders but we will not allow foreign funds to set the tone for macroeconomic policy guzman added citi research in a note to clients referred to the comments as anti market rhetoric the focus to make the debt sustainable without an imminent fiscal adjustment does not bode well for bondholders it said the only country with a higher perceived risk of default than argentina is venezuela according to jp morgan s emerging markets bond index plus venezuela s spread was an eye watering 12 990 basis points over treasuries on thursday while the index as a whole stood at a spread of 307 basis points argentina s biggest creditor the international monetary fund imf sent a team of economists to buenos aires this week to work out a plan for the government to repay the 44 billion it owes the multilateral lender the deal will set the stage for restructuring talks with bondholders this will be a complex negotiation but i believe the argentines understand there is a limit to how much pain they can impose on the bondholders said alberto bernal chief emerging markets strategist at xp investments in new york advertisement 3 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the government says it needs to push out the maturities of about 100 billion in bonds and loans to give breathing room to an economy asphyxiated by recession and high inflation on tuesday the government ruffled the market when it unilaterally postponed a 1 47 billion principal payment on its af20 bond from thursday until sept 30 the af20 was very poorly handled but i still believe that there is some merit in deciding not to print money to pay for that amortization bernal said it shows that the government understands the clear causality that exists between printing pesos and further deterioration of inflation expectations latin america s no 3 economy is expected by private analysts to shrink 1 5 in 2020 with inflation seen easing to 41 7 from over 50 currently guzman and the fund say initial meetings between the two have been constructive but imf spokesman gerry rice warned that the fund s ability to grant debt forgiveness was not unlimited the capacity of the imf to restructure debt to postpone repayments is constrained by our legal and policy frameworks he told reporters in washington reporting by hugh bronstein additional reporting by walter bianchi eliana raszewski cassandra garrison and hernan nessi

s earnings press release supplemental information forms 10 q and 10 k are available on the company s website todd todd meredith president chief executive officer thank you carla i will focus on three key topics today first the increased momentum of ffo per share growth in 2019 second healthcare realty s key building blocks for growth including a higher level of net investment and third our positive outlook for 2020 healthcare realty reported strong results for the fourth quarter and full year 2019 normalized ffo per share grew from 1 57 in 2018 to 1 60 per share in 2019 momentum increased throughout the year built on solid fundamentals of sustainable internal and external growth our portfolio again performed well with same store noi growing right in line with expectations around 3 most importantly our focus is on driving steady revenue growth with contractual rent increases tenant retention and cash leasing spreads we also contained expenses quite well which accelerated noi for the multi tenant properties 2019 external growth was led by robust acquisition volume approaching 400 million nearly double our historical pace equally important we sold far fewer properties than in recent years it s worth noting we sold some of our last post acute properties in 2019 along with a handful of mobs at more indicative cap rates following a period of costly dispositions and reducing leverage healthcare realty s portfolio and balance sheet are in great shape with the environment for medical office and while the environment for medical office investment remains competitive our confidence to invest at an attractive pace is based on our established relationships financial strength and access to accretive capital a key part of our strategy is to avoid bidding wars and portfolio premiums is often as possible in 2019 we sourced nearly 70 of our acquisitions working directly with owners and brokers before the properties were widely marketed we rely on our deep relationships to buy what we target rather than what is listed for sale a great example is the mob we recently acquired in orange county a property we ve been pursuing for years through direct dialog with the owner and the help of a local broker we are also using our mob experience and operational expertise to help our health system partners meet their expanding real estate needs hospitals and physicians are increasingly providing outpatient services across a range of settings to achieve market share and revenue growth while balancing value and efficiency critical in today s healthcare environment as an example we re working with baptist memorial health care in memphis to redevelop 111 000 square foot property into a strategic hub within their outpatient network this off campus property will include a surgery center a large orthopedic clinic a lung practice and other complementary services outpatient expansions like these are happening across the country and correlate with favorable national trends in 2019 more than two thirds of all new healthcare jobs were in the ambulatory and outpatient sector what s most gratifying to us is seeing these trends initiated through our well established throughout our well established network of health system relationships as another example in nashville we re working with st thomas part of ascension to redevelop one of our smaller existing properties into a state of the art 100 000 square foot mob tied directly into their new women s hospital and the creation of a new front entrance to the campus looking ahead to 2020 the pipeline for acquisitions is strong and moving forward we are planning for fewer dispositions at better cap rates and we expect a couple of developments to begin soon higher more consistent net investment volume steady same store growth and disciplined capital spending are the key building blocks we will use to grow ffo per share and improve dividend coverage in 2020 and the years ahead now i d like to turn over to bethany for an update on the healthcare trends bethany a mancini corporate communications 2019 was an active year for the trump administration s regulatory agenda and congressional attempts to address certain healthcare costs the legal standing of the aca was challenged in the appellate court and in the end health policy finished the year relatively status quo congress specifically addressed two voter friendly healthcare initiatives one the rise in pharmaceutical prices and the other a bipartisan bill to limit patient costs for out of network medical care both efforts failed to gain traction with party line division over the issue of market intervention and price control amid intense industry lobbying from insurers providers and pharmaceutical companies these initiatives are already beginning to resurface in 2020 both sides and congress would like a voter friendly win on healthcare in an election year but a partisan standoff could again stalemate any real movement on legislation if neither side is willing to compromise and concede a political win to the other on the regulatory front the trump administration and cms remained quite active bms issued rulings last year requiring hospitals to list standard prices beginning in 2021 and this year site neutral medicare payment rates will apply to clinic visit in all off campus hospital outpatient departments these rulings among others are being challenged and installed in the quarter cms admittedly is adhering to an aggressive regulatory approach in spite of the certain opposition and legal roadblock the administration acknowledges partly bringing these issues to light through the regulatory process in the hope of eventually influencing legislation on the judicial side the aca remains under scrutiny in the texas v azar case the federal appeals court remanded the case back to the district court to consider it favorability from the now defunct individual mandate the supreme court is expected to ultimately rule on this case most likely not before 2021 moving past the political realm hospital fundamentals appear strong with positive reimbursement rates and commercial price increases in 2020 and signs of stable admissions and revenue growth with pressure to lower costs health systems are focused less on their number of admissions and more on improving margins by treating patients in efficient care settings health systems are expanding outpatient facilities across markets and focusing their hospital campuses on higher acuity inpatient and outpatient care the aha s 2020 hospital stats report confirms these trends hospital saw a decrease in their outpatient visits by 0 9 in 2018 specifically in the number of er visits which are moving in part to lower cost settings more convenient to patients other areas of hospital outpatient utilization were stable or up slightly from the prior year with higher acuity leading to an increase in total outpatient revenues up 4 5 we continue to see among healthcare realty tenant and health system partners in sizable fast growing markets the outpatient care is on the right across the spectrum of service setting outpatient facilities represent one of the few proven strategies to remove unnecessary costs from the healthcare system while cms insurers and providers continue to explore value based care and quality incentive payments most reimbursement rates are still largely fee for service and volume driven accordingly outpatient care is expected to remain one of the most critical and attractive strategy for health systems and providers to meet rising demand lower cost and enhanced profit margin healthcare realty will continue to selectively invest in outpatient facilities that are well located and aligned with strong health system positioned relevant to current healthcare trends and with the potential for long term growth now i ll turn it over to rob for an overview of investment activity rob rob hull executive vice president of investments thank you bethany i m going to summarize healthcare realty s 2019 investment activity and provide our outlook for the coming year healthcare realty finished 2019 with strong acquisition volume annual net investment activity with more than seven times that of 2018 well above our historical pace increased acquisition volume was driven by our internal sourcing process targeting well located buildings with the greatest potential for growth to summarize the year we acquired 18 properties in 16 separate transactions for 381 million at a blended cap rate of 5 5 and we re very accretive at our cost of capital what i really like about these properties is about one third establish new relationships or in new markets that will further our growth in the coming years and each property on and off campus is important to our health partners as they shifted the delivery of care into the most appropriate setting also during the year we funded 29 million of several developments including charlotte seattle and memphis we sold 10 mobs for 28 million at a combined cap rate of 5 5 and disposed of our last skilled nursing facility and two independent inpatient rehab facilities dispositions for 2019 totaled 55 million about half of our recent average annual sales volume now i ll give you an overview of our acquisitions in the quarter we purchased six properties for a total of 107 million included are two mobs i mentioned on last quarter s call one in raleigh was purchased for 22 million is adjacent to wakemed s north hospital and is our first building in the market the other a 20 million investment anchored by an asc is located in dallas adjacent to baylor scott white s plano hospital additionally we acquired three mobs in seattle bringing total square footage in the market to 1 4 million square feet the first of these was a 23 million mob with the primary tenant being evergreenhealth a new relationship for healthcare realty the building is conveniently located in a dense area with direct access to interstate 405 and just three tenths of a mile from evergreen s 318 bed main hospital second was an mob we purchased for 10 million adjacent to commonspirit s highline medical center we now own nearly two thirds of the mob space around this hospital giving us flexibility to accommodate tenant expansions and best serve our healthcare partners last in seattle was an off campus mob we purchased for 24 million anchored by overlake and uw medicine two of our long standing relationships each system is offering services at this location integral to increasing its market share and serving the rapidly growing population these five acquisitions totaled almost 99 million at a blended cap rate of 5 7 this excludes the purchase of a building in memphis related to a redevelopment which is expected to stabilize at a 7 6 yield looking ahead we expect acquisition volumes for 2020 to remain robust so far this year we have purchased an 87 000 square foot mob in los angeles for 42 million the building is adjacent to memorialcare s 252 bed saddleback medical center the real opportunity here is that leasing discussions are under way that would take occupancy from 80 to over 90 and would increase the yield to over 6 beyond this investment we have several properties we expect to close by the end of this quarter and a solid pipeline of directly sourced and targeted acquisitions we are setting initial guidance for 2020 at 250 million to 350 million 70 greater than our initial guidance at this time last year and which reflects the strength and current visibility of our pipeline we expect cap rates to average 5 to 5 8 consistent with 2019 dispositions for 2020 are expected to be generally in line with last year s reduced sales volume at lower average cap rates and with non mob sales largely behind us we expect 25 million to 75 million of dispositions this year at an average cap rate of 5 5 to 6 5 regarding development activity our embedded pipeline continues to produce a steady source of investment we commenced construction at our memphis redevelopment that i introduced last quarter and we are already in discussions with several tenants to expand their space the redevelopment is 85 pre leased and is anchored by a surgery center in seattle our first tenant and asc occupancy this month at a 151 000 square foot on campus development more importantly quarterly noi is projected to be over 600 000 once all leases once all signed leases take occupancy in the third quarter we are also talking to several prospective tenants about taking space in the building including additional hospital services and a third party women s health practice looking ahead for 2020 we expect to start two to three more developments in tennessee north carolina washington or texas driven by an expansion of services from our healthcare partners as an example ascension st thomas hospital in nashville has announced an expansion plan of over 300 million on a 683 bed midtown campus included will be a new women s hospital a related surgical addition and an inpatient rehab facility with healthcare realty s prior redevelopment on this campus fully leased we are in discussions with the hospital to replace and expand another building we own at the front door to the new women s hospital the 100 000 square foot mob redevelopment has a budget of 40 million as we move into 2020 i m pleased with the pace of acquisition and development activity produced by our internal sourcing process and our team s ability to foster key relationships together with lower disposition levels at better cap rates than in years past our outlook for the year s net investment activity is bright now i will turn it over to kris to discuss financial and operational performance for the quarter and full year kris douglas executive vice president chief financial officer thanks rob the fourth quarter much like the year itself was defined by the continued strong performance of our same store properties complemented by an increased acquisition pace combined those factors resulted in a normalized ffo per share increase for 2019 of 1 7 growth accelerated in the second half of the year with fourth quarter ffo per share increasing 4 year over year to 0 41 sequentially ffo was 3 1 million higher than the third quarter of 2019 primarily due to a 1 2 million contribution from net investment activity and an 800 000 reversal of third quarter seasonal utilities the remaining increase was split between higher leasing activity lower g a and lower interest expense on the operations front trailing 12 month same store noi increased 2 9 led by the reliably strong growth of our same store multi tenant properties at 3 2 and single tenant net lease properties at 1 8 single tenant noi growth is consistent with our expectations given that nearly 30 of the leases have non annual escalators that have not had an increase in the past 24 months noi growth will remain at this level for the first three quarters of 2020 an increase in the fourth quarter with the next non annual rent increase occurring in october we anticipate occupancy within the single tenant portfolio to remain at 100 there is only one lease expiration this year an 83 000 square foot on campus mob in and renewal discussions with the tenant indicate a favorable outcome the solid growth from our same store multi tenant properties was due to a combination of reliable revenue growth and prudent expense management revenue per occupied square foot increased 2 6 while operating expenses grew just 1 5 lower than average expense growth was primarily the result of a 3 reduction in utility expenses in addition successful tax appeals resulted in a historically low 1 3 increase in real estate taxes during the year we continue to proactively manage all line items and expect overall expenses to increase in 2020 within our long term expectation of 2 to 2 5 internal revenue growth indicators are strong as evidenced by the following key performance metrics from the quarter cash leasing spreads averaged 4 2 tenant retention was 86 6 the average in place contractual increase was 2 9 and for the leases executed in the quarter future contractual increases are 3 16 these metrics point to the viability of ongoing internal growth shifting to capital and the balance sheet the fourth quarter saw an increase in maintenance capex as expected even with the higher spend in the quarter total capex for the year was 1 million less than in 2018 as a result the fad payout ratio improved 500 basis points to 95 looking forward to 2020 the midpoint of our maintenance capex guidance is 60 million this is 4 9 above 2019 actual and compares favorably when considering portfolio square footage is up approximately 6 in 2020 we raised 103 million of equity during the quarter through the atm which was used to fund the 149 million of acquisitions closed during the quarter and last month including the january acquisition debt to ebitda would have been 5 times which is at the low end of our target leverage as a reminder our line balance will reduce at the end of this month when we draw down our 150 million seven year term loan our flexible balance sheet improving payout ratio and availability of capital positions us well to fund our growth opportunities and looking ahead our compounding internal growth coupled with increased net investment activity will drive ffo per share growth operator we are now ready to open the line for questions questions and answers operator we ll now begin the question and answer session first question comes from nick joseph with citi please go ahead nick joseph citigroup analyst thanks you mentioned the portfolio cap rate premium versus relationship driven deals i m wondering if you could put some numbers around that in terms of what you re seeing in terms of portfolio deals today versus the guidance that you provided for 2020 todd meredith president chief executive officer i think in terms of portfolio deals 50 basis point to in some cases 100 basis point premium on portfolio deals related in regards to what we re seeing transactions that are being produced by our internal sourcing process and through direct relationships that we have nick joseph citigroup analyst and is that given that premium is there an opportunity to put together a portfolio sell into that strength kris douglas executive vice president chief financial officer certainly if we felt like we needed to i think we could certainly see that coming together i think our view would be it really just comes down to as we talked about we really see our portfolio being in great shape and probably don t see a super large portfolio or need to put together a large portfolio to sell certainly i think if we did that we could certainly drive those kind of premiums like as rob said other sellers have been doing but for us we re really viewing this more as a maintenance level activity now that the portfolio is in such great shape nick joseph citigroup analyst thanks just maybe on guidance appreciate all of the line items that you provide what are your thoughts of not providing ffo and normalized ffo guidance kris douglas executive vice president chief financial officer i think our view is philosophically we really like to have folks have the building blocks and put that together and understand all the pieces it s not that we couldn t do that along with ffo guidance i think probably the biggest issue is keeping the focus on those pieces and if we saw that folks were having a difficult time using those pieces to put together their own estimates or it was materially wide range of estimates or materially off our own expectations i think we would certainly put more emphasis on that but i think we re more comfortable with the pieces and think it seems to be working pretty well with those that follow us and put together their estimates like yourself nick joseph citigroup analyst sounds good thanks kris douglas executive vice president chief financial officer thank you operator our next question comes from jordan sadler with keybanc capital markets please go ahead jordan sadler keybanc capital markets analyst thanks i just wanted to sort of continue on the investment prospects i think rob we mentioned that the outlook for investment activity is bright and you ve obviously had a lot of success in 19 can you talk to what s driving this is as a sourcing process just continuing to evolve is it sort of this adjacency that seems to be unfolding in terms of new investments relative to existing investments that s driving it what s sort of the it s one of the key drivers if you will and what keeps you so optimistic todd meredith president chief executive officer sure i think you hit it the key driver sort of the leading concept there is really the effort to source these acquisitions through our own direct channels and relationships and we ve really just seen that pipeline build through that effort i would say over the last couple of years and you ve heard us picking up our discussion about that in the last several quarters so we re really just building that confidence from sort of the reach we have with our team the depth and market reach very targeted in certain markets that we want to build in and go into some new markets and then obviously expanding with our health system relationships and partners there so it s really putting those pieces together the strength and experience the depth of our team has really been translating and certainly we re trying to really target using our cost of capital where it makes sense accretively and obviously that helps and you saw a big contrast in that 18 versus 19 so it s but i would say primarily it s really that internal sourcing effort jordan sadler keybanc capital markets analyst is your focus and i think we ve talked about this also in the past is there a sort of like a little bit of an increased appetite for off campus or how is that factoring into the sort of underwriting at this point it seems they re like more of these are seem to be adjacent or off campus as opposed to on kris douglas executive vice president chief financial officer right if you look at 2019 about 70 were on our adjacent and 30 were just outside that i would say it was a bit of a unique year in that regard and that we had quite a cluster of assets that as you just pointed out sort of live between this quarter mile and a third of mile so that s obviously not going very far out on the risk curve and i would say it s also been in very dense markets like seattle so that s been rob walk through some of those and some of those are just outside that quarter mile definition so we re sort of live and by our own tight definition of that and so you re picking up on that not really an intention to move away from campus however we re certainly willing to look off campus you ve heard of several of us talk about the shifting of outpatient obviously it s shifting to outpatient from the hospital but that s a lot of that s on campus but we re also willing to work with our health system partners if that means going off campus you ve often heard us talk about reservation about off campus really that issue is just understanding the real estate value and then making sure any additional risk we see that there is some additional return related to that so really there was only one building in our whole activity set for 19 that was materially away from a hospital i think it was about 3 5 miles it was also in the seattle area that rob as rob described it and i think the yield was just over 6 and reflected that at additional perceived risk that we have of being off campus jordan sadler keybanc capital markets analyst okay todd meredith president chief executive officer and i would just add to that then that 1 billion we had two systems that are we have deep relationships with so that was the driving force as well jordan sadler keybanc capital markets analyst yeah that s helpful and then just on the cap rate on sort of deals expected for 2020 that low end 5 i mean are we where do you see the market headed right now rob obviously your cost of capital has kind of come back and you ve got some support but is there a greater level of availability at that price point or is it or is pricing sort of getting a little bit more aggressive relative to last year how would you characterize that rob hull executive vice president of investments jordan i d say that if you look at 2019 we averaged about 5 5 on our cap rates it s early this year we ve seen that so far the deals that we re looking at and that we re pursuing cap rates have been consistent with that so i think it s a little early to tell at this point we aren t seeing much movement in cap rates but kind of going back to the way we source deals and our internal sourcing process versus chasing marketed deals we may be a little insulated from that so but for us right now it seems to be somewhat consistent with last year but continue to keep our eye on that todd meredith president chief executive officer and jordan i would say to the point about marketed deals the large portfolios that were mentioned earlier i think that s where you tend to see that come out and people follow that trend more so i think as rob said it s early and if we do see some larger transactions later this year i think those will be the ones to watch to see if those bigger portfolios drive lower on cap rates as you say in terms of just and it kind of makes sense there is obviously a lower cost of capital especially in the debt markets for a lot of potential bidders so you could see that but our view as rob said is we re probably little insulated from that based on our internal sourcing focus jordan sadler keybanc capital markets analyst okay and then just lastly i guess kris you mentioned that capex is expected to increase in the fourth quarter i don t know if i missed this but just specifically as it relates to leasing costs from renewals i think they were up to 23 of cash noi in the quarter ti s up to 3 15 per square foot per year any was there a particular lease or two that sort of drove this spike and maybe just offer a little bit of color kris douglas executive vice president chief financial officer yeah i had a couple of points there i guess first on the commitments that yes you re correct it was a bit higher and it is related to one specific lease be it was well over 3 in total we have one lease that made about 70 000 square feet that was higher than significantly higher than the average up closer to 4 50 and that was due to the fact that it was multiple suites associated with this tenant and as part of the renewal we made the determination to consolidate and move a lot of the space across contiguous space which is going to be more efficient for them but it also opens up for us the ability to have larger blocks of space to drive occupancy and future growth in the periods ahead so it was a strategic decision to do that we also did have almost 10 cash leasing spread on that renewal and we were able to increase the in place contractual escalators from 2 5 to 3 so an example of maintenance capex decisions that have good investments and good returns associated with them so that was in the commitments and part of those dollars are going to run through your spend in this quarter that some of it in the last quarter and some of it will be in future quarters but as we will talk about regularly you will see actual spin fluctuate from quarter to quarter it s just not as consistent as you would see in earnings but overall the spend for the year on total maintenance capex of 57 million is down 1 million from last year and was within our expectations and consistent with that payout ratio of 95 that we had indicated we expected for the year when we talked on our last call jordan sadler keybanc capital markets analyst how big did you say that one lease was kris douglas executive vice president chief financial officer it was 70 000 square feet so it s about 20 of the overall renewal volume in the quarter jordan sadler keybanc capital markets analyst okay thank you operator our next question comes from chad vanacore of stifel please go ahead tau stifel nicolaus analyst hi good morning this is tau on for chad my first question is a follow on question on the acquisition guidance looks like your acquisition for 2020 guidance is still solid but it s lower compared to the 2019 deals that you guys completed is it just a matter of being conservative are you guys seeing more increased competition in your targeted price point for the assets or are you seeing any change in pricing i think while towering the call you used the word frenzy and hinted that large portfolio cap rates have been compressed so how should we think about the market in general and also the cadence of the acquisition throughout the year rob hull executive vice president of investments yeah i think if you look at again the cap rates we did last year there in that mid fives range and we see that being early in the year we see that being consistent with what we did last year i think as you referred to the guidance i mean we have a solid pipeline of opportunities we re off to a strong start we ve closed on a 42 million deal already we have a good number of additional deals that are under contract or loi i think what you ll find with our pipeline is that a majority of it is internally sourced deals through relationships that we have those buildings are not often for sale and so we spend a lot of time working with owners and brokers on those deals and so as we look out for the year the predictability of what we can close early in the year is only so visible as you look toward the end of the year and that becomes more and more as we go through the year that becomes more and more confident and we have more and more confidence in that so it s really about kind of setting the initial guidance that was significantly above where we were last year but setting that guidance with some reasonable amount of confidence and what we can get close based on that pipeline that s internally sourced tau stifel nicolaus analyst okay and also you ve lowered the cash noi growth outlook to 2 3 to 3 2 in 2020 that s a little bit lower compared to 2019 because you realized 2 9 i m just wondering what are the primary driver of that lower guidance it looks like the midpoint of outlook is a little bit higher than 2019 but maybe rate is a little bit softer but it is also in the kind of the expense outlook kris douglas executive vice president chief financial officer yeah so first off i would say the short answer is it has a lot to do with comps and comparability with some great results that we saw in the last year that will fall into the prior periods that will create some changes in terms of your comparability year over year but as you re looking out through the year we expect the noi same store noi to come in similar to where if not above where we came in this year 3 plus up close to the top end of the range but because of the comparability issues and some of the previous periods it will create a little bit slower momentum in the first half of the year you can see that if you look at the quarterly noi year over year growth and specifically if you look at the first quarter of 19 and fourth quarter of 2018 both of those periods had 4 plus year over year noi growth and so those will now end up in the prior period comp that we will be comparing off of moving forward so if those move out of the comparable period you re going to get back to the 3 plus that we had historically been reporting but if you look to the underlying growth metrics that really drive revenue in terms of cash leasing spreads tenant retention contractual escalators all of those are staying in the 3 range on the growth that we ve historically seen and that s what gives you the confidence and insight as to the expectations of long term growth but overall you kind of look at it and say quarter to quarter you could see growth anywhere between 2 and 4 on a quarterly basis with a midpoint around 3 it will moderate a bit when you look on a trailing 12 month basis maybe more in that 2 5 to 3 5 range but still overall we are looking at right at plus or minus 3 growth long term tau stifel nicolaus analyst okay and lastly from me you have close to 20 of your lease that you expire in 2020 are there any large leases that we should be aware of kris douglas executive vice president chief financial officer in any year you re always going to have certain amount of leases rolling i ll say last year we actually had more than 20 so we re down a little bit but plus or minus 20 is what we would generally expect we do have fitness center in dallas that we have talked about on previous calls that we are in the process of working with the hospital to as they are looking to transition operations to a new operator they re probably going to take about half of the 100 000 plus square feet and we are working on backfilling the rest of that space as well as a potential redevelopment of the entire building to capitalize on the momentum that s coming from the new fitness center as well as a 300 000 square foot new administrative building that the hospital is completing directly next door which is creating a lot of vibrancy in that area so that will be occurring this year we also have a general office tenant and a building also in dallas that s about 60 000 square feet that in the back half of the year we don t expect to renew we re already in the process of working on backfilling that space and have a 10 000 square foot user has already signed up to take a portion of that so there will be maybe a little bit of timing as we backfill but it s in a great area of dallas right near the northpark mall right on the expressway there and we ve had tremendous leasing success in a couple of buildings we own right there so feel good about it but that is a larger exploration for us given that our average tenant size is about 4 000 square feet tau stifel nicolaus analyst thanks for the additional details thanks for taking my call operator thank you next question comes from connor siversky berenberg please go ahead connor siversky berenberg capital markets llc analyst good morning everybody and thanks for having me just a couple of questions on dispositions i m seeing the purchase option schedule in the 10 k can you provide any kind of color on the timing or execution of these contracts todd meredith president chief executive officer yeah in the k what that lays out are any options that are available there are a portion that are available today that does not mean they have been exercised none of them have been exercised and they ve been available for quite some time i can t remember off the top of my head there is a footnote on there i think there has been 10 to 15 years that these on average have been available and have not been exercised but they re basically perpetually open but we don t have any expectation that they re going to be exercised at this time connor siversky berenberg capital markets llc analyst okay thanks for that and then on this acquisition in los angeles at the beginning of the year any additional color you could provide on the building is it specialized for any specific function and then any details on the existing lease term as well rob hull executive vice president of investments on the building we acquired in los angeles it is adjacent to settle back hospital there it s a sizable hospital and it s a multi tenant building typical of what we would be pursuing and i would say it s not special purpose asset by any means but just more in line with the multi tenant buildings that we like to purchase with good tenancy that is representative of the quality health system that s adjacent to it connor siversky berenberg capital markets llc analyst got you got you thanks for that again and then in terms of future capex expectations are you guys seeing any developing regulations or maybe building code adjustments that would necessitate an increase in capex spend going forward kris douglas executive vice president chief financial officer it really goes jurisdiction by jurisdiction we ve had some of that in california frankly that we ve been experiencing over the last three four five years and so it s already inside of our spend in that area but overall across the country we re not seeing anything that materially is changing our expectation on what our spend we do expect obviously there is going to be inflationary pressures on capital including ti and building capex but we think that with being able to continue to drive rent growth in that 3 plus range that we are able to more than accommodate and get a return on the capital that is associated with all of our ti projects connor siversky berenberg capital markets llc analyst all right got you and then last one from me on that our first investment in raleigh any promising trends in that market that you see that could can generate some continued interest investments there on your end todd meredith president chief executive officer sure i mean raleigh as i mentioned that s our first investment in that market we think it s a strong market good growth profile good health systems and we think there is some opportunity there in the market to make additional investments so we re excited about being in that market and our team is continuing to form relationships and pursue opportunities there connor siversky berenberg capital markets llc analyst all right great that s all from me thank you operator next question comes from jonathan hughes raymond james please go ahead jonathan hughes raymond james associates analyst hey good morning on the internally sourced deal pipeline and the better pricing there i mean why are these healthcare systems not market those properties and get a better price it s certainly not for lack of interest or capital chasing mobs i mean do they like the certainty of sale and long term ownership by selling to you and that s it or is there another piece of expertise or data analytics capabilities you bring to those systems whereby they re willing to forego a higher price from another buyer todd meredith president chief executive officer well i would be careful to bifurcate this we re really as rob said looking more at individual properties buying them one by one and frankly most of them are not from health systems we would tell you year after year that you just don t see a whole lot coming from health systems certainly some do come from health systems occasionally so there is a big difference here where you have a very fragmented owner base or seller list of sellers we did 16 different transactions for 18 properties in 19 so that gives you a sense of that so i think it s really just that issue that we re buying from individual owners and you re right if somebody had that portfolio of all those properties we bought 19 and package it together maybe they can drive that larger portfolio pricing and that s what rob was referring to is when you look at some of the larger portfolios that transacted in 19 and years past our view is that there has been a portfolio premium paid for some of those larger portfolios and i m really referring to sort of 1 billion close to 1 billion or more type size where you can get those kind of premiums so i just think based on where we re focused with the internal sourcing and individual transactions you re just it s not that we re not paying market price as we are we think we re paying indicative pricing for those assets it s just you re not driving additional portfolio premium beyond that rob hull executive vice president of investments i d add to that jonathan that where we have seen obviously the value that we re bringing to the health systems is through development and the way we re doing development a lot of the development we re doing now is in conjunction with the hospital and generally you get into some strategic decisions there about not only the development you re doing but sometimes that will lead to an acquisition opportunity maybe it s one or two buildings but it s really coming from that interaction with the health system and you sort of proving your value through your ability to develop and provide some services to them a good example of that is what we re doing in memphis on that redevelopment there that s been an opportunity that we ve worked hand in hand with the health system and we re seeing a lot of benefits from a relation standpoint because of that jonathan hughes raymond james associates analyst okay that s helpful i think you said 16 transactions for what 18 properties last year i mean how many of those 16 transactions were actually buying the real estate from a system kris douglas executive vice president chief financial officer i don t well memphis yeah the redevelopment property that i mentioned that memphis transaction other than that i don t think there were any that were purchased from the system jonathan hughes raymond james associates analyst okay and then switching to kind of looking at the lease schedule this year 20 of the multi tenant leases rolled is there potential for the cash leasing spreads there to go above 4 like last year in multi tenant or is that unlikely given the i think it s about 12 of vacancy or so in that portfolio kris douglas executive vice president chief financial officer it s going to move around from quarter to quarter and depend on just the mix that you are able to achieve if you look at this year and what we ve seen historically the majority we break down in our disclosure each quarter in our earnings release the different ranges of the cash leasing spreads and you ll have a portion that will be negative i think it s running around 10 that s generally consistent with what we have seen historically but then it really comes down your average is going to depend on that total distribution but if you look at distribution over time we the majority of it still runs in that 3 to 4 range we think that s the appropriate way to look at the long term but if you re able to do a little bit better on 4 plus and moderate the negatives then you can see results like we did this quarter but we think that the 3 to 4 continues to be achievable and is our expectation for 20 as well jonathan hughes raymond james associates analyst okay the 88 occupancy for the multi tenant mob portfolio is that peak structural occupancy can it ever get to a low 90 range kris douglas executive vice president chief financial officer our view is with multi tenant it is certainly a lower number than you might see obviously if you blend in a lot of single tenant 88 to 90 certainly is probably something over time that we see being able to achieve but it s not just pure lease up sometimes it s selling assets that may be for whatever reason stuck in the 70s and for a prolonged period and we ve made our efforts and we can t seem to move it so maybe it becomes a disposition or just maybe a matter of time so it really is a portfolio effect and i would say the example kris gave about the large tenant that we re strategically combining space to open up larger blocks it takes those kind of long term moves and investments in ti to really optimize that so it s a slow steady process of building from 88 both from a portfolio construction standpoint but also then within buildings so our view is probably moving slowly toward 90 is where our focus is todd meredith president chief executive officer you re also going to have in that your development and how much space maybe still left to lease up and a development once it s completed but that s another example of a good opportunity to drive income as well as occupancy over time jonathan hughes raymond james associates analyst okay and that s helpful thanks for the time todd meredith president chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from vikram malhotra morgan stanley please go ahead selina pi morgan stanley analyst good morning this is selina on for vikram so thanks for taking my question just was curious what your expectations are for the fad payout ratio in 2020 based on your current capex outlook todd meredith president chief executive officer sure if you look obviously as kris described we moved from about just under 100 to 95 going from 18 to 19 if you look at our midpoint or the range we have for capex and all the growth drivers we have we really do see ourselves driving toward 90 hopefully we can achieve most of that in 20 so our view is we should see continued improvement in 2020 and obviously in the years beyond that but that s sort of the progress we re looking for is driving that toward certainly toward 90 selina pi morgan stanley analyst great and just one last question any high level thoughts of around how more a medicare for all stance may impact mob in some of your tenants todd meredith president chief executive officer i would say generally speaking we ve talked about that i think the key thing is the probabilities there is a lot of sequence of low probability events have to occur so spending a lot of time on it right now is probably maybe not the best use but i think the key takeaway is it s not going to change the fact that people need healthcare that there will be demand you have an aging population and again some of the incentives if you make healthcare essentially no cost no marginal cost for folks not setting taxes as high no marginal cost at the incurrence of use then you could actually see usage go up and so it may cause some restructuring in some uncertainty around that certainly from the health insurance side going from private to government but certainly we think mobs will be necessary doctors will be necessary all those services shifting to outpatient will become if not the same urgency more urgency around that so we continue to see benefits from that not to discount the turbulence that might happen in that transition we still think there s strong fundamentals behind that selina pi morgan stanley analyst great thanks for taking my question todd meredith president chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from lukas hartwich green street advisors please go ahead lukas hartwich green street advisors analyst thanks can you just comment on the broader supply outlook for medical office todd meredith president chief executive officer yeah i mean i think if you look at the transactions that we ve seen over the past five years has been above 10 billion that s traded out there i think as you look at the developments and development pace that s out there it s been pretty consistent in that 1 to 2 of total mob supply that s in the market we see that continuing to click along at a pretty steady pace over the next few years and so i don t see a lot of meaningful change and big chunks of supply coming on online so it s been pretty consistent lukas hartwich green street advisors analyst have you seen any increase in speculative development todd meredith president chief executive officer no no we have not seen any increase in speculative development lukas hartwich green street advisors analyst great kris douglas executive

equipment including real estate net ii intangible impairments iii other income expense net which includes foreign currency transaction gains losses net iv significant acquisition costs and v restructuring charges adjusted ebitda margin is calculated by dividing adjusted ebitda by total revenues we use multiples of current or projected adjusted ebitda in conjunction with our discounted cash flow models to determine our estimated overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets we believe adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin provide our current and potential investors with relevant and useful information regarding our ability to generate cash flow to support business investment these measures are an integral part of the internal reporting system we use to assess and evaluate the operating performance of our business adjusted ebitda excludes both interest expense net and the provision benefit for income taxes these expenses are associated with our capitalization and tax structures which we do not consider when evaluating the operating profitability of our core operations finally adjusted ebitda does not include depreciation and amortization expenses in order to eliminate the impact of capital investments which we evaluate by comparing capital expenditures to incremental revenue generated and as a percentage of total revenues adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin should be considered in addition to but not as a substitute for other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap such as operating income

calculation of adjusted eps was 18 2 for the twelve months ended december 31 2019 and 18 2 for the twelve months ended december 31 2018 the tax impact of reconciling items and discrete tax items is calculated using the current quarter s estimate of the annual structural tax rate for both the three month and full year periods this may result in the current period adjustment plus prior reported

net debt includes debt hedge derivatives for appendix please open the pdf file by clicking on the link at the end of the press release disclaimer the group is exposed to fluctuations in copper prices in connection with its distribution of cable products cables accounted for approximately 14 of the group s sales and copper accounts for approximately 60 of the composition of cables this exposure is indirect since cable prices also reflect copper suppliers commercial policies and the competitive environment in the group s markets changes in copper prices have an estimated so called recurring effect and an estimated so called non recurring effect on the group s performance assessed as part of the monthly internal reporting process of the rexel group i the recurring effect related to the change in copper based cable prices corresponds to the change in value of the copper part included in the sales price of cables from one period to another this effect mainly relates to the group s sales ii the non recurring effect related to the change in copper based cable prices corresponds to the effect of copper price variations on the sales price of cables between the time they are purchased and the time they are sold until all such inventory has been sold direct effect on gross profit practically the non recurring effect on gross profit is determined by comparing the historical purchase price for copper based cable and the supplier price effective at the date of the sale of the cables by the rexel group additionally the non recurring effect on ebita corresponds to the non recurring effect on gross profit which may be offset when appropriate by the non recurring portion of changes in the distribution and administrative expenses the impact of these two effects is assessed for as much of the group s total cable sales as possible over each period group procedures require that entities that do not have the information systems capable of such exhaustive calculations to estimate these effects based on a sample representing at least 70 of the sales in the period the results are then extrapolated to all cables sold during the period for that entity considering the sales covered the rexel group considers such estimates of the impact of the two effects to be reasonable this document may contain statements of future expectations and other forward

90 days supplemental reporting measures we believe that net income and net income attributable to common stockholders nics as defined by u s generally accepted accounting principles u s gaap are the most appropriate earnings measurements however we consider funds from operations ffo normalized ffo revpor same store revpor ss revpor net operating income noi and same store noi ssnoi to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance these supplemental measures are disclosed on our pro rata ownership basis pro rata amounts are derived by reducing consolidated amounts for minority partners noncontrolling ownership interests and adding our minority ownership share of unconsolidated amounts we do not control unconsolidated investments while we consider pro rata disclosures useful they may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our joint venture arrangements and should be used with caution historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with u s gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation however since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient in response the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of operating performance for reits that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income ffo attributable to common stockholders as defined by nareit means net income attributable to common stockholders computed in accordance with u s gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate and impairments of depreciable assets plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests normalized ffo attributable to common stockholders represents ffo attributable to common stockholders adjusted for certain items detailed in exhibit 2 we believe that normalized ffo attributable to common stockholders is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance because investors and equity analysts may use this measure to compare the operating performance of the company between periods or as compared to other reits or other companies on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by unanticipated and or incalculable items we define noi as total revenues including tenant reimbursements less property operating expenses property operating expenses represent costs associated with managing maintaining and servicing tenants for our properties these expenses include but are not limited to property related payroll and benefits property management fees paid to operators marketing housekeeping food service maintenance utilities property taxes and insurance general and administrative expenses represent costs unrelated to property operations or transaction costs these expenses include but are not limited to payroll and benefits professional services office expenses and depreciation of corporate fixed assets ssnoi is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties using a consistent population which controls for changes in the composition of our portfolio as used herein same store is generally defined as those revenue generating properties in the portfolio for the relevant year over year reporting periods land parcels loans and sub leases as well as any properties acquired developed redeveloped including major refurbishments where 20 or more of units are simultaneously taken out of commission for 30 days or more sold or classified as held for sale during that period are excluded from the same store amounts properties undergoing operator transitions and or segment transitions except seniors housing triple net to seniors housing operating with the same operator are also excluded from the same store amounts normalizers include adjustments that in management s opinion are appropriate in considering ssnoi a supplemental non gaap performance measure none of these adjustments which may increase or decrease ssnoi are reflected in our financial statements prepared in accordance with u s gaap significant normalizers defined as any that individually exceeds 0 50 of ssnoi growth per property type are separately disclosed and explained we believe noi and ssnoi provide investors relevant and useful information because they measure the operating performance of our properties at the property level on an unleveraged basis we use noi and ssnoi to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess the property level performance of our properties no reconciliation of the forecasted range for ssnoi on a combined basis or by property type is included in this release because we are unable to quantify certain amounts that would be required to be included in the comparable gaap financial measure without unreasonable efforts and we believe such reconciliation would imply a degree of precision that could be confusing or misleading to investors revpor represents the average revenues generated per occupied room per month at our seniors housing operating properties it is calculated as our pro rata version of total resident fees and services revenues from the income statement divided by average monthly occupied room days ss revpor is used to evaluate the revpor performance of our properties under a consistent population which eliminates changes in the composition of our portfolio it is based on the same pool of properties used for ssnoi and includes any revenue normalizations used for ssnoi we use revpor and ss revpor to evaluate the revenue generating capacity and profit potential of our seniors housing operating portfolio independent of fluctuating occupancy rates they are also used in comparison against industry and competitor statistics if known to evaluate the quality of our seniors housing operating portfolio our supplemental reporting measures and similarly entitled financial measures are widely used by investors equity and debt analysts and ratings agencies in the valuation comparison rating and investment recommendations of companies our management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to historical operating results and in making operating decisions additionally they are utilized by the board of directors to evaluate management the supplemental reporting measures do not represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with u s gaap and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity finally the supplemental reporting measures as defined by us may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies please see the exhibits for reconciliations of supplemental reporting measures and the supplemental information package for the quarter ended december 31

restructuring would likely be frustrating for bondholders but we will not allow foreign funds to set the tone for macroeconomic policy guzman added citi research in a note to clients referred to the comments as anti market rhetoric the focus to make the debt sustainable without an imminent fiscal adjustment does not bode well for bondholders it said the only country with a higher perceived risk of default than argentina is venezuela according to jp morgan s emerging markets bond index plus venezuela s spread was an eye watering 12 990 basis points over treasuries on thursday while the index as a whole stood at a spread of 307 basis points argentina s biggest creditor the international monetary fund imf sent a team of economists to buenos aires this week to work out a plan for the government to repay the 44 billion it owes the multilateral lender the deal will set the stage for restructuring talks with bondholders this will be a complex negotiation but i believe the argentines understand there is a limit to how much pain they can impose on the bondholders said alberto bernal chief emerging markets strategist at xp investments in new york advertisement 3 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the government says it needs to push out the maturities of about 100 billion in bonds and loans to give breathing room to an economy asphyxiated by recession and high inflation on tuesday the government ruffled the market when it unilaterally postponed a 1 47 billion principal payment on its af20 bond from thursday until sept 30 the af20 was very poorly handled but i still believe that there is some merit in deciding not to print money to pay for that amortization bernal said it shows that the government understands the clear causality that exists between printing pesos and further deterioration of inflation expectations latin america s no 3 economy is expected by private analysts to shrink 1 5 in 2020 with inflation seen easing to 41 7 from over 50 currently guzman and the fund say initial meetings between the two have been constructive but imf spokesman gerry rice warned that the fund

president trump has nominated conservative scholar judy shelton for a spot on the federal reserve s board of governors arguably the most important economic policy team in the world shelton s nomination is controversial and several u s senators including from trump s party have said they have many questions for shelton at her confirmation hearing on thursday shelton has a phd in business administration and has spent years advocating for the united states to return to something akin to the gold standard a view outside the mainstream that many economists say could hamper the nation s ability to fight recessions more troubling to many is that shelton criticized ultralow interest rates when president barack obama was in office but has recently embraced them seemingly to align with trump the wall street journal editorial board says she should be confirmed because she brings a fresh perspective to the seven seat board the washington post and new york times editorial boards have come out against her arguing she would be a danger to one of washington s last apolitical institutions advertisement below are direct quotes from shelton on some of the hottest topics in economics and monetary policy 1 fed independence many economists and investors say the fed must be independent of political pressure to make the best decisions for the economy but shelton has questioned that tenet i don t see any reference to independence in the legislation that has defined the role of the federal reserve for the united states shelton said at an event in october from which the post obtained a transcript it would be in keeping with its historical mandate if the fed were to pursue a more coordinated relationship with both congress and the president she wrote in a september 2019 wall street journal op ed 2 gold for years shelton has been one of the leading proponents of linking the u s dollar to gold silver or another clear benchmark so its value does not move around as much the nation began to abandon the gold standard in the 1930s and fully exited it in 1971 advertisement let s go back to the gold standard shelton wrote in a 2009 op ed in the wall street journal under a gold standard if people think the paper money printed by government is losing value they have the right to switch to gold in her 2011 book fixing the dollar now she advocated for expanding or contracting the money supply as necessary to maintain the steady value of gold in dollars a policy that likely would have entailed hiking interest rates during the great recession the complete opposite of what the fed did she has gone as far as talking about how the united states could transition back to a system like the gold standard by having the u s treasury issue bonds that could be redeemed for literal gold as a first step u s citizens could ask congress to authorize the limited issuance of gold backed treasury bonds that would provide for payment of principal at maturity in either ounces of gold or the face value of the security at the option of the holder she wrote in the wall street journal in 2010 advertisement 3 shelton has been an outspoken fed critic why do we need a central bank she wrote in the wall street journal in march 2009 she argued in her 2011 book that putting rules based policy in place to automatically set interest rates would be better than giving fed leaders unrestrained discretionary authority to meet eight times a year to decide whether to hike or cut rates 4 she didn t like low interest rates until president trump came into office loose monetary policy is bad for you and for your economic prospects shelton wrote in the washington examiner in january 2013 one of many times she spoke out against the fed s decision to take interest rates to zero during the financial crisis but she called for a large interest rate cut in july and told the post in a june interview i would lower rates as fast as efficiently as expeditiously as possible shelton has been clear that she wants to see so called interest on excess reserves the mechanism the fed uses to control interest rates go to zero she has been ambiguous about whether she then wants a different interest rate mechanism to remain at the current level of about 1 75 percent advertisement 5 shelton doesn t like that the fed buys government bonds one of the major tools used to pump money into the financial system in the aftermath of the financial crisis i don t see why a central bank should even be allowed to buy government debt that s just a conflict of interest right there shelton said in an august 2015 cato institute podcast what the federal reserve is doing is very close to central planning 6 shelton favors virtual currencies arguing that there should be more competition against the u s dollar this has become a big debate as facebook would like to issue its own worldwide digital currency a modern version of this approach one that permits the issuance of virtual currencies in tandem with government issued currencies adapting legal tender laws to permit healthy currency competition should be put forward she wrote for the cato institute in 2018 7 shelton has advocated for open borders between the united states and mexico and for a single currency in north america advertisement in the wall street journal opinion piece north america doesn t need borders shelton wrote in 2000 that opening the u s mexico border is steeped in pragmatism and a fulfillment of open markets if a north american common market were good even better would be a global common market with a single worldwide currency she told the san antonio express news in 2000 8 like trump shelton has questioned the accuracy of u s government statistics yet many economists and former government officials across the political spectrum have defended u s government statistical agencies for thorough and unbiased data i don t trust the statistics on gdp growth or on inflation shelton said at a 2015 cato institute conference in emails to the post this summer shelton said she remains skeptical about the accuracy and consistency of economic statistics because they do not always capture technological innovation accurately she added that we need to be sure that data used for policymaking is accurate and appropriate advertisement 9 shelton wants an international monetary conference at mar a lago trump s resort in palm beach fla she told the financial times in july that she wants to see a new bretton woods style conference to reset the international monetary system if it takes place at mar a lago that would be great she said we make america great again by making america s money great again she wrote in a 2018 essay 10 she has advocated for getting rid of federal deposit insurance which secures account holders deposits of up to 250 000 at u s banks eliminating federal deposit insurance would restore the essential character of banking as a vehicle for channeling financial capital into productive investments while striving to meet the risk and timing preferences of depositors government should not intervene in that private business activity she wrote in her 1994 book money meltdown

this article is more than 4 years old getty cronyism is a real drag on the u s economy some people blame big business for seeking favorable treatment while others put the blame on opportunistic government officials looking to win votes the truth is both sides are responsible for perpetuating the cronyism that undermines competition and rigs the economy against consumers cronyism is when politicians or other public officials give preferential treatment to specific businesses or industries politicians and businesses typically defend any favorable treatment as a necessary means of creating jobs or stimulating broader economic development in reality cronyism largely benefits the companies or industries receiving the favors while taxpayers bear the cost cronyism takes a variety of forms some more obvious than others targeted tax breaks or subsidies to firms such as the recent amazon example are the most common examples of cronyism and they are a large and growing problem according to a recent study the number and dollar amount of state and local tax deals has increased since the early 2000s these tax breaks are supposed to spur broader economic development in the cities and states handing out the money but there is little evidence that they work instead the government is picking winners and losers by giving some firms an advantage over their competitors undermining trust in the free enterprise system in the process while targeted tax breaks get a lot of attention cronyism is more pervasive whenever government interferes with markets regardless of how well meaning the intentions cronyism is likely to follow take california s new ab5 which narrows the definition of who can work as an independent contractor the stated goal of ab5 is to protect workers from being exploited by employers misclassifying them as independent contractors but in many cases it s harming workers since the bill went into effect at the beginning of 2020 independent contractors in a variety of occupations including journalists copy editors actors musicians and videographers have already lost work or are facing an uncertain future as both workers and companies grapple with compliance people in other occupations that have traditionally had a lot of independent contractors can rest easy though since the authors of ab5 granted them exemptions exempt occupations include many with substantial lobbying power such as lawyers physicians engineers accountants and real estate agents many construction industry occupations including carpenters and plumbers are also exempted if ab5 is as beneficial to workers as its proponents claim there would be no reason to exempt these occupations instead it seems the authors of ab5 knew the bill would create problems for many lawyers doctors and others satisfied with their work status so they gave them special treatment this is an example of a more discreet type of cronyism that often goes unnoticed in markets resources are allocated via the price system and prices are determined by underlying supply and demand conditions but when government controls resources supply and demand are often ignored and economic factors take a backseat to political considerations research finds there is a significant increase in state economic incentives in years when incumbent governors are up for reelection likely in an effort to get more votes other research finds that political factors play a large role in the adoption of state financial incentives for renewable energy projects this was the case for two big solar panel projects solyndra and crescent dunes both projects went belly up but not before political considerations helped each receive hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars despite signs that the projects were likely to fail trade policy is another area full of cronyism since his election president trump has levied tariffs on billions of dollars worth of goods including auto parts aluminum nails steel and whiskey steel and aluminum companies lobbied hard for tariffs to protect them from foreign competition all while claiming tariffs would enable them to expand u s production the steel industry has added some jobs but one estimate concludes each job has cost consumers around 900 000 this is due to the higher price of steel being passed on to consumers through products that use steel as an input such as cars other research supports this finding that u s consumers not foreign countries are paying for the tariffs in the form of higher prices the cronyism doesn t stop once the tariffs are in place either chinese products have been trump s biggest targets and china has retaliated in kind levying tariffs on many u s agricultural products this in turn resulted in trump giving billions of taxpayer dollars to u s farmers to compensate them for the lost revenue caused by the tariffs despite their small share of overall employment farmers are a loud voice in washington and their clout helped them get taxpayer money to offset some of the damage caused by the tariffs this is especially true for those with the biggest farms who also tend to be the wealthiest farmers as data shows that the biggest farms received the bulk of the money so in addition to paying higher prices to help a few politically powerful industries like steel taxpayers are also being forced to bail out other groups on the back end that have been harmed by retaliatory tariffs for most taxpayers tariffs are a clear lose lose other u s businesses are seeking exemptions from the tariffs on chinese goods via a cumbersome time consuming process according to companies seeking exemptions the requirements are unclear the decision process is opaque and there s no timeline for receiving an answer these factors combined create a perfect environment for cronyism and there s evidence that politics is influencing exemptions according to one report varian medical systems out of palo alto california hired trump ally brian ballard to help with its exemption process after ballard was hired four out of five of varian s exemption requests were approved in an sec filing varian said two of these exemptions boosted earnings by 23 million maybe this is all a coincidence or varian s experience is unique but it seems more likely that political wheeling and dealing has become an important part of doing business in the current trade war this is the very essence of cronyism in addition to the apparent cronyism there s evidence that president trump s erratic behavior regarding tariffs calling out countries on twitter and frequently changing tariff amounts and affected goods is increasing uncertainty around trade policy more uncertainty is linked to less investment less employment and more stock price volatility meaning that in addition to raising prices for consumers current trade policy is adversely affecting broader economic growth the export import exim bank is another government program that gives specific companies taxpayer subsidized advantages over their competitors the exim bank is a government agency that gives subsidized loans to domestic and foreign companies in order to facilitate the export of u s goods and services it s supposed to help small and medium sized companies expand into foreign markets but its primary beneficiaries are large and profitable companies such as the airplane manufacturer boeing boeing doesn t need subsidized loans to succeed yet from 2007 to 2017 it received more than one third of all exim bank support congress had a chance to reform or close the bank in 2019 but in a show of bipartisan support for cronyism both the house and senate voted to reauthorize the bank for another seven years many people believe cronyism is simply a result of having the wrong people in charge democrats blame republicans and vice versa but history shows us that cronyism permeates both parties democrats and republicans in local state and the federal government routinely bail out influential businesses and direct taxpayer dollars and other public assistance to their supporters the bailout of general motors and chrysler in 2008 is a good example the bailout began under president george bush a republican but was supported by democrat and then president elect barack obama who ultimately saw it through the final result was a 14 billion loss for taxpayers cronyism is an inevitable result of government having too much influence over the economy not who is in charge plans like the green new deal which calls for radically expanding government control over education health care transportation construction manufacturing and agriculture will further expand and entrench cronyism in america if something like the green new deal comes to fruition the only thing that will depend on who is in charge is which companies or industries get the favors not whether favors are handed out this is already playing out in portland oregon which recently enacted a small version of the green new deal the new law levies a tax on corporations that is projected to raise 60 million to supply clean efficient energy and jobs to people the city has long slighted while the money hasn t come in yet it s already clear the funds are susceptible to cronyism as noted by a local news outlet never has city hall had so much money to spend with so few strings attached the guidelines for spending the tax are squishy as are the yardsticks for measuring the effectiveness of those expenditures even supporters of the tax are worried about the waste and cronyism that s bound to occur given the lack of accountability measures and clear metrics for measuring outcomes in fact at least one instance of cronyism has already occurred a few large national waste haulers and construction companies were able to successfully leverage their political connections to get exemptions from the tax at the last minute all the problems with accountability measurement and cronyism infecting portland s relatively small 60 million program would dramatically increase under any similar federal plan that gave elected officials and bureaucrats control over trillions of dollars as these examples show both businesses and government are to blame for cronyism businesses drive demand for cronyism staying competitive in a rapidly evolving marketplace is hard work often it means a business must innovate in a way that can actually harm its own products or services because if it doesn t a competitor will back in 2011 apple ceo tim cook admitted his company s ipad ate into the sales of its popular laptops yet apple also realized that if it didn t create a tablet computer consumers wanted some other company eventually would and that would ve been even worse for apple s overall business it s not surprising that many businesses seek out government favors to get an edge over their competitors instead of continually trying to innovate since innovating often means reducing sales of their other products or services in the process it s also not surprising that government officials who want to win elections dole out favors to businesses that can help favors to businesses lead to ribbon cuttings and press coverage which voters often interpret as a sign that government officials are doing something productive the result is more votes even if the promised benefits to the broader economy never materialize it would be great if business leaders and government officials recognized the harm cronyism causes and agreed to stop unfortunately this is unlikely to happen ending cronyism requires changing the rules to reduce the influence government officials have over the economy one policy that could help end cronyism is an interstate compact prohibiting firm specific tax deals currently several states including arizona new york florida and illinois are considering a compact that would require participating states to phase out their use of tax incentives it s not clear what enforcement mechanisms would be included to keep state officials in line but it s encouraging that so many states recognize the problem and want to do something bottom up pressure from taxpayers could also force government officials to bind their own behavior via legislation public uproar over tax incentives contributed to amazon backing out of its proposed new york city expansion but such events are likely to be rare so long as government officials can interfere with the economy even though the u s economy is still unfettered compared to other countries and is doing well right now cronyism is a problem businesses want government favors that give them an advantage and the incentives are such that public officials are all too willing to deliver unless the rules and incentives that enable cronyism are changed it will persist regardless of which political party is in charge

contributors to this performance as well as north america to a lesser extent other operating income and expenses were down to a net expense of 308 million from 346 million in 2018 this was mainly due

completion and production services segments were 429 million and 24 million respectively representing a 4 and 62 increase from 2018 we commercialized our alphaautomation technology offering with our 32 field deployed systems earning commercial rates drilling approximately 613 wells in 2019 an increase of 69 over the prior year precision s president and ceo kevin neveu stated during the fourth quarter precision s strong financial results were led by rising canadian activity in our contract drilling services and completion and production services segments firm international activity and flattening customer demand in the u s as a result of precision s high performance high value strategy market positioning in key basins commercialization of alphaautomation intense cost control and cash management efforts we generated adjusted ebitda of 105 million and cash provided by operations of 75 million results delivered this quarter demonstrate precision s ability to consistently generate cash reduce debt and repurchase shares in canada precision maintained its record level market share supported by leading market positions in the montney duvernay and heavy oil regions our 26 ac super triples and over 60 super singles provide precision an unmatched scale efficiency and competitive advantage throughout all key regions in the western canadian market this momentum has continued into the first quarter of 2020 as seasonal customer demand has remained strong well into february the company reached a peak of 83 active rigs in january compared with a peak of 62 up 34 from the first quarter of 2019 and has 80 rigs running today compared to 55 this time last year although longer term canadian demand will be driven by customer capital discipline and commodity prices we expect our market positioning and scale in our canadian drilling segment to continue to generate strong cash flows throughout the course of the year in the u s precision s fourth quarter average rig count was in line with our expectations and generated sequentially improved margins supported by firm day rates and aggressive cost management our rig count ended the year softer than anticipated due to a large customer reducing operations and idling three contracted ac st 1500 s precision remains confident in its ability to redeploy these rigs as the oil and gas operators continue to high grade drilling operations in 2020 we anticipate capital discipline operating efficiency and industrial scale will remain central themes in the u s market and customer spending behavior will be largely defined by remaining within cash flow and maximizing drilling efficiencies these market trends align well with precision s high performance high value strategy our alpha technologies offering and our ability to deliver industrial efficiencies to our customers internationally the business remains a stable source of cash generation looking to 2020 precision will continue to leverage its expanded scale in kuwait and will prioritize reactivating idle assets in the middle east region precision s completion and production services segment finished the year on firm footing generating strong free cash flow improved margins and good progress on both pricing and market share despite a highly fractured market our team has focused and delivered on effectively managing all elements within their control including reducing fixed and variable costs strong operational performance training and crewing rigs and ensuring the integrity of the assets all while continuing to effectively manage customer relationships we expect customer spending in 2020 will largely be tied to the commodity macro and our scale and operational efficiency will continue to support free cash flow generation in the current environment precision delivered on its 2019 strategic priorities established at the beginning of the year first the company generated substantial free cash flow allowing us to exceed our annual debt repayment targets for the second consecutive year by paying down 205 million of debt since the beginning of 2018 precision has reduced its debt levels by 412 million already eclipsing the

for an additional year with a goal to reduce debt by 700 million between 2018 and 2022 second precision continued to leverage its scale and high performance super series fleet to drive both strong operating margins and market share gains in the u s and canada finally the company delivered on its technology initiatives for the year achieving full commercialization of our alphaautomation system achieving our alphaautomation commercialization milestone was a result of three years of field hardening the technology with over 1 100 wells drilled to date extensive training of over 100 crews and close collaboration with our customers to demonstrate the efficiency and value this technology delivers looking to 2020 we plan to deploy an additional 24 alphaautomation systems driven by continued

december 31 2019 revenue was 372 million 13 lower than the fourth quarter of 2018 revenue decreased due to lower activity in the u s and canada partially offset by higher average day rates in the u s and higher international activity compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 our drilling activity decreased 21 in the u s 13 in canada and grew 11 internationally our 2019 fourth quarter revenue from our contract drilling services and completion and production services segments decreased 14 and 5 respectively from the comparable 2018 quarter general and administrative expenses were 26 million 4 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2018 excluding the effect of share based incentive compensation expense for the quarter our general and administrative expenses decreased by 8 million from 2018 the lower expenses in the current quarter were primarily the result of continued fixed cost control initiatives and the impact of lease related charges due to the adoption of ifrs 16 see discussion on share based incentive compensation under other items later in this release for additional details adjusted ebitda see non gaap measures was 105 million a decrease of 29 million from the fourth quarter of 2018 our adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenue was 28 this quarter compared with 31 in the comparative quarter of 2018 operating earnings see non gaap measures were 8 million compared with negative 172 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 lower adjusted ebitda and operating earnings in 2019 were primarily due to reduced u s and canadian activity higher share based incentive compensation expense and the non recurring receipt of the transaction termination fee in the fourth quarter of 2018 in the 2019 quarter we decommissioned 29 drilling rigs resulting in a loss on asset decommissioning of 20 million with the adoption of ifrs 16 lease related charges of 3 million in the quarter were recognized through finance charges and depreciation and amortization expense historically these charges were reflected in operating and general and administrative expense total share based incentive compensation expense for the quarter was 7 million compared with a recovery of 12 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 see discussion on rig decommissioning and share based incentive compensation under other items for additional details net finance charges were 28 million a decrease of 4 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 primarily due to a reduction in interest expense related to retired debt partially offset by 1 million of lease accretion charges resulting from the adoption of ifrs 16 revenue per utilization day in the u s increased in the fourth quarter of 2019 to us 23 949 from us 23 369 in the prior year quarter the increase was the result of higher day rates idle but contracted rig revenue and rig technology revenue partially offset by lower turnkey activity during the quarter we had us 3 million of revenue from each of idle but contracted rigs and turnkey projects as compared with fourth quarter 2018 idle but contracted rig and turnkey revenue of us 0 3 million and us 11 million respectively on a sequential basis revenue per utilization day excluding revenue from turnkey and idle but contracted rigs was consistent with the third quarter of 2019 operating costs on a per day basis decreased to us 14 073 in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with us 15 042 in 2018 the decrease was mainly due to lower turnkey activity the impact from the reversal of prior period provisions and the componentization of rig recertification costs excluding the impact of the provision reversals and componentization of recertification costs our operating costs on a per day basis for the quarter were us 14 974 see discussion on change of rig components under other items for additional details in canada average revenue per utilization day for contract drilling rigs was 22 182 compared with 22 802 in the fourth quarter of 2018 the lower average revenue per utilization day in the fourth quarter of 2019 was primarily due to lower rates from a higher proportion of super singles in our rig mix and lower shortfall payments partially offset by higher technology revenue we did not receive shortfall payments in the fourth quarter of 2019 as compared to 1 million in the 2018 quarter average operating costs per utilization day for drilling rigs in canada decreased to 14 791 compared with the prior year quarter of 15 115 the decrease was mainly caused by the impact of lower repair and maintenance costs due to the componentization of rig recertification costs excluding the impact of componentization of recertifications our operating costs on a per day basis for the quarter were 15 044 we realized revenue from international contract drilling of us 43 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 an increase of us 4 million over the prior year period average revenue per utilization day in our international contract drilling business was us 52 283 compared with us 51 982 in the respective prior year quarter the higher average rate in 2019 was primarily due to day rate increases from the renewal and extension of drilling contracts and the deployment of our sixth kuwait rig funds provided by operations see non gaap measures in the fourth quarter of 2019 were 76 million a decrease of 17 million from the prior year comparative quarter cash provided by operations was 75 million versus 93 million in the prior year quarter the decrease in funds and cash provided by operations was primarily the result of lower activity and the non recurring transaction termination fee that was received in the fourth quarter of 2018 capital expenditures were 22 million in the fourth quarter 8 million lower than the same period in 2018 capital spending for the quarter included 8 million for upgrade and expansion capital and 14 million for the maintenance of existing assets infrastructure spending and intangibles summary for the year ended december 31 2019 revenue for the year ended december 31 2019 totaled 1 541 million consistent with 2018 operating earnings see non gaap measures were 95 million an increase of 293 million from 2018 as a percentage of revenue operating earnings improved to 6 compared to negative 13 in 2018 in 2019 operating earnings were positively impacted by increased international drilling activity higher u s and international average day rates gains on asset disposals partially offset by lower canadian drilling activity the non recurring transaction termination fee and loss on asset decommissioning and higher share based compensation expense in addition during the fourth quarter of 2018 we incurred goodwill impairment charges of 208 million general and administrative costs were 104 million a decrease of 8 million from 2018 the decrease in costs was primarily the result of continued fixed cost control initiatives and the impact of lease related charges due to the adoption of ifrs 16 partially offset by higher share based incentive compensation and the weakening of the canadian dollar on our u s dollar denominated costs see other items later in this release net finance charges were 118 million a decrease of 9 million from 2018 primarily due to a reduction in interest expense related to debt retired in 2018 and 2019 partially offset by the weakening of the canadian dollar on our u s dollar denominated interest expense funds provided by operations see non gaap measures in 2019 were 293 million a decrease of 19 million from 311 million in the prior year cash provided by operations was 288 million in 2019 as compared to 293 million in 2018 the decrease in funds and cash provided by operations was primarily the result of the non recurring transaction termination fee that was received in the fourth quarter of 2018 capital expenditures were 161 million in 2019 an increase of 35 million over 2018 capital spending for 2019 included 121 million for upgrade and expansion capital and 40 million on the maintenance of existing assets infrastructure and intangibles our 2019 upgrade and expansion capital were mainly comprised of one u s new build one u s scr to ac triple upgrade the kuwait new build rig and long lead capital items our new build and upgraded rigs were backed by long term drilling contracts strategy precision s strategic priorities for 2019 were as follows generate strong free cash flow and utilize 200 million to reduce debt in 2019 in the fourth quarter of 2019 we generated 75 million in cash provided by operations and further reduced our debt balance by 59 million through open market repurchases and redemptions of our unsecured senior notes for the full year 2019 precision exceeded our 2019 debt reduction target with total debt repayments of 205 million maximize financial results by leveraging our high performance high value super series rig fleet and scale with disciplined cost management in the fourth quarter of 2019 precision continued operating at record market share levels in the u s and canada and have leveraged our size and scale to maximize cash flow in the u s operating margins revenue less operating costs were up 19 compared to the prior year quarter despite decreased canadian industry activity levels our canadian drilling operations generated strong cash flow and our completion and production services business contributed 6 million of adjusted ebitda precision also continued to leverage its expanded footprint in kuwait with our sixth kuwait rig commencing drilling on july 1 2019 increasing our economies of scale and operating margins in the region for the full year 2019 precision reported adjusted ebitda of 392 million up 5 from 2018 despite a 22 reduction in canadian drilling activity levels full scale commercialization and implementation of our alphaautomation platform alphaapps and alphaanalytics in the fourth quarter we announced full commercialization of our alphaautomation

furthermore approximately 85 of the u s industry s active rigs and 61 of the canadian industry s active rigs were drilling for oil targets compared with 81 for the u s and 60 for canada at the same time last year industry conditions we expect tier 1 rigs to remain the preferred rigs of customers globally the economic value created by the significant drilling and mobility efficiencies delivered by the most advanced xy pad walking rigs has been highlighted and widely accepted by our customers the trend to longer reach horizontal completions and importance of the rig delivering these complex wells consistently and efficiently has been well established by the industry we expect demand for leading edge high efficiency tier 1 rigs will continue to strengthen relative to less capable rigs as drilling rig capability has been a key economic facilitator of horizontal unconventional resource exploitation development and field application of drilling equipment process automation coupled with closed loop drilling controls and de manning of rigs will continue this technical evolution while creating further cost efficiencies and performance value for customers capital spending capital spending in 2020 is expected to be 95 million and includes 58 million for sustaining infrastructure and intangibles and 37 million for upgrade and expansion we expect our spending to be split 86

current quarter and the non recurring receipt of the transaction termination fee in the fourth quarter of 2018 other items share based incentive compensation plans we have several cash settled share based incentive plans and two equity settled share based incentive plans details of vesting conditions fair value determination and accounting policy for each plan can be found in the notes to our

to a recovery of 14 million in the comparable 2018 quarter the higher share based compensation expense in 2019 was the result of our share price increasing in the 2019 fourth quarter versus a decline in the 2018 quarter executive psu share based incentive compensation expense for the quarter was 3 million compared with 2 million in the same quarter in 2018 the increased compensation expense was the result of additional executive psus granted in 2019 offset partially by lower fair values for the 2019 grants finance charges net finance charges were 28 million a decrease of 4 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 primarily due to a reduction in interest expense related to the debt retired in 2018 and 2019 partially offset by the impact of the adoption of ifrs 16 interest charges on our u s denominated long term debt in the fourth quarter of 2019 were us 20 million 26 million compared with us 23 million 30 million in 2018 normal course issuer bid in 2019 the toronto stock

2019 we purchased and cancelled an additional 2 million common shares for 3 million rig decommissioning in the fourth quarter of 2019 we decommissioned certain drilling and ancillary equipment that no longer met our high performance technology standards included in the decommissioned assets were those drilling rigs previously held for sale we recognized a 20 million loss on the decommissioning of these assets change in rig components in the fourth quarter of 2019 we performed our annual review of estimated useful lives residual values and methods and components of depreciation of property plant and equipment due to changes in circumstance surrounding the timing nature and complexity of rig recertifications we determined the associated costs represent a separate component of property plant and equipment this change has been recognized prospectively and is expected to increase our 2020 depreciation expense by approximately 3 million income tax income tax recovery for the quarter was 12 million compared with 2 million in the same quarter in 2018 in 2019 the province of alberta announced various reductions to corporate income tax rates that when fully implemented over the next three years will decrease the provincial corporate income tax rate from 12 to 8 by 2022 the increase in the income tax recovery for the quarter was mainly due to a larger fourth quarter loss prior to the non taxable portion of the goodwill impairment in 2018 adjustments for prior period taxes reversal of unrecognized tax benefits and u s tax reform legislation clarification enacted in december 2019 offset by a reduction in the benefit from the alberta income tax rate reductions liquidity and capital resources the oilfield services business is inherently cyclical in nature to manage this we

past experiences and assumptions we believe are reasonable in the circumstances the critical judgments and estimates used in preparing the condensed interim consolidated financial statements are described in our 2018 annual report and there have been no material changes to our critical accounting judgments and estimates during the three months and year ended december 31 2019 except for those impacted by the adoption of new accounting standards changes in accounting policy new standards adopted the following standards became effective on january 1 2019 ifrs 16 leases ifric 23 uncertainty

operating leases when precision is the lessee changed effective january 1 2019 precision adopted ifrs 16 using the modified retrospective approach and our comparative information was not restated as a result the comparability of our 2019 adjusted ebitda to periods prior to january 1 2019 is impacted under ifrs 16 leases classified as operating leases were recognized on our statement of financial position with a right of use asset and corresponding lease obligation representing the present value of precision s future lease payments once recognized right of use assets are depreciated over the shorter of their useful life and the term of the lease the lease obligation is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method under this approach an interest charge is applied to accrete the lease obligation to the present value of future lease payments as lease payments are made the lease obligation is reduced historically operating lease obligations were accounted for as off balance sheet and lease expenses were only recognized at the time of payment in either operating or general and administrative expense however under ifrs 16 lease costs are reflected on the statement of earnings loss through depreciation and interest expense resulting in an increase to adjusted ebitda upon transition we recognized right of use assets and corresponding lease obligations of 73 million for the three months and year ended december 31 2019 we recorded lease interest charges of 1 million and 3 million and depreciated our right of use assets by 2 million and 8 million respectively as a result of the new lease standard our adjusted ebitda was positively impacted for the three months and year ended december 31 2019 by 3 million and 11 million respectively non gaap measures in this release we reference non gaap generally accepted accounting principles measures adjusted ebitda covenant ebitda operating earnings loss funds provided by used in operations and working capital are terms used by us to assess performance as we believe they provide useful supplemental information to investors these terms do not have standardized meanings prescribed under international financial reporting standards ifrs and may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies adjusted ebitda we believe that adjusted ebitda earnings before income taxes gain on repurchase and redemption of unsecured senior notes finance charges foreign exchange impairment of goodwill reversal of impairment of property plant and equipment loss on asset decommissioning gain on asset disposals and depreciation and amortization as reported in the interim consolidated statement of earnings loss is a useful measure because it gives an indication of the results from our

chairman and ceo stated our fourth quarter results were as we expected with sales flat to last year and very strong cash generation operating and free cash flow for the quarter were 440 million and 300 million respectively for the full year operating and free cash flow were about 1 4 billion and 870 million respectively our leverage is approaching historical lows which provides us with the flexibility to pursue additional opportunities under our stock repurchase program we bought approximately 23 million in the fourth quarter for a total of about 375 million since the inception of the buyback program as we anticipated our businesses remained challenged by soft demand greater competition and reduced production volume in the u s markets continued to be influenced by the strong dollar the impact of lvt on other products and positive trends in housing that should be a tailwind competition has increased in our global markets impacting our pricing and mix as we leverage investments in sales and marketing to drive growth many countries where we operate are stimulating their economies with lower interest rates to encourage greater consumer spending and economic growth this year in the near term we still anticipate that most of our markets will have continued pressure in our product categories throughout the period we implemented changes to increase sales and reduce costs we have enhanced our lvt manufacturing in the u s and europe and realigned our u s carpet operations we have decreased our ceramic production and inventories and are taking out wood flooring plants in the u s and europe we are reducing the complexity of our operations enhancing processes to reduce costs and increasing automation to improve efficiencies we continue to improve the productivity and volume of our new lvt u s countertop russian sheet vinyl and european carpet tile investments our acquisitions in australia and brazil are installing state of the art equipment that will expand their product portfolios we are introducing new design and performance innovations to enhance our market positions and broaden our customer base to promote both new and existing products we are making higher levels of sales and marketing investments for the quarter our global ceramic segment sales were flat as reported and decreased 1 5 on a constant currency and days basis the segment s operating margin was 6 as reported declining year over year primarily due to inflation and lower production rates partially offset by productivity most of the segment s markets faced soft demand and excess industry capacity that is compressing market prices and margins our u s ceramic business remained under pressure from lvt taking share and high industry inventories from ceramic purchases ahead of tariffs to align our own inventory levels we meaningfully reduced production in our north american ceramic plants which increased our costs to improve sales we are rolling out multiple new products and adding sales representatives and design consultants in major markets we have begun manufacturing our proprietary new click tile in multiple sizes and designs and we have already received commitments from major customers our quartz countertop sales increased as we ramped up productivity at our new plant in mexico we continued to gain market share by expanding our brands distribution and product offering with larger sizes porcelain products and a more comprehensive wall tile collection in brazil we had good sales growth in the period and initiated a new porcelain line to create larger sizes for our premium collections the southern european economies remain slow impacting our primary ceramic markets and industry pricing in europe we increased our volume and are expanding our activities in the commercial and outdoor channels in russia we grew our sales in a soft market and we are starting up additional porcelain production to make super large sizes as well as a new plant to produce coordinated premium sanitary ware during the quarter our flooring north america segment s sales decreased 4 as reported and 5 on a constant days basis with an operating margin of 3 as reported and 7 excluding restructuring and other charges operating income for the segment declined primarily due to lower volume price and mix we have executed many initiatives to align the business with the present conditions including closing three plants consolidating high cost operations and reducing wood manufacturing the effects of these actions will increase and flow through inventory with full cost benefit in the third quarter of 2020 in the quarter our residential carpet sales performed best in the new home construction and multi family channels we are leveraging our strengths in design and fiber technology to deliver differentiated new collections in both premium and value carpet categories to create greater value for our commercial customers and improve our cost we invested in new design capabilities proprietary carpet tile backings and material manufacturing we have increased the production and speeds of our lvt operations and ongoing initiatives will further improve formulations and throughput during the period u s tariffs on click lvt were removed and the market has adjusted pricing to reflect this change to expand our price points and highlight our unique visuals and features we are introducing new rigid and flexible lvt collections for both residential and commercial markets the virus in china is postponing the start up of some production and could potentially disrupt some lvt service depending on when product shipments resume sales of our water proof laminate products are expanding and we anticipate continued growth due to their realistic appearance durability and ease of installation to support higher laminate sales we are upgrading our hdf board production to expand capacity and improve our costs for the quarter our flooring rest of the world segment s sales increased 3 as reported and 4 on a constant currency and days basis the segment s operating margin was 13 as reported and 14 excluding restructuring and other charges due to volume growth reduced start up cost and lower inflation partially offset by price and mix across the segment our investments in product innovation cost improvements acquisitions and new businesses strengthened our results we are outperforming the european laminate market and sales of our new signature collection are ramping up quickly due to an enhanced level of sophistication we announced the consolidation of wood manufacturing to our facility in malaysia which will improve our costs and increase our flexibility to better satisfy our customers our lvt sales grew as our manufacturing productivity significantly improved our new rigid collections are being well received and our next generation of flexible lvt provides our most realistic wood and stone visuals our panels and insulation businesses had good results in a more competitive environment in australia and new zealand our soft and hard surface sales grew in a difficult environment and we are launching many new carpet collections to enhance our offering market conditions remain challenging across most of our businesses and geographies in response we are adjusting our business strategies enhancing our product offering and restructuring operations we are increasing our investments in sales and marketing expanding our commercial participation and enhancing both our premium and value collections to broaden our distribution into new channels and geographies we are bringing many new product innovations and categories to market our new lvt countertop sheet vinyl and carpet tile plants are improving their productivity as we invest to expand our customer base and sales volume as our lvt manufacturing capacity grows with higher speeds and efficiencies we are enhancing design and features and increasing sales of our rigid and flexible offerings we are limiting the traditional inventory build that we typically do in the first quarter as we manage our production with market demand taking all of this into account our eps guidance for the first quarter of 2020 is 1 90 to 2 00 excluding any one time charges lvt growth in the u s exchange rates and excess global capacity continue as headwinds for our businesses we are executing specific initiatives to adapt to shifting consumer preferences changing markets and competitive pressures for the full year of 2020 we expect that our actions to increase sales and distribution reduce costs and enhance utilization of our new plants will deliver improved year over year results with our performance accelerating during the second half of the year our

by chris vermeulen of the technical traders quite a bit has changed in the global markets and future expectations over the past 4 weeks q4 2019 ended with a bang us china trade deal us signing the usmca continental free trade agreement brexit and now the wuhan virus on top of all of that we ve learned that germany and japan have entered a technical recession as q4 2019 earnings continue to push the us stock market higher what should traders expect going forward in 2020 volatility sector rotation and continued us stock market strength our researchers have been pouring over our charts and predictive modeling tools to attempt to identify any signs of weakness or major price rotation there are early warning signs that the us stock market may be setting up for a moderate downside price rotation within the first 6 months of 2020 but we believe the continued capital shift that has been taking place over the past 24 months will continue to drive foreign investment into the us and north american stock markets for quite a while in 2020 and 2021 the interesting component to all of this which should keep investor s attention and really get them excited is the chance that some type of foreign market disruption may take place in 2020 and 2021 there are a number of things that could potentially disrupt foreign market expectations first on the list is this virus event in china that seems to be spreading rapidly second would be the news that japan and germany have entered a recession further down the list is the very real possibility that many asian and foreign nations could see a dramatic decrease in gdp and economic activity throughout much of 2020 and 2021 it is far too early to make any real predictions but traders need to be aware of the longer term consequences of global markets entering a contraction phase related to a confluence of events that prompts central bank intervention while consumers financial sectors and manufacturing and industrial sectors are pummeled imagine what the global markets would look like if 25 to 55 of asia europe and africa see a dramatic decrease in economic output gdp and financial sector activities on top of the potential for massive loan defaults it may spark another credit crisis event this time throughout the emerging and foreign markets a massive surge in us stock market valuation has taken place since the start of 2020 it is very likely that foreign capital poured into the us stock market expecting continued price advancement and very strong earnings from q4 2019 this valuation appreciation really started to take place in early 2019 and continued throughout the past 14 months we believe this valuation appreciation is foreign capital dumping into the us markets to chasing the strong us economic expectations we believe this surge into the us stock markets will continue until something changes future expectations the us presidential election cycle would usually be enough to cause some sideways trading in the us stock market maybe not this time the fact that japan and germany as well as china very soon have entered an economic recession would usually be enough to cause some sideways price rotation in the us stock market maybe not this time the potential wide spread economic contraction related to the wuhan virus would normally be enough to cause some contraction or sideways trading in the us stock market maybe not this time there is still a risk that price could revert to middle or lower price channel levels at any time in the future we ve highlighted these levels on the charts below yet we have to caution traders that the foreign markets may be setting up for one of the largest capital shift events in recent history if any of these contagion events roil the foreign markets while the us economic activity and data continue to perform well then we could be setting up for a massive shift away from risky foreign markets emerging markets and watch global capital pour into safe havens metals miners and pour into the us stock market us canada mexico we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us we ve authored numerous articles about how the foreign markets gorged themselves on debt after 2009 while easy money policies allowed them to borrow us dollars very cheaply we ve highlighted how this debt is now hanging over these corporations manufacturers and investors heads as a liability the recent repo market activity suggests liquidity risks already exist in the global markets if these liquidity issues extend further we could see a much broader market rotation within the us and foreign markets dow jones industrial average quarterly chart currently the us stock market appears to be near the upper range of a defined price channel near these levels it is not uncommon to see some downside price rotation to set up a new price advance within the price channels this indu chart highlights the extended price channel trend originating from 2008 and the more recent price channel yellow originating from 2015 any breakdown of these channels could prompt a much broader downside price move s p 500 quarterly chart this spy chart highlights the extended upside price trend in the us stock markets the spy has recently breached the upper price channel level it may be setting up a new faster price channel yet we believe this rally in early q1 2020 is more of a reaction to the very strong 2019 us economic data and the continued capital shift pouring capital into the us markets a correction from these levels to near 275 would not be out of the question transportation sector quarterly chart this transportation index tran chart presents a very clear price channel and shows a moderate weakness recently in this sector the fact that the tran has consolidated into a middle range of the price channel while the other us stock market indexes continue to push higher suggests the valuation advance in the us stock market is mostly capital chasing strength of the us economy than a true economic expansion event 2020 will likely continue to see more volatility more price rotation more us stock market strength and further risks of a reversion event we believe forward guidance for q1 and q2 will be revised lower as a result of these new global economic conditions originating from asia europe and japan if the virus event spreads into africa and the middle east think belt road then we could see a much broader correction event in the meantime prepare for weaker future earnings related to the shut down of industry and consumer sectors throughout much of asia if this shut down type of quarantining process extends throughout other areas of the world then we need to start to expect a much broader economic contraction event minor events can be absorbed by the broader markets major events where global economies contract for many months or quarters can present a very dangerous event for investors overall we may see another 20 to 40 days of sliding higher in the us stock market before we see any real risks become present for investors this means you should start preparing for any potential unknowns right now plan accordingly as this event will likely result in a sudden and potentially violent change in price trend join my swing trading etf wealth building newsletter if you like what you read here and ride my

aaron glantz has won a peabody been nominated for a pulitzer and three emmys and written three books including his most recent book homewreckers how a gang of wall street kingpins hedge fund magnates crooked banks and vulture capitalists suckered millions out of their homes and demolished the american dream he s written for the new york times abc news npr and the pbs newshour and his reporting has led to criminal probes by the dea the fbi and the ftc but perhaps the least relatable thing about glantz is that he s a homeowner and that he bought his home in 2009 the year his son was born glantz and his wife bought a house in san francisco taking advantage of the bottomed out housing market to buy a home that has now clearly become their largest financial asset he assumed at the time that many other middle class families would be able to do the same take advantage of cheap housing prices buying on the ground floor and waiting to sell until the market got healthy again while growing wealth but when he began reporting on the great recession the housing crisis and the bubble he realized that he was an exception a very rare one i had naively assumed that there were going to be a lot of other families like mine families of middle class but modest incomes that were able to use this historic price drop that came with the foreclosure crisis to become homeowners he says but as a journalist i watched year over year as the home ownership rate in america went down it went down not only in 2008 and 2009 but every year until 2016 when it bottomed out to a 50 year low recognizing that home ownership wasn t stabilizing and that he was more or less a rare benefactor of the low housing costs in the midst of the recession glantz had a few questions what happened to all of those homes where did they go they didn t just disappear glantz knew and if he was an exception what was the rule that s what led him to homewreckers which details the recovery from the great recession and how wall street capitalists like steve mnuchin and the federal government failed to help the american middle class in the midst of the worst economic crisis in recent history fatherly spoke to glantz about homewreckers why the wealth gap has widened between black and white families and why he feels optimistic about our future your book tackles the great recession and how in the aftermath middle class earners haven t been able to gain wealth in the traditional ways like home ownership which were subjects you came to after buying your own house when we bought our house in 2009 real estate prices were low and we were in the middle of a recession there were foreclosures all across america eight million foreclosures during the housing bust i had naively assumed that there were going to be a lot of other families like mine that were families of middle class but modest incomes that were able to use this historic price drop that came with the foreclosure crisis to become homeowners right that tends to be the narrative about recessions they can be beneficial to middle class people who have a new path to home ownership the people who benefited are people like steve mnuchin who is now our treasury secretary steve schwarzman the head of blackstone wilbur ross who is now our commerce secretary mnuchin and ross both acquired banks from the government paid the government nothing and got billions in subsidies from the government while they foreclosed on large numbers of families so it certainly was advantageous to the super rich ross mnuchin schwarzman and tom barrack the president s best friend who bought up 30 000 homes through his company what happened to all the homes that were foreclosed on who owns them now you used to have a situation where you had 30 000 homes and 30 000 families owning them instead you have 30 000 homes owned by a real estate investment trust headed up by the best friend of the president so you asked me what this means for the professional class there might be some members of the professional class who are investing in these companies but for the most part the professional class is totally cut out right unless you are a super rich banker at goldman sachs or at mnuchin s company or wilbur ross we live in a country right now where the top one percent where the the very very richest americans control as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent of americans that 90 percent is going to include a lot of people who are in the middle class and even upper middle class that s why you have this economy right now yes most of the people who got hurt in the recession were people who were middle class and lower middle class who live paycheck to paycheck and lose their job and end up foreclosed on and then they can never get back into home ownership and the american dream again people are unable to acquire an asset so you can have a young professional who has a good job at a law firm or is a doctor but who feels poor because they re unable to buy a house and live the american dream and feel that security they could be making 100 000 and still feel poor so that s why i focused the book on who can own a home and on who is benefiting from the historic decline in homeownership in america it s this small group of people who are connected to our president how was one investment firm able to own 30 000 homes how were 10 people able to loot the wealth from families instead of those families taking advantage of a down economy and buying assets we had a situation over the last 10 years where every step of the way the government could have intervened on behalf of families and instead intervened on behalf of a small group of vulture capitalists so for example in the book i write about the failure of indymac bank this was a large southern california bank that failed because it was making a lot of toxic loans during the housing bubble like the ninja loan no income no job no assets no problem or the reverse mortgage where the bank gives you some money and then adds interest and fees on top of it every month and then when you die the bank just takes the house because the debt has ballooned so big or interest only loans where it s a high interest credit card instead of paying off the loan bit by bit over time if you make the minimum payment the debt actually grows bigger like a high interest credit card these were all the products that indymac made that collapsed in 2008 there were lines around the block consumers trying to pull their money and the government stepped in and took it over the government lost a tremendous amount of money on this because we insured consumer deposits and they could have done any number of things with this bank what the government decided to do was give it to a group headed by steve mnuchin which also included george soros michael dell founder of dell computers john paulson etc yeah that doesn t seem to be a solution then we made a further deal with mnuchin s group where we agreed to pay them when they lost money to help cover their losses normally a bank would have a financial incentive to not foreclose especially in a down economy the government removed that incentive and said we will pay up to 90 percent of your losses on foreclosures that includes not only the cost of the loan but attorneys fees appraisal costs inspection costs etc right so you can foreclose on families and hardly lose any money and if they made money they could keep it any money mnuchin made he could keep and any money he lost foreclosing on families we d pay so we end up giving his group more than a billion dollars in subsidies as he forecloses on over 100 000 families including 23 00 seniors as you know the government was backing up many of these loans so the government actually ends up owning more than 200 000 homes all across america and was trying to figure out what to do with all this real estate that it doesn t want what do you mean decide if they would sell it off the obama administration put out a call for public comment there were a lot of good ideas one of the good ideas was to sell the homes off one at a time to families like mine so they could build wealth for their families other good ideas included giving the housing stock to affordable housing providers or using it to integrate neighborhoods what the obama administration did instead was auction off the homes 1 000 at a time to large wall street firms some of the first homes that tom barrack acquired as part of his empire was a 1 000 home bundle across los angeles las vegas and phoenix he paid about 30 cents on the dollar for a controlling interest in those homes so if you were a consumer at this time during the housing bust maybe you would want to buy one of these homes for cheap but nobody would lend to you right and anyway before you had a chance to bid the home was gobbled up by these private equity firms so if you go to people in the obama administration at the time and they go well why did you do this they said well anyone could have competed anyone could have competed who could buy 1 000 homes at once if you were a family and you wanted to buy one home even if you re an upper middle class family you were completely cut out of this opportunity what i m hearing is we had a clear pathway out of the housing bust and recession that could have rebuilt the middle class but we didn t take it right if we lived in a true free market society when the market was down homes that would have been out of the reach of middle class people would fall into their price range we might have a situation where the home ownership rate in america could have remained stable because some families who maybe took out risky loans or junk loans would lose their homes to foreclosure but then other families who were behaving in a more fiscally responsible manner could benefit from that down price and then gain equity over time and raise their children in an atmosphere of stability and pass on wealth and opportunity to the next generation and yet that did not happen so what we have now is that we have families that perhaps maybe could have bought a home when the prices were lower financially but they were robbed of that opportunity and now prices are incredibly high and people are still renting and they feel squeezed even when they make a good salary so how are we doing in 2020 the president might say the economy is doing great the dow is up unemployment is low do you agree with that sentiment most middle class americans spend 80 percent of their money on just 5 essentials food shelter clothing transportation and medical care four of those five things immediately disappear as soon as we spend the money our gas is burnt up our clothing wears out our food is eaten the only big ticket expense we have that has any chance at appreciating in value is our housing which is most families largest expense either you re saving money and building security for your family and living the american dream or it s doing all of that for your landlord that s why i focus an entire book on home ownership is home ownership bouncing back it s starting to kick up a little bit from its 50 year low in 2016 it s still at a historic low one thing we haven t talked about yet is racism the home ownership gap between black people and white people is greater than its been at any time since the jim crow era it s actually greater than it was when segregation was legal and encouraged by the government so people of color were more likely to be wiped out during the foreclosure crisis they were more likely to get bad loans during the housing bubble and now what we found in our journalism was that people of color are more likely to be denied credit even when they make the same amount of money and are trying to buy the same size home in the same neighborhood as their white counterparts right recovery is uneven we re not talking about a racial wealth gap that s just propelled by poverty we re talking about a racial wealth gap that is propelled by the fact that even middle class and upper middle class people of color can be shut out of buying assets and building wealth we live in a country where the average homeowner is worth 100 times more than the average renter according to the census bureau so people of color are falling farther and farther behind compared to their white counterparts even when they have good middle class or upper middle class jobs if you re a parent and you want to pass that stability of home ownership onto your children you can t i knew that before 2008 that home ownership and wealth between black and white families was already not a great story just given the history of redlining high interest credit and everything that happened with the g i bill what s made it so much worse today than it was 70 years ago if you look over the historical continuum of the last 100 years in the 1930s what the government did in the 1930s was totally opposite what it did in the great recession of the 2000 s fdr started a government run bank the home owners loan corporation holc it refinanced one out of every five loans in urban america it saved 1 000 000 homes and when people were foreclosed on that bank went and then sold the homes to other families so they could live the american dream the result was that home ownership boomed in the decades after the great depression and the modern middle class was born we not only had the holc but we also had the g i bill for returning wwii vets and millions were able to buy homes and live the dream but even then the g i bill wasn t equitably distributed for women and men of color because it was a bill that partnered with businesses that had the right to discriminate against consumers i know that black men who returned from war were denied loans because private banks could do so and sold homes that were lower value because homeowners associations didn t want black people in their neighborhoods exactly we had this fantastic government program but only if you were white lines were drawn on maps and in some neighborhoods were redlined one of the worst things you could say about your neighborhood was that it was a melting pot the government was absolutely against integration in the 30 s people of color were systematically left out of this amazing middle class opportunity in 1968 as part of the civil rights movement president lyndon b johnson signed the fair housing act which said that all of those practices from before were illegal and discrimination was wrong right so that s good but things didn t get better in 1977 the government came back and jimmy carter signed a law called the community reinvestment act it said it s not enough to just not to discriminate but that banks are required by law to try to lend to all parts of the community not just the rich and the white so they can t just sit there in their offices and say we can t find any borrowers from these neighborhoods they actually have to go to those neighborhoods open a branch and seek customers and make responsible loans but what this morphed into during the housing bubble was banks making predatory loans to people of color so you had these ninja loans high interest loans so when the housing bust happened the foreclosure crisis disproportionately affected those communities including mnuchin s bank onewest which concentrated 70 percent of its foreclosures in california in communities of color when lending returned and the economy started to get better people of color were systematically left out of this rise of opportunity that came with this recovery so mnuchin s bank foreclosed on 100 000 families 23 000 seniors and concentrated those foreclosures in neighborhoods with large amounts of borrowers of color over five years then mnuchin s bank made just three loans to help african american families buy homes and just 11 to latino families and then all these families are now renters to banks unable to build wealth or buy assets because they were foreclosed on one other thing is that the people who set up this system are now running the country so if we re concerned that there aren t enough safeguards in place and that we might experience the same movie again one of the barriers we face is that the people who benefited from the last crisis are now in charge of the economy and the people who are taking up the debt have the ear of the president i guess what bothers me the most is that i feel like we could have a fundamentally different economy if the obama administration had done more for families rather than for banks at every step of the way good people came forward with good ideas that could have had the whole story go differently in 2008 when the economy was collapsing people went to schumer pelosi bush and obama and raised the issue of recreating the holc which as i said was so successful for the country s white majority back in the 1930 s imagine if that had been launched again but without the racism we would have avoided so much of the pain that i wrote about and we would have been in a much stronger position today the people who raised these issues weren t lefty pinkos we re talking about former members of the federal reserve board of governors former advisers to reagan people at the american enterprise institute this was not only an idea that had progressive policy implementations it was also very fiscally responsible the alternative which we ended up doing ended up shoveling a lot of money to bankers like mnuchin that we would never see again well i m feeling pretty thoroughly bummed out don t feel bummed out where i left in the book is fairly optimistic like i mentioned throughout this whole process people came forward with very practical ideas that could have made the situation better and they were dismissed those ideas are still there we can still have a government bank that invests in the american people instead of giving our subsidies to wall street bankers for example if you look at the democratic candidates for president many of them elizabeth warren bernie sanders pete buttigieg not joe biden as near as i can tell have offered pretty robust plans to deal with our housing crisis i wish that the moderators at debates could ask them about this as extensively as they ve made them talk about their health care plans these people understand how important these issues are to the american people that makes me optimistic that the issues that we ve been discussing my very well be before the voters in the next election

joining us this morning for our fourth quarter earnings call before we get started i wanted to let you know that we have slides to accompany our discussion these can be found in the investors section

direct you to slide 2 and remind you that today s presentation includes forward looking statements that reflect bunge s current view with respect to future events financial performance and industry condition these forward looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties bunge has provided additional information in its reports on file with the sec concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in this presentation and we encourage you to review these factors on the call this morning are greg heckman bunge s chief executive officer and john neppl chief financial officer i ll now turn the call over to greg gregory a heckman chief executive officer thank you ruth ann and good morning everyone we re happy to be joining the call from our new headquarters in st louis this morning so let s get started on slide 3 you can see the agenda for today s call i ll start with some thoughts on our 2019 accomplishments through the lens of our key priorities and then i ll provide an overview of the fourth quarter before handing it over to john who will go into more depth on our performance i ll conclude with our outlook for 2020 and then we ll open up the line for your questions with that let s turn to slide 4 in 2019 the team did an excellent job executing in the face of great complexity in many moving parts both internally and externally we effectively managed the things under our control and made substantial progress against our key priorities we drove improved operational performance we took actions to optimize the portfolio and we increased our financial discipline and rigor especially around capital allocation on operational performance our total oilseed crush volume and capacity utilization rates were the highest in the past five years our soy and sun seed crushing operations achieved the lowest industrial unit costs in that same timeframe these improvements helped us weather the difficult markets in 2019 and allowed us to capture more margin when we had the opportunity we moved from a regional structure to a global operating model simplifying how we operate and aligning incentives to the whole rather than the parts with that we reduced the number of bonus pool dramatically incentivized teams to work together toward the common goals of bunge we ve received positive internal feedback about our headquarters move with clear evidence of improved efficiency collaboration and shared insights as a result we will be fully moved into st louis by the end of q2 our new operating model allows us to focus on what s most important our business relationships on both ends of the value chain with farmers and customers while facing fewer internal distractions in short we re working as one team better able to focus on driving results and operating the business with better visibility and more accountability moving to slide 5 while we made substantial improvements to our portfolio we continue to execute against other identified opportunities with the goal to be substantially finished by the end of the second quarter we completed our sugar bioenergy 50 50 joint venture with bp and announced an agreement to also sell our margin in managed assets in brazil recently sire a u s ethanol producer repurchased our stake in that business we also completed several smaller transactions selling several idle grain facilities in eastern europe and two idled wheat milling sites in brazil while also optimizing our south american grain footprint to improve capacity utilization by closing seven other grain facilities turning to slide 6 we ve increased our financial discipline and rigor continuing our work to identify and capture cost savings opportunities 2019 we achieved approximately 50 million in savings from our previously established global competitiveness program and are driving additional savings opportunities from our more recent efforts combined with the operational and portfolio actions we took in 2019 bunge is getting more streamlined with line of sight to additional improvement opportunities we also changed our approach to risk management with a focus on taking risk appropriate for the earnings power of bunge and the environment we re operating within this approach allows us to better capture the earnings power available and the physical and financial flows provided by our global asset base this is especially true when market conditions change as they did during the fourth quarter we re committed to pursuing a disciplined capital allocation strategy capital deployment decisions will be the result of a deliberate process anchored by high quality analysis and stress testing on the front end as well as performing post project reviews moving to the next slide because we re managing risks better while running our assets harder when margins in certain markets improved in q4 we delivered better earnings than we had earlier anticipated looking ahead to 2020 we feel good about our transformation and our ability to adapt to what we expect to remain challenging and volatile environment we have a lot of momentum coming out of q4 that will help us move ahead and taking into account the current margin environment and lack of visibility into the back half of the year we expect 2020 eps to be broadly in line with what we earned in 2019 when excluding notable items our gain on beyond meat and the depreciation benefit of the sugar bioenergy segment with that i ll hand it over to john to walk us through our financial results and 2020 outlook in greater detail john w neppl chief financial officer thanks greg and good morning everyone let s turn to the earnings highlights on slide 8 our reported fourth quarter earnings per share from continuing operations was a loss of 0 48 compared to a loss of 0 51 in the fourth quarter of 2018 adjusted eps was 1 27 in the fourth quarter versus 0 08 in the prior year our reported results include 239 million in net charges of which approximately 102 million related to various portfolio initiatives and 76 million to the partial impairment of goodwill recorded on the acquisition of loders croklaan we have achieved the vast majority of our targeted and integration synergies associated with this acquisition and although we are making progress on revenue synergies we are achieving them at a slower pace than we had forecast when we completed the deal importantly the goodwill writedown was a result of our annual impairment test and not triggered by a specific event loders is a unique asset and this charge does not change our positive view on this business or its long term potential total segment earnings before interest and taxes or ebit was 44 million in the quarter versus 70 million in the prior year on an adjusted basis total segment ebit was 283 million in the quarter versus 107 million in the prior year agribusiness adjusted ebit was 177 million compared to 55 million last year higher segment results in the quarter reflected improved execution particularly in managing risk throughout our grain and oilseeds value chains in oilseeds lower soy processing results in the u s and europe reflected particularly strong margins a year ago softseed results had improved when compared to last year due to strong oil demand and seed supplies as expected oilseeds results were negatively impacted by approximately 95 million of mark to market reversals on soy crushing contracts which favorably impacted our third quarter results an increase in soy crush margins during the fourth quarter resulted in new mark to market losses on forward contracts however these losses were largely offset by mark to market gains on forward hedges related to our softseed and palm oil supply chains that serve our downstream edible oils customers as a result we enter 2020 with only a small net mark to market balance improved results in oilsseds trading and distribution were primarily due to better positioning in grains higher results were primarily driven by origination in south america brazilian farmer selling increased as local prices improved and in argentina farmers accelerated sales in anticipation of a change in the export taxes ocean freight results benefited from good fleet positioning and management food ingredients adjusted ebit was 84 million compared to 73 million in q4 of 2018 edible oils adjusted results of 67 million were up 11 million from last year driven by better results in north america and asia which more than offset lower results in south america results in europe were comparable to last year excluding approximately 30 million of favorable timing differences on hedges that will reverse in 2020 segment results were lower than in prior year milling adjusted ebit of 17 million for the quarter were similar to the prior year as higher results in mexico were offset by lower results in the u s and brazil in sugar bioenergy fourth quarter 2019 results reflect bunge s ownership through november adjusted ebit of 52 million in the quarter was 100 million higher than the prior year the increase was mainly due to improved agricultural yields and operational execution that drove lower unit costs as well as higher brazilian ethanol pricing and higher sugar pricing and volume results also benefited from approximately 38 million of lower depreciation when compared to last year due primarily to the business being classified as held for sale fertilizer adjusted ebit of 26 million was in line with the prior year adjusting for all notable items the effective tax rate for the year was approximately 16 the lower than expected tax rate was primarily due to earnings mix as we reported strong fourth quarter results in regions with favorable tax rates let s turn to slide 9 and sg a when the company announced its global competitiveness program in july 2017 the goal was to achieve a reduction in sg a cost of 250 million by the end of 2020 as compared to its 2017 addressable sg a baseline of 1 35 billion with hard work and the commitment of our employees bunge achieved this savings target one year ahead of plan this slide bridges the savings to what we report in our sg a expense line reflecting unaddressable costs changes in our business portfolio such as the loders croklaan acquisition and other factors that impact our sg a such as inflation foreign exchange gcp program costs and variable compensation the 252 million of cost reductions is roughly equally split between indirect spending and employee costs the company incurred approximately 150 million of one time execution costs over the life of this program moving to slide 10 cash flow highlights for 2019 we generated approximately 1 1 billion of adjusted funds from operations a similar level to prior year the cash flow generation enabled us to comfortably fund our capex and dividend and to reduce our debt as you can see on slide 11 our debt largely finances our inventories with approximately 80 of our net debt being used to finance readily marketable inventory at the end of 2019 working capital ended the year a bit higher than we were targeting primarily due to elevated commercial activity in q4 especially in south america resulting in increases in farmer advances accounts receivable balances and unrealized gains on derivatives used to hedge commercial commitments turning to slide 12 we have committed credit facilities of approximately 4 3 billion all of which was available at the end of quarter and we had a cash balance of 320 million total committed credit facilities dropped from 5 billion last quarter to 4 3 billion as a result of a 700 million revolving credit facility being converted into a term loan and then transferred on a non recourse basis to the sugar bioenergy joint venture proceeds received from the 700 million debt transfer and a further 75 million received from bp were largely used to pay down balances outstanding under the company s commercial paper program and credit facilities moving to slide 13 and our full year summary of capital allocation we generated adjusted funds from operations of approximately 1 1 billion from this total capex spending was 524 million which was about 25 million lower original guidance for the year this included 118 million of capex for sugar bioenergy which will not be incurred by bunge going forward we paid 317 million in dividends to shareholders this left us with approximately 215 million of retained cash flow that we allocated toward debt reduction and working capital please turn to slide 14 return on invested capital our trailing four quarter average adjusted return on invested capital was 7 9 overall well above the 5 in the prior year excluding our sugar bioenergy segment roic was 7 7 versus 6 5 last year we are currently reviewing our stated weighted average cost of capital of 7 based on our preliminary review we believe the 7 we have been referring to maybe higher than our actual lag if we determine there is a more appropriate rate to use going forward we will communicate that in the future quarter whether or not we make that change our targeted roic of 9 will remain unchanged moving to slide 15 and our outlook for 2020 as greg mentioned in his remarks we expect 2020 eps to be largely in line with what we earned in 2019 when excluding notable items our gain on beyond meat and the depreciation benefit in the sugar bioenergy segment in agribusiness we expect full year results to be down from 2019 based upon current forward market structure however actual origination processing and distribution margins will evolve based on fulfillment of the u s china trade agreements crop sizes and farmer commercialization in food ingredients we expect full year results in edible oils and milling to be similar to 2019 excluding approximately 13 million of favorable q4 2019 timing differences which are expected to be negative to 2020 in fertilizer we expect the full year results to be down versus a particularly strong 2019 and for results to be similar to 2018 in sugar bioenergy market fundamentals have improved versus 2019 driven by sustained brazilian ethanol market prospects and better year over year sugar prices for 2020 we expect an effective tax rate in the range of 19 to 23 net interest expense of approximately 230 million capex in the range of 400 million to 450 million and depreciation and amortization of approximately 465 million with that i ll turn the call back over to greg for some closing comments gregory a heckman chief executive officer thanks john as john noted we re still faced with uncertainty in 2020 we expect markets to remain volatile as long as u s and china trade tensions and asf continue to create uncertainty it s too early to tell what if any impact the coronavirus situation will have on our markets or how developments in argentina may affect the industry this year so you can see why it s important that our team remains nimble we ll continue to focus on improving industrial operations honing our approach to risk management being disciplined about capital deployment and working in ways that allow us to quickly adjust to changing market dynamics to maximize the earnings potential of our global platform i want to reiterate how impressed and appreciative i am by the team s ability to navigate a challenging external environment this year while also implementing significant internal change we got a tremendous foundation of processing and distributing assets and a great team who s improving our execution with them we re already seeing the benefits of those changes and we expect them to continue i look forward to sharing more with you as we continue our work we ll also provide more detail on our strategy and earnings power at our investor day which we re planning to hold in late second quarter more detail to come on that and with that i ll open the call to questions questions and answers operator the first question comes from adam samuelson of goldman sachs please go ahead adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst yes thanks good morning everyone gregory a heckman chief executive officer good morning adam adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst greg john i was hoping maybe to start as you clarify and provide a little bit more color on the guidance so first at the eps level adjusted eps in 2019 was 4 58 beyond meat and the sugar benefit i believe were about 0 90 so is that you re saying broadly or roughly 3 70 of eps i just wanted to clarify that just on the outset of that john w neppl chief financial officer that s very close yeah the combination of sugar and beyond was about 0 86 so you re really close adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst okay that s super helpful so then digging into the operating guidance maybe within that just quantify i mean what there should be i imagine some year on year benefits from the sg a reductions that you ve been implementing the headquarter rationalization some of the asset moves that you ve taken over the course of 2019 just can you quantify some of those internal tailwinds that i would think are embedded in the numbers and then within the agribusiness unit maybe frame a little bit kind of some of the puts and takes between the grain side and oilseeds and kind of how you re thinking about the two sides of the market there thanks john w neppl chief financial officer yeah adam i m sorry can you repeat your question around the cost side i didn t adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst yeah yeah so just i mean in terms of the sg a cuts that you ve been implementing over the course of the last year as you continue the global competitiveness program i d imagine that there would be some carryover benefit 2020 versus 19 embedded in your ebit forecasts can you quantify those i mean just benefits from internal initiatives that you re including in the ebit forecast that you ve laid out john w neppl chief financial officer yeah first i think that probably important to know the first half of the year you know we still got some i ll say redundant costs associated with our transfer of employees to st louis and some of the execution we re doing around are rewiring we will continue to have some higher costs probably the first half of the year as those programs run out i do we do expect a measurable reduction next year in sg a particularly at the corporate level at this point from just a pure overhead standpoint if you think about a run rate basis we saved about 50 million last year from the beginning of the year to the end of the year of additional costs and i think heading into 2020 we should have a comparable hopefully a comparable number going throughout the year next year maybe a little bit less than that because as we cut deeper and deeper into the organization it gets a little bit tougher but we are expecting somewhere probably in the neighborhood of 25 million to 50 million of additional cost savings next year gregory a heckman chief executive officer yeah the other thing probably worth mentioning john mentioned all the rewire work that continues to go on in the first half but also the resources around all the portfolio work we re doing here in the first half so some of it has been announced but hasn t closed yet and some of the ongoing work and with our target of getting the majority of that wrapped up we re in a position to at least be able to speak to what we re doing by the end of the second quarter which will then give us get us in a position as john said to make the balance of those changes and kind of come out of 2020 with the run rate that we re looking to go forward and of course that s the kind of thing we ll also drill into more detail during investor day john w neppl chief financial officer yeah i don t think we ll be on our revised run rate until late back half of the year and i think once we get out of 2020 at the end of the year we should start with a much cleaner cost base at the end of 2020 heading into 2021 adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst okay and then just broadly just the agribusiness unit specifically just help a bit just lay out the kind of the different assumptions on crushing and the grain side gregory a heckman chief executive officer yeah as we look at 2020 as we ve talked we ve got pretty good momentum coming out of q4 here and we ve got pretty good visibility into the first half and we d even say that the first half looks positive i think the challenge is really know very very little visibility into the second half and then you ve got the big flags around the china trade the argentina economic situation coronavirus it s possible effect on demand you ve got the margin curves in crush outside of u s are heavily inverted and second half replacement margin is definitely not attractive and then of course u s the soy crush margins are significantly below last year what we ve seen so i think that s really the drivers inside of the agri business which is the big piece and then of course around the distribution is the timing of the phase 1 and we re lacking the details really about timing and products and then already some talk about maybe a delay due to coronavirus so that s kind of the key drivers that we ve put this together with adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst okay i appreciate all that color i ll pass it on thanks gregory a heckman chief executive officer thank you operator the next question is from tom simonitsch of jp morgan please go ahead tom simonitsch jp morgan analyst hi good morning everyone gregory a heckman chief executive officer good morning tom tom simonitsch jp morgan analyst so on the latest goodwill impairment you noted synergies are coming slower than you expected can you just remind us on those synergy targets and how they ve changed gregory a heckman chief executive officer yeah let me frame that up the one thing that i want to be really clear about is we definitely believe in the value of that platform that was a wonderful opportunity this is the kind of asset that only trades once and we were and we were glad to get that opportunity we ve continued to deliver on all of our cost targets we fully integrated the team we re going to market as one company and able to continue to benefit from the combined legacy bunge business and legacy loders business the gap we have had had been on the timing of delivering the top line synergies and those are not coming as fast as we had planned we do love the business because fats and oils is definitely on trend it s right in our wheelhouse it s an adjacent space as a value allows us to value up our fats and oils platform and we definitely are at the table with customers having conversations and working on projects that i was just with the senior sales team last week and they said we wouldn t have been in this position a couple of years ago and it s the global presence it s the end to end product and technical capabilities and frankly it s the record on sustainability which bunge s done a really fantastic job and while we re on loders we ve got some important product launches this year in our infant nutrition we ve extended our award winning betapol with the new high concentration formulas in the confection space we re launching a reduced sugar fat system and we did that work with one of our venture companies and this allows us to put less sugar to be used for the same sweetness we re really excited about where that can go and then on the plant based area which has garnered so much activity so much investment we ve got a line of fats to replace animal fats in a range of products from veggie burgers to beverages and we re working with over a handful of global customers in getting some traction there so while we were slow in delivering the top line this is a great property and this is going to create a lot of value for shareholders long term john w neppl chief financial officer and i think this may be worth mentioning greg the driver of the impairment was really just a shortfall to our overall model that we had built when we bought the business but we still did achieve pretty good growth year over year inside that business so very positive growth just not quite at the level of what we expected when we priced the business so that drove the impairment but again as i mentioned on the in my remarks that was just driven by our annual review of goodwill it wasn t any single event that created caused the staff to take a separate look at it tom simonitsch jp morgan analyst understood thank you and then just on capital allocation you paid down some debt with proceeds from the jv this last quarter what needs to happen if you just start buying back shares john w neppl chief financial officer well it s something we talked about we haven t bought back shares for a few years now i think and as greg and i have commented we re taking a hard look at everything it hasn t been a priority on capital allocation up to this point certainly it s a bucket we look at and talk about and we will do so in 2020 i think the question is really when we look at opportunities it s up to us to find good ways to create value for the shareholder by reinvesting capital and if we can t find a better alternative then share buyback is certainly on the table we haven t finished sort of our plan for 2020 exactly how we want to allocate all the capital we do have a fair amount of money earmarked as i mentioned 400 million to 450 million for capex and we always hold a little bit back and determine whether or not the right thing is going to be debt reduction if we have some sort of an acquisition opportunity or share repurchase but it s certainly on the table and but i would say at this point we don t have any hard to signal one way or the other tom simonitsch jp morgan analyst i ll pass it on thank you very much operator the next question comes from vincent andrews of morgan stanley please go ahead vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst thank you and good morning everyone gregory a heckman chief executive officer hey good morning vincent vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst if you could just clarify for me on the share repurchases and the alternative uses of capital i mean i guess the way i think i would be thinking about it is that you re going to have an analyst day in june presumably you re going to tell us that your earnings power is higher than what you re run rating at and that your stock s undervalued so why wouldn t your shares today the best alternative use of capital because you d presumably be buying them at a discount which i think you were versus going out and paying a premium for somebody else s business john w neppl chief financial officer yeah it s always a trade off i agree and i d like to think between now and our plan would be between now and june to provide you a better clarity on what our capital allocation plan will be yeah it s we hear from shareholders and investors some that like share buyback and some that don t and so for us we really have to just look at it and say as we kind of hit the reset here with the company and develop a go forward strategy i would say it ll get equal airtime discussion with anything else we have to capital i just can t sit here today and commit to you that we re going to purchase share or how many we re going to purchase but certainly if it becomes clear that s the best alternative for our capital then we d be foolish not to take that into consideration and make it part of our allocation vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst okay gregory a heckman chief executive officer look our first order of business is continue to execute to get the cash in the house and that s continue to execute operationally and continue the balance of our portfolio work and then to be able to have that strong debate in the boardroom vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst okay that s fair enough and if i could just ask john a follow up on working capital obviously it built in the toward the end of the year and obviously that was part of why the earnings were better should we expect some type of reversal next year holding commodity prices constant just because farmer selling was advanced and so forth or how should we be thinking about cash flow in 2020 relative to a roughly flat underlying eps event john w neppl chief financial officer yeah i think our bias right now based on what we look at today we do we would expect it to revert a bit and so we would expect the change in working capital next year to be a net positive for cash flow at this point to your point though all else being equal commodity prices et cetera i would agree with your comment vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst okay thanks very much guys and congratulations on the quarter john w neppl chief financial officer you bet gregory a heckman chief executive officer thank you very much operator the next question comes from ben bienvenu of stephens inc please go ahead ben bienvenu stephens inc analyst yeah thanks good morning guys gregory a heckman chief executive officer good morning ben ben bienvenu stephens inc analyst ask about you talked about the roic target you talked about wacc i want to ask about the roic as it relates to the components of that target would you expect a greater proportion of the move toward 9 comes from your earnings so the numerator or your reduced invested capital the denominator kind of how are you all thinking about the contribution as you move forward john w neppl chief financial officer yeah that s a great question so yeah there is a couple of things one is through the portfolio of actions we ve been taking throughout the year so if you look at the gap where we finished here at 7 9 to get to 9 that s 1 1 if you think about that purely on an earnings perspective that s less than 4 a ton on our crush margin based on our volume for this year so it puts into perspective it could be achievable to the revenue side but we re not going to rely on that necessarily to try to get us there obviously driving earnings is an important piece of it but as we look at the portfolio of actions we ve taken this year half that gap over half that gap could be made up just by a reduction in invested capital based on the actions we ve taken some of those have been announced but haven t been executed yet so i think we would view our goal to get to 9 at this point to be half driven by portfolio action half driven by driving earnings it s probably a good baseline ben bienvenu stephens inc analyst okay great that s helpful and then i want to ask about the edible oils business but kind of the just the veggie oil market more broadly obviously had a great back half of the year in palm oil soybean oil the market has been volatile here year to date with coronavirus and so i m just curious if you could just give us your view to the extent you have visibility on the vegetable oil market and palm oil and soybean oil in particular in the nearest term gregory a heckman chief executive officer sure the i think one of the keys is the last time we were all together if you remember crush margins were pretty tough crush has slowed in some regions that had tightened up oil a bit and then with the lower palm production we saw the palm market rally at the same time rally on price at the same time that oil supplies tightened into the end of year and that some of those dynamics is also what helped us deliver q4 we believe that could tighten further coming here into 2020 softseed margins continue to be good outside the eu and then we ve got biodiesel creating a lot of demand for refining capacity and that s a net positive for the oil outlook as well when you look at the mandates the u s going from 2 1 billion gallons to 2 43 billion here in 2020 so there are a lot of things driving i think the big overlay is global demand but that s yet to be seen ben bienvenu stephens inc analyst okay fair enough thanks good luck gregory a heckman chief executive officer thank you operator the next question comes from rob moskow of credit suisse please go ahead robert moskow credit suisse analyst hi thanks greg and john the if i think about the potential for a rebound for your business through china i would imagine it would be a resumption of normal trade flows but then also rebuilding of the pig herd in china following the african swine fever impact i imagine you ve been conservative on both of those factors is it does it make sense to think of them both as incremental to your business or is one bigger than the other or is there any way to quantify it gregory a heckman chief executive officer i m not sure there s a way to quantify it i think in china on asf we do think that about 40 of the herd was liquidated it looks like we think that s done as long as we don t get asf to come back a resurgence of it and some of the demand has improved and some of the small people have been able to switch over to poultry to chicken quickly and then we ve seen sales rebound 2 so hope that the worst is in there as far as to the u s china trade no doubt we re always a big fan of markets that are economic and clear and concise and open fair and free trade but regardless of that i m glad we ve got a global platform and this great team running it and so we ll continue to stay in the position for a number of outcomes and not try to over guess what s going to happen and if you really kind of tried to frame up the drivers as you look at 2020 we took our outlook right and we based that visibility on the curves and we didn t give any adjustments plus or minus versus what you can look through today around trade asf or the coronavirus if you looked at the challenges the things you don t want to see happen you wouldn t want to see asf return to china or spread you wouldn t want to see coronavirus continue to grow which would be tough on oil and meal demand and you wouldn t want to see these trade disruptions continue in a way that s bad for margins on crushing as well as distribution and then you wouldn t want to see animal numbers decline overall and you also probably don t want to see argentinian crush run up and run at high volumes uneconomically on the flip side what you do want to root for would be seeing oil demand continue to tighten as we just talked about as it has been we see the annual the animal numbers grow which means no spread of asf argentina would remain slow as it is now we d see wheat continue to remain tight and the outlook right now is there ll be less wheat fed and of course that means it s not competing with soybean meal it s better for soybean meal demand and then the coronavirus ends up being a flash and goes away so we re not even talking about it next quarter we see a little bit of improvement in the brazilian economy after the pension reform last year that was definitely positive and so we d like to see the brazilian economy continue to improve that would be good for really all of our businesses and then see u s meat exports improve which would be constructive to prices and that would continue to keep the animal numbers high in the u s and be good for demand so if there s the list of things to root for if you need me to email them i d be happy to do that robert moskow credit suisse analyst i think i ll just rely on the transcript thanks but if i can ask you one little element of that i think you said you would root for oil demand to continue to tighten is that what you said because i would think you would want demand to be stronger on oil what i get gregory a heckman chief executive officer yes sorry by demand growing the s d picture tight sorry if that s not clear enough robert moskow credit suisse analyst okay got it okay thank you gregory a heckman chief executive officer thank you operator the next question comes from heather jones of heather jones research please go ahead heather jones heather jones research analyst good morning congratulations on the quarter gregory a heckman chief executive officer thank you very much heather jones heather jones research analyst yes i wanted to clarify something you said earlier greg did you say the first half outlook for agribusiness is positive and that you are lacking visibility the visibility isn t good in the back half gregory a heckman chief executive officer that s correct you just heather jones heather jones research analyst so thinking about the cadence of the quarters right now and given there s a little visibility in the back half is it fair to assume i know you didn t quantify how much you are anticipating agribusiness being down but when we re thinking about how the year is going to play out are you expecting at this point that first half agribusiness would be up year on year and in the back half potentially down how should we be thinking about that gregory a heckman chief executive officer there are so many moving pieces and in this business the one thing we ve seen with it being seasonal and cyclical and the fact that we do operate across the value chain the one thing we know right is that margin can move from one area of our business to another and it can move from one quarter to another so i m really hesitant to try to put the specificity really around the quarters that s why we kind of like to talk to the full year and where we re trending so as we talked about momentum out of q4 we feel that momentum and what we ve been able to do to protect margins in the first half and kind of the outlook of as we look through we feel good about the momentum coming in if you look first half year over year q2 was pretty big prior year heather jones heather jones research analyst okay but q1 an easier comp and then moving on to edible oil so your comments were all bullish and which i share that view so given that i was sort of surprised about the outlook language i mean you guys had mentioned that q3 of 2019 that it was probably not good to run rate that because pretty much everything went right but you talked about fundamentals being good and now you re talking about similar year on year excluding the timing effect and so just wondering because your qualitative commentary sounds really bullish but then the quantitative commentary doesn t sound as much and just wondering if you could help me reconcile the two gregory a heckman chief executive officer well the flip side would maybe be some of the things in brazil what we ve seen while it s been helpful for the agribusiness has probably been a little bit challenging for food ingredients so there are a number of puts and takes across the portfolio i think we are concerned from a demand overall with just as we talked about the number of unknowns in the marketplace between the asf the coronavirus argentinian situation yes and i don t know if i have a better a more specific look than that heather jones heather jones research analyst so there s some conservatism built into that commentary related to potential demand impact from coronavirus gregory a heckman chief executive officer i think what we ve tried to do is look through and tell you what we can see and not what we hope is going to happen heather jones heather jones research analyst okay perfect thank you so much operator the next question comes from ken zaslow of bank of montreal please go ahead kenneth zaslow bank of montreal analyst hey good morning everybody gregory a heckman chief executive officer good morning ken kenneth zaslow bank of montreal analyst just a couple of questions one is when you think about the portfolio change that you ve done can you quantify if that was not done how much your profits would have been down relative to where you were or kind of said differently based on what you ve done how much have you improved off a base level or some sort of quantitative view on that john w neppl chief financial officer yes i think the if you think about the actions that we ve actually taken or that had been announced so i ll go that way because we ve got a couple that are going to close here a couple of small things that are going to close here shortly now and one of those of course our margarine and mayo business that we sold and announced in south america we would just on the things that we ve announced or executed we would expect ebit ebit is going to accrete 10 million to 15 million but probably more importantly should be an accretion on the share price around 0 25 driven by both ebit accretion and lower interest cost going forward from proceeds so that would of course include sugar and that s assuming our sugar jv performs at what we expect it to on the earnings side so we do expect some reasonable amount of accretion here based on what we ve done already and then of course we re continuing to look at other opportunities kenneth zaslow bank of montreal analyst and what about the utilization rate i thought you said also that there was a greater i think the first comment that was said was the utilization rate was all time high and cost is all time low or something like that or five year low i think that was interesting so i m just trying to figure out how that all played out because that doesn t seem to always be included in the hard numbers gregory a heckman chief executive officer yes and some of that is really the operating model and how the commercial teams and the industrial teams are really working hand in glove about getting the assets one in shape to run when the margins are there and then getting us positioned to get to capture the earnings at risk existing in that asset base so that we can run our assets harder and not have any unscheduled downtime whether it s for maintenance or whether it s for commercial things so i think the team has been much more nimble and especially in this environment being able to flex our global system and keep our assets full when the margins are there so that s been a result of some footprint but a lot operating model in the team and then as john talked about some of the portfolio changes that we ve made as those things close and we unwire them from the organization then worked to get the stranded costs out those are things that are in fly they re not an overnight flip the switch kenneth zaslow bank of montreal analyst yes i agree it just seems like there s more i guess what i was trying to figure out is out of all these building blocks it sounds like there s at least 50 million to 75 million of incremental profit that has been built up through corporate actions and i don t know for sure but that s what it seems like i just didn t know if there s a way to quantify utilization rates costs and portfolio management into three buckets of how to actually think of the incremental earnings from internal actions gregory a heckman chief executive officer well what we re going to try to do is prove it by delivering quarter at a time and then being real transparent about how we deliver it kenneth zaslow bank of montreal analyst my follow up question is when you think about your portfolio management by the end of the second quarter is that really the end of it because it seems like there is still a fair bit of assets under the bunge umbrella that may be earning return on invested capital that might be dilutive to your 9 how much has to be done after that and what is the progression in terms of how we re going to expect to see that and i m going to leave gregory a heckman chief executive officer yes how we ve been talking about internally we had going to be initial portfolio review and put our target list together and the things that you ve seen done and the things that we have teams working against today and that are under way those were pushing to be able as we said to have finished or in a position to announce our intentions by the end of the second quarter when we do the investor day because what our goal is to be clear about what asset base we continue to run going forward and be able to talk about the earnings power of that and our growth plans that doesn t mean and as we ve told the team running a great business is constantly challenging in the things that aren t making the return hurdles that they either have a plan to get there on a very short time line or they have exit plans and that never stops that s continuous improvement that s like gcp is a muscle memory and now we are challenging and chasing our best metrics across our global platform to continue to drive cost out in a continuous improvement just like risk management we re never going to be perfect it s always trying to get better it s continuous improvement so this just becomes the culture of how we re running the company so that it s not an event it s an everyday event kenneth zaslow bank of montreal analyst okay i appreciate it thank you very much gregory a heckman chief executive officer thank you operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to ruth ann wisener for any closing remarks ruth ann wisener vice president of investor relations thanks for your interest in bunge and if you have any further questions please

serbian manufacturing is pulling in impressive levels of foreign investment and hit unprecedented highs in 2018 after attracting 66 projects valued at about 3bn according to greenfield investment monitor fdi markets over the past five years 56 of all greenfield fdi projects to serbia have been in manufacturing the automotive sector is therefore serbia s second largest market after real estate for foreign investment based on number of projects since 2003 with the sector seeing record amounts of fdi in 2019 which resulted in 8700 new jobs according to fdi markets advertisement and this boom could be set to continue volkswagen for example has shortlisted serbia for its new 1 6bn factory in southeastern europe which will employ 5000 people even though unlike fellow contenders bulgaria and romania it is not yet an eu member engine of growth serbia s automotive industry dates back to the late 1930s when local vehicle manufacturer zastava produced its first automobile under licence from italy s fiat several decades later foreign manufacturers such as mercedes peugeot and ford set up shop as serbia became a balkan hub for automotives however the industry was severely disrupted by yugoslavia s disintegration and the political instability of the 1990s today however automotives is one of serbia s most vibrant sectors about 60 automotive companies from europe the us and asia operate in the country between them investing a total of roughly 2bn that has created 30 000 jobs according to 2018 research from the chamber of commerce and industry of serbia fiat chrysler automobiles has been a key presence in the country it is serbia s leading exporter and employs about 2400 people at its factory in fas free zone kragujevac producing roughly 80 000 cars a year for export to us and eu markets according to das serbia s development agency the 1990s saw the destruction of yugoslavia s market after eu economic sanctions the arrival of fiat brought new hope it increased interest of tier 1 and tier 2 companies to so automotive became one of the leading export industries in the country says slobodan radović general manager of a facility owned by teknia group a spanish automotive components manufacturer that has operations across 13 countries advertisement serbia s automotive industry accounts for just over 10 of the country s exports and supplies almost all major european car manufacturers according to das the bulk of this production involves vehicle chassis system parts especially tyres and suspension followed by electrical system and engine components for this reason as well as serbia s low construction labour and energy costs compared with other countries in europe china s shandong linglong began construction in 2019 on its 1bn tyre factory in serbia s free zone zrenjanin the company told national news outlet radio television of serbia growing free zones the vast majority of automotive manufacturers moving to serbia operate from one of the country s 15 free economic zones all of which are located near the border or by corridor 10 one of the pan european highways doubling in number over the past decade serbia s free zones have proven successful across numerous sectors and now host about 200 companies including major names such as continental swarovski siemens and michelin the zones export value has grown in size by nine times since 2008 reaching 2 18bn in 2018 as the number of manufacturing companies has grown 10 fold over that period according to the government s free zones administration while the zones ship to asia and north america too germany and italy are the main export partners serbia s oldest site free zone pirot was named europe s leading free zone for foreign investment in fdi s 2018 global free zones of the year awards due to its financial incentives and 22 increase in manufacturing investors between 2016 and 2017 michelin owned tigar tyres the zone s anchor tenant has invested 230m in

goods and services within and between zones and payment of vat on energy consumption electric energy gas fuel oil and coal german presence bosch dräxlmaier zf friedrichshafen and many other german manufacturers have undertaken a whopping 35 of all foreign investment projects in serbian automotives since 2003 according to fdi markets in 2019 germany s boysen group invested 60m in an exhaust system production site in free zone subotica attracted by serbia s low wages and strategic location for customer delivery in central and south east europe according to ceo rolf geisel moreover the city assembly of subotica allowed boysen to use the construction land for free according to radio television of serbia after germany the next top sources of fdi in serbian automotives are france germany italy south korea the us and china according to fdi markets chinese companies are entering the scene particularly fast yanfeng automotive interiors a manufacturer of interior trim opened a production facility in free zone šumadija one of two free zones located in kragujevac while china s meita europe has expanded its production site in baric where it produces metal turbo components in free zone belgrade government incentives serbian governments especially under current president aleksandar vučić have made concerted efforts to incentivise foreign investment in manufacturing government subsidies are particularly generous towards investments that are either capital heavy located outside the capital belgrade or create a large number of full time jobs investors that qualify receive between 3000 and 7000 per new employee for example for serbia s strategic geography the presumption that an eu candidate can expect significant growth serbia s automotive sector has a good tradition particularly of well trained staff and a relatively cheap labour rate the whole process is supported and subsidised by the government says mr radović serbia ranks joint second with hungary in terms of the cost to quality ratio for fdi in automotive components manufacturing while romania takes top place according to fdi benchmark on top of its strategic location serbia benefits from numerous free trade agreements such as the central european free trade agreement with the european free trade association russia and turkey and a generalised system of preferences with the us australia and japan nonetheless according to data collated by the world economic forum in 2018 serbia s logistics need improving and the country ranks second worst in the western balkan region in terms of road quality the government is aware of the problem however over the past two years chinese finance and contractors among others have combined to commence work on motorway upgrades including the belgrade bypass and serbia montenegro highway upgrades such as these further down the road will keep serbian automotives on course to remain one of the country s most attractive markets for

with that i ll turn the call over to melissa smith melissa smith chairman and chief executive officer good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today i m pleased to report that we had a very strong end to the year and our performance this quarter capped another record year for wex we finished 2019 with strong momentum highlighted by growth and effective execution in each of our business segments solid organic growth combined with our recent strategic acquisitions has further strengthened our foundation for sustainable growth and sets us up nicely as we enter 2020 turning first to our quarterly performance on slide three we delivered earnings results at the top end of our guidance range for q4 revenue grew 15 to 440 million compared to last year driven by another quarter of very strong growth in our travel and corporate solutions and health segments a revenue adjustment in the fleet segment that did not impact earnings which roberto will discuss later led to a 5 reduction in revenue growth this adjustment reflects the difference between reported revenue in the top end of our previous guidance range from a segment perspective fleet solutions grew 3 which included an 8 reduction in growth caused by the revenue adjustments driven by volume growth increased late fees and incremental revenue from eg fuel partially offset by lower fuel prices unfavorable fx headwinds and a softer market environment payment processing transactions were up 9 turning to travel and corporate solutions we closed out the year with an impressive 23 increase in revenue during q4 with purchase volume up more than 1 4 billion to 9 6 billion we continued the strong momentum in our corporate payments segment which was boosted by meaningful contributions from noventis finally in our health and employee benefit solutions segment revenue was up an impressive 69 in the fourth quarter this was driven by double digit growth in our u s healthcare business with 18 organic growth and better than expected contributions from discovery benefits strong top line growth continues to drive operating leverage in the fourth quarter on a per diluted share basis gaap net income attributable to shareholders was 1 24 per diluted share and adjusted net income was 2 61 up 24 over the prior year now looking at the full year 2019 was another record year for wex as noted on slide four revenue increased 15 to 1 72 billion better than expected performance from our recent acquisitions including noventis discovery benefits and eg fuel contributed just over half of our growth this past year when compared to our long term revenue guidance range which assumes flat fuel prices and fx rates we outperformed the top end of our 10 to 15 range when including acquisitions and we performed well within our 8 to 12 range excluding them highlights for the year include solid revenue growth across all of our businesses particularly in our u s health business which grew an incredible 62 year over year we also achieved notable results from the integration and ramp up of the shell and chevron portfolios which were a major focus during the year and from the acquisitions that we completed from a profitability standpoint gaap net income per diluted share was 2 26 per diluted share while adjusted net income per diluted share increased 11 to 9 20 similar to the revenue growth we had solid organic growth throughout the business the ramp of shell and chevron and a nice contribution from the businesses we acquired during the year in addition our adjusted net income growth in 2019 was solidly within our long term target range which assumes flat fuel prices and foreign exchange rates turning to slide five our strong performance in 2019 aligns with the strategic pillars set years ago that still serve as the guidepost for our business we remain committed to building upon our best in class growth engine leading through superior technology driving scale through execution and leveraging our culture to attract and retain the best employees executing against these pillars has allowed us to post another outstanding year underscored by double digit revenue and profitability growth achieving technology milestones and successful integration of strategic m a across all of our business segments as part of our best in class growth engine a significant growth driver for us in 2019 was our ability to win in the marketplace as you can see on slide six we ve highlighted some of the most significant wins and contract renewals of 2019 most notably the shell and chevron portfolios and a number of accounts across all of our segments these wins were made possible by the superior execution of the wex team our best in class products a market leading technology on the technology front 2019 was a landmark year for us as we migrated our north american fleet platform to the cloud marking our third significant technology platform migration recall this was one of our main goals outlined during our 2018 investor day with the objective of gaining increased speed to market driving more efficient scalability and enhancing our stability and functionality this was one of the largest and most complex platform migrations wex has ever done and was completed with very little customer disruption we remain focused on the migration and development of cloud technology including building new capabilities and continue to migrate existing technology platforms in 2020 and beyond one of our platforms of focus is the internal transaction processing system for our travel and corporate payment customers in addition to cloud migration our other achievements this year included consolidating otr platform implementing one of the largest product releases for our healthcare business ever including more than 135 new features and deploying a host of tools internally to help us scale our commitment to innovation remains one of the cornerstones of our business and we will continue to drive industry leading technological advancements on all fronts since 2020 as we look ahead to 2020 we expect our momentum to continue building off a tremendously successful 2019 once again we expect our business will achieve results in alignment with our long term targets of 10 to 15 top line growth and 15 to 20 adjusted net income growth in 2020 roberto will take you through the details of our guidance this year but i d like to provide some color on the key assumptions we have underpinning our expected performance first similar to last year our fleet business is expected to generate solid growth in line with the longer term growth targets we outlined at our investor day last year however unlike last year in which our performance progressively ramped throughout the year due to shell and chevron 2020 will likely see the inverse trajectory as we begin to anniversary the migration of these large portfolios we re also assuming the softer market environment discussed last quarter will continue into 2020 second we expect robust double digit growth from our north american travel and corporate payments businesses contributions from our recently announced acquisitions of the enett and optal have not been factored into our guidance but will provide meaningful lift in growth and profitability when these acquisitions close which we expect to be mid 2020 as a reminder these acquisitions advance our long term global growth strategy provide geographic diversification and reduce wex exposure to macroeconomic fluctuations as well as complement wex technology and product portfolio we re excited about the new ota opportunities that this combination will bring which is key to driving our next phase of growth and lastly we expect another record performance from our u s health business as i look back at 2019 i am pleased with the extraordinary progress we ve made this year and the steps taken toward achieving sustainable growth as we continue to execute against our strategic pillars we have established a strong platform that is more resilient and more diversified than ever before which is reflected in our performance this past year we ll continue to leverage the strength of our customer and partner relationships our market leading positions across core markets as well as the underlying technology that serves as the bedrock of our business lastly i want to take a moment to thank all of the employees who make wex success possible and are truly the backbone of our business i would now like to turn the call over to our cfo roberto simon roberto roberto simon chief financial officer thank you melissa and good morning everyone strong results for the fourth quarter and the full year 2019 highlight the momentum in the business i will start my remarks with a review of the full year at a high level then moving to the details of q4 and finally on to 2020 guidance starting with the results for the full year wex outperformed the long term revenue target and was solidly in the range on adjusted net income when compared to 2018 revenue grew 15 and adjusted net income grew 12 fuel prices and fx rate had a 35 million negative impact on revenue and approximately 19 million impact on adjusted net income we had significant revenue growth in each of the segments for the year fleet revenue grew 6 travel and corporate solutions grew 21 and health and employee benefit grew 48 each of these growth rates met or exceeded the long term organic growth target outlined at investor day we are very satisfied with these results now let s move on to q4 and those results on slide nine and 10 we got a strong revenue and adjusted net income growth driven by another quarter of double digit top line growth in the travel and healthcare segments the 3 fleet segment revenue growth reflects a 20 9 million correction to revenue as melissa previously mentioned that reduced revenue growth by 8 there was no impact to earnings due to an equal reduction in the sales and marketing expenses from an earnings point of view we continued to benefit from revenue growth and the acquisitions made during the year overall we are pleased with the fourth quarter performance on both top and bottom line results for the fourth quarter of 2019 total revenue was 440 million a 15 increase over prior year non gaap adjusted net income was 114 7 million or 2 61 per diluted share up 24 and at the high end of guidance breaking down the 15 revenue growth approximately 11 came from acquisitions 6 from organic and a 2 decline due to headwinds from macroeconomic factors the 6 organic revenue growth was negatively impacted by 5 from the revenue correction i mentioned earlier moving to segment results beginning with slide 11 compared to the prior year fleet solutions achieved 260 9 million in revenue an increase of 3 the gains were led by the north american fleet business which grew 17 and another solid quarter from over the road additionally we continue to benefit from the go fuel card transaction within the fleet segment we continue to see solid organic payment processing transaction growth of 9 3 driven by new sales at the same time we continue to maintain very low attrition rates finally same store sales were 3 1 negative due to a slowdown in the industrial economy we anticipate this trend to continue into 2020 finance fee revenue increased 42 the net late fee rate continued to increase this quarter to 65 basis points in comparison to the 44 basis points in q4 2018 and the 58 basis points last quarter the increase was in line with expectations and was due to seasonality the shell and chevron portfolios a mix of new business wins and small rate increases the net payment processing rate in q4 was 110 basis points which was down 28 basis points over the last year the decrease was due primarily to the revenue adjustment which reduced the rate by 22 basis points in addition it also declined due to the shell and chevron portfolios and negative impact from spreads in europe to finish in fleet the average domestic fuel price in q4 was 2 80 versus 2 94 in 2018 turning to travel and corporate solutions segment on slide number 12 we finished 2019 with the same strong momentum that we had all year total revenue for the quarter was 95 7 million an increase of 23 approximately 11 million relates to the acquisition of noventis in north america the corporate payment revenue grew 38 outside of the u s travel grew 48 in latin america and we saw double digit increases in europe total purchase volume issued by wex reached 9 6 billion this represents 17 growth versus prior year to conclude this segment the net interchange rate in the fourth quarter was 84 basis points which was 20 basis points higher than q4 last year like in past quarters the increase was due to a contract change with a sizable travel customer the noventis acquisition and the continued strong performance in the u s corporate payments moving on to slide 13 for health and employee benefit solutions we surpassed expectations again revenue for the quarter was up an impressive 69 compared to last year the u s sales revenue which includes the legacy business plus discovery benefits grew 75 to break this down the legacy wex health grew a substantial 18 and the acquisition of discovery benefits added 26 million the average number of saas accounts was up 17 continuing the trend we have seen throughout the year we are well positioned to capture additional growth in the u s health market and continue to expect middle to high teens growth in the long run from an integration point of view we successfully delivered more than 5 million in synergies from the discovery benefits acquisition and are on track to deliver another 5 million by the end of 2020 now let s move to expenses on slide 14 for the quarter total cost of service expenses were 180 1 million up from 137 6 million in q4 last year total sg a depreciation and amortization expenses were 156 1 million which is up 6 3 million versus 2018 breaking down the line items within these categories processing cost increased 33 9 million primarily due to acquisitions service fees and operating interest were flat compared to the prior year credit loss during the quarter was 18 2 million up from 16 1 million a year ago in the fleet segment credit loss was 18 5 basis points of spend volume within guidance consistent with prior quarters the north america fleet business performed well and we continue to see challenges in the trucking market with higher losses in the small fleet over the road business g a expenses were up 14 6 million due to the recently announced acquisition of enett and optal and higher performance based compensation finally sales and marketing expenses were down 11 2 million partly due to the previously mentioned revenue adjustment this was offset by the recent acquisitions and the shell and chevron costs changing gears on to slide 15 to discuss taxes on a gaap basis the effective tax rate this quarter was 26 9 on a non gaap basis the ani tax rate was 24 7 down 30 basis points from a year ago looking now to the balance sheet on slide 16 we ended the quarter with 811 million in cash up from 541 million at the end of last year from a liquidity perspective the corporate cash balance was approximately 370 million this balance increased approximately 150 million from q3 due to a strong cash flow generation additionally there were 769 million of available borrowings under the company s credit agreement also at year end we had a total balance of 2 8 billion on the revolving line of credit term loans and notes the leverage ratio as defined in our credit agreement stands at approximately 3 5 times at the end of 2019 up from 3 1 times at the end of last year as expected the increase reflects the acquisitions we completed during 2019 looking forward and assuming a july 1 closing date for enett and optal we expect leverage to be less than 4 5 times after closing we expect to delever half a turn to a full turn per year finally as of today we have approximately 2 3 of the financing debt essentially at fixed rates now let s look to guidance on slide 17 we had an exceptional year with notable revenue and earnings growth rates as we continued to benefit from organic growth the shell and chevron portfolios and the integration of the discovery benefits noventis and the go fuel card acquisitions we anticipate this growth will continue through 2020 before we get into the numbers i want to give you some puts and takes that should be considered when modeling 2020 first and most important the guidance is in line with our long term targets of 10 to 15 growth in revenue and 15 to 20 growth in earnings these targets include acquisitions and assume constant fuel prices and fx rates starting with the fleet segment our 2020 plans are within the long term targets of 4 to 8 driven by consistent transaction growth rates and the continued outperformance of the shell and chevron portfolios however due to macroeconomic factors in the over the road trucking business we expect to see a slowdown in growth when compared to 2019 moving into the travel and corporate solutions segment revenue is expected to grow in the middle of the long term target range of 10 to 15 we expect volume growth to be in the mid teens and a small decrease in the interchange rate to clarify this does not include the impact of the enett and optal transaction regarding the health and employee benefit segment we expect our u s health business to continue the momentum we have seen over the past several years and grow revenue in the low 20 range this will be driven by new customers a successful open enrollment season and meaningful contributions from discovery benefits now for guidance which is made on a non gaap basis and reflects our business of today the expectations for the full year our revenue in the range of 1 86 billion to 1 90 billion and adjusted net income in the range of 447 million to 464 million on an eps basis we expect adjusted net income to be between 10 15 and 10 55 per diluted share for the first quarter revenue expectations are in the range of 445 million to 455 million and adjusted net income expectations are in the range of 95 million to 99 million on an eps basis adjusted net income is expected to be between 2 15 and 2 25 per diluted share now let me walk you through a few more assumptions exchange rates are based as of mid february 2020 domestic fuel prices will average 2 69 in the first quarter and 2 70 for the full year this assumption for the u s is based on the applicable nymex futures price from the week of february 3 the fleet credit loss will be between 15 and 20 basis points for the first quarter and 13 to 18 for the full year the company expects its 2020 adjusted net income tax rate for the full year to be between 24 5 and 25 5 finally there will be approximately 44 million shares outstanding for the year to conclude we are very confident about 2020 guidance and are looking forward to a successful year and now we will open the line for questions questions and answers operator your first question comes from the line of sanjay sakhrani from kbw your line is now open sanjay sakhrani kbw analyst thanks good morning i wanted to dig in a little bit more into the fuel segment and i appreciate it s a challenging macro backdrop however when we look at the deceleration in same store sales versus the decel in some of the transaction growth numbers it seemed like the latter was a little bit more than the same store sales so i was wondering if you could just help us think about that relationship going forward melissa smith chairman and chief executive officer so sanjay it s melissa are you talking about the growth the 9 growth we saw in the quarter sanjay sakhrani kbw analyst right like year over year like that year over year growth rate decelerated a decent amount melissa smith chairman and chief executive officer yes so we ve talked about the last couple of quarters we ve seen a slight deceleration in same store sales and so you can see that coming through it s about 0 5 percentage point from q3 to q4 so it s incremental yes so a little bit over 3 in same store sales degradation in q4 compared to the prior year if you look at the rest of what s happening across the business there were changes in business days sequentially so you look at number of business days that were in q3 number of business days in q4 we get a little bit of a benefit in that in q3 we re getting hit a little bit in that in q4 but if you normalize that there really isn t anything new to talk about that s sitting in the base of the business growth rates look similar excluding what s happening from a macro and what s happening with business days that are happening within those two quarters sanjay sakhrani kbw analyst okay and i guess when we think about that macro weakness how much of is it of it is related to some of the trade stuff that we saw ahead of the virus news and i guess specific to the virus i m just wondering when we look at the enett accretion numbers do you feel like there s any risk to those given they have a little bit more asia impact or exposure sorry melissa smith chairman and chief executive officer yes and actually let me clarify that s a good question on same store sales we re talking about north american fleet so those are numbers are specific to the fleet portfolio and what we ve seen for changes sequentially it s led to the biggest impact of what s happening in the transportation segment so that s got the biggest drag to us if you look in q4 sequentially everything is a little bit worse but slightly worse from period to period and the only thing that was positive is public administration compared to all the other sics so that s what s happening with same store sales in north american fleet and remember if you look at the type of customers that we have in our north american fleet business they re across many different industries they re sitting in admin in mining in manufacturing so many different sics and it s an indicator really of what s happening with their businesses because they are fueling where they need to fuel and when they don t need to they don t have deliveries to make or if they don t have service calls to make then we don t see that coming through in our spend volume so i put that aside and say we ve seen that i would say stabilized it s been slightly negative in q3 a little bit worse than q4 but in the ballpark they re looking pretty similar and that s what we assume would continue into 2020 and i put that aside and talk about the coronavirus which is a totally different thing that is in our fleet in our travel business which recall in our travel business most of our spend volume is in the united states the second for us is europe we have a very little amount that s happening in asia in january we didn t see an impact to our business because of coronavirus we did see slight softness in hong kong and australia but you re talking about since asia is a relatively small part of our business you re talking about a couple of regions that sit within that it had really no impact on our business and because we have such little business in asia we re really not seeing much of an impact to us within wex and if we looked at what we assumed in our guidance on a go forward to 2020 i mean we contemplated on that when we set out our guidance range but if you look at our midpoint we re assuming minimal impact again because of the dynamics of who we have where our spend volume happens in our portfolio and then you asked a third question in there which was around the impact to enett and optal their business is 40 of their volume is in asia 60 is in europe when we ve looked at market research on that there s a couple of things that i want to call out wall street journal just put out an article this week where they had travel economists looking into impact if you look at hotels what they re saying is they re predicting a 0 3 impact to hotel volume and globally if you look at some of the research that has been done by morgan stanley on this front they looked at previous coronavirus like event so pandemic issues what they showed is regional impact which was relatively brief and i think if you step back at a macro level we feel for those that are impacted by the virus and we know that this is a very fluid situation but what we ve looked at that helps us box this leads us to believe that the impact should be relatively minor to wex core business and relatively short term to the extent that it would impact enett and optal and remember we re assuming at this point in time that we would have a midyear close sanjay sakhrani kbw analyst okay thank you roberto simon chief financial officer and maybe sanjay what i will add is to put some numbers for you on what melissa said if you take our travel business overall and we do a bit more than 30 billion of spend so for a percentage point on a full year basis you are talking a couple of million dollars in revenue on a full year basis so it gives you also a flavor on what would be the impact but as melissa said our volume today most of it is in north america sanjay sakhrani kbw analyst got it thanks operator your next question comes from the line of ramsey el assal from barclays your line is now open ramsey el assal barclays analyst hi thanks for taking my question today and forgive me if you addressed this already in the prepared remarks i ve been hopping between a couple of calls can you give a little more color on the adjustment you made in the fleet solutions segment what is this exactly and that would be helpful roberto simon chief financial officer yes of course this is roberto so let me explain it to you the asc 606 revenue standard that we adopted in january 2018 allows certain agreements with customers to be presented on a gross basis in the p l where you record the revenue on the top line and then the related commissions you recorded on the sales and marketing line and then there are other arrangements that you only report the net amount and we keep all in the revenue side with no amounts in sales and marketing so as we were closing q4 and we re doing our internal reviews we identified certain partner arrangements where the accounting didn t properly reflect the economics and as a result we fixed the p l classification we reduced the revenue and the sales and marketing costs by approximately 21 million relative to the q4 guidance and then of this 21 million approximately 14 million relate to the prior three quarters of 2019 and what i want to clarify as well is that there was no impact to operating income or our net income on a gaap basis or on an ani basis ramsey el assal barclays analyst okay that s helpful and lastly and this is a quick two parter the first is any impact to call out from that there were some press reports about an outage in efs it seemed pretty minor and transitory but i thought i d ask about it and then the second part of the question is just on the emv liability shift later in the year can you just help us think through the impacts on your business your most updated thinking in terms of where your fraud loss rates would go after the switch accrued which presumably is down or whether you could would it permit you to do anything like loosening credit lines or any general impact on the business would be helpful and then i ll get back in the queue melissa smith chairman and chief executive officer so i ll answer the first one the efs and fleet one cards did experience a really short outage earlier this month and we obviously took immediate steps to minimize the disruption we were actively communicating with our customers which actually is why it got picked up in the press we want to make sure that s clear that the outage was due to a glitch with our third party database vendor so it was something that we rectified and just further for us reinforces the move that we re going into the cloud this is a platform that is scheduled to go into the cloud this year which is important to us for all the reasons that we talked about on the call and is with the migrations that we ve had we ve had three so far this is one of the ones we have scheduled to move in in 2020 we had very minimal impact transaction volume if you look at it over the period of time it was very similar to what we ve seen in other periods and roberto was going to answer your second question roberto simon chief financial officer yes so if you recall a couple three years ago we had a significant fraud losses and we implemented a couple of systems and we invested significant amount of money so the fraud losses today are minimal if i mean as you know we don t report them any longer but they are within the fleet credit loss they are less they re approximately 20 of the total credit losses and as you ve seen in the migration in q4 this year we do not expect a meaningful impact not on our financials and the other thing on top of doing the system and the investments that we have done we are also working on doing more investments on developing some artificial intelligence tools that are helping us to detect fraudulent transactions and to perform better on this area so overall we do not expect not to see a huge benefit because the numbers are already low ramsey el assal barclays analyst okay guys thank you operator your next question comes from the line of steven wald from morgan stanley your line is now open steven wald morgan stanley analyst good morning thanks for the shout out to morgan stanley although i wish you were on a better topic maybe just going back to the i think you guys were just talking about how the fraud is kind of not really the moving piece here but if i look at the trajectory you re sort of talking about in terms of the credit losses it looks like you re expecting that to sort of crescendo into this upcoming quarter and then sort of improve over the back half of the year but with the comments about otr being weak and remaining into 2020 could you just talk about how you think you see that progressing i think the last time we talked about it it sounded like it would sort of progress for a better part of the year and then like a year over year improvement just because of the lower base but could you just give us updated thoughts there roberto simon chief financial officer yes absolutely so the first thing i would say is that 2019 we closed at 15 1 basis points and earlier in the year we gave a range so we were within the range if you compare that to prior year to 2018 there were a couple of percentage points increases but a big portion of that relates to the shell and chevron portfolios as you know they are small fleets and those small fleets carry more credit loss you make more money on late fees but at the same time your credit losses are a bit higher and also recall that we had on the shell side there s a revolver portfolio and then what is different from what we thought earlier in the year is that in the past two quarters on the over the road we have seen some deterioration on the economy and it was also in q3 and that s why you have seen a small spike compared to where we were in 2018 when we modeled 2020 and i have here the numbers in front of me we are modeling a full year similar to what we have in 2019 around the on midpoint around the 15 16 basis points and obviously we have modeled on the first half of the year a bit higher credit losses than last year because of the annualization of the over the road segment steven wald morgan stanley analyst got it okay that s helpful and then maybe just shifting gears toward talking about m a putting enett and optal to the side as a reference point and obviously you guys gave a lot of commentary the other week there fleetcor was out the other week talking about moving toward channels like software on the front end of corporate payments could you just remind us in terms of your stacking of priorities where you re thinking of in terms of m a and where you would use that remaining dry powder i know you said you re going to be below the 4 5 leverage room leverage ratio so you re going to have some room either way even as you close enett and optal melissa smith chairman and chief executive officer so when we think about capital and how we allocate capital we go across each of our core verticals and when i think about the core verticals it s travel it s corporate payments fleet and health and we re looking for geographic expansion scale plays or product extensions that we can add in and you can look back this last year 2019 and so we did a little bit of each of those in the acquisitions that we made and so if they fit where we re going strategically then we really run a mix of those different options and then there s a combination between what becomes available from a timing perspective so we ve got a strategic road map of what we want to acquire we re working on relationships on an ongoing basis some of these things take years to come to fruition and we execute them when they meet all of those criteria so when they fit what we want to do strategically they are on our road map they hit one of those three areas scale product extension or geographic extension they hit financial criteria and we have the ability to absorb it so we have a whole host of filters that we go through so as we re looking into the future we re going to continue to do that same process that we ve done over the past five years and so it will be a mix that you ll continue to see that come through and it s going to be a combination of what we want to do strategically and what s happening in the marketplace at prices that we think makes sense for us steven wald morgan stanley analyst awesome thank you very much operator your next question comes from the line of bob napoli from william blair your line is now open bob napoli william blair analyst thank you for taking my question i d like to dig a little bit more into the corporate payments and healthcare business with two separate questions first on the mid teens growth in payment volume in the travel and corporate payments business for 2020 what does that how would you break that down between the travel portion and the corporate payments portion and you did have a nice increase in the net interchange rate which you attributed to corporate payments is there more upside on that roberto simon chief financial officer so the way with our corporate or travel and corporate payment segment so we guided on the within our long term range in the segment of a 10 to 15 at midpoint we expect volumes to be slightly higher than that so on the 15 call it on the mid teens slightly similar to this year slightly down the way i will look at it if you remember at investor day we break down the segment between travel where the market is growing around 9 overall and the corporate payment that is growing on the 15 to 20 so you could think directionally that the volume growth are going to be splitted similar to what the two markets are growing at and then from a net interchange point of view this year there was a big change because of the reasons that i ve been saying every quarter so we got noventis we got a customer contract change where we moved just the dollars from other revenue into payment processing and we had some customer mix impact as well if you model into 2020 we probably will see and i mentioned that a small decrease on the rate because of the mix of the spend more than any other thing ok so there s nothing that we are expecting to be different but i think you probably will see a small decrease on the rate but similar to where we are in 2019 bob napoli william blair analyst okay thank you and then on the healthcare business you re lapping the acquisition to discovery benefits but you still seem very confident about i guess mid to high teens revenue growth that industry is not growing that fast so you re taking a fair amount of market share so maybe just an update it sounds like that acquisition integration is going well and how are you gaining the amount of market share this is a much bigger business now to have confidence in those types of growth rates over the medium to long term melissa smith chairman and chief executive officer yes if you look at the performance in our health business this year it s been just outstanding across the board to new contract wins what we re bringing and signing the integration of dbi the ramp of business in dbi and all across the board it s been really very very strong and if you look at that business a lot of those trends you can see happening through enrollment season so we ve had a really strong enrollment season we feel good about the combined business that we have the channels that we ve established in the health business the pipelines that we have and that s leading to our confidence in the growth rates that we ve got in the in our guidance for 2020 bob napoli william blair analyst where is the market share coming from i guess is i mean melissa smith chairman and chief executive officer it s coming from lots of places i wouldn t describe it as coming from any one place some of it continues to be internal systems that are migrating some as the market is growing as we ve seen growth within the hsa market specifically but even the fsa market continues to grow so you see more adoption growth rates healthcare costs keep going up all of those things which were the reasons why we entered the space they really have come true and then for taking market away i wouldn t say it s coming from any one place i d say it s coming from a bunch of different places and we have the benefit of working through some really great partner channels that are in the marketplace with their brands every day and they re bringing in market share as well so it s been a combination of adding new partners those partners continue to grow health care costs go up and there s more adoption to these programs and all of those things have been creating some really good tailwinds for us bob napoli william blair analyst okay thank you appreciate it operator your next question comes from the line of darrin peller from wolfe research your line is now open darrin peller wolfe research analyst thanks guys when you look at the fourth quarter fleet trends when you adjust for the 21 million and you adjust for just look at macro it wasn t really that different of a trend as i think you alluded to earlier so when we consider going forward i guess i d be curious to hear number one is there any update to what you re seeing in the subverticals you had called out like transportation and wholesale and construction i think last quarter i guess any other signs of strengthening or weakening in some of those areas or others and then i d be curious to hear if you re seeing any market share impacts associated with some of the reviews going on the regulatory reviews at one of your competitors if you could just comment on market share updates there if you re seeing any evidence of any changes melissa smith chairman and chief executive officer yes we continue to win in the marketplace we feel very good about our competitive positioning the pipeline that we have the businesses that we have implemented and that s been true for years the addition of efs into the rest of our north american fleet business has been really strong combination in the marketplace and so that i wouldn t describe that as changing i think that s been strong for us for years and we do feel good about the technology that we have the amount that we re investing so our ability to continuing to win in the marketplace is in part because we start from a product that s superior and we continue to invest in it in terms of what we re seeing in mix in change from an economic perspective and same store sales it really is slightly worse across most sics but from sequentially from q3 to q4 but when i say slightly it s a little bit more than 0 5 point i don t know that there s any one thing that i would call out i talked about transportation because it is having a bigger impact but if i look through the portfolio in equally big or things like mining which is not a very big part of the business as mining oil and extraction that s actually quite negative year over year but most of these are a few points negative with a few being higher single digits negative from an sic perspective and so we just are seeing continued softness in the industrial segments in that portfolio nothing that s for us there s nothing alarming it s just soft compared to what we achieve currently darrin peller wolfe research analyst yes continuation of that is embedded in your guidance right melissa smith chairman and chief executive officer yes yes and theoretically we ll have better comps when you get into the second half of next year but we re going in assuming that it continues throughout all of 2020 roberto simon chief financial officer i was going to say exactly that and as we get along into the year if we see the same store sales improving obviously we will have an update on the guidance as we move into 2020 darrin peller wolfe research analyst okay just a quick follow up on the corporate payment side given it continues to be one of your gems in your business just talk a little more about the blocking and tackling you re doing there and what you think is differentiating you guys right now in the marketplace that s allowing for the growth rate melissa smith chairman and chief executive officer yes the growth for us is coming in a couple of ways it s coming through partner channels and so we ve said is the technology behind a bunch of both financial institutions and fintech companies where they use to think of us as the payment tech that sits behind that that s been the highest growth rate for us we ve also had good growth with cross selling within our existing fleet portfolio and we think of that as more of a direct sales force so both of those have been working well for us in the marketplace i think from a competitive differentiation standpoint we ve got some pretty good tech chops and so when we re talking to other companies both from just a pure technology perspective the ability to integration into the systems that we have but also from just a security perspective as we re doing business with banks that s something that we take very seriously and we have a lot of compliance and security reviews that are happening on an ongoing basis which creates a little bit of overhead but actually helps us a lot competitively in the marketplace because we do well on that front darrin peller wolfe research analyst make sense thank you operator your next question comes from the line of ashish sabadra from deutsche bank your line is now open ashish sabadra deutsche bank analyst thanks for taking my question so question on margins margins were pretty strong in the quarter you obviously saw some benefit from the accounting change but even in other segments the margins were pretty good how should we think about margins going into 2020 any color on the segment levels roberto simon chief financial officer hi obviously the q4 is a bit twisted because of the revenue recognition adjustment on the revenue side but overall what i can tell you is that if i look from 2017 to 2018 2018 to 2019 and if you exclude fuel prices and fx fluctuations we have been improving the margins in both years and if you look at 2020 if you take the midpoint in revenue excluding again fuel prices and fx fluctuation the revenue is growing 10 and eps is growing 15 therefore you should expect another year of improvement overall on the margins and that s what we have said always we want to focus on both growing the business and accelerating the growth but at the same time how we can improve margins over time as we continue our investments and as i said if you look back to the past two years and the guidance we have for 2020 we continue improving the margins from an adjusted operating income point of view ashish sabadra deutsche bank analyst that s very helpful and maybe just a quick follow up on the accounting change as you mentioned there was 14 million adjustment for the prior three quarters i was just wondering if you can give us what the quarterly adjustments were and should we expect that then going forward as well roberto simon chief financial officer so yes the 21 million is the full year number and as i said 14 million approximately 14 million relate to the prior three quarters they are approximately as we go on q1 q2 and q3 they are slowly increasing but our 2020 guidance already include that revenue adjustment as if we were doing net revenue so we have contemplated on our guidance for 2020 that we won t have the adjustment going forward ashish sabadra deutsche bank analyst that s very useful thanks operator there are no question at this time you may continue steve elder senior vice president of global investor relation thank you everyone thanks for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with you in a couple of months and updating you on our progress and that will conclude our call for today operator duration 60 minutes call participants steve elder senior vice president of global investor relation melissa smith chairman and chief executive
