what if tomorrow nobody but the united states would use the us dollar every country or society would use their own currency for internal and international trade their own economy based non fiat currency it could be traditional currencies or new government controlled crypto currencies but a country s own sovereign money no longer the us dollar no longer the dollar s foster child the euro no longer international monetary transactions controlled by us banks and by the us dollar controlled international transfer system swift the system that allows and facilitates us financial and economic sanctions of all kinds confiscation of foreign funds stopping trades between countries blackmailing unwilling nations into submission what would happen well the short answer is that we would certainly be a step closer to world peace away from us financial hegemony towards nation states sovereignty towards a world geopolitical structure of more equality we are not there yet but graffities are all over the walls signaling that we are moving quite rapidly in that direction and trump knows it and his handlers know it which is why the onslaught of financial crime sanctions trade wars foreign assets and reserves confiscations or outright theft all in the name of make america great again is accelerating exponentially and with impunity what is surprising is that the anglo saxon hegemons do not seem to understand that all the threats sanctions trade barriers are provoking the contrary to what should contribute to american greatness economic sanctions in whatever form are effective only as long as the world uses the us dollar for trading and as reserve currency once the world gets sick and tired of the grotesque dictates of washington and the sanction schemes for those who do no longer want to go along with the oppressive rules of the us they will be eager to jump on another boat or boats abandoning the dollar and valuing their own currencies meaning trading with each other in their own currencies and that outside of the us banking system which so far even controls trading in local currencies as long as funds have to be transferred from one nation to another via swift many countries have also realized that the dollar is increasingly serving to manipulate the value of their economy the us dollar a fiat currency by its sheer money mass may bend national economies up or down depending in which direction the country is favored by the hegemon let s put the absurdity of this phenomenon in perspective today the dollar is based not even on hot air and is worth less than the paper it is printed on the us gdp is us 21 1 trillion in 2019 world bank estimate with current debt of 22 0 trillion or about 105 of gdp the world gdp is projected for 2019 at us 88 1 trillion world bank according to forbes about us 210 trillion are unfunded liabilities net present value of future projected but unfunded obligations 75 years mainly social security medicaid and accumulated interest on debt a figure about 10 times the us gdp or two and a half times the world s economic output this figure keeps growing as interest on debt is compounded forming part of what would be called in business terms debt service interest and debt amortization but is never paid back in addition there are about one to two quadrillion dollars nobody knows the exact amount of so called derivatives floating around the globe a derivative is a financial instrument which creates its value from the speculative difference of underlying assets most commonly derived from such inter banking and stock exchange oddities like futures options forwards and swaps this monstrous debt is partly owned in the form of treasury bonds as foreign exchange reserves by countries around the world the bulk of it is owed by the us to itself with no plans to ever pay it back but rather create more money more debt with which to pay for the non stop wars weapon manufacturing and lie propaganda to keep the populace quiet and in lockstep this amounts to a humongous worldwide dollar based pyramid system imagine this debt comes crashing down for example because one or several big wall street banks are on the brink of bankruptcy so they claim their outstanding derivatives paper gold another banking absurdity and other debt from smaller banks it would generate a chain reaction that might bring down the whole dollar dependent world economy it would create an exponential lehman brothers 2008 on global scale the world is increasingly aware of this real threat an economy built on a house of cards and countries want to get out of the trap out of the fangs of the us dollar it s not easy with all the dollar denominated reserves and assets invested abroad all over the globe a solution may be gradually divesting them us dollar liquidity and investments and moving into non dollar dependent currencies like the chinese yuan and the russian ruble or a basket of eastern currencies that are delinked from the dollar and its international payment scheme the swift system beware of the euro it s the foster child of the us dollar there are increasingly blockchain technology alternatives available china russia iran and venezuela are already experimenting with government controlled cryptocurrencies to build new payment and transfer systems outside the us dollar domain to circumvent sanctions india may or may not join this club whenever the modi government decides which way to bend east or west the logic would suggest that india orients herself to the east as india is a significant part of the huge eurasian economic market and landmass india is already an active member of the shanghai cooperation organization sco an association of countries that are developing peaceful strategies for trade monetary security and defense comprising china russia india pakistan most central asian countries and with iran waiting in the wings to become a full fledged member as such sco accounts for about half of the world population and a third of the world s economic output the east has no need for the west to survive no wonder that western media hardly mention the sco which means that the western average public at large has no clue what the sco stands for and who are its members government controlled and regulated blockchain technology may become key to counter us coercive financial power and to resist sanctions any country is welcome to join this new alliance of countries and new but fast growing approach to alternative trading and to finding back to national political and financial sovereignty in the same vein of dedollarization are indian barter banks they are for example trading indian tea for iranian oil such arrangements for goods to be exchanged against iranian petrol are carried out through indian barter banks where currencies i e iranian rials and indian rupees are handled by the same bank exchange of goods is based on a list of highest monetary volume indian trade items against iranian hydrocarbon products for example iran s large import of indian tea no monetary transaction takes place outside of india therefore us sanctions may be circumvented since no us bank or us treasury interference can stop the bilateral trade activities at this point it might be appropriate to mention facebook s attempt to introduce a globe spanning cryptocurrency the libra little is known on how exactly it will or may function except that it would cater to billions of facebook members around the world according to facebook there are 2 38 billion active members imagine if only two thirds about 1 6 billion opened a libra account with facebook the floodgate of libras around the world would be open libra is or would be a privately owned cryptocurrency and coming from facebook could be destined to replace the dollar by the same people who are now abusing the world with the us dollar it may be projected as the antidote to government controlled cryptocurrencies thus circumventing the impact of dedollarization beware of the libra despite us and eu sanctions german investments in russia are breaking a 10 year record in 2019 by german business pouring more than 1 7 billion into the russian economy in the first three months of 2019 according to the russian german chamber of commerce the volume of german companies investments in russia is up by 33 by 400 million since last year when total investments reached 3 2 billion the largest since 2008 despite sanctions which amounted to about 1 billion combined for 140 german companies surveyed and registered with the chamber of commerce and despite western anti russia pressure russia german trade has increased by 8 4 percent and reached nearly 62 billion in 2018 in addition notwithstanding us protests and threats with sanctions moscow and berlin continue their nord stream 2 natural gas pipeline project which is expected to be finished before the end of 2019 not only is the proximity of russian gas a natural and logical supply source for germany and europe it will also bring europe independence from the bullying sales methods of the united states and payments will not be made in us dollars in the long run the benefits of german russian business and economic relations will far outweigh the illegal us sanctions once this awareness has sunk in there is nothing to stop russian german business associations to flourish and to attract other eu russian business relations all outside of the dollar dominated banking and transfer system president trump s trade war with china will eventually also have a dedollarization effect as china will seek and already has acquired other trading partners mostly asian asian pacific and european with whom china will deal in other than dollar denominated contracts and outside the swift transfer system for example using the chinese international payment system cips which by the way is open for international trade by any country across the globe this will not only circumvent punishing tariffs on china s exports and make us customers of chinese goods furious as their chinese merchandise is no longer available at affordable prices or no longer available at all but this strategy will also enhance the chinese yuan on international markets and boost the yuan even further as a reliable reserve currency even outranking the us dollar in fact in the last 20 years dollar denominated assets in international reserve coffers have declined from more than 90 to below 60 and will rapidly decline further as washington s coercive financial policies prevail dollar reserves are rapidly replaced by reserves in yuan and gold and that even in such staunch supporters of the west as is australia washington also has launched a counter productive financial war against turkey because turkey is associating and creating friendly relations with russia iran and china and foremost because turkey a nato stronghold is purchasing the russian s 400 cutting edge air defense system a new military alliance which the us cannot accept as a result the us is sabotaging the turkish currency the lira which has lost 40 since january 2018 turkey will certainly do whatever it can to get out from under the boot of the us dollar stranglehold and currency sanctions and further ally itself with the east this amounts to a double loss for the us turkey will most likely abandon all trading in us dollars and align her currency with for example the chinese yuan and the russian ruble and to the detriment of the atlantic alliance turkey may very likely exit nato abandoning nato will be a major disaster for the us as turkey is both strategically as well as in terms of nato military power one of the strongest if not the strongest nation of the 29 nato members outside of the us if turkey exits nato the entire european nato alliance will be shaken and questioned other countries long wary of nato and of storing nato s nuclear weapons on their soils especially italy and germany may also consider exiting nato in both germany and italy a majority of the people is against nato and especially against the pentagon waging wars from their nato bases in their territories in germany in italy to stem against this trend the former german defense minister ursula von der leyen from the conservative german cdu party is being groomed to become jean claude juncker s successor as president of the european commission mr juncker served since 2014 ms von der leyen was voted in tonight 17 july with a narrow margin of 9 votes she is a staunch supporter of nato her role is to keep nato as an integral part of the eu in fact as it stands today nato is running the eu this may change once people stand up against nato against the us vassal the eu administration in brussels and claim their democratic rights as citizens of their nation states europeans sense that these pentagon initiated and ongoing wars and conflicts supported by washington s european puppet allies may escalate into a nuclear war their countries nato bases will be the first ones to be targeted sinking europe for the 3rd time in 100 years into a world war however this one may be all destructive nuclear and nobody knows or is able to predict the damage and destruction of such a catastrophe nor the time of recovery of mother earth from an atomic calamity so let s hope turkey exits nato it would be a giant step towards peace and a healthy answer to washington s blackmail and sabotage against turkey s currency the us currency sanctions are in the long run a blessing it gives turkey a good argument to abandon the us dollar and gradually shift towards association with eastern moneys mainly the chinese yuan thereby putting another nail in the us dollar s coffin however the hardest blow for washington will be when turkey exits nato such a move will come sooner or later notwithstanding ms von der leyen s battle cries for nato the breaking up of nato will annihilate the western power structure in europe and throughout the world where the us still maintains more than 800 military bases on the other hand the disbanding of nato will increase the world s security especially in europe for all the consequences such an exit will bear exiting nato and economically exiting the us dollar orbit is a further step towards dedollarization and a blow to us financial and military hegemony finally investments of the chinese belt and road initiative bri also called the new silk road will be mostly made in yuan and local currencies of the countries involved and incorporated in one or more of the several bri land and maritime routes that eventually will span the globe some us dollar investments may serve the people s bank of china china s central bank as a dollar divesting tool of china s huge dollar reserves which currently stands at close to two trillion dollars the bri promises to become the next economic revolution a non dollar economic development scheme over the coming decades maybe century connecting peoples and countries cultures research and teaching without however forcing uniformity but promoting cultural diversity and human equality and all of it outside the dollar dynasty breaking the nefarious dollar hegemony first published at new eastern outlook neo
harish puppala rakesh sharma story continues below advertisement remove ad the imf you ve heard of it you know what it stands for and you may even have heard the name christine lagarde but do you really know what it does no points for saying it assigns impossible missions to one tom cruise the international monetary fund keeps track of how countries are doing and india s growth story in particular cannot be told without mentioning the role of the imf but we ll get to that in a minute the imf has received both criticism and credit for its efforts to promote financial stability across the globe some economists claim it is in the midst of a major transformation citing its vast expansion of lending capacity governance reform and the move away from free market fundamentalism however others suggest that the imf must go further in implementing changes that will improve the plight of the world s poor and guarantee the fund s relevance in a changing global economy christine lagarde stepped down earlier this week from her role as managing director of the imf after being nominated for a job that could make her the first woman president of the european central bank her resignation once again thrust the fund into the spotlight the imf was also in the news in 2011 when its previous chief dominic strauss kahn quit following serious sexual assault allegations it was in the news just a few days ago for saying the us dollar is overvalued which means we could have a donald trump hot take on imf soon perhaps even a suggestion that ivanka trump should head the imf considering the lagarde eyeroll seen across the world simply put the imf is in the news all the time what better time to cash in and look at the imf s role in the global economy and what its accomplishments are that is precisely the point of this edition of digging deeper with moneycontrol story continues below advertisement remove ad the imf and india all those doomsday economic scenarios that the soothing decibels of prime time news promise us as we have our carb heavy dinners they had already come to pass in 1991 after 6 years of problems in balance of payments india had reached a point where the coalition government in 1991 could not pass the budget we were staring into the abyss and the imf said yeah you don t get any more loans the world bank the actual lender did the same the government had no option but to mortgage the country s gold to receive a bailout package and avoid defaulting on payments us indians are nothing if not full on nirupa roy pawning gold to save the country at this point for those asking how are the world bank and the imf different here s a quick pointer unlike the world bank which was designed as a lending institution focused on longer term development and social projects the imf was conceived as a watchdog of the monetary and exchange rate policies vital to global markets anyway back to india and the merry times of 1991 one world bank report noted one of the conditions stipulated in the world bank loan structural reform required india to open itself up to participation from foreign entities in its industries including state owned enterprises meghnad desai a british economist who also participated in uk politics styled baron now he was the first non uk born candidate to contest in the election for lord speaker in the british house of lords their upper house he was unsuccessful recalls that situation like this that was a time when nobody was going to give india any money people forget that we had to pawn our entire gold stock normally when you have gold stock the international monetary fund accepts that that gold stock is there and gives you money against it india had to physically move the gold stock out of india abroad i m informed by very very reliable sources that the van taking the gold to the airport broke down and there was total panic that story was corroborated by former rbi governor yv reddy in his book advise and dissent 47 tonnes of gold in a van broken down in the middle of the road you can t make this up the fact that india one of the founding members of the imf and the world bank was denied further loans by them tells you how far we had fallen and that explains the main role of the imf anticipating trouble and well trouble shooting said trouble much like the other imf you know that one where the message is burnt after reading speaking of burn after reading great film a brief history of the imf anyway back to the real world imf the genesis of the international monetary fund goes back to july 1944 and the bretton woods conference in new hampshire usa 44 allied countries and colonies the ones that fought the nazis and japan attended the conference those 44 nations sought to build a framework for international economic cooperation and avoid repeating the competitive currency devaluations that contributed to the great depression of the 1930s the imf came into formal existence in 1945 with 29 member countries and the goal of reconstructing the international payment system british india was one of the founding members and independent india remained a member the imf s primary mission in its words is to ensure the stability of the international monetary system the system of exchange rates and international payments that enables countries and their citizens to transact with each other the historic accord founded the twin institutions of the world bank and the imf and required member nations to peg their currencies to the us dollar however the system of fixed exchange rates broke down in the late 1960s and early 1970s due to an overvaluation of the usd and american president richard nixon s decision to suspend the dollar s convertibility into gold according to the council on foreign relations the imf is akin to a credit union that permits its membership access to a common pool of resources funds that represent the financial commitment or quota contributed by each nation relative to its size in theory members with balance of payments trouble seek recourse with the imf to buy time to rectify their economic policies and restore economic growth the fund pursues its mission in three fundamental ways surveillance technical assistance and lending the imf has been called the world s financial crisis firefighter relied on by member countries to deal with crippling sovereign debt and prevent contagion from spreading through the global financial system so how does the imf function their 9 to 5 consists of observing their 189 member states economies closely a member country typically summons the imf when it can no longer finance imports or service its debt to creditors a sign of potential crisis the fund will then extend the government a loan and help organize a new debt repayment schedule that the country can manage in exchange the member agrees to implement imf reforms designed to rectify its balance of payments and restore foreign exchange reserves in its central bank the lending conditions are designed not only to guarantee the repayment of loans but also to ensure the money borrowed will be spent in line with the stated economic objectives the imf cannot force its will on member countries countries accept the fund s conditioned financial assistance on a voluntary basis historically much of the fund s work has been done in developing countries including major interventions in argentina brazil indonesia and mexico the imf recast itself in a broader more active role following the 1973 collapse of fixed exchange rates intervening in developing countries from asia to south america a new imf for the new millennium the 2008 global financial crisis and subsequent european debt crisis required major bailouts in advanced eurozone economies such as greece iceland ireland and portugal for the first time in 2010 the imf gained renewed relevance as the european sovereign debt crisis unfolded the european sovereign debt crisis which began in 2010 represented a stark shift in the imf s central focus you probably remember the documentary inside job which addressed the fall of markets in developed countries well in 2010 instead of providing loans to emerging markets on the periphery of the global economy the imf became concerned with unsustainable debt loads in developed countries the shift was epitomized by the imf s intervention in greece where it the european commission and the european central bank together pledged 375 billion in three separate bailouts over eight years the greek bailout marked the first time the imf lent to a eurozone country since the euro was embraced as common currency in 2002 the size of the assistance package relative to greece s imf membership contribution usually limited to 600 was extraordinary at 3 200 it is the largest such package granted to a member country the contrast with the other struggling eurozone economies is illustrative during the same period the imf agreed to loan portugal 30 billion and ireland 25 billion success or failure that said the imf is routinely identified with economic hardship and political ferment because it is only in times of crisis that its services are sought it is often the only organization equipped for such interventions and evaluating the fund s success over the past seventy plus years is a difficult task harvard economist benjamin m friedman has said we cannot reliably know whether the consequences of the imf s policies were worse than whatever the alternative would have been some economists characterize the fund s performance in the asian financial crisis of 1997 98 as a success they argue that the economic reforms championed by the fund allowed the countries involved to recover quickly and laid the foundation for sustained growth during the 2000s others point to the fund s role in brazil in 2002 as positive an early recovery there after intervention allowed imf loans to be repaid ahead of schedule on the other hand the international monetary fund is also accused of exceeding its brief or being guilty of mission creep william easterly makes the case in his 2006 account of the failures of western aid to the undeveloped world the white man s burden while he acknowledges some imf successes in firefighting financial crises in mexico and east asian countries in the mid 1990s he criticizes many of the fund s interventions in severely impoverished countries particularly in africa and latin america as overly ambitious and intrusive in addition he describes many of the fund s loan conditions and technical advice as out of touch with ground level realities in recent years the imf s work in more advanced economies has drawn ire as well remember the whole greece and austerity measures fiasco and the outpouring of derision for germany and the riots greece has been the most high profile example as austerity measures deepened the country s economic contraction in july 2015 popular discontent led to a no vote in a referendum on whether to accept the imf s loan conditions which included raising taxes lowering pensions and other spending and privatizing industries the greek government subsequently ignored the results and accepted the loans however the greek case also saw the imf relent in its stance on austerity at least compared with the european commission and the ecb in 2016 senior imf economists argued that more austerity would be counterproductive and in 2018 the fund raised the alarm about the unsustainability of greece s debt burden the critics point to hard facts recessions and years of high unemployment in imf loan recipient countries most notably greece and spain which have the highest youth unemployment rates in the european union at well over 30 percent greece s economy is still 25 percent smaller than it was before the crisis and its debt load is nearly 180 percent of gdp supporters of the imf programs counter that the target eurozone countries have all started to grow again and point to major success stories such as ireland which has seen its gdp rise well above pre crisis levels in 2012 the imf announced roughly 430 billion in new member commitments nearly doubling the institution s capacity to lend as of april 2018 its total lending power stands at approximately 1 trillion having said that in recent times several countries have turned instead to other governments for assistance in 2018 pakistan solicited chinese saudi and emirati loans to replenish its foreign exchange reserves before negotiating with the imf concerns have also been raised about the management of the imf for many years a gentlemen s agreement between europe and the united states or a duopoly if you will has guaranteed the md position at imf to a european and the reins of the world bank to be handed to the american pick in fact in its 75 year history the imf has always been led by a european cfr says the situation leaves little recourse for ascendant emerging economies that despite modest changes in 2015 do not have as large an imf voting share as the united states and europe the financial times noted the same in a recent editorial the global economy is at an inflection point us china trade tensions are hurting growth by the time the new imf head arrives a big shift in macroeconomic policy may be needed the oecd has already called for big economies to be ready to provide a co ordinated fiscal policy stimulus the imf should prepare its own response as the global credit boom unwinds programmes are likely to be needed in several emerging economies it noted to say nothing of having to deal with a truculent trump white house for these reasons it has been suggested to look beyond the eurozone and the us to find the next md of the imf raghuram rajan was a name doing the rounds but it appears finance minister of the group of seven nations have narrowed down the list to four names and rajan is not one of them jeroen dijsselbloem the former finance minister of the netherlands and former president of the eurogroup the club of euro area finance ministers mário centeno current head of the eurogroup and portugal s finance minister the governor of the finnish central bank olli rehn and nadia calviño the spanish economy minister and a former senior european union official are the frontrunners as of now whoever is eventually elected has his her work cut out
yves here this article glosses a bit over the fact that trump s main claim about the value of the dollar was that it was overvalued relative to the renminbi while that was true years ago it hasn t been for a while as china has been managing its dirty float to let the renminbi appreciate versus the dollar trump correctly got a lot of heat from serious economists when he asserted that the level of the dollar was a significant factor in the us trade deficit with china by alex kimani a veteran finance writer investor engineer and researcher for safehaven com originally published at safehaven trump has been very vocal about his dislike for the fed s hawkish policies repeatedly drumming up the fact that higher interest rates lead to an overly brawny dollar and slow down the economy trump has even reportedly asked white house aides to explore ways to weaken the currency in order to boost exports and boost economic growth trump s open criticisms have mostly been viewed as unconventional going by the central bank s presumption of independence though of course no president wants to be associated with an economy weakening under his or her watch and now the president s call for lower rates and a weaker dollar have just have found fresh impetus from an unexpected source the imf now says the american currency is 6 12 overvalued incidentally the bretton woods institution has also found that the euro the second most commonly used currency in international trade is undervalued by 8 18 relative to the german economy the region s largest but in a potentially big knock on trump s assertions against beijing the imf says the chinese yuan appears to be fairly valued though it does concede that there are large uncertainties around the currency that could mean it s undervalued by 11 5 percent or overvalued by up to 8 5 percent source the guardian fresh ammunition you can expect trump to take full advantage of the fresh ammunition that the imf has just handed him the fact that he has never been a big fan of multilateral institutions such as the imf or the world bank notwithstanding in a tweet earlier this month trump accused china and europe of manipulating their respective currencies in order to gain unfair advantage of the u s and you can hardly blame him for going out on a limb to stop real or perceived injustices the dollar has strengthened considerably over the past decade with the dollar index a measure that pits the greenback against a basket of six major currencies euro japanese yen canadian dollar british pound swedish krona and swiss franc climbing 26 percent over the timeframe an overly strong dollar compared to currencies from major trade partners makes u s exports less competitive source investing com there are several plausible reasons why the u s dollar has become so bullish first the fed s expansive monetary policy during the post crisis era saw it constrain the supply of the currency which inevitably led to an increase in value second the ecb countered by doing just the opposite while political instability in the region further helped to weaken the currency bear in mind that the euro makes up about 58 percent of the dollar index making it by far and wide the most significant currency in determining the dollar s trajectory the yen is a distant second with a weight of 14 percent third forex traders have also played a significant role by using leverage to further weaken the euro and strengthen the dollar and finally there s always the distinct possibility that eurozone nations and china have been actively manipulating their currencies as trump claims china innocent for its part beijing has vowed to stay away from a currency war and said it does not plan to use a weaker yuan as a stick in the ongoing trade war suspicions though have continued to run high given beijing s checkered history as far as currency manipulation goes the yuan s value has declined markedly against the dollar ever since trump slapped hefty tariffs on chinese exports goldman sachs has argued that the declining value of the yuan on a trade weighted basis is big enough to blunt trump s tariffs a weaker yuan is an attractive trade off for the country because it helps goose a weakening economy without creating excessive inflationary pressures moreover it s irrational to expect beijing to suddenly stop manipulating its currency even as its economy continues to slow and chances of solid trade deal increasingly looking tenuous nevertheless beijing has severally received a clean bill of health from independent bodies despite trump continually pressuring the treasury to declare china a currency manipulator it has desisted from doing so citing lack of clear evidence instead italy ireland vietnam malaysia and singapore have been found guilty of the vice in the latest audit while germany remains on the watchlist

companies surveyed and registered with the chamber of commerce and despite western anti russia pressure russia german trade has increased by 8 4 percent and reached nearly 62 billion in 2018 in addition notwithstanding us protests and threats with sanctions moscow and berlin continue their nord stream 2 natural gas pipeline project which is expected to be finished before the end of 2019 not only is the proximity of russian gas a natural and logical supply source for germany and europe it will also bring europe independence form the bullying sales methods of the united states and payments will not be made in us dollars in the long run the benefits of german russian business and economic relations will far outweigh the illegal us sanctions once this awareness has sunk in there is nothing to stop russian german business associations to flourish and to attract other eu russian business relations all outside of the dollar dominated banking and transfer system president trump s trade war with china will eventually also have a dedollarization effect as china will seek and already has acquired other trading partners mostly asian asian pacific and european with whom china will deal in other than dollar denominated contracts and outside the swift transfer system for example using the chinese international payment system cips which by the way is open for international trade by any country across the globe this will not only circumvent punishing tariffs on china s exports and make us customers of chinese goods furious as their chinese merchandise is no longer available at affordable prices or no longer available at all but this strategy will also enhance the chinese yuan on international markets and boost the yuan even further as a reliable reserve currency ever outranking the us dollar in fact in the last 20 years dollar denominated assets in international reserve coffers have declined from more than 90 to below 60 and will rapidly decline further as washington s coercive financial policies prevail dollar reserves are rapidly replaced by reserves in yuan and gold and that even in such staunch supporters of the west as is australia washington also has launched a counter productive financial war against turkey because turkey is associating and creating friendly relations with russia iran and china and foremost because turkey a nato stronghold is purchasing the russian s 400 cutting edge air defense system a new military alliance which the us cannot accept as a result the us is sabotaging the turkish currency the lira which has lost 40 since january 2018 turkey will certainly do whatever it can to get out from under the boot of the us dollar stranglehold and currency sanctions and further ally itself with the east this amounts to a double loss for the us turkey will most likely abandon all trading in us dollars and align her currency with for example the chinese yuan and the russian ruble and to the detriment of the atlantic alliance turkey may very likely exit nato abandoning nato will be a major disaster for the us as turkey is both strategically as well as in terms of nato military power one of the strongest if not the strongest nation of the 29 nato members outside of the us if turkey exits nato the entire european nato alliance will be shaken and questioned other countries long wary of nato and of storing nato s nuclear weapons on their soils especially italy and germany may also consider exiting nato in both germany and italy a majority of the people is against nato and especially against the pentagon waging wars form their nato bases in their territories in germany in italy to stem against this trend the former german defense minister ursula von der leyen from the conservative german cdu party is being groomed to become jean claude juncker s successor as president of the european commission mr juncker served since 2014 ms von der leyen was voted in tonight 17 july with a narrow margin of 9 votes she is a staunch supporter of nato her role is to keep nato as an integral part of the eu in fact as it stands today nato is running the eu this may change once people stand up against nato against the us vassal the eu administration in brussels and claim their democratic rights as citizens of their nation states europeans sense that these pentagon initiated and ongoing wars and conflicts supported by washington s european puppet allies may escalate into a nuclear war their countries nato bases will be the first ones to be targeted sinking europe for the 3rd time in 100 year into a world war however this one may be all destructive nuclear and nobody knows or is able to predict the damage and destruction of such a catastrophe nor the time of recovery of mother earth from an atomic calamity so let s hope turkey exits nato it would be giant step towards peace and a healthy answer to washington s blackmail and sabotage against turkey s currency the us currency sanctions are in the long run a blessing it gives turkey a good argument to abandon the us dollar and gradually shift towards association with eastern moneys mainly the chinese yuan thereby putting another nail in the us dollar s coffin however the hardest blow for washington will be when turkey exits nato such a move will come sooner or later notwithstanding ms von der leyen s battle cries for nato the breaking up of nato will annihilate the western power structure in europe and throughout the world where the us still maintains more than 800 military bases on the other hand the disbanding of nato will increase the world s security especially in europe for all the consequences such an exit will bear exiting nato and economically exiting the us dollar orbit is a further step towards dedollarization and a blow to us financial and military hegemony finally investments of the chinese belt and road initiative bri also called the new silk road will be mostly made in yuan and local currencies of the countries involved and incorporated in one or more of the several bri land and maritime routes that eventually will span the globe some us dollar investments may serve the people s bank of china china s central bank as a dollar divesting tool of china s huge dollar reserves which currently stands at close to two trillion dollars the bri promises to become the next economic revolution a non dollar economic

trump has been very vocal about his dislike for the fed s hawkish policies repeatedly drumming up the fact that higher interest rates lead to an overly brawny dollar and slow down the economy trump has even reportedly asked white house aides to explore ways to weaken the currency in order to boost exports and boost economic growth trump s open criticisms have mostly been viewed as unconventional going by the central bank s presumption of independence though of course no president wants to be associated with an economy weakening under his or her watch and now the president s call for lower rates and a weaker dollar have just have found fresh impetus from an unexpected source the imf now says the american currency is 6 12 overvalued incidentally the bretton woods institution has also found that the euro the second most commonly used currency in international trade is undervalued by 8 18 relative to the german economy the region s largest but in a potentially big knock on trump s assertions against beijing the imf says the chinese yuan appears to be fairly valued though it does concede that there are large uncertainties around the currency that could mean it s undervalued by 11 5 percent or overvalued by up to 8 5 percent click to enlarge source the guardian fresh ammunition you can expect trump to take full advantage of the fresh ammunition that the imf has just handed him the fact that he has never been a big fan of multilateral institutions such as the imf or the world bank notwithstanding in a tweet earlier this month trump accused china and europe of manipulating their respective currencies in order to gain unfair advantage of the u s and you can hardly blame him for going out on a limb to stop real or perceived injustices related bezos next big project could be worth 100 billion per year the dollar has strengthened considerably over the past decade with the dollar index a measure that pits the greenback against a basket of six major currencies euro japanese yen canadian dollar british pound swedish krona and swiss franc climbing 26 percent over the timeframe an overly strong dollar compared to currencies from major trade partners makes u s exports less competitive click to enlarge source investing com there are several plausible reasons why the u s dollar has become so bullish first the fed s expansive monetary policy during the post crisis era saw it constrain the supply of the currency which inevitably led to an increase in value second the ecb countered by doing just the opposite while political instability in the region further helped to weaken the currency bear in mind that the euro makes up about 58 percent of the dollar index making it by far and wide the most significant currency in determining the dollar s trajectory the yen is a distant second with a weight of 14 percent third forex traders have also played a significant role by using leverage to further weaken the euro and strengthen the dollar and finally there s always the distinct possibility that eurozone nations and china have been actively manipulating their currencies as trump claims china innocent for its part beijing has vowed to stay away from a currency war and said it does not plan to use a weaker yuan as a stick in the ongoing trade war suspicions though have continued to run high given beijing s checkered history as far as currency manipulation goes the yuan s value has declined markedly against the dollar ever since trump slapped hefty tariffs on chinese exports goldman sachs has argued that the declining value of the yuan on a trade weighted basis is big enough to blunt trump s tariffs a weaker yuan is an attractive trade off for the country because it helps goose a weakening economy without creating excessive inflationary pressures moreover it s irrational to expect beijing to suddenly stop manipulating its currency even as its economy continues to slow and chances of solid trade deal increasingly looking tenuous nevertheless beijing has severally received a clean bill of health from independent bodies despite trump continually pressuring the treasury to declare china a currency manipulator it has desisted from doing so citing lack of clear evidence instead italy ireland vietnam malaysia and singapore have been found guilty of the vice in the latest audit while germany remains on the watchlist by alex kimani for safehaven com more top reads from safehaven com
jul 18 2019 alasdair macleod the combination of american trade protectionism and the end of a failing credit expansion is leading into a global economic downturn and potentially a systemic crisis meanwhile investors still believe more extreme monetary policies will stabilise economies and that the ultra low interest rate environment will persist without renewed price inflation as samuel johnson reputedly said of a second marriage it represents the triumph of hope over experience introduction there is a moment just after the top of every credit cycle where positive momentum stalls before a new reality emerges when the stall begins as appears to be the case today everything is still read positively perennial bulls say don t worry the central bank will reduce interest rates and inject enough money into the banking system to ensure any recession will be minor and growth will resume with interest rates falling confidence in the final outcome means stocks continue to rise with this mindset bad news for the economy is always good news for stocks this investors paradise is populated by devotees of the new economics supporting progressively increased state intervention they don t actually believe that free markets should set stock prices anymore and have become hooked on central banks pursuing inflationary policies in their minds the relationship between monetary inflation and rising stock prices amounts to a financial equivalent of perpetual motion however their enduring belief in the might of central banks and the importance they place on maintaining asset prices makes inflationists blind to the message from stalling markets we all get caught up in it and when evidence of the stall in economic growth mounts we clamour for lower interest rates credit expansion and finally competitive exchange rates even president trump is now telling us the fed must weaken the dollar to boost exports and the american economy as it is already doing his bidding with interest rates surely the fed will oblige the naivety of this reasoning is endemic and as a naïve supporter of free markets president trump is beginning to trot it out again in britain the same old inflationist story wrapped up in proposed tax cuts to be paid for later by economic growth is now being pushed by boris johnson almost certain to be the next prime minister let us hope this is just electioneering rhetoric but so widely are the myths of monetary stimulus believed that they are now certain to be renewed in a push to sustain economic growth that gold prices measured in dollars will be guaranteed to rise is indirectly becoming officially sanctioned those of us in the gold business would be grateful for president trump s endorsement of gold if it was not for the economic consequences of his weak dollar policies on ordinary people whose money is about to be trashed nevertheless the gold price has now jumped to a new level and markets are trying to discount the consequences of what is now unfolding as the gold price continues to rise those who wonder whether it is worth buying miss the point it is not gold that rises but their money that s falling money is falling because governments through more aggressive monetary policies are about to deliberately undermine their own currencies the naivety over the consequences of weak money is not restricted to the leaderships of the us and uk the maintenance of negative interest rates and bond yields in the eu and japan are already testament to that but we now see two world leaders assuming boris succeeds may who indicate they are aware of the failings of the economic establishment but publicly endorsing the inflationism that has been central to the establishment s failure by promising the tax jam of today for a better outlook tomorrow boris johnson is roughly where trump was before he was elected president let s hope an enterprising journalist asks him to clarify whether he thinks a lower sterling which we already have is good for the economy very likely he will agree perhaps with the proviso that price inflation remains under control therefore central banks are committed to address stalling economic growth by snorting more of the drug that is giving us the downer but our leaders and central bankers are ignorant of sound theories of money and credit and are driven almost entirely by statistical information and here we hit a further problem government statistics are not fit for purpose statistics are misleading statistically inflation is under control because the statisticians with their methods have ensured it is so in giving the central banks a passport to accelerate the rate of monetary inflation by suppressing the consequences they are storing up trouble for us all there will come a time when not even the manipulation of consumer price statistics will hide the fact that the purchasing powers of the dollar sterling euro and even the yen are all falling at an alarming rate it is when we begin to sense that this is a problem that the stalling feeling turns our greed or complacency into concern and then outright fear exactly two hundred years ago lord canning who was briefly prime minster of great britain warned that you can prove anything with statistics except the truth this was over a century before modern econometrics evolved to make statistics more meaningful but statisticians have missed what was behind canning s point statistics prove nothing because they cannot replace sound reasoning instead they only assume the relationships between cause and effect rather than attempting to understand the manner of the link their approach is to monitor the relationship between monetary inflation and changes in prices to ensure that increases in the cpi remain within a target range as long as this is the case monetary policy makers can carry on issuing money out of thin air you cannot measure the general level of prices because it is a concept and not a fact strictly speaking it is hardly a concept either because it is not the unmeasurable general level of prices that inflates but the purchasing power of the currency that diminishes it may take time to work through but if you increase the quantity of unbacked state money and the bank credit in circulation a unit of currency will simply buy less not enough recognition is given to the draining effect on the productive members of society and their businesses monetary inflation undermines the value of their earnings and profits transferring wealth from savers and it impoverishes the poorest labourers for the benefit of government finances far from obtaining something for nothing the government gets its seigniorage by impoverishing the same people that pay its taxes if one could measure the general level of prices it is more likely that they have been rising by between seven and ten per cent annually for a considerable time as illustrated by john williams s shadowstats and confirmed by the chapwood index the official two per cent target is poppycock if we assume the two independent calculations are more realistic us citizens have been getting collectively poorer every year since the financial crisis of 2008 09 not only is this evidence that canning s aphorism about statistics telling us everything but the truth still holds but governments now fully depend on the concealment of the true state of affairs by statistical suppression governments have arrived at this point because funding through inflation faces the law of diminishing returns the more a government inflates the more it impoverishes its people and the more the people are impoverished the less both taxes and inflationary financing yield and as we look down from the heights of inflated asset prices the more evidence emerges that our economies are stalling the more important this will become with the establishment investing institutions and regular investors all being misled by official statistics it is no wonder that an understanding of the true position hardly exists it is an alice in wonderland world where the more you inflate the more gdp statistics say the economy is growing under recording the price deflator has become central to maintaining the delusion almost no one realises that an increase in nominal gdp is no more than a reflection of more money and credit being injected into the economy it confuses this increase in the quantity of money and credit with progress but progress suffers the disadvantage like the general price level of being impossible to measure with statistics reliance on statistical method has encouraged wrongheaded government intervention long ago we dismissed the certain knowledge that society thrives by cooperation and governments only by intervention the former progresses the latter interferes it prevented governments from trying to improve on free markets but that ended following the first world war consequently decades of intervention from the 1920s onwards have increasingly distorted our world away from free markets to embrace the gospel of government the gospel has been a drip feed upon which modern economies have become increasingly dependent stalling into a nose dive that drip feed is now augmented by american trade protectionism reversing the expansion of trade from which we have all benefited the harmful effect on the american economy will become apparent the combination of a long period of credit expansion and trade tariffs will very likely drive it into a deepening recession possibly a slump as these conditions today repeat those of 1929 1932 if the inflationary effect on prices is to be limited it will require foreign investors to buy dollars and increasing quantities of us treasury debt to cover an escalating budget deficit global funds will have to be diverted to the dollar from other investment opportunities notably the widescale development of asia from its policy towards china s economic development elements of the american deep state appear to understand this president trump appears not to and now he proposes to weaken the dollar the foreigners are expected to buy to finance his escalating budget deficits it is a difficult trap he has unwittingly set for his administration and as the us economy stalls further and the dollar weakens in a vain attempt by policy makers under the donald s cosh to make america great again the dollar s slide will require rising interest rates for its purchasing power to be stabilised forcing us treasury prices into a bear market the us treasury s finances will be plainly ensnared in a debt trap other currencies driven for decades by the same keynesian logic are to greater and lesser extents in the same boat but every currency has two driving forces that determine their valuations there is the collective assessment of the foreign exchanges and changes in preferences between holding money and buying goods in the domestic economy sometimes the foreigners might feel a fall is overdone and buy a currency when its domestic purchasing power is still falling at other times the slide towards oblivion is deferred by the general public who cannot get their heads round what is happening to their government s money but despite these interacting forces once the world s reserve currency begins to decline interest rates everywhere have to rise if this increasingly likely event happens the effect on forward looking markets is certain to be brutal today s stall becomes a free fall tomorrow that is why it is likely that by the end of this year it will be increasingly apparent that national economies emasculated by continual wealth transfer through monetary debasement and over burdened by non productive debt will begin to rhyme with the crash of 1929 32 and the subsequent depression the most notable difference is that with today s currencies being unbacked fiat instead of tied to gold prices will rise instead of falling as they did in the 1930s implications for gold the last time the destructive forces of an end of credit cycle coincided with trade protectionism was in october 1929 they were the driving factors behind the wall street crash and the subsequent depression this time the tariffs are not nearly as high as those of the smoot hawley tariff act but the magnitude of the credit cycle is far greater while we can hope that this time the combination is not as disruptive as the 1929 32 episode there is no doubt that today there is enough of a build up of market distortions ready to wash out of the global economy to justify considerable unease this unease is yet to be manifest in widespread investment opinion which still hopes for a miracle from monetary policies but both our analysis and the empirical observations of events ninety years ago demonstrate why a miracle is impossible a slump in global business activity is already developing and the only policy response will be inflationary monetary expansion is effectively guaranteed in a vain attempt to stop a downturn and to ensure the banking system is preserved this compares with a 25 contraction in broad money between 1929 and 1933 as thousands of american banks went under through the medium of the dollar in 1929 33 prices were measured in gold which was fixed at 20 67 to the ounce this time there is no sheet anchor and the dollar will simply lose purchasing power this means there will be more dollars to the ounce of gold there is no point in speculating how many dollars there will be to the ounce you might as well debate how many angels can dance on the head of a pin more importantly it is difficult to see how the slide in the dollar s purchasing power can be stopped once it starts just as the ability of the productive sector to pay taxes is being increasingly undermined at the same time as the government s expenditure rises we can also see time preferences adding a further layer of destruction to government finances foreigners in particular will need far higher interest rates to stop them selling dollars and to persuade them to buy again this was the policy of paul volcker as chairman of the fed addressed in the early eighties when he increased interest rates to 20 federal government debt then stood at only 30 of gdp while today it stands at 105 putting aside the bad debts escalating at the banks from a grossly overindebted private sector a rise in interest rates sufficient to stabilise the fiat dollar would almost certainly wipe out government finances and therefor faith in the dollar itself that is the extent the debt trap has now reached and the problem is not confined to america all major economies are in the same boat with very few notable exceptions the eurozone includes governments with severe debt problems and the japanese government has the highest debt to gdp ratio of them all lesser currencies have always had difficulties which will simply escalate if dollar interest rates rise for the moment very few see the true extent of the fiat currency problem it is hard for them to visualise an economic slump when overall demand for goods drops and for their prices to rise at the same time they are fixated on the objective value of money in transactions and do not realise that if people lose faith in it a currency s purchasing power will slide when it starts the process could be rapid the education of the masses in this matter thanks to cryptocurrencies is more advanced now than it has ever been if bitcoin soars to 20 000 50 000 and more millennials round the world will understand that the dollar or their local currency is going down the rush out of fiat bank deposits into crypto on its own could easily precipitate a widespread currency and systemic crisis this is not to advocate buying bitcoin or gold for that matter it is just to warn of the approaching end of the road for unbacked fiat currencies at a time when governments themselves face bankruptcy there is a well known saying that governments can t go bust don t you believe it it depends on fools continuing to place value in their fiat currencies we can

violation of the relevant laws of that jurisdiction toronto july 19 2019 globe newswire summary introduction the boards of barrick gold corporation barrick and acacia mining plc acacia are pleased to announce that they have reached agreement on the terms of a recommended offer by barrick for the ordinary share capital of acacia that barrick does not already own it is intended that the acquisition will be implemented by means of a court sanctioned scheme of arrangement under part 26 of the companies act the scheme under the terms of the acquisition each scheme shareholder will receive for every scheme share 0 168 new barrick shares the share for share exchange ratio and any acacia exploration properties special dividends and any deferred cash consideration dividends as described below on the basis of the market closing price of a barrick share on the nyse on 18 july 2019 being the last business day before this announcement the exchange rate of us 1 2479 1 on that date and the total number of 410 085 499 acacia shares in issue on that date the terms of the share for share exchange ratio imply a value of approximately 232 pence per acacia share total consideration of approximately 343 million 428 million for acacia minority shareholders and a total value of approximately 951 million for acacia on that basis the terms of the share for share exchange ratio represent a premium of 53 5 to the closing price of 151 pence per acacia share on 20 may 2019 the last business day prior to the announcement of a possible offer by barrick for acacia a premium of 24 2 to the closing price of 187 pence per acacia share on 18 july 2019 the last business day before this announcement and a premium of 28 2 to the volume weighted average price per acacia share over the twenty trading days ended on 18 july 2019 the last business day before this announcement in addition to the share for share exchange ratio under the terms of the acquisition acacia shareholders including barrick or any other member of the barrick group whose names appear on the register of members of acacia at the scheme record time irrespective of whether or not they attended and voted at the court meeting or the general meeting and if they attended and voted whether or not they voted in favour of the acquisition will be entitled to receive and retain the acacia exploration properties special dividends and any deferred cash consideration dividends if applicable paid as a consequence of the sales process to realise value from the sale of certain of the acacia exploration properties as described under sale of the sale exploration properties below the acacia exploration properties are acacia s exploration assets located in the republic of tanzania the republic of kenya the republic of mali and burkina faso including the excluded assets being acacia group s interests in the nyanzaga gold project in tanzania and the south houndé project in burkina faso in respect of which sale processes have already been commenced by acacia and are well advanced value attributable to the excluded assets of us 10 million has been reflected in the increased exchange ratio reflected in the share for share exchange ratio the independent technical value itv of the acacia exploration properties set out in the competent persons report produced by srk reflects an attributable value range for the acacia exploration properties of us 37 million low value to us 87 million high value with a preferred value of us 57 million included in the preferred value is an amount of us 9 million which relates to the excluded assets the value of the acacia exploration properties excluding the excluded assets the sale exploration properties as reported by srk amounts to us 48 million the exploration value whilst the itv attributed a value of us 9 million to the excluded assets since publication of the itv the value has increased to us 10 million as a result of the renegotiation of the agreement in which there will be an increase in the upfront payment in lieu of the royalty for the nyanzaga gold project as reflected in the share for share exchange ratio barrick and acacia note that the value of the sale exploration properties included in the itv is based on a number of assumptions which may or may not be supported and there can be no certainty or any assurance given by barrick or acacia that any sale will occur or in the event that a sale does occur that a realisation of such value will be achieved through a sale scheme shareholders should therefore not assume that the exploration value will be achieved through the sale of the sale exploration properties and that net proceeds equivalent to the exploration value will be payable to acacia shareholders as acacia exploration properties special dividends barrick currently owns 262 246 950 acacia shares representing approximately 63 9 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of acacia the terms of the acquisition are final and therefore in accordance with the code barrick will not be permitted to increase the terms of the acquisition sale of the sale exploration properties under the terms of the acquisition barrick has agreed for the benefit of all acacia shareholders to undertake a sales process to realise value for the sale exploration properties whereby barrick will following a customary marketing process dispose of the sale exploration properties in an arm s length transaction or series of transactions at the best cash price reasonably obtainable by barrick in the market at the time a sale or sales during the period of two years commencing on the effective date the sale period in view of barrick s 63 9 per cent shareholding in acacia barrick s interests in the outcome of the sales process to realise value for the sale exploration properties are wholly aligned with those of other acacia shareholders the sale exploration properties may be sold by barrick on an individual or combined basis within the sale period individual sales of the sale exploration properties may take place at different times within the sale period but barrick intends to conclude the sales process in respect of the sale exploration properties on or before the end of the sale period further details of the anticipated process for sale of the sale exploration properties and the arrangements that will be put in place will be set out in the scheme document the net proceeds of any sale or sales will be paid to acacia shareholders including barrick or any other member of the barrick group whose names appear on the register of members of acacia at the scheme record time irrespective of whether or not they attended and voted at the court meeting or the general meeting and if they attended and voted whether or not they voted in favour of the acquisition on a pro rata basis by reference to their existing holdings of acacia shares at that time by way of a us dollar cash payment payable on or before 31 december in the relevant year such sale or sales are completed the acacia exploration properties special dividends to the extent any sale consummated prior to the end of the sale period involves the payment of any escrow holdback deferred cash consideration or similar following that date deferred cash consideration any net deferred cash consideration will be paid to acacia shareholders including barrick or any other member of the barrick group whose names appear on the register of members of acacia at the scheme record time in the manner and on the basis described above a deferred cash consideration dividend deferred cash consideration dividends if any will be payable by acacia once such deferred cash consideration is actually received in cleared funds by barrick or any barrick subsidiary barrick will make an announcement by no later than 31 december each year until all net proceeds have been paid and all deferred cash consideration has been received as to any sale exploration properties sold or deferred cash consideration received in the relevant year and the gross and net proceeds attributable to such sale or sales and the amount of the acacia exploration properties special dividend and or deferred cash consideration dividend paid or payable to acacia shareholders as a result no statements made in this paragraph constitute post offer undertakings for the purposes of rule 19 5 of the code background to and reasons for the acquisition disputes with the government of tanzania the business and operations of acacia have been materially affected by the ongoing disputes with the government of tanzania got in march 2017 the got announced a ban on the export of metallic mineral concentrates the export ban and as a consequence in the second half of 2017 acacia took the decision to place the bulyanhulu mine on reduced operations the export ban remains in effect in addition there are numerous ongoing unresolved disputes between the got and acacia group companies including disputes in relation to tax environmental and criminal matters in october 2018 one of acacia s employees in tanzania was charged by the tanzanian prevention and combating of corruption bureau pccb with an offence under the tanzanian prevention and combating of corruption act the pccb also charged two current and one former employee of acacia s tanzanian businesses together with bulyanhulu gold mine limited bgml and pangea minerals limited pml and north mara gold mine limited nmgml and a third party canadian entity explorations miniers du nord ltd this being the former joint venture partner for the tulawaka mine with a number of different offences including breaches of the tanzanian anti money laundering act a total of 39 charges were brought acacia and barrick remain deeply concerned regarding the ongoing risks to these individuals who still remain in custody on criminal charges for a range of allegations without committal for trial or access to bail acacia continues to favour a negotiated resolution to the company s disputes with the got but as a fall back the acacia group sought to protect the company s business through the contractual arbitration proceedings commenced in 2017 by acacia s subsidiaries bgml and pml got arrangements barrick and acacia both believe that a negotiated settlement of acacia s disputes with the got is necessary barrick the company s majority shareholder has been in discussions with the got in an effort to identify and document a solution to the company s disputes which would include a lifting of the export ban and settlement of all other outstanding disputes acacia has co operated and provided assistance to barrick in relation to the discussions with the got on 19 october 2017 barrick and the got signed a set of framework documents which envisaged a us 300 million settlement payment and subsequent 50 50 sharing of economic benefits between acacia and the got as acacia was not permitted to participate in the discussion acacia was not a party to the framework documents and was not involved in negotiating the terms included therein there followed a lengthy period of time during which barrick and the got were discussing a set of agreements to implement the framework documents in the course of may 2019 barrick s negotiations with the got advanced to the point where draft transaction documents for a possible settlement had been extensively negotiated and initialled by the got albeit with a number of substantive issues still outstanding the key principle of the draft transaction documents under discussion is that going forward the got and acacia s tanzanian mine operating subsidiaries the tmcs will share the economic benefits derived from the tanzanian mines on a 50 50 basis based on the life of mine plans of the tmcs the got will receive its share of economic benefits through taxes royalties fees and other fiscal levies and through the got s 16 free carried interest in all distributions including shareholder loan repayments from the tmcs and a new tanzanian management company the 50 50 sharing arrangement will be reviewed annually to ensure that the actual and projected sharing of economic benefits is in accordance with the 50 50 principle the draft transaction documents also provide for payment by the acacia group of an aggregate sum of us 300 million in consideration for the full final and comprehensive settlement of all existing disputes between the got and the acacia group including all liability to taxation and a waiver of actual or potential claims on a mutual basis this us 300 million payment is outside of and therefore not taken into account for the purposes of the 50 50 sharing of the economic benefits over time the settlement envisaged by the draft transaction documents involves a significant value transfer from acacia to the got but this has been critical to agreeing draft settlement terms with the got and creating a viable operating framework for the tmcs going forward a summary of the material terms of the current draft transaction documents under discussion is set out in appendix 4 recent developments on 21 may 2019 barrick informed acacia that it had made significant progress towards finalising a proposed resolution to the disputes between the got and acacia and provided the transaction documents to acacia noting their status on the same date barrick also provided acacia with a letter dated 19 may 2019 from the acting chairman of the got negotiating team and addressed to each of the tmcs this letter the got negotiating team letter states that the got will not execute final agreements for the resolution of the company s disputes if acacia is one of the counterparties to the agreements and that it will only sign such agreements if satisfied that substantial changes have been made to the management style of the operating companies and of their shareholders acacia immediately reached out to the most senior levels in the got to seek clarity on the letter received and to date has received no response on 12 july 2019 acacia announced that its north mara mine had received a letter the no export letter from the mining commission of the tanzanian ministry of minerals informing it that the mining commission is soon to conduct an inspection of north mara s gold production the no export letter stated that export permits for gold shipments from north mara would be issued following completion of this inspection until such time as acacia receives permits for gold shipments the company cannot sell its product and production will accrue to inventory the company anticipates that under a normal production schedule it could operate for approximately one further week before running out of storage capacity acacia is seeking clarification of the timing for completion of the inspection on 16 july 2019 the national environment management council nemc issued nmgml with a prohibition notice the prohibition notice which orders the north mara mine to stop use of its tailings storage facility the tsf by 6 00 a m local time on 20 july 2019 the nemc cited the north mara mine s failure to contain and prevent seepage from the tsf as grounds for its issuance of the prohibition notice the prohibition notice stated that it shall remain effective until such time that nemc were to be satisfied that the north mara mine has taken measures to contain seepage from the tsf acacia is seeking clarification of the prohibition notice the effect of the north mara mine having to stop using the tsf would be the immediate cessation of gold production and in time if the prohibition is not lifted cessation of mining operations at north mara transaction committee observations on current status of operations the transaction committee acknowledges that the got negotiating team letter represented a material development in respect of acacia s status with the got shortly following the got negotiating team letter an official spokesman of the got confirmed in a press conference their position that they would not deal with acacia going forward furthermore acacia s local staff have engaged with their counterparts in government who have again confirmed that the got will not engage with acacia for the purposes of agreeing a settlement as things stand therefore there is a serious question as to whether acacia s entry into the transaction documents and the building of a long term partnership with the got on which the future for the business envisaged in the transaction documents necessarily relies are a realisable alternative for acacia as an independent company whilst acacia has continued to operate its assets and achieve significant production despite the deteriorating operating environment following the export ban the transaction committee views the no export letter and prohibition notice as a further material deterioration in the operating environment in particular the no export letter and the prohibition notice will restrict the ability of acacia to operate at north mara until such time as the company receives export permits and the prohibition is lifted on use of the tsf considering the impending loss of the ability of acacia to produce gold and operate the mine at north mara the acacia group s cash flow from operations will be adversely impacted and the acacia group will be required to meet its on going working capital requirements and other financial obligations from its existing cash balance this position is not sustainable and the liquidity of the company will be constrained in the absence of a resolution in the absence of a settlement of its disputes with the got the transaction committee remain concerned about the potential for the operating environment for the acacia group to further deteriorate further actions from the got have the potential to negatively affect the sustainability of the acacia group s business and present risks to acacia s employees and other stakeholders the acacia group has to date and only as a fall back option sought to protect its assets via the arbitration proceedings commenced in july 2017 as the transaction committee has previously disclosed however there are significant collateral risks in pml and bgml continuing to seek to protect their businesses through maintaining the arbitrations pending a negotiated resolution accordingly as announced on 17 july 2019 pml and bgml have now sought a stay of those proceedings in the light of increasing risks and to allow more time for a negotiated resolution the transaction committee has also concluded that the value to scheme shareholders of the acacia group pursuing these arbitration proceedings in the future does not exceed the value of the consideration as further explained in the section headed acacia recommendation and irrevocable undertakings below in light of this background and current circumstances the transaction committee having considered amongst other factors the financial terms of the scheme believes that the acquisition is a fair outcome for the scheme shareholders it is also an attractive solution for the company s other key stakeholders as it may enable barrick to finalise the terms of a settlement with the got thereby resolving the long running disputes and potentially allowing the acacia group s tanzanian business and its employees in tanzania who have provided exceptional and unstinting support in continuing operations in country to return to a normalised operating environment background to the acquisition it is against the background of the got s position as highlighted above that barrick concluded that the only way forward to preserve to the extent possible the value of acacia s assets was for barrick to make an offer to acquire all of the acacia shares not already owned by it and on 21 may 2019 barrick presented acacia with an indicative proposal to acquire all the issued and to be issued share capital of acacia not already owned or controlled by barrick the consideration originally proposed by barrick was in the form of new common shares in barrick with scheme shareholders receiving 0 153 of a new common share of barrick for every ordinary share in acacia the possible offer acacia s announcement confirming barrick s indicative proposal stated that any firm intention to make an offer in accordance with rule 2 7 of the code would be subject to a deadline of 5 00 p m on 18 june 2019 the first pusu deadline on 18 june 2019 acacia announced that barrick had requested that acacia seek an extension to the first pusu deadline in order to facilitate further engagement with acacia and its minority shareholders in order to provide further time to determine a proposal that might receive sufficient shareholder support the acacia board requested that the panel extend the first pusu deadline and in light of this request an extension was granted by the panel to 5 00 p m on 9 july 2019 the second pusu deadline on 24 june 2019 acacia announced that in 2018 it had engaged srk an independent technical consultancy to carry out a comprehensive review of its geological and resource modelling and preparation of its life of mine plans and mineral resource and mineral reserve statements srk presented the results of this review in the form of a competent persons report which was effective on 30 june 2019 and published by acacia on 9 july 2019 the transaction committee directors confirm that srk have confirmed that an updated valuation of acacia s assets as at the date of this announcement would not be materially different from the valuation thereof contained in the competent persons report the competent persons report and an executive summary thereof can be found on acacia s website as follows on 9 july 2019 acacia also announced that barrick had requested that acacia seek an extension to the second pusu deadline in order to allow barrick more time to review the competent persons report and facilitate further engagement with acacia on the terms of the proposal in order to further facilitate such discussions the acacia board requested that the panel extend the second pusu deadline and in light of this request an extension was granted by the panel to 5 00 p m on 19 july 2019 acacia has subsequently engaged with barrick on the contents of the competent persons report and other matters relating to the terms of the possible offer following these discussions barrick informed the transaction committee that while constructive the discussions with srk and acacia and barrick s detailed review of the competent persons report did not result in barrick attributing greater value to acacia s operating mines than taken into account in connection with its possible offer barrick has informed the transaction committee that the discussion did however lead it to conclude that it was in a position to revise its proposal to take into account two additional value items unrelated to acacia s operating mines as noted below barrick s revised proposal barrick s possible offer did not attribute any value to the acacia exploration properties the competent persons report ascribed an itv to the acacia exploration properties ranging from us 37 million low value to us 87 million high value with a preferred value of us 57 million barrick has agreed with acacia i to improve the exchange ratio upon which scheme shares will be exchanged for barrick shares to reflect us 10 million in respect of the disposal by acacia of the excluded assets and ii to undertake a sales process for the benefit of all acacia shareholders to realise value for the sale exploration properties with the net proceeds of any sale or sales being paid to all acacia shareholders by way of acacia exploration properties special dividends in addition barrick has agreed to further improve the exchange ratio upon which scheme shares will be exchanged for barrick shares to reflect general and administrative expense savings expected to be realised following the effective date through the office closures and personnel reductions referred to under the section headed directors management and employees and locations of business below the transaction committee has considered the terms of the acacia exploration properties special dividends and any deferred cash consideration dividends the transaction committee notes that the competent persons report attributes a value of us 48 million to the sale exploration properties however the transaction committee notes that there is no certainty around the outcome of any sales process and therefore the cash amount that may be realised from the disposal of the sale exploration properties may be materially lower or higher and have taken this into account in assessing the value of the consideration in considering the merits of these terms the transaction committee has also taken the following into account the terms of the transaction documents as summarised in appendix 4 to this announcement and their likely impact on the operations future financial results and prospects for acacia based on the management s long term business plan for the acacia group s mines while acknowledging at the same time that it is not known what the final terms of such settlement may comprise the recent and continuing deterioration of the operating environment as exemplified by the no export letter and prohibition notice the urgent need to create certainty and stability for acacia its people and the communities in which it operates which the transaction committee believes is more likely to happen under the full ownership and control of barrick given the current attitude of the got towards acacia the statement in the got s negotiating team letter as to the inability of acacia to enter into the transaction documents and the significant uncertainty as to the ability of acacia to build a long term partnership with the got the risks and uncertainties associated with the fall back alternative of continuing with the outstanding arbitration as described above the transaction committee has also concluded that the value to scheme shareholders of the acacia group pursuing these arbitration proceedings in the future does not exceed the value of the consideration the certainty created for scheme shareholders to receive the consideration if the acquisition were to proceed the apparent lack of alternative buyers of acacia or any of its tanzanian assets at this time of great uncertainty for the company the significant risks that barrick is assuming given that it has not yet reached a final agreement with the got on the transaction documents acacia recommendation and irrevocable undertakings the transaction committee directors who have been so advised by j p morgan cazenove and rbc capital markets as to the financial terms of the acquisition consider the terms of the acquisition to be fair and reasonable in providing their advice j p morgan cazenove and rbc capital markets have taken into account the commercial assessments of the transaction committee directors accordingly the transaction committee directors have unanimously approved the acquisition and intend to recommend that the scheme shareholders vote in favour of the scheme at the court meeting and the resolutions to be proposed at the general meeting as rachel english and andre falzon the only members of the board who hold any acacia shares have irrevocably undertaken to do in respect of their own acacia shares representing approximately 0 01 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of acacia further details of these irrevocable undertakings are set out in appendix 3 the irrevocable undertakings will cease to be binding only if one of the events set out in appendix 3 takes place in addition lazard co limited is providing independent financial advice to the transaction committee directors in providing such advice lazard co limited has relied upon the commercial assessments of the transaction committee directors transaction committee stephen galbraith who is both a non executive director of acacia and an employee of barrick has played no part in the consideration by the transaction committee directors of the acquisition the recommendation of it by the transaction committee directors or the discussions between barrick and the got general it is intended that the acquisition will be implemented by means of a court sanctioned scheme of arrangement under part 26 of the companies act the acquisition will be conditional on among other things i the requisite approvals of the scheme shareholders for the scheme and the acquisition at the court meeting and of acacia shareholders at the general meeting ii relevant regulatory

of 1934 barrick s and acacia s mineral reserves and mineral resources have been estimated in accordance with national instrument 43 101 standards of disclosure for mineral projects as required by canadian securities regulatory authorities for united states reporting purposes industry guide 7 under the us securities exchange act of 1934 as interpreted by the staff of the sec applies different standards in order to classify mineralization as a reserve in addition while the terms measured indicated and inferred mineral resources are required pursuant to national instrument 43 101 standards of disclosure for mineral projects the sec does not recognize such terms canadian standards differ significantly from the requirements of the sec and mineral resource information contained herein and in the documents incorporated herein by reference is not comparable to similar information regarding mineral reserves disclosed in accordance with the requirements of the sec however for united states reporting purposes the sec has adopted amendments to its disclosure rules to modernize the mineral property disclosure requirements for issuers whose securities are registered with the sec under the u s securities exchange act of 1934 which amendments became effective february 25 2019 with compliance required for the first fiscal year beginning on or after january 1 2021 the sec s rule amendments replace the historical property disclosure requirements for mining registrants that were included in industry guide 7 and recognize estimates of measured mineral resources indicated mineral resources and inferred mineral resources in addition the sec has amended its definitions of proven mineral reserves and probable mineral reserves to be substantially similar to the corresponding definitions required in national instrument 43 101 investors should understand that inferred mineral resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and as to their economic and legal feasibility in addition investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of any mineral resources constitute or will be converted into reserves accordingly information contained in this

holders may not be able to sue a non us company or its officers or directors in a non us court for violations of us securities laws further it may be difficult to compel a non us company and its affiliates to subject themselves to a us court s judgment in accordance with normal uk practice barrick or its nominees or its brokers acting as agents may from time to time make certain purchases of or arrangements to purchase acacia shares other than pursuant to the acquisition until the date on which the acquisition and or scheme becomes effective lapses or is otherwise withdrawn these

excluded assets being acacia group s interests in the nyanzaga gold project in tanzania and the south houndé project in burkina faso in respect of which sale processes have already been commenced by

value of the acacia exploration properties excluding the excluded assets the sale exploration properties as reported by srk amounts to us 48 million the exploration value whilst the itv attributed a value of us 9 million to the excluded assets since publication of the itv the value has increased to us 10 million as a result of the renegotiation of the agreement in which there will be an increase in the upfront payment in lieu of the royalty for the nyanzaga gold project as reflected in the share for share exchange ratio barrick and acacia note that the value of the sale exploration properties included in the itv is based on a number of assumptions which may or may not be supported and there can be no certainty or any assurance given by barrick or acacia that any sale will occur or in the event that a sale does occur that a realisation of such value will be achieved through a sale scheme shareholders should therefore not assume that the exploration value will be achieved through the sale of the sale exploration properties and that net proceeds equivalent to the exploration value will be payable to acacia shareholders as acacia exploration properties special dividends barrick

or deferred cash consideration dividend paid or payable to acacia shareholders as a result no statements made in this paragraph constitute post offer undertakings for the purposes of rule 19 5 of the code 4 background to and reasons for the acquisition disputes with the government of tanzania the business and operations of acacia have been materially affected by the ongoing disputes with the government of tanzania got in march 2017 the got announced a ban on the export of metallic mineral concentrates the export ban and as a consequence in the second half of 2017 acacia took the decision to place the bulyanhulu mine on reduced operations the export ban remains in effect in addition there are numerous ongoing unresolved disputes between the got and acacia group companies including disputes in relation to tax environmental and criminal matters in october 2018 one of acacia s employees in tanzania was charged by the tanzanian prevention and combating of corruption bureau pccb with an offence under the tanzanian prevention and combating of corruption act the pccb also charged two current and one former employee of acacia s tanzanian businesses together with bulyanhulu gold mine limited bgml and pangea minerals limited pml and north mara gold mine limited nmgml and a third party canadian entity explorations miniers du nord ltd this being the former joint venture partner for the tulawaka mine with a number of different offences including breaches of the tanzanian anti money laundering act a total of 39 charges were brought acacia and barrick remain deeply concerned regarding the ongoing risks to these individuals who still remain in custody on criminal charges for a range of allegations without committal for trial or access to bail acacia continues to favour a negotiated resolution to the company s disputes with the got but as a fall back the acacia group sought to protect the company s business through the contractual arbitration proceedings commenced in 2017 by acacia s subsidiaries bgml and pml got arrangements barrick and acacia both believe that a negotiated settlement of acacia s disputes with the got is necessary barrick the company s majority shareholder has been in discussions with the got in an effort to identify and document a solution to the company s disputes which would include a lifting of the export ban and settlement of all other outstanding disputes acacia has co operated and provided assistance to barrick in relation to the discussions with the got on 19 october 2017 barrick and the got signed a set of framework documents which envisaged a us 300 million settlement payment and subsequent 50 50 sharing of economic benefits between acacia and the got as acacia was not permitted to participate in the discussion acacia was not a party to the framework documents and was not involved in negotiating the terms included therein there followed a lengthy period of time during which barrick and the got were discussing a set of agreements to implement the framework documents in the course of may 2019 barrick s negotiations with the got advanced to the point where draft transaction documents for a possible settlement had been extensively negotiated and initialled by the got albeit with a number of substantive issues still outstanding the key principle of the draft transaction documents under discussion is that going forward the got and acacia s tanzanian mine operating subsidiaries the tmcs will share the economic benefits derived from the tanzanian mines on a 50 50 basis based on the life of mine plans of the tmcs the got will receive its share of economic benefits through taxes royalties fees and other fiscal levies and through the got s 16 free carried interest in all distributions including shareholder loan repayments from the tmcs and a new tanzanian management company the 50 50 sharing arrangement will be reviewed annually to ensure that the actual and projected sharing of economic benefits is in accordance with the 50 50 principle the draft transaction documents also provide for payment by the acacia group of an aggregate sum of us 300 million in consideration for the full final and comprehensive settlement of all existing disputes between the got and the acacia group including all liability to taxation and a waiver of actual or potential claims on a mutual basis this us 300 million payment is outside of and therefore not taken into account for the purposes of the 50 50 sharing of the economic benefits over time the settlement envisaged by the draft transaction documents involves a significant value transfer from acacia to the got but this has been critical to agreeing draft settlement terms with the got and creating a viable operating framework for the tmcs going forward a summary of the material terms of the current draft transaction documents under discussion is set out in appendix 4 recent developments on 21 may 2019 barrick informed acacia that it had made significant progress towards finalising a proposed resolution to the disputes between the got and acacia and provided the transaction documents to acacia noting their status on the same date barrick also provided acacia with a letter dated 19 may 2019 from the acting chairman of the got negotiating team and addressed to each of the tmcs this letter the got negotiating team letter states that the got will not execute final agreements for the resolution of the company s disputes if acacia is one of the counterparties to the agreements and that it will only sign such agreements if satisfied that substantial changes have been made to the management style of the operating companies and of their shareholders acacia immediately reached out to the most senior levels in the got to seek clarity on the letter received and to date has received no response on 12 july 2019 acacia announced that its north mara mine had received a letter the no export letter from the mining commission of the tanzanian ministry of minerals informing it that the mining commission is soon to conduct an inspection of north mara s gold production the no export letter stated that export permits for gold shipments from north mara would be issued following completion of this inspection until such time as acacia receives permits for gold shipments the company cannot sell its product and production will accrue to inventory the company anticipates that under a normal production schedule it could operate for approximately one further week before running out of storage capacity acacia is seeking clarification of the timing for completion of the inspection on 16 july 2019 the national environment management council nemc issued nmgml with a prohibition notice the prohibition notice which orders the north mara mine to stop use of its tailings storage facility the tsf by 6 00 a m local time on 20 july 2019 the nemc cited the north mara mine s failure to contain and prevent seepage from the tsf as grounds for its issuance of the prohibition notice the prohibition notice stated that it shall remain effective until such time that nemc were to be satisfied that the north mara mine has taken measures to contain seepage from the tsf acacia is seeking clarification of the prohibition notice the effect of the north mara mine having to stop using the tsf would be the immediate cessation of gold production and in time if the prohibition is not lifted cessation of mining operations at north mara transaction committee observations on current status of operations the transaction committee acknowledges that the got negotiating team letter represented a material development in respect of acacia s status with the got shortly following the got negotiating team letter an official spokesman of the got confirmed in a press conference their position that they would not deal with acacia going forward furthermore acacia s local staff have engaged with their counterparts in government who have again confirmed that the got will not engage with acacia for the purposes of agreeing a settlement as things stand therefore there is a serious question as to whether acacia s entry into the transaction documents and the building of a long term partnership with the got on which the future for the business envisaged in the transaction documents necessarily relies are a realisable alternative for acacia as an independent company whilst acacia has continued to operate its assets and achieve significant production despite the deteriorating operating environment following the export ban the transaction committee views the no export letter and prohibition notice as a further material deterioration in the operating environment in particular the no export letter and the prohibition notice will restrict the ability of acacia to operate at north mara until such time as the company receives export permits and the prohibition is lifted on use of the tsf considering the impending loss of the ability of acacia to produce gold and operate the mine at north mara the acacia group s cash flow from operations will be adversely impacted and the acacia group will be required to meet its on going working capital requirements and other financial obligations from its existing cash balance this position is not sustainable and the liquidity of the company will be constrained in the absence of a resolution in the absence of a settlement of its disputes with the got the transaction committee remain concerned about the potential for the operating environment for the acacia group to further deteriorate further actions from the got have the potential to negatively affect the sustainability of the acacia group s business and present risks to acacia s employees and other stakeholders the acacia group has to date and only as a fall back option sought to protect its assets via the arbitration proceedings commenced in july 2017 as the transaction committee has previously disclosed however there are significant collateral risks in pml and bgml continuing to seek to protect their businesses through maintaining the arbitrations pending a negotiated resolution accordingly as announced on 17 july 2019 pml and bgml have now sought a stay of those proceedings in the light of increasing risks and to allow more time for a negotiated resolution the transaction committee has also concluded that the value to scheme shareholders of the acacia group pursuing these arbitration proceedings in the future does not exceed the value of the consideration as further explained in the section headed acacia recommendation and irrevocable undertakings below in light of this background and current circumstances the transaction committee having considered amongst other factors the financial terms of the scheme believes that the acquisition is a fair outcome for the scheme shareholders it is also an attractive solution for the company s other key stakeholders as it may enable barrick to finalise the terms of a settlement with the got thereby resolving the long running disputes and potentially allowing the acacia group s tanzanian business and its employees in tanzania who have provided exceptional and unstinting support in continuing operations in country to return to a normalised operating environment background to the acquisition it is against the background of the got s position as highlighted above that barrick concluded that the only way forward to preserve to the extent possible the value of acacia s assets was for barrick to make an offer to acquire all of the acacia shares not already owned by it and on 21 may 2019 barrick presented acacia with an indicative proposal to acquire all the issued and to be issued share capital of acacia not already owned or controlled by barrick the consideration originally proposed by barrick was in the form of new common shares in barrick with scheme shareholders receiving 0 153 of a new common share of barrick for every ordinary share in acacia the possible offer acacia s announcement confirming barrick s indicative proposal stated that any firm intention to make an offer in accordance with rule 2 7 of the code would be subject to a deadline of 5 00 p m on 18 june 2019 the first pusu deadline on 18 june 2019 acacia announced that barrick had requested that acacia seek an extension to the first pusu deadline in order to facilitate further engagement with acacia and its minority shareholders in order to provide further time to determine a proposal that might receive sufficient shareholder support the acacia board requested that the panel extend the first pusu deadline and in light of this request an extension was granted by the panel to 5 00 p m on 9 july 2019 the second pusu deadline on 24 june 2019 acacia announced that in 2018 it had engaged srk an independent technical consultancy to carry out a comprehensive review of its geological and resource modelling and preparation of its life of mine plans and mineral resource and mineral reserve statements srk presented the results of this review in the form of a competent persons report which was effective on 30 june 2019 and published by acacia on 9 july 2019 the transaction committee directors confirm that srk have confirmed that an updated valuation of acacia s assets as at the date of this announcement would not be materially different from the valuation thereof contained in the competent persons report the competent persons report and an executive summary thereof can be found on acacia s website as follows on 9 july 2019 acacia also announced that barrick had requested that acacia seek an extension to the second pusu deadline in order to allow barrick more time to review the competent persons report and facilitate further engagement with acacia on the terms of the proposal in order to further facilitate such discussions the acacia board requested that the panel extend the second pusu deadline and in light of this request an extension was granted by the panel to 5 00 p m on 19 july 2019 acacia has subsequently engaged with barrick on the contents of the competent persons report and other matters relating to the terms of the possible offer following these discussions barrick informed the transaction committee that while constructive the discussions with srk and acacia and barrick s detailed review of the competent persons report did not result in barrick attributing greater value to acacia s operating mines than taken into account in connection with its possible offer barrick has informed the transaction committee that the discussion did however lead it to conclude that it was in a position to revise its proposal to take into account two additional value items unrelated to acacia s operating mines as noted below barrick s revised proposal barrick s possible offer did not attribute any value to the acacia exploration properties the competent persons report ascribed an itv to the acacia exploration properties ranging from us 37 million low value to us 87 million high value with a preferred value of us 57 million barrick has agreed with acacia i to improve the exchange ratio upon which scheme shares will be exchanged for barrick shares to reflect us 10 million in respect of the disposal by acacia of the excluded assets and ii to undertake a sales process for the benefit of all acacia shareholders to realise value for the sale exploration properties with the net proceeds of any sale or sales being paid to all acacia shareholders by way of acacia exploration properties special dividends in addition barrick has agreed to further improve the exchange ratio upon which scheme shares will be exchanged for barrick shares to reflect general and administrative expense savings expected to be realised following the effective date through the office closures and personnel reductions referred to under the section headed directors management and employees and locations of business below the transaction committee has considered the terms of the acacia exploration properties special dividends and any deferred cash consideration dividends the transaction committee notes that the competent persons report attributes a value of us 48 million to the sale exploration properties however the transaction committee notes that there is no certainty around the outcome of any sales process and therefore the cash amount that may be realised from the disposal of the sale exploration properties may be materially lower or higher and have taken this into account in assessing the value of the consideration in considering the merits of these terms the transaction committee has also taken the following into account the terms of the transaction documents as summarised in appendix 4 to this announcement and their likely impact on the operations future financial results and prospects for acacia based on the management s long term business plan for the acacia group s mines while acknowledging at the same time that it is not known what the final terms of such settlement may comprise the recent and continuing deterioration of the operating environment as exemplified by the no export letter and prohibition notice the urgent need to create certainty and stability for acacia its people and the communities in which it operates which the transaction committee believes is more likely to happen under the full ownership and control of barrick given the current attitude of the got towards acacia the statement in the got s negotiating team letter as to the inability of acacia to enter into the transaction documents and the significant uncertainty as to the ability of acacia to build a long term partnership with the got the risks and uncertainties associated with the fall back alternative of continuing with the outstanding arbitration as described above the transaction committee has also concluded that the value to scheme shareholders of the acacia group pursuing these arbitration proceedings in the future does not exceed the value of the consideration the certainty created for scheme shareholders to receive the consideration if the acquisition were to proceed the apparent lack of alternative buyers of acacia or any of its tanzanian assets at this time of great uncertainty for the company the significant risks that barrick is assuming given that it has not yet reached a final agreement with the got on the transaction documents 5 recommendation the transaction committee directors who have been so advised by j p morgan cazenove and rbc capital markets as to the financial terms of the acquisition consider the terms of the acquisition to be fair and reasonable in providing their advice j p morgan cazenove and rbc capital markets have taken into account the commercial assessments of the transaction committee directors accordingly the transaction committee directors have unanimously approved the acquisition and

dividends and any deferred cash consideration dividends as described below on the basis of the market closing price of a barrick share on the nyse on 18 july 2019 being the last business day before this announcement the exchange rate of us 1 2479 1 on that date and the total number of 410 085 499 acacia shares in issue on that date the terms of the share for share exchange ratio imply a value of approximately 232 pence per acacia share total consideration of approximately 343 million 428 million for acacia minority shareholders and a total value of approximately 951 million for acacia on that basis the terms of the share for share exchange ratio represent a premium of 53 5 to the closing price of 151 pence per acacia share on 20 may 2019 the last business day prior to the announcement of a possible offer by barrick for acacia a premium of 24 2 to the closing price of 187 pence per acacia share on 18 july 2019 the last business day before this announcement and a premium of 28 2 to the volume weighted average price per acacia share over the twenty trading days ended on 18 july 2019 the last business day before this announcement in addition to the share for share exchange ratio under the terms of the acquisition acacia shareholders including barrick or any other member of the barrick group whose names appear on the register of members of acacia at the scheme record time irrespective of whether or not they attended and voted at the court meeting or the general meeting and if they attended and voted whether or not they voted in favour of the acquisition will be entitled to receive and retain the acacia exploration properties special dividends and any deferred cash consideration dividends if applicable paid as a consequence of the sales process to realise value from the sale of certain of the acacia exploration properties as described under sale of the sale exploration properties below the acacia exploration properties are acacia s exploration assets located in the republic of tanzania the republic of kenya the republic of mali and burkina faso including the excluded assets being acacia group s interests in the nyanzaga gold project in tanzania and the south houndé project in burkina faso in respect of which sale processes have already been commenced by acacia and are well advanced value attributable to the excluded assets of us 10 million has been reflected in the increased exchange ratio reflected in the share for share exchange ratio the independent technical value itv of the acacia exploration properties set out in the competent persons report produced by srk reflects an attributable value range for the acacia exploration properties of us 37 million low value to us 87 million high value with a preferred value of us 57 million included in the preferred value is an amount of us 9 million which relates to the excluded assets the value of the acacia exploration properties excluding the excluded assets the sale exploration properties as reported by srk amounts to us 48 million the exploration value whilst the itv attributed a value of us 9 million to the excluded assets since publication of the itv the value has increased to us 10 million as a result of the renegotiation of the agreement in which there will be an increase in the upfront payment in lieu of the royalty for the nyanzaga gold project as reflected in the share for share exchange ratio barrick and acacia note that the value of the sale exploration properties included in the itv is based on a number of assumptions which may or may not be supported and there can be no certainty or any assurance given by barrick or acacia that any sale will occur or in the event that a sale does occur that a realisation of such value will be achieved through a sale scheme shareholders should therefore not assume that the exploration value will be achieved through the sale of the sale exploration properties and that net proceeds equivalent to the exploration value will be payable to acacia shareholders as acacia exploration properties special dividends barrick currently owns 262 246 950 acacia shares representing approximately 63 9 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of acacia the terms of the acquisition are final and therefore in accordance with the code barrick will not be permitted to increase the terms of the acquisition sale of the sale exploration properties under the terms of the acquisition barrick has agreed for the benefit of all acacia shareholders to undertake a sales process to realise value for the sale exploration properties whereby barrick will following a customary marketing process dispose of the sale exploration properties in an arm s length transaction or series of transactions at the best cash price reasonably obtainable by barrick in the market at the time a sale or sales during the period of two years commencing on the effective date the sale period in view of barrick s 63 9 per cent shareholding in acacia barrick s interests in the outcome of the sales process to realise value for the sale exploration properties are wholly aligned with those of other acacia shareholders the sale exploration properties may be sold by barrick on an individual or combined basis within the sale period individual sales of the sale exploration properties may take place at different times within the sale period but barrick intends to conclude the sales process in respect of the sale exploration properties on or before the end of the sale period further details of the anticipated process for sale of the sale exploration properties and the arrangements that will be put in place will be set out in the scheme document the net proceeds of any sale or sales will be paid to acacia shareholders including barrick or any other member of the barrick group whose names appear on the register of members of acacia at the scheme record time irrespective of whether or not they attended and voted at the court meeting or the general meeting and if they attended and voted whether or not they voted in favour of the acquisition on a pro rata basis by reference to their existing holdings of acacia shares at that time by way of a us dollar cash payment payable on or before 31 december in the relevant year such sale or sales are completed the acacia exploration properties special dividends to the extent any sale consummated prior to the end of the sale period involves the payment of any escrow holdback deferred cash consideration or similar following that date deferred cash consideration any

and all deferred cash consideration has been received as to any sale exploration properties sold or deferred cash consideration received in the relevant year and the gross and net proceeds attributable to such sale or sales and the amount of the acacia exploration properties special dividend and or deferred cash consideration dividend paid or payable to acacia shareholders as a result no statements made in this paragraph constitute post offer undertakings for the purposes of rule 19 5 of the code background to and reasons for the acquisition disputes with the government of tanzania the business and operations of acacia have been materially affected by the ongoing disputes with the government of tanzania got in march 2017 the got announced a ban on the export of metallic mineral concentrates the export ban and as a consequence in the second half of 2017 acacia took the decision to place the bulyanhulu mine on reduced operations the export ban remains in effect in addition there are numerous ongoing unresolved disputes between the got and acacia group companies including disputes in relation to tax environmental and criminal matters in october 2018 one of acacia s employees in tanzania was charged by the tanzanian prevention and combating of corruption bureau pccb with an offence under the tanzanian prevention and combating of corruption act the pccb also charged two current and one former employee of acacia s tanzanian businesses together with bulyanhulu gold mine limited bgml and pangea minerals limited pml and north mara gold mine limited nmgml and a third party canadian entity explorations miniers du nord ltd this being the former joint venture partner for the tulawaka mine with a number of different offences including breaches of the tanzanian anti money laundering act a total of 39 charges were brought acacia and barrick remain deeply concerned regarding the ongoing risks to these individuals who still remain in custody on criminal charges for a range of allegations without committal for trial or access to bail acacia continues to favour a negotiated resolution to the company s disputes with the got but as a fall back the acacia group sought to protect the company s business through the contractual arbitration proceedings commenced in 2017 by acacia s subsidiaries bgml and pml got arrangements barrick and acacia both believe that a negotiated settlement of acacia s disputes with the got is necessary barrick the company s majority shareholder has been in discussions with the got in an effort to identify and document a solution to the company s disputes which would include a lifting of the export ban and settlement of all other outstanding disputes acacia has co operated and provided assistance to barrick in relation to the discussions with the got on 19 october 2017 barrick and the got signed a set of framework documents which envisaged a us 300 million settlement payment and subsequent 50 50 sharing of economic benefits between acacia and the got as acacia was not permitted to participate in the discussion acacia was not a party to the framework documents and was not involved in negotiating the terms included therein there followed a lengthy period of time during which barrick and the got were discussing a set of agreements to implement the framework documents in the course of may 2019 barrick s negotiations with the got advanced to the point where draft transaction documents for a possible settlement had been extensively negotiated and initialled by the got albeit with a number of substantive issues still outstanding the key principle of the draft transaction documents under discussion is that going forward the got and acacia s tanzanian mine operating subsidiaries the tmcs will share the economic benefits derived from the tanzanian mines on a 50 50 basis based on the life of mine plans of the tmcs the got will receive its share of economic benefits through taxes royalties fees and other fiscal levies and through the got s 16 free carried interest in all distributions including shareholder loan repayments from the tmcs and a new tanzanian management company the 50 50 sharing arrangement will be reviewed annually to ensure that the actual and projected sharing of economic benefits is in accordance with the 50 50 principle the draft transaction documents also provide for payment by the acacia group of an aggregate sum of us 300 million in consideration for the full final and comprehensive settlement of all existing disputes between the got and the acacia group including all liability to taxation and a waiver of actual or potential claims on a mutual basis this us 300 million payment is outside of and therefore not taken into account for the purposes of the 50 50 sharing of the economic benefits over time the settlement envisaged by the draft transaction documents involves a significant value transfer from acacia to the got but this has been critical to agreeing draft settlement terms with the got and creating a viable operating framework for the tmcs going forward a summary of the material terms of the current draft transaction documents under discussion is set out in appendix 4 recent developments on 21 may 2019 barrick informed acacia that it had made significant progress towards finalising a proposed resolution to the disputes between the got and acacia and provided the transaction documents to acacia noting their status on the same date barrick also provided acacia with a letter dated 19 may 2019 from the acting chairman of the got negotiating team and addressed to each of the tmcs this letter the got negotiating team letter states that the got will not execute final agreements for the resolution of the company s disputes if acacia is one of the counterparties to the agreements and that it will only sign such agreements if satisfied that substantial changes have been made to the management style of the operating companies and of their shareholders acacia immediately reached out to the most senior levels in the got to seek clarity on the letter received and to date has received no response on 12 july 2019 acacia announced that its north mara mine had received a letter the noexport letter from the mining commission of the tanzanian ministry of minerals informing it that the mining commission is soon to conduct an inspection of north mara s gold production the no export letter stated that export permits for gold shipments from north mara would be issued following completion of this inspection until such time as acacia receives permits for gold shipments the company cannot sell its product and production will accrue to inventory the company anticipates that under a normal production schedule it could operate for approximately one further week before running out of storage capacity acacia is seeking clarification of the timing for completion of the inspection on 16 july 2019 the national environment management council nemc issued nmgml with a prohibition notice the prohibition notice which orders the north mara mine to stop use of its tailings storage facility the tsf by 6 00 a m local time on 20 july 2019 the nemc cited the north mara mine s failure to contain and prevent seepage from the tsf as grounds for its issuance of the prohibition notice the prohibition notice stated that it shall remain effective until such time that nemc were to be satisfied that the north mara mine has taken measures to contain seepage from the tsf acacia is seeking clarification of the prohibition notice the effect of the north mara mine having to stop using the tsf would be the immediate cessation of gold production and in time if the prohibition is not lifted cessation of mining operations at north mara transaction committee observations on current status of operations the transaction committee acknowledges that the got negotiating team letter represented a material development in respect of acacia s status with the got shortly following the got negotiating team letter an official spokesman of the got confirmed in a press conference their position that they would not deal with acacia going forward furthermore acacia s local staff have engaged with their counterparts in government who have again confirmed that the got will not engage with acacia for the purposes of agreeing a settlement as things stand therefore there is a serious question as to whether acacia s entry into the transaction documents and the building of a long term partnership with the got on which the future for the business envisaged in the transaction documents necessarily relies are a realisable alternative for acacia as an independent company whilst acacia has continued to operate its assets and achieve significant production despite the deteriorating operating environment following the export ban the transaction committee views the no export letter and prohibition notice as a further material deterioration in the operating environment in particular the no export letter and the prohibition notice will restrict the ability of acacia to operate at north mara until such time as the company receives export permits and the prohibition is lifted on use of the tsf considering the impending loss of the ability of acacia to produce gold and operate the mine at north mara the acacia group s cash flow from operations will be adversely impacted and the acacia group will be required to meet its on going working capital requirements and other financial obligations from its existing cash balance this position is not sustainable and the liquidity of the company will be constrained in the absence of a resolution in the absence of a settlement of its disputes with the got the transaction committee remain concerned about the potential for the operating environment for the acacia group to further deteriorate further actions from the got have the potential to negatively affect the sustainability of the acacia group s business and present risks to acacia s employees and other stakeholders the acacia group has to date and only as a fall back option sought to protect its assets via the arbitration proceedings commenced in july 2017 as the transaction committee has previously disclosed however there are significant collateral risks in pml and bgml continuing to seek to protect their businesses through maintaining the arbitrations pending a negotiated resolution accordingly as announced on 17 july 2019 pml and bgml have now sought a stay of those proceedings in the light of increasing risks and to allow more time for a negotiated resolution the transaction committee has also concluded that the value to scheme shareholders of the acacia group pursuing these arbitration proceedings in the future does not exceed the value of the consideration as further explained in the section headed acacia recommendation and irrevocable undertakings below in light of this background and current circumstances the transaction committee having considered amongst other factors the financial terms of the scheme believes that the acquisition is a fair outcome for the scheme shareholders it is also an attractive solution for the company s other key stakeholders as it may enable barrick to finalise the terms of a settlement with the got thereby resolving the long running disputes and potentially allowing the acacia group s tanzanian business and its employees in tanzania who have provided exceptional and unstinting support in continuing operations in country to return to a normalised operating environment background to the acquisition it is against the background of the got s position as highlighted above that barrick concluded that the only way forward to preserve to the extent possible the value of acacia s assets was for barrick to make an offer to acquire all of the acacia shares not already owned by it and on 21 may 2019 barrick presented acacia with an indicative proposal to acquire all the issued and to be issued share capital of acacia not already owned or controlled by barrick the consideration originally proposed by barrick was in the form of new common shares in barrick with scheme shareholders receiving 0 153 of a new common share of barrick for every ordinary share in acacia the possible offer acacia s announcement confirming barrick s indicative proposal stated that any firm intention to make an offer in accordance with rule 2 7 of the code would be subject to a deadline of 5 00 p m on 18 june 2019 the first pusu deadline on 18 june 2019 acacia announced that barrick had requested that acacia seek an extension to the first pusu deadline in order to facilitate further engagement with acacia and its minority shareholders in order to provide further time to determine a proposal that might receive sufficient shareholder support the acacia board requested that the panel extend the first pusu deadline and in light of this request an extension was granted by the panel to 5 00 p m on 9 july 2019 the second pusu deadline on 24 june 2019 acacia announced that in 2018 it had engaged srk an independent technical consultancy to carry out a comprehensive review of its geological and resource modelling and preparation of its life of mine plans and mineral resource and mineral reserve statements srk presented the results of this review in the form of a competent persons report which was effective on 30 june 2019 and published by acacia on 9 july 2019 the transaction committee directors confirm that srk have confirmed that an updated valuation of acacia s assets as at the date of this announcement would not be materially different from the valuation thereof contained in the competent persons report the competent persons report and an executive summary thereof can be found on acacia s website as follows on 9 july 2019 acacia also announced that barrick had requested that acacia seek an extension to the second pusu deadline in order to allow barrick more time to review the competent persons report and facilitate further engagement with acacia on the terms of the proposal in order to further facilitate such discussions the acacia board requested that the panel extend the second pusu deadline and in light of this request an extension was granted by the panel to 5 00 p m on 19 july 2019 acacia has subsequently engaged with barrick on the contents of the competent persons report and other matters relating to the terms of the possible offer following these discussions barrick informed the transaction committee that while constructive the discussions with srk and acacia and barrick s detailed review of the competent persons report did not result in barrick attributing greater value to acacia s operating mines than taken into account in connection with its possible offer barrick has informed the transaction committee that the discussion did however lead it to conclude that it was in a position to revise its proposal to take into account two additional value items unrelated to acacia s operating mines as noted below barrick s revised proposal barrick s possible offer did not attribute any value to the acacia exploration properties the competent persons report ascribed an itv to the acacia exploration properties ranging from us 37 million low value to us 87 million high value with a preferred value of us 57 million barrick has agreed with acacia i to improve the exchange ratio upon which scheme shares will be exchanged for barrick shares to reflect us 10 million in respect of the disposal by acacia of the excluded assets and ii to undertake a sales process for the benefit of all acacia shareholders to realise value for the sale exploration properties with the net proceeds of any sale or sales being paid to all acacia shareholders by way of acacia exploration properties special dividends in addition barrick has agreed to further improve the exchange ratio upon which scheme shares will be exchanged for barrick shares to reflect general and administrative expense savings expected to be realised following the effective date through the office closures and personnel reductions referred to under the section headed directors management and employees and locations of business below the transaction committee has considered the terms of the acacia exploration properties special dividends and any deferred cash consideration dividends the transaction committee notes that the competent persons report attributes a value of us 48 million to the sale exploration properties however the transaction committee notes that there is no certainty around the outcome of any sales process and therefore the cash amount that may be realised from the disposal of the sale exploration properties may be materially lower or higher and have taken this into account in assessing the value of the consideration in considering the merits of these terms the transaction committee has also taken the following into account the terms of the transaction documents as summarised in appendix 4 to this announcement and their likely impact on the operations future financial results and prospects for acacia based on the management s long term business plan for the acacia group s mines while acknowledging at the same time that it is not known what the final terms of such settlement may comprise the recent and continuing deterioration of the operating environment as exemplified by the no export letter and prohibition notice the urgent need to create certainty and stability for acacia its people and the communities in which it operates which the transaction committee believes is more likely to happen under the full ownership and control of barrick given the current attitude of the got towards acacia the statement in the got s negotiating team letter as to the inability of acacia to enter into the transaction documents and the significant uncertainty as to the ability of acacia to build a long term partnership with the got the risks and uncertainties associated with the fall back alternative of continuing with the outstanding arbitration as described above the transaction committee has also concluded that the value to scheme shareholders of the acacia group pursuing these arbitration proceedings in the future does not exceed the value of the consideration the certainty created for scheme shareholders to receive the consideration if the acquisition were to proceed the apparent lack of alternative buyers of acacia or any of its tanzanian assets at this time of great uncertainty for the company the significant risks that barrick is assuming given that it has not yet reached a final agreement with the got on the transaction documents acacia recommendation and irrevocable undertakings the transaction committee directors who have been so advised by j p morgan cazenove and rbc capital markets as to the financial terms of the acquisition consider the terms of the acquisition to be fair and reasonable in providing their advice j p morgan cazenove and rbc capital markets have taken into account the commercial assessments of the transaction committee directors accordingly the transaction committee directors have unanimously approved the acquisition and intend to recommend that the scheme shareholders vote in favour of the scheme at the court meeting and the resolutions to be proposed at the general meeting as rachel english and andre falzon the only members of the board who hold any acacia shares have irrevocably undertaken to do in respect of their own acacia shares representing approximately 0 01 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of acacia further details of these irrevocable undertakings are set out in appendix 3 the irrevocable undertakings will cease to be binding only if one of the events set out in appendix 3 takes place in addition lazard co limited is providing independent financial advice to the transaction committee directors in providing such advice lazard co limited has relied upon the commercial assessments of the transaction committee directors transaction committee stephen galbraith who is both a non executive director of acacia and an employee of barrick has played no part in the consideration by the transaction committee directors of the acquisition the recommendation of it by the transaction committee directors or the discussions between barrick and the got general it is intended that the acquisition will be implemented by means of a court sanctioned scheme of arrangement under part 26 of the companies act the acquisition will be conditional on among other things i the requisite approvals of the scheme shareholders for the scheme and the acquisition at the court meeting and of acacia shareholders at the general meeting ii relevant regulatory clearances being received and other conditions satisfied

compliance required for the first fiscal year beginning on or after january 1 2021 the sec s rule amendments replace the historical property disclosure requirements for mining registrants that were included in industry guide 7 and recognize estimates of measured mineral resources indicated mineral resources and inferred mineral resources in addition the sec has amended its definitions of proven

rate of us 1 2479 1 on that date and the total number of 410 085 499 acacia shares in issue on that date the terms of the share for share exchange ratio imply a value of approximately 232 pence per acacia share total consideration of approximately 343 million 428 million for acacia minority shareholders and a total value of approximately 951 million for acacia on that basis the terms of the

tanzania the republic of kenya the republic of mali and burkina faso including the excluded assets being acacia group s interests in the nyanzaga gold project in tanzania and the south houndé project in burkina faso in respect of which sale processes have already been commenced by acacia and are well advanced value attributable to the excluded assets of us 10 million has been reflected in the

value is an amount of us 9 million which relates to the excluded assets the value of the acacia exploration properties excluding the excluded assets the sale exploration properties as reported by srk amounts to us 48 million the exploration value whilst the itv attributed a value of us 9 million to the excluded assets since publication of the itv the value has increased to us 10 million as a result of the renegotiation of the agreement in which there will be an increase in the upfront payment in lieu of the royalty for the nyanzaga gold project as reflected in the share for share exchange ratio barrick and acacia note that the value of the sale exploration properties included in the itv is based on a number of assumptions which may or may not be supported and there can be no certainty or any assurance given by barrick or acacia that any sale will occur or in the event that a sale does occur that a realisation of such value will be achieved through a sale scheme shareholders should therefore not assume that the exploration value will be achieved through the sale of the sale exploration properties and that net proceeds equivalent to the exploration value will be payable to acacia shareholders as acacia exploration properties special dividends barrick currently owns 262 246 950 acacia shares representing approximately 63 9 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of acacia

the market at the time a sale or sales during the period of two years commencing on the effective date the sale period in view of barrick s 63 9 per cent shareholding in acacia barrick s interests in the outcome of the sales process to realise value for the sale exploration properties are wholly aligned with those of other acacia shareholders the sale exploration properties may be sold by barrick

acacia exploration properties special dividend and or deferred cash consideration dividend paid or payable to acacia shareholders as a result no statements made in this paragraph constitute post offer undertakings for the purposes of rule 19 5 of the code background to and reasons for the acquisition disputes with the government of tanzania the business and operations of acacia have been materially affected by the ongoing disputes with the government of tanzania got in march 2017 the got announced a ban on the export of metallic mineral concentrates the export ban and as a consequence in the second half of 2017 acacia took the decision to place the bulyanhulu mine on reduced operations the export ban remains in effect in addition there are numerous ongoing unresolved disputes between the got and acacia group companies including disputes in relation to tax environmental and criminal matters in october 2018 one of acacia s employees in tanzania was charged by the tanzanian prevention and combating of corruption bureau pccb with an offence under the tanzanian prevention and combating of corruption act the pccb also charged two current and one former employee of acacia s tanzanian businesses together with bulyanhulu gold mine limited bgml and pangea minerals limited pml and north mara gold mine limited nmgml and a third party canadian entity explorations miniers du nord ltd this being the former joint venture partner for the tulawaka mine with a number of different offences including breaches of the tanzanian anti money laundering act a total of 39 charges were brought acacia and barrick remain deeply concerned regarding the ongoing risks to these individuals who still remain in custody on criminal charges for a range of allegations without committal for trial or access to bail acacia continues to favour a negotiated resolution to the company s disputes with the got but as a fall back the acacia group sought to protect the company s business through the contractual arbitration proceedings commenced in 2017 by acacia s subsidiaries bgml and pml got arrangements barrick and acacia both believe that a negotiated settlement of acacia s disputes with the got is necessary barrick the company s majority shareholder has been in discussions with the got in an effort to identify and document a solution to the company s disputes which would include a lifting of the export ban and settlement of all other outstanding disputes acacia has co operated and provided assistance to barrick in relation to the discussions with the got on 19 october 2017 barrick and the got signed a set of framework documents which envisaged a us 300 million settlement payment and subsequent 50 50 sharing of economic benefits between acacia and the got as acacia was not permitted to participate in the discussion acacia was not a party to the framework documents and was not involved in negotiating the terms included therein there followed a lengthy period of time during which barrick and the got were discussing a set of agreements to implement the framework documents in the course of may 2019 barrick s negotiations with the got advanced to the point where draft transaction documents for a possible settlement had been extensively negotiated and initialled by the got albeit with a number of substantive issues still outstanding the key principle of the draft transaction documents under discussion is that going forward the got and acacia s tanzanian mine operating subsidiaries the tmcs will share the economic benefits derived from the tanzanian mines on a 50 50 basis based on the life of mine plans of the tmcs the got will receive its share of economic benefits through taxes royalties fees and other fiscal levies and through the got s 16 free carried interest in all distributions including shareholder loan repayments from the tmcs and a new tanzanian management company the 50 50 sharing arrangement will be reviewed annually to ensure that the actual and projected sharing of economic benefits is in accordance with the 50 50 principle the draft transaction documents also provide for payment by the acacia group of an aggregate sum of us 300 million in consideration for the full final and comprehensive settlement of all existing disputes between the got and the acacia group including all liability to taxation and a waiver of actual or potential claims on a mutual basis this us 300 million payment is outside of and therefore not taken into account for the purposes of the 50 50 sharing of the economic benefits over time the settlement envisaged by the draft transaction documents involves a significant value transfer from acacia to the got but this has been critical to agreeing draft settlement terms with the got and creating a viable operating framework for the tmcs going forward a summary of the material terms of the current draft transaction documents under discussion is set out in appendix 4 recent developments on 21 may 2019 barrick informed acacia that it had made significant progress towards finalising a proposed resolution to the disputes between the got and acacia and provided the transaction documents to acacia noting their status on the same date barrick also provided acacia with a letter dated 19 may 2019 from the acting chairman of the got negotiating team and addressed to each of the tmcs this letter the got negotiating team letter states that the got will not execute final agreements for the resolution of the company s disputes if acacia is one of the counterparties to the agreements and that it will only sign such agreements if satisfied that substantial changes have been made to the management style of the operating companies and of their shareholders acacia immediately reached out to the most senior levels in the got to seek clarity on the letter received and to date has received no response on 12 july 2019 acacia announced that its north mara mine had received a letter the noexport letter from the mining commission of the tanzanian ministry of minerals informing it that the mining commission is soon to conduct an inspection of north mara s gold production the no export letter stated that export permits for gold shipments from north mara would be issued following completion of this inspection until such time as acacia receives permits for gold shipments the company cannot sell its product and production will accrue to inventory the company anticipates that under a normal production schedule it could operate for approximately one further week before running out of storage capacity acacia is seeking clarification of the timing for completion of the inspection on 16 july 2019 the national environment management council nemc issued nmgml with a prohibition notice the prohibition notice which orders the north mara mine to stop use of its tailings storage facility the tsf by 6 00 a m local time on 20 july 2019 the nemc cited the north mara mine s failure to contain and prevent seepage from the tsf as grounds for its issuance of the prohibition notice the prohibition notice stated that it shall remain effective until such time that nemc were to be satisfied that the north mara mine has taken measures to contain seepage from the tsf acacia is seeking clarification of the prohibition notice the effect of the north mara mine having to stop using the tsf would be the immediate cessation of gold production and in time if the prohibition is not lifted cessation of mining operations at north mara transaction committee observations on current status of operations the transaction committee acknowledges that the got negotiating team letter represented a material development in respect of acacia s status with the got shortly following the got negotiating team letter an official spokesman of the got confirmed in a press conference their position that they would not deal with acacia going forward furthermore acacia s local staff have engaged with their counterparts in government who have again confirmed that the got will not engage with acacia for the purposes of agreeing a settlement as things stand therefore there is a serious question as to whether acacia s entry into the transaction documents and the building of a long term partnership with the got on which the future for the business envisaged in the transaction documents necessarily relies are a realisable alternative for acacia as an independent company whilst acacia has continued to operate its assets and achieve significant production despite the deteriorating operating environment following the export ban the transaction committee views the no export letter and prohibition notice as a further material deterioration in the operating environment in particular the no export letter and the prohibition notice will restrict the ability of acacia to operate at north mara until such time as the company receives export permits and the prohibition is lifted on use of the tsf considering the impending loss of the ability of acacia to produce gold and operate the mine at north mara the acacia group s cash flow from operations will be adversely impacted and the acacia group will be required to meet its on going working capital requirements and other financial obligations from its existing cash balance this position is not sustainable and the liquidity of the company will be constrained in the absence of a resolution in the absence of a settlement of its disputes with the got the transaction committee remain concerned about the potential for the operating environment for the acacia group to further deteriorate further actions from the got have the potential to negatively affect the sustainability of the acacia group s business and present risks to acacia s employees and other stakeholders the acacia group has to date and only as a fall back option sought to protect its assets via the arbitration proceedings commenced in july 2017 as the transaction committee has previously disclosed however there are significant collateral risks in pml and bgml continuing to seek to protect their businesses through maintaining the arbitrations pending a negotiated resolution accordingly as announced on 17 july 2019 pml and bgml have now sought a stay of those proceedings in the light of increasing risks and to allow more time for a negotiated resolution the transaction committee has also concluded that the value to scheme shareholders of the acacia group pursuing these arbitration proceedings in the future does not exceed the value of the consideration as further explained in the section headed acacia recommendation and irrevocable undertakings below in light of this background and current circumstances the transaction committee having considered amongst other factors the financial terms of the scheme believes that the acquisition is a fair outcome for the scheme shareholders it is also an attractive solution for the company s other key stakeholders as it may enable barrick to finalise the terms of a settlement with the got thereby resolving the long running disputes and potentially allowing the acacia group s tanzanian business and its employees in tanzania who have provided exceptional and unstinting support in continuing operations in country to return to a normalised operating environment background to the acquisition it is against the background of the got s position as highlighted above that barrick concluded that the only way forward to preserve to the extent possible the value of acacia s assets was for barrick to make an offer to acquire all of the acacia shares not already owned by it and on 21 may 2019 barrick presented acacia with an indicative proposal to acquire all the issued and to be issued share capital of acacia not already owned or controlled by barrick the consideration originally proposed by barrick was in the form of new common shares in barrick with scheme shareholders receiving 0 153 of a new common share of barrick for every ordinary share in acacia the possible offer acacia s announcement confirming barrick s indicative proposal stated that any firm intention to make an offer in accordance with rule 2 7 of the code would be subject to a deadline of 5 00 p m on 18 june 2019 the first pusu deadline on 18 june 2019 acacia announced that barrick had requested that acacia seek an extension to the first pusu deadline in order to facilitate further engagement with acacia and its minority shareholders in order to provide further time to determine a proposal that might receive sufficient shareholder support the acacia board requested that the panel extend the first pusu deadline and in light of this request an extension was granted by the panel to 5 00 p m on 9 july 2019 the second pusu deadline on 24 june 2019 acacia announced that in 2018 it had engaged srk an independent technical consultancy to carry out a comprehensive review of its geological and resource modelling and preparation of its life of mine plans and mineral resource and mineral reserve statements srk presented the results of this review in the form of a competent persons report which was effective on 30 june 2019 and published by acacia on 9 july 2019 the transaction committee directors confirm that srk have confirmed that an updated valuation of acacia s assets as at the date of this announcement would not be materially different from the valuation thereof contained in the competent persons report the competent persons report and an executive summary thereof can be found on acacia s website as follows on 9 july 2019 acacia also announced that barrick had requested that acacia seek an extension to the second pusu deadline in order to allow barrick more time to review the competent persons report and facilitate further engagement with acacia on the terms of the proposal in order to further facilitate such discussions the acacia board requested that the panel extend the second pusu deadline and in light of this request an extension was granted by the panel to 5 00 p m on 19 july 2019 acacia has subsequently engaged with barrick on the contents of the competent persons report and other matters relating to the terms of the possible offer following these discussions barrick informed the transaction committee that while constructive the discussions with srk and acacia and barrick s detailed review of the competent persons report did not result in barrick attributing greater value to acacia s operating mines than taken into account in connection with its possible offer barrick has informed the transaction committee that the discussion did however lead it to conclude that it was in a position to revise its proposal to take into account two additional value items unrelated to acacia s operating mines as noted below barrick s revised proposal barrick s possible offer did not attribute any value to the acacia exploration properties the competent persons report ascribed an itv to the acacia exploration properties ranging from us 37 million low value to us 87 million high value with a preferred value of us 57 million barrick has agreed with acacia i to improve the exchange ratio upon which scheme shares will be exchanged for barrick shares to reflect us 10 million in respect of the disposal by acacia of the excluded assets and ii to undertake a sales process for the benefit of all acacia shareholders to realise value for the sale exploration properties with the net proceeds of any sale or sales being paid to all acacia shareholders by way of acacia exploration properties special dividends in addition barrick has agreed to further improve the exchange ratio upon which scheme shares will be exchanged for barrick shares to reflect general and administrative expense savings expected to be realised following the effective date through the office closures and personnel reductions referred to under the section headed directors management and employees and locations of business below the transaction committee has considered the terms of the acacia exploration properties special dividends and any deferred cash consideration dividends the transaction committee notes that the competent persons report attributes a value of us 48 million to the sale exploration properties however the transaction committee notes that there is no certainty around the outcome of any sales process and therefore the cash amount that may be realised from the disposal of the sale exploration properties may be materially lower or higher and have taken this into account in assessing the value of the consideration in considering the merits of these terms the transaction committee has also taken the following into account the terms of the transaction documents as summarised in appendix 4 to this announcement and their likely impact on the operations future financial results and prospects for acacia based on the management s long term business plan for the acacia group s mines while acknowledging at the same time that it is not known what the final terms of such settlement may comprise the recent and continuing deterioration of the operating environment as exemplified by the no export letter and prohibition notice the urgent need to create certainty and stability for acacia its people and the communities in which it operates which the transaction committee believes is more likely to happen under the full ownership and control of barrick given the current attitude of the got towards acacia the statement in the got s negotiating team letter as to the inability of acacia to enter into the transaction documents and the significant uncertainty as to the ability of acacia to build a long term partnership with the got the risks and uncertainties associated with the fall back alternative of continuing with the outstanding arbitration as described above the transaction committee has also concluded that the value to scheme shareholders of the acacia group pursuing these arbitration proceedings in the future does not exceed the value of the consideration the certainty created for scheme shareholders to receive the consideration if the acquisition were to proceed the apparent lack of alternative buyers of acacia or any of its tanzanian assets at this time of great uncertainty for the company the significant risks that barrick is assuming given that it has not yet reached a final agreement with the got on the transaction documents recommendation the transaction committee directors who have been so advised by j p morgan cazenove and rbc capital markets as to the financial terms of the acquisition consider the terms of the acquisition to be fair and reasonable in providing their advice j p morgan cazenove and rbc capital markets have taken into account the commercial assessments of the transaction committee directors accordingly the transaction committee directors have unanimously approved the acquisition and intend to recommend that the scheme shareholders vote in favour of the scheme at the court meeting and the resolutions to be proposed at the general meeting as rachel english and andre falzon the only members of the board who hold any acacia shares have irrevocably undertaken to do in respect of their own acacia shares representing approximately 0 01 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of acacia j p morgan cazenove and rbc capital markets are providing independent financial advice to the transaction committee directors for the purposes of rule 3 of the code lazard co limited is providing independent financial advice to the transaction committee directors and in providing such advice lazard co limited has relied upon the commercial assessment of the transaction committee directors each of j p morgan cazenove rbc capital markets and lazard co limited has given and not withdrawn its consent to the inclusion in this announcement of references to its name in the form and context in which it appears transaction committee stephen galbraith who is both a non executive director of acacia and an employee of barrick has played no part in the consideration by the transaction committee directors of the acquisition the recommendation of it by the transaction committee directors or the discussions between barrick and the got irrevocable undertakings barrick has received irrevocable undertakings to vote in favour of or procure the voting in favour of the scheme at the court meeting and the resolutions to be proposed at the general meeting from rachel english and andre falzon the only members of the board who hold any acacia shares in respect of a total of 26 383 acacia shares representing approximately 0 01 per cent of the existing issued ordinary share capital of acacia the irrevocable undertakings will cease to be binding only if one of the events set out in

in tanzania implemented the export ban forcing acacia immediately to cease all exports of its gold copper concentrate at the bulyanhulu and buzwagi mines in early april 2017 a presidential committee of the got was formed to investigate the contents of metallic mineral concentrates in various locations in tanzania including samples from the impounded containers owned by acacia shortly thereafter a second presidential committee of the got the second committee was formed to consider the economic and regulatory issues relating to the export of metallic mineral concentrates from tanzania on 12 june 2017 the second committee announced its conclusions that acacia had under declared revenues and tax payments over a number of years by tens of billions of us dollars acacia disputed these conclusions and was engaging with the highest levels of the got in june 2017 barrick began engaging separately with the got in relation to the disputes between acacia and the got due to requirements of the got acacia was not permitted to participate in these and future discussions between the got and barrick nor was it permitted to subsequently engage directly at the highest levels with the got in light of these developments the independent acacia directors recognised that supporting barrick s discussions with the got was the most pragmatic way to achieve a settlement of the disputes and barrick has worked in good faith with the consent and support of acacia and for the benefit of all shareholders on 29 june 2017 the got published draft legislation which recommended changes to the legal framework governing the natural resources sector in tanzania including an increase in the royalty rate applicable to gold copper and silver to 6 furthermore the tanzanian parliament approved a new finance act imposing a 1 clearing fee which the acacia group has been paying under protest on the value of all minerals exported from tanzania from 1 july 2017 the legislation became law in early july 2017 on 4

an new working paper by sebastian horn carmen reinhart and christoph trebesch on china s foreign lending has some important findings such as that china accounts for more than 40 of the external debt of 50 developing countries we ve embedded the document at the end of this post the study is an ambitious undertaking seeking to track china s foreign lending from the start of the current regime in 1949 to 2017 they identified 1 974 loans and 2 947 grants to 152 countries totaling approximately 530 billion which is over and above china s purchases of foreign bonds the authors conclude that the overwhelming majority of the lending is official meaning by the government or government owned enterprises despite its opacity the authors describe half the funding to developing economies as hidden meaning not included in the statistics of the world bank international monetary fund or bank of international settlements this data is difficult to compile because china lends to different economies in different ways and for none of the types of lending is there a central authoritative data source on top of that even where the data is solid it may not mean what it appears to mean for instance former us treasury official brad setser used to post regularly on treasury s report on international capital flows and he would regularly attribute most of treasury purchases attributed to the uk because that s where the trades were booked to china but the biggest gap is not in coming up with estimates of chinese purchases of foreign government bonds which is its main source of lending to advanced economies but its use of loans foreign direct investment and even loans to chinese construction companies operating abroad which are its major ways of providing funding to developing economies a report in big think underscored the significance of this research indeed economist and author of the report tresbesch recently told germany s spiegel in an interview following the release of the study s findings that compiling all of the information was like a kind of economic archeology their information came from numerous financial world databases along with some documents provided courtesy of the cia it s no secret that china would like to keep this type of information occluded from the international scene opponents of china s secretive lending practices fear that beijing is engaging in predatory debt diplomacy and using their worldwide belt and road initiative to create a new kind of economic colonialism over africa and other parts of the developing world these developing country borrowers aren t necessarily getting breaks from china the authors find that the lending is often at prevailing rates and even secured by domestic assets like commodities the authors note emphasis original china s direct loans and trade credits have climbed from almost zero in 1998 to more than 1 6 trillion usd or close to 2 percent of world gdp in 2018 5 these loans mostly go to low and middle income countries in total estimates suggest that the chinese state now accounts for a quarter of total bank lending to emerging markets this has transformed china into the largest official creditor easily surpassing the imf or the world bank beyond that however little is known among our tasks is to identify these borrowers not surprisingly chinese lending reflects strategic rather than financial goals from the article we find that the people s republic has always been an active international lender even in the 1950s and 1960s when it lent substantial amounts to communist brother states chinese loans have helped to finance large scale investments in infrastructure energy and mining in more than 100 developing and emerging market countries with potentially large positive effects for growth and prosperity at the same time however the large lending flows resulted in the build up of high debt servicing burdens for the 50 main recipients of chinese direct lending the average stock of debt owed to china has increased from less than 1 of gdp in 2005 to more than 15 of debtor country gdp in 2017 at least according to our lower bound estimates for these countries debt to china now accounts for more than 40 of total external debt on average over the past decades official creditors have typically lent to developing countries at concessionary terms with long maturities and at below market interest rates china instead often lends at market terms with risk premia shorter maturities and partly with collateral clauses that secure repayment through commodity export proceeds in particular from oil the latter establishes china s comparatively high level of seniority among other international creditors see schlegl et al 2019 these practices have a historical analogue indeed china s overseas loans share many features with french german and british 19th century foreign lending which also tended to be market based partially collateralized by commodity income and characterized by a close link of political and commercial interests feis 1930 borchardt 1951 with a view to financial stability another relevant historical analogue is the lending boom of the 1970s when resource rich low income countries received large amounts of syndicated bank loans while commodity prices boomed the chinese lending flows during 2008 to 2015 share similarities with the 1970s lending cycle which did not end happily once commodity prices export revenues and economic growth slumped across many of the countries that had gone on a borrowing spree after 1982 dozens of sovereigns went into default resulting in a lost decade in latin america and elsewhere the sharp increase in the incidence of sovereign debt restructurings of chinese debt since 2011 suggests a new wave of debt overhangs debt levels and the debt service burdens in two dozen developing countries are much higher than previously thought in other words if you think the troika hasn t been nice to the famed piigs china is in a position to be even less nice the authors also estimate the magnitude of chinese foreign lending emphasis original over time as of 2018 the government of china holds more than five trillion usd of debt towards the rest of the world 6 of world gdp up from less than 500 billion in the early 2000s 1 of world gdp the main difference to figure 1 is that we now add portfolio debt holdings blue area and combine these with the direct loans and trade credits shown before if we also add foreign equity and direct investments not shown china s total financial claims abroad amount to more than 8 of world gdp in 2017 this dramatic increase in chinese official lending and investment is almost unprecedented in peacetime history being only comparable to the rise of us lending in the wake of wwi and wwii horn et al forthcoming indeed the rapid growth of claims have transformed the chinese government into the world s largest official creditor the largest overall creditor remains the united states despite these developments however we know strikingly little about china s capital exports and their global implications the paper has an extensive discussion of the distribution of chinese lending and its magnitude relative to the size of the recipient country s economy and amount of external credit for instance specifically the country group most exposed to china are low income developing countries lidcs many of whom are commodity exporters and some are former highly indebted poor countries hipcs who benefitted from large scale official debt relief in the 1990s and 2000s another highly exposed group are oil exporting countries such as angola ecuador niger or venezuela as well as countries that are commonly associated with china s belt and road initiative listed in world bank 2018 for the bri countries the median in our data is comparatively low 3 6 debt to gdp while the average is more than twice as high 8 8 debt to gdp this reflects the fact that some bri countries have already borrowed heavily from china pushing up the average while others have only recently joined and are not as highly indebted as of 2017 such as countries in eastern europe and the middle east the regions most indebted to china are far east asia and central asia including highly exposed small economies that are in geographic proximity to china such as laos cambodia and the kyrgyz republic see panel b of figure 8 next come sub saharan africa and latin america as well as some parts of the mena middle east and north africa region the debt flows to eastern europe are smaller when measured as a share of debtor country gdp but the amounts of credit to europe have been growing substantially over the past five years there a a lot more meat in the paper for instance the institutional and legal characteristics of china s loans also have commercial rather than official characteristics the loans are extended by a variety of creditors including more than a dozen public banks and public enterprises that behave like private entities in addition the lending contracts often look like commercial loans with secrecy and arbitration clauses so that repayment amounts or any default or restructuring details are kept outside of the public domain all of these features are highly unusual for official lending as extended by oecd governments and paris club member countries during the post wwii era around 70 percent of paris club claims on low income and emerging countries are in the form of official development assistance as defined by the oecd i e are concessional in character and have a grant element of at least 25 percent the united states government for example typically extends funds for military and economic cooperation in the form of grants rather than loans the same is true for official creditors in europe where the european stability mechanism esm lent with maturities of up to 30 years and at almost no risk premia corsetti et al 2018 interestingly 85 of these loans are dollar denominated and about half are secured needless to say this is an impressive piece of research and i ve extracted only some of its important findings i hope you ll read it in full
in a house hearing on monetary policy last week federal reserve chair jerome powell made a telling confession in response to a question from rep alexandria ocasio cortez d ny the topic was the so called natural rate of unemployment the idea believed by many economists and policymakers that there is a rate at which unemployment could get so low that it could trigger ever rising inflation it s an idea that has governed decades of monetary policymaking often prompting the fed to keep interest rates higher than it should slowing down the economy in the process out of fear of accelerating inflation ocasio cortez didn t waste time poking holes at it she pointed out that the unemployment rate now 3 7 percent has fallen well below the fed s estimates of the natural rate which it forecast at 5 4 percent in 2014 and 4 2 percent today and yet she noted inflation is no higher today than it was five years ago given these facts do you think it s possible that the fed s estimates of the lowest sustainable unemployment rate may have been too high powell s response to his credit was as simple and direct as you ll ever hear from a central banker absolutely he elaborated i think we ve learned that this is something you can t identify directly i think we ve learned that it s lower than we thought substantially lower than we thought in the past powell s response was commendable perhaps even groundbreaking here was the fed chair challenging decades of conventional economic wisdom it was a welcome sign of a policymaker s willingness to question age old assumptions that have dictated policy and affected millions and it s not the only economic iron law that we need to revisit in the spirit of powell s act i d like to dig deeper into some assumptions that have defined economic policymaking these past few decades assumptions that have needlessly caused a lot of economic pain the natural rate of unemployment that aoc questioned is one such idea more on that below there are three others worth singling out that globalization is a win win proposition for all an idea that has deservedly taken a battering in recent years that federal budget deficits crowd out private investments and that the minimum wage will only have negative effects on jobs and workers economists and policymakers have gotten these ideas wrong for decades at great cost to the public especially hard hit have been the most economically vulnerable and these mistakes can certainly be blamed for the rise of inequality it s time we moved on from them 1 going below the natural rate of unemployment could spark an inflationary spiral the mandate of the federal reserve is to achieve maximum employment at stable prices it has interpreted the latter to mean an inflation rate of 2 percent for decades the fed has used the benchmark interest rate it controls to target that inflation rate and it s done so by trying to keep actual unemployment close to its estimate of what s called the natural rate of unemployment a rate below which it was believed inflation would spiral up the problem is that the core relationship behind this model the negative correlation between unemployment and inflation has been weakening for years and with it any ability to reliably estimate the natural unemployment rate moreover as powell acknowledged there s been an asymmetry because the estimates of the natural rate have been too high the fed has often intervened in the direction of raising or failing to cut interest rates the cost of this asymmetry has been steep since 2009 the average of the fed s natural rate estimate has been about 5 percent as powell stressed we can t accurately identify the natural rate of unemployment but suppose it s actually 3 5 percent targeting 5 percent unemployment when we could achieve 3 5 percent with little risk of spiraling inflation would mean 2 4 million people unnecessarily out of work even targeting the fed s current natural rate 4 2 percent would sacrifice a million potential workers to the altar of an empirically elusive concept and the unemployed are just one subgroup that gets hurt in such a scenario much research has shown that in slack labor markets middle and low wage earners lack the bargaining clout they have in tight labor markets as such they face lower pay fewer hours of work higher poverty and wider racial economic gaps by contrast high income households are little affected which means that labor market slack can deepen inequality the figure below from a recent paper by keith bentele and me shows the acceleration the difference between wage growth in strong versus weak labor markets for real annual earnings for low income workers we found earnings rose at about a 2 percent annual pace in hot labor markets and fell at about a 4 percent pace in cool ones the difference 6 percent is the first bar clearly the benefits of moving from slack to taut conditions are much more important for low than for high earning households such are the costs of over estimating the natural rate 2 everybody wins with globalization back in the 1990s when the clinton administration was trying to sell nafta the view that expanded trade was virtually all upside began to pervade the rhetoric and politics of both parties they were supported by economic arguments that exporting industries would expand into markets and add new jobs and consumers would have cheaper goods by dint of their superior productivity us manufacturers and their communities wouldn t be hurt any disruption to workers livelihoods was either dismissed as an impossibility or placed under the antiseptic rubric of transition costs this excerpt from the 1994 economic report of the president nicely captures the zeitgeist as economists have long predicted freer trade has been a win win strategy for both the united states and its trading partners allowing all to reap the benefits of enhanced specialization lower costs greater choice and an improved international climate for investment and innovation american industries both their workers and their owners have benefited from increased export markets and from cheaper imported inputs american consumers have been able to purchase a wider variety of products at lower prices than they could have without the expansion of trade when pressed as to how expanded trade could truly be win win advocates like clinton s economics team above cited the economic theory of comparative advantage when trading partners produce what they re best at producing both countries will come out ahead but the theory never said expanded trade would be win win for all instead it and its more contemporary extensions explicitly said that expanded trade generates winners and losers and that the latter would be our blue collar production workers exposed to international competition true the theory maintained correctly in my view that the benefits to the winners were large enough to offset the costs to the losers and still come out ahead but as trade between nations expanded policymakers quickly forgot about the need to compensate for the losses the era of free trade eventually led to large trade deficits with countries with comparatively productive factories to ours but with much lower wages most notably mexico and china as in every other advanced economy the share of us manufacturing employment had long been drifting down but the number of us factor jobs held pretty constant around 17 million until around 2000 when over the next decade almost 6 million such jobs were lost economists who ve studied the period now refer to it as the china shock once again these impacts didn t just translate into just job losses wages were hit too between the late 1940s and the late 1970s when production workers were relatively insulated from foreign competition blue collar manufacturing compensation more than doubled by contrast it s grown only 5 percent since then did the winners from trade the multinational corporations that relocated production the finance sector that made the deals the retailers that profited from the china price compensate the losers of course not they argued that everyday low prices were reward enough but not only did the winners fail to help the losers say through serious employment replacement programs robust safety net assistance direct job creation and investments to make our manufacturers more competitive they instead used their winnings to invest in politicians to cut their taxes and write ever more trade deals favoring investors over workers let me be very clear both the us and developing countries have significantly benefitted from global trade but because of the demonstrably false view that free trade is all upside win win considerable economic pain has been meted out pain that has not been met with anything approaching an adequate policy response 3 deep budget deficits will crowd out private investment for decades economists argued that when the federal government runs a budget deficit it pushes up interest rates and slows economic growth it s a theory known as crowd out suggesting government borrowing from a relatively fixed stock of loanable capital crowds out private borrowing which in turn raises the cost of capital i e the interest rate but this is yet another relationship that has failed to hold up though not before its adherents created considerable hardship both here and even more so in europe through austere budget policy in the wake of the great recession the belief in this idea prompted policymakers to reduce government spending to avoid alleged crowd out effects well before the private sector had recovered and could generate enough growth on its own there were certainly periods in the past when crowd out did indeed appear in the data the 1970s and early 1980s saw larger budget deficits i e more negative and higher interest rates but since then deficits have swung significantly up and down while interest rates have consistently drifted down most recently we ve been posting very large budget deficits given the state of the economy due to both deficit financed tax cuts and spending and interest rates are nonetheless hitting historic lows precisely the opposite of crowd out predictions this all sounds pretty abstract but it has stark implications on the ground based on the deeply embedded notion at the time that the deficits built up in the great recession needed to come down quickly the federal government pivoted to deficit reduction well before our private sector had recovered as a member of the obama economic team at the time i can confirm that crowd out fears were a motivation for the pivot according to this analysis by the brooking s institute between 2011 and 2014 fiscal policy cut about 1 percentage point per year from real gdp growth based on the historical correlation between growth and jobs this austerity added 2 points to the unemployment rate in those years or about 3 million jobs i tend not to give trump a lot of credit for economic policy and i believe his tax cut will exacerbate inequality and rob the treasury of needed revenue but the fiscal economics of trump s tax cuts are revealing in ways that relate both to crowd out and the natural rate of unemployment as noted deficits are up and interest rates are down meanwhile the positive fiscal boost has helped drive the unemployment rate down to 50 year lows while inflation remains low and stable these developments clearly undermine long held economic doctrines and they ve been a boon to working families that said a final point must be underscored the absence of crowd out doesn t mean deficits no longer matter even with low rates we ll still be devoting more tax revenue to financing our debt and even more worrisome is the fact that we re almost certain to enter the next recession with a debt to gdp ratio that s twice that of the historical norm this will likely lead congress to be more timid in fighting the next recession but this is a political constraint not an economic one 4 a higher minimum wage will only hurt workers another big mistake with lasting consequences has been the assumption that minimum wage increases will hurt their intended beneficiaries low wage workers the theory is that free markets set an equilibrium wage that perfectly matches supply and demand given employers needs and workers capabilities force that equilibrium wage up and rampant unemployment will result when i was coming up in the profession our textbooks argued that believing minimum wages could help low wage workers was akin to believing that water flowed uphill their message was particularly comforting to conservative politicians who wanted to protect the profits of employers of low wage workers today decades of high quality research much of it initiated by the late great economist alan krueger have introduced a much more nuanced view about the true impacts of minimum wage hikes but years of economists opposition to the policy have left us with a national minimum wage of 7 25 per hour a level far too low to support the many families that depend on the minimum wage another myth was that only teenagers earned the minimum david cooper s work shows the main beneficiaries of higher minimum wages are working adults how the consensus began to change is instructive to their credit some state policymakers decided to ignore the economists and raise minimum wages in their states this provided researchers like krueger with quasi natural experiments of a type too rare in economics the positive results of these studies led many more states and cities to raise their wage floors 29 states plus dc now have minimums above the federal level and this fed back into the experimental research creating a powerful loop summarizing a large and still contentious body of research a fair conclusion is that conditional on their magnitude minimum wage increases accomplish their goal of raising pay for low wage workers without large job loss effects but the broader point is that an economic relationship believed to be steadfast was tested and was found wanting the changing consensus can be seen in a new report from the congressional budget office a bastion of mainstream economics that found an increase in the minimum wage to 15 phased in by 2025 would benefit 27 3 million workers with an average gain of 1 500 per year reduce the number of the poor by 1 3 million but also cut employment of affected workers by 1 3 million yes some would lose jobs but so many more would benefit hardly the everybody loses prediction that prevailed among economists for decades what all these economic mistakes have in common pegging the natural rate too high ignoring the harm from exposure to international competition austere budget policy low and stagnant minimum wages all of these misunderstood economic relationships have one thing in common in every case the costs fall on the vulnerable people who depend on full employment to get ahead blue collar production workers and communities built around factories families who suffer from austerity induced weak recoveries and under funded safety nets and who depend on a living wage to make ends meet these groups are the casualties of faulty economics in contrast the benefits in every case accrue to the wealthy highly educated workers largely insulated from slack labor markets executives of outsourcing corporations the beneficiaries of revenue losing tax cuts that allegedly require austere budgets and employers of low wage workers in this regard there is a clear connection between each one of these mistakes and the rise of economic inequality i cannot overemphasize the importance of recognizing who benefits and who loses from these economic mistakes because that difference is why these mistakes persist every one of the wrong assumptions described here benefits conservative causes from reducing the bargaining clout of wage earners to strengthening the hand of outsourcers and offshorers to lowering the labor costs of low wage employers these economic assumptions are thus complementary to the conservative agenda and that in and of themselves makes them far more enduring than they should be based on the facts it is no coincidence that the assumptions are being so rigorously questioned by a new group of highly progressive politicians like rep ocasio cortez they are making the critical connections in our political economy to challenge old assumptions that have hurt working people for too long the vast majority of us will be better off for their work jared bernstein is a senior fellow at the center on budget and policy priorities and was the chief economic adviser to vice president joe biden from 2009 to 2011
us equities rebounded after new york federal reserve fed president john williams said that central bankers should act quickly to lower interest rates at the first sign of economic distress although a 25 basis point rate cut would perhaps do as a preventive measure to support the economy equity investors thought otherwise the us 10 year yield eased to 2 02 the probability of a 50 basis point cut in

growing tensions in the straits of hormuz after the us downed an iranian drone the ftse is expected to open 32 point higher at 7530p in london dovish fed remarks are priced in with greatest enthusiasm investors are highly sensitive to dovish comments from fed presidents these days as they are trying to figure out whether the fed would lower its interest rates by 50 basis points by the end of this month instead of 25 basis points fully priced in given that a 50 basis point cut would trigger a further rally in global equities any remark of dovish nature translates immediately into higher asset prices as mentioned earlier the probability of a 50 basis point cut advanced 40 according to the activity in us treasury markets this probability stood near 25 a week earlier hence if the market goes down this road the fed may have to follow to avoid an unnecessary tumble across the us and global equities as a result there is room for a further advance in the equity space and the us dollar and us

explains the process for issuance of a sovereign bond notable transactions and regulatory changes that may affect certain aspects of the sovereign bond market in the coming year for additional information see sovereign entities practice guide and debt capital markets in international jurisdictions in order to finance their budgets raise funds for infrastructure projects or otherwise raise needed resources beyond tax revenues governments throughout the world turn to the local and international capital markets the sovereign bond market for both local currency and foreign currency denominated instruments includes both traditional stable issuers with investment grade ratings and more volatile emerging markets issuers sovereign issuers are typically active in the beginning of the calendar year as finance ministries begin to address their funding needs thereafter sovereigns usually analyze market conditions throughout the year to identify the optimal time for issuance based on trends in the yield curve for u s treasury bonds u s treasuries as well as trends in the sovereign s yield curve against u s treasuries or other benchmark securities notable transactions bond yields became volatile at times throughout 2018 with bond yields increasing from previous historical lows as central banks increased interest rates and ended stimulus programs a sell off in emerging market debt also held issuances for part of 2018 to their lowest level in years late in the year and into the first half of 2019 as expectations for lower growth globally began to materialize the federal reserve expressed a marked shift in its plans to increase interest rates which similarly also caused the european central bank to restart its stimulus program from the financial crisis and for a number of other governments central banks to lower their own interest rates this in part lead investors into the bond market and contributed again to lower bond yields by march 2019 there were reports of global debt yielding less than 0 approaching 10 trillion sovereigns have continued to access the markets carefully according to developments in their local economies including volatile oil prices for oil producing nations and with an eye to internal political developments and in some cases expanding anti corruption scandals a further trend that began with peru s issuance of 3 08 billion euroclearable sol denominated notes in 2017 was an increase in the international issuance of domestic debt in a euroclearable instrument typically in a rule 144a regulation s transaction and with the underlying goal to develop local markets and protect against exchange rate risks issues consummated under this trend include chile s approximately ps 104 trillion of bonds issued in july 2018 and panama s 1 billion issuance of its notas del tesoro issued in april 2019 2018 saw a continued interest in green bond and other thematic bond issuances by sovereigns with notable transactions including indonesia s issuance in february 2018 of its 1 25 billion green bonds the first green bond sovereign issue from asia and belgium s 4 5 billion green bond issuance also in february of 2018 the second largest ever sovereign green bond issuance on october 2018 the republic of seychelles issued 15 million of the first ever blue bonds meant to finance marine and ocean based projects by creating a blue grants fund and a blue investment fund focused on supporting sustainable marine and fisheries projects although green bond issuances and other thematic bonds currently comprise only a small portion of the market this trend bears watching as projects funded by these bonds diversify in order to meet commitments to cut emissions targets under the paris accord and to fund marine and ocean based projects to combat climate change effects in addition certain other sovereigns returned to the markets due to different circumstances qatar returned to the market for the first time since 2016 with a 12 billion offering in april 2018 with reported investor interest of 53 billion greece also returned to the bond market with a 2 5 billion issuance in january 2019 after having completed its bailout program in august of 2018 with reported demand of over 10 billion while sovereigns have less frequently issued floating debt based on london interbank offered rate libor with the impending end of libor set to occur by 2021 some sovereigns are likely to include them in their liability management programs in the coming years in order to lessen exposure and unpredictability and also because amendment of bond terms may be hampered by the diffuse nature of ownership of the instruments deal structure and process deal process a sovereign bond offering is typically commenced by the sovereign seeking proposals for an offering in some cases public bidding laws of the issuer require that the sovereign undertake a full procurement process to select underwriters in others a more informal process based on the issuer s prior relationships and desire to retain a wide list of market makers and create competition among them will result in a selection process with a rotating group of lead banks the principal global investment banks typically act as lead underwriters on transactions throughout the world with regional underwriters taking roles as part of the underwriting syndicate in the regions in which they are more prominently known international counsel i e new york or uk counsel depending on whether the bonds are to be issued pursuant to new york law or uk law and whether the bonds are registered with the securities and exchange commission sec may also be selected pursuant to such rules either on an issue by issue basis or for a multiyear period underwriters generally also retain local counsel i e of the country issuing the bonds with the sovereign issuers either using in house counsel typically from the sovereign s finance ministry or office of the attorney general or both inhouse and external counsel any requirement or preference for a selection process for advisors is likely to add significant additional time for completion of a transaction as discussed below time line once the sovereign selects financial and legal advisors the parties will hold the kickoff for the offering for seasoned repeat issuers with an effective shelf registration statement already on file with the sec and updated public disclosure including an annual report on form 18 k a transaction may be effected in a matter of days for additional information on shelf registration statements see shelf registration top 10 practice tips shelf registration statements and takedowns and market trends 2017 18 shelf registrations and takedowns for sovereign issuers who access the market more intermittently and whose disclosures may not be updated as frequently a time line of six to eight weeks is more common longer if the debt securities will be registered with the sec in circumstances where a new registration statement is required and sec staff review is possible for additional information on sec review see understanding the sec review process and top 10 practice tips responding to sec comment letters for inaugural issuers a transaction may also include a road show for targeted investors in financial centers or in cities with a concentration of institutional investors in the united states europe and asia which may add an additional week or more to the execution time line for additional information on road shows see preparing for a road show and pre road show checklist due diligence for first time or very infrequent issuers a due diligence trip to the country of the sovereign issuer may be scheduled to visit with officials from the principal governmental ministries of the issuer ministry of finance central bank ministry of foreign affairs ministry of commerce and trade and office of attorney general to conduct a review of the issuer s economic and political condition for repeat issuers such due diligence is most often held telephonically with a smaller set of governmental officials narrowed to ministry of finance and central bank since legal compliance due diligence with respect to sanctions anti money laundering and combating terrorism financing has become more prevalent a separate diligence call is typically undertaken requiring additional coordination with individuals in the central bank or ministry of finance who deal with compliance in this area on a day today basis these individuals typically differ from the economic and political governmental officials for more information see ofac due diligence in securities offerings ofac compliance in a securities offering checklist and money laundering laws compliance representation and warranty deal structure global sovereign bond transactions are typically offered either publicly pursuant to a sec registration or privately on a rule 144a regulation s basis to institutional investors in the united states and offshore the issuer will enter into an underwriting agreement with underwriters for sec registered offerings or a purchase agreement with initial purchasers for rule 144a regulation s offerings for repeat issuers standard documentation will typically be used and will be subject to modification only to reflect changes in law and regulation or to address particular aspects of an offering for additional information on sec registered offerings see registered offerings applicable laws rules and regulations initial public offerings resource kit and follow on offerings resource kit for additional information on rule 144a regulation s offerings and forms used in these transactions see rule 144a regulation s offerings resource kit rule 144a and regulation s requirements indenture rule 144a and or regulation s debt offering and purchase agreement rule 144a and or regulation s debt offering starting in 2014 with the adoption of international capital market association icma recommended aggregated collective action clauses cacs most sovereign issuers have opted to issue using a new york or english law indenture rather than the historical fiscal agency agreement proposed as a result of the legal and procedural stalemates occasioned by the greek and argentine restructurings these clauses permit voting on fundamental amendments to the terms of affected debt securities on an aggregated basis among different series of bonds in a manner similar to the requirements of chapter 11 under the u s bankruptcy code cacs are intended to make it harder for a holdout creditor to frustrate an agreed resolution for a debt restructuring by acquiring a veto position in a single series of debt securities and voting those securities against a global restructuring by using a trustee structure in which the trustee has fiduciary rights on behalf of the noteholders as a whole and is authorized to act with exclusive authority upon the instruction of a majority of noteholders the icma form trust indenture seeks to make it more difficult for minority vulture noteholders to pursue remedies at odds with the majority of creditors deal terms transaction terms for sovereign bond offerings are comparatively standardized under either new york or english law both as among various issuers and as among an issuer s outstanding series of bonds this structure helps issuers to go to market quickly and investors to make investment decisions based on their view of the particular sovereign s credit characteristics and outlook and not on any particular or unique provisions in the transaction terms of a particular bond series covenants and events of default are minimal with a negative pledge on other external public indebtedness being the sole negative covenant and events of default typically limited to payment and nonpayment defaults cross acceleration or payment default on other external debt of the issuer unsatisfied judgments illegality or repudiation for investment grade sovereign issuers issuer call provisions at a make whole premium against u s treasuries for the majority of the outstanding tenor reduced to par as the debt securities near maturity have become another standard feature of sovereign bond issuances other changes in standard documentation include the january 1 2016 adoption of provisions addressing the eu bail in regulation for underwriters subject to eu regulation and starting in january 1 2019 the adoption of provisions addressing the qualified financial contracts rules for u s globally systemically important banking organizations despite not being in effect for sovereign counterparties until january 1 2020 sovereign bond offerings will typically be listed and eligible for trading on a non u s stock exchange often either the luxembourg stock exchange or the irish stock exchange due in part to those exchanges offering exchange regulated markets outside the scope of certain eu regulations disclosure trends the prospectus offering circular used for the issuance and sale of the securities will include political economic and financial information covering the sovereign issuer consistent with the requirements of schedule b under the u s securities act of 1933 as amended the securities act which sets forth the minimum requirements to be included in a registration statement filed by foreign governments seeking to register debt securities for sale in the united states form 18 k under the rules of the u s securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the exchange act and the rules of the stock exchange upon which the bonds are to be listed compared to the detailed technical requirements of the u s securities laws covering private issuers included in sec regulations such as regulation s k or regulation s x the express requirements under schedule b and form 18 k are minimal however market practice and other applicable legal provisions such as section 17 a 15 u s c 77q of the securities act and rule 10b 5 17 c f r 240 10b 5 under the exchange act have the practical effect of standardizing disclosures and inducing sovereigns to include in their disclosure important legal and political developments in their countries along with macroeconomic information concerning their budgets gdp balance of payment and foreign trade information international reserve levels and outstanding debt if a sovereign issuer s economy or budget is particularly dependent on a commodity such as oil or minerals or on remittance flows from expatriates additional detailed disclosures may be included this information almost always prepared and reported using international monetary fund approved methodology substitutes for the audited financial statements of private companies required under the u s or eu securities laws and regulations for seasoned issuers with shelf registration statements filed with the sec and filing annual reports on form 18 k the sec will typically review a sovereign s annual report and or schedule b registration statement once every three to five years with such review often tied to the filing of a new schedule b shelf registration statement sovereigns considering a need to file a new registration statement to register additional debt securities should plan such filing in advance to take into consideration the likelihood of sec review and potential delay in the declaration of effectiveness of the new registration statement for further information see schedule b foreign sovereign debt offerings legal and regulatory trends in 2018 there were few new legal or regulatory developments in the united states directly applicable to sovereign bond issuers although market practice saw continued heightened attention to diligence questions and representations concerning economic sanctions terrorism financing and corruption while not specific to sovereigns one recent change that may affect sovereign issuers that list their securities on european stock exchanges is a new requirement under the markets in financial instruments directive mifid ii relating to trade reporting requirements that became effective on january 3 2018 under the mifid ii investment firms must report information on trade details parties and financial instruments one such piece of information is the legal entity identifier lei the lei is a 20 digit alphanumeric code developed by the international organization for standardization to allow a unique identification of legal entities sovereigns are not exempted from the requirement and must obtain an lei in order for their securities to continue to be traded in eu markets while the european securities and markets authority had issued temporary measures to ease the transition by allowing trading venues to report their lei codes instead of the lei codes of non eu issuers that did not then have their own lei code such temporary measures expired on july 2018 for a discussion of these regulations in another context see reverse yankee bonds and the new eu market abuse regime market outlook sovereign issuers are typically active in the beginning of the calendar year as finance ministries begin to address their funding needs and 2019 has been no exception while the sovereign bond market continues to see substantial demand in 2019 with the increasing volatility and expected decrease in economic activity one can anticipate that market participants will study the direction of the market in determining timing of issuances and effects on the overall market expectations concerning actions by the federal reserve in adjustments to the fed funds rate are also likely to determine the timing and depth of issuances for the remainder of the year originally published by lexis practice advisor the

by dagny taggart we are living in precarious times and if you haven t prepared for an economic collapse yet it is time to start taking action despite what some experts would like you to believe the us is on shaky financial ground several indicators suggest things are far worse than many think let s take a look at them now more than half of families in the us live in asset poverty a recent study found that more than 63 percent of american children and 55 percent of americans live in asset poverty this means they have few or no assets to rely on in the event of a financial emergencysuch as a job loss a medical crisis recessions or natural disasters in a press release study co author david rothwell an assistant professor in osu s college of public health and human sciences explained that when families lack assets such as vehicles homes savings accounts or investments surviving a financial crisis is very difficult this is a dimension of financial security that we don t think about that much and it s pretty high the findings highlight the extent of financial insecurity among american families these shocks ripple through the family and down to the children rothwell said the study was published in the journal children and youth services review earlier this year co authors are timothy ottusch of the university of arizona and jennifer finders of purdue university living in poverty can have devastating impacts on children as the press release explains rothwell studies poverty and its impact on families and children experiencing poverty in childhood can have lifetime impacts for those children past research has shown that children who grow up in poverty are more likely to struggle in school have lower job earnings throughout life and experience family instability as adults a growing body of research suggests that parents asset levels also predict academic achievement educational expectations and the likelihood of college enrollment and graduation families with assets that can be used when income is disrupted are also likely to experience less financial stress and strain yet asset poverty is higher than income poverty for children and families in a 2018 study of canadian families researchers including rothwell found that asset poverty was two to three times more prevalent than income poverty families can have adequate day to day funds but be asset poor and would likely struggle during a financial shock source rent is becoming unaffordable for many americans according to the national low income housing coalition renting is becoming increasingly unaffordable for many americans in its latest out of reach report the organization explains that the struggle to find affordable housing is not limited to those earning minimum wage or the unemployed the report s central statistic is the housing wage which is an estimate of the hourly wage a full time worker must earn to rent a home without spending more than 30 percent of income on housing costs for 2019 the housing wage is 22 96 and 18 65 for a modest two and one bedroom apartment respectively based on the fair market rent the average renter s hourly wage is 1 08 less than the housing wage for a one bedroom rental and 5 39 less than a two bedroom rental that means that an average renter in the u s has to work a 52 hour week to put this in perspective a median wage worker in eight of the country s largest ten occupations does not earn enough to afford a one bedroom apartment an employee earning the federal minimum wage 7 25 per hour would have to work 127 hours every week equivalent to more than two full time jobs to afford a two bedroom apartment this is not just a regional issue there isn t a single state metro area or county in the u s where a full time employee earning the minimum wage can afford to rent a two bedroom property to explore data for your area enter your zip code in the box below the map on this page out of reach 2019 according to the report the ten jobs that are expected to see the biggest growth over the coming decade are those that pay less than the wage needed to afford housing and that is likely to result in an even greater disparity between wages and housing costs by 2026 as this infographic from statista illustrates food is about to become more expensive massive damaging floods in the midwest have been occurring since this past march to make a bad situation worse the potential for more floods in key agricultural states looms in front of us as more rain is predicted for the rest of this spring so far heavy flooding has impacted important agricultural states including nebraska iowa illinois and missouri the economic impacts of the flooding are likely to be devastating as cat ellis explained in midwest flooding will cause shortages of these foods bottom line our modern food supply is largely dependent upon grains and soy with major producers losing at least one harvest this year the cost of manufactured food and livestock feed will skyrocket meat and dairy will be doubly impacted while many farms lost animals to floodwaters and farmers lost money due to both lost animals and damage to property the cost to feed those remaining animals is going to go through the roof add to this livestock disease and tariffs and trade war with both mexico and china the two countries from whom we import the most food both consumers and farmers are in deep financial trouble whatever your situation is start thinking about what you eat and how to store those items ellis wrote here s how to get started building that stockpile americans are losing purchasing power purchasing power is the value of a currency expressed in terms of the amount of goods or services that one unit of money can buy in other words it is how much your money buys you purchasing power is important because all else being equal inflation decreases the amount of goods or services you are able to purchase inflation reduces the value of a currency s purchasing power in the article america s concealed crisis fifty years of economic decline 1969 to 2019 charles hugh smith explains how the loss of purchasing power has pushed the middle class into the working class the keys to understanding the concealed crisis of decline are purchasing power relative to wages earnings how many goods and services can wages buy for the average american household wages have risen modestly while the purchasing power of those wages has plummeted furthermore the quality of goods and services has in many cases declined sharply so that even if prices have dropped what you get for your money has fallen even further effectively reducing the purchasing power of your wages source smith also discusses how planned obsolescence impacts purchasing power case in point appliances were once designed and built to last a generation or longer refrigerators washers and dryers lasted for decades now the average appliance fails within a few years and the electronic board costing roughly a third of the entire appliance price fails and must be replaced with labor the cost of the repair is so high consumers often send the almost new appliance to the landfill and buy a new and soon to fail appliance net net low quality reduces purchasing power even if price has declined source although our income is higher than it was 40 years ago we can t buy much with it smith says bottom line how much housing higher education and well being does the average wage buy now compared to decades past not much the statistics are bleak wages are basically unchanged from the high water mark 50 years ago which coincidentally was also the high water mark of u s energy production until very recently adjusted for purchasing power and quality the average paycheck buys far less than it did 50 years ago source evidence that the economy has already entered a downturn is mounting a few days ago michael snyder summed up some of the signs the us economy is starting to deteriorate rapidly in the article the pain of this new economic downturn is starting to show up all over the country on tuesday we got some more new numbers and they were just as bad as we thought they might be but even before today s numbers all of the data were telling us the exact same thing the new york fed s empire state manufacturing index just suffered the worst one month decline in u s history morgan stanley s business conditions index just suffered the largest one month decline that we have ever seen global trade numbers are the worst they have been since the last recession and just last week i detailed the complete and utter bloodbath that we are witnessing in the u s trucking industry right now so considering what we already knew it shouldn t have been a surprise that new home sales in the u s were down a whopping 7 8 percent during the month of may source in addition an economic indicator that has preceded every recession over the past five decades occurred a few days ago reports npr it is known among economists and wall street traders as a yield curve inversion and it refers to when long term interest rates are paying out less than short term rates that curve has been flattening out and sloping down for more than a year raising worries among some analysts that investors long term view of the market is not positive and that an economic downturn is looming but on sunday an inauspicious milestone was achieved the yield curve remained inverted for three months or an entire quarter which has for half a century been a clear signal that the economy is heading for recession in the next nine to 18 months according to campbell harvey a duke university finance professor who spoke to npr on sunday his research in the mid 1980s first linked yield curve inversions to recessions that has been associated with predicting a recession for the last seven recessions harvey said from the 1960s this indicator has been reliable in terms of foretelling a recession and also importantly it has not given any false signals yet source the economy has not recovered much since the 2008 recession many refer to stock market valuation and the official unemployment rate as indicators of an improving economy but the truth is that they paint a deceiving picture of the true state of the american economy as economist antony p mueller outlines in phony economic growth stats conceal deep problems on main street alternative calculations of the employment data which include long term discouraged workers and chronically unemployed indicate that the labor market is much slacker than the official statistics indicate profits recovered in the first few years after the crisis of 2008 but over the past five years they have been flat stock prices in turn as measured by the s p 500 index have risen by over 50 percent since 2012 the recovery after the crisis of 2008 was brought about by the stimulus packages and later on by the monetary policy of quantitative easing the expansion that followed does not constitute genuine economic growth while the financial asset markets indicate wealth creation the economy s productive capacity tends to remain weak over the past ten years the congressional budget office had to lower its estimate of potential output year by year and productivity growth has stayed below the trend of the time before the crisis of 2008 source in the conclusion of that piece dr mueller states policymakers ignore the main lesson of the crisis of 2008 that monetary and fiscal stimulus policies do not bring about a solid recovery but manufacture a phony economic growth that distorts the economy s structure of production instead of a v shaped recovery that would occur if government abstained from intervention policymakers produce an l shaped agony as if a prolonged stagnation wasn t already bad enough the interventionists also act as the undertakers of capitalism policy intervention distorts the economy and drives a wedge between wall street and main street the majority of the people do not attribute the discrepancy between the growth of financial wealth and the stagnation of the real economy to the policy of the authorities but accuses capitalism of this evil source here s what you can do to prepare for a financial crisis if you are skeptical about the warning signs of the impending economic disaster that i have outlined in this brief article here s a great resource to refer to as you monitor current events 10 recession warning signs you need to know as much as one would like to believe that the american economy has bucked the cycle of boom and bust that has defined every market economy since the dawn of time that s probably not the case in spite of a booming stock market and rock bottom unemployment history would dictate that the good times will be coming to an end probably sooner rather than later writer joel anderson warns in the article he describes economic behaviors that point to the possibility of a looming recession here is a list of resources to help you prepare while the fate of the us economy is out of our hands there are things we can do to prepare for an economic downturn and eventual crash the preparation is completely in our hands those who choose not to prepare are going to be in for a very hard time what do you think do you think an economic

by today is cuban workers day a cuban friend told me in late june beaming at the news that all employees of the island s budgeted state sector would receive significant salary rises commencing from 1 july 2019 cuba s budgeted sector incorporates organisations and entities which operate with a state budget and mostly provide services free to the population without returning revenue to the state this includes public health education culture and sport public administration community services housing and defence every one of the 1 470 736 workers in this sector will receive the pay rise at a cost to the cuban state of over seven billion cuban pesos annually simultaneously 1 281 523 pensions will rise costing an additional 838 million pesos a year and taking the number of direct beneficiaries to over 2 75 million cubans announcing the salary rise and outlining a set of economic reforms to follow cuban president miguel díaz canel and other government ministers have framed the measures in relation to several factors first aggressive steps by the us trump administration to strangle the cuban economy by strengthening the us blockade particularly through the spring 2019 implementation of title iii of the helms burton act under which us citizens can sue cuban and foreign interests who traffic engage in any way in properties they or their predecessors owned prior to the nationalisations carried out by cuba s revolutionary government from 1960 second determination not to return to the hardships suffered by the cuban population during special period of economic crisis in the 1990s díaz canel referred to creative measures taken in that period which are currently under study third the demand from cubans and their organisations for a pay rise communicated directly to the president and ministers during their regular tours of cuban provinces in recent congresses of the cuban workers confederation ctc and the national association of cuban economists anec as well as during public debates over the new constitution approved in february 2019 fourth the measure acknowledges the loyalty and commitment of workers who have stayed in state employment often in the lowest paid jobs defending the conquests of cuba s socialist revolution in health education culture sport and community and social welfare providing essential services for all cubans finally the salary rise is a step towards a broader economic restructuring comprising changes to the way salaries and prices are set more flexibility introduced into the planning process with greater initial input from workers the elimination of the dual currency more cooperation between state enterprises and non state entities and foreign investors and greater financial autonomy for state enterprises these measures aim to boost national production and improve cuba s balance of payments so to withstand the onslaught of us imperialism by advancing the national development plan through to 2030 having announced the pay rise on 27 june in pinar del rio díaz canel participated in a two hour live broadcast of the daily current affairs programme the mesa redonda round table on 2 july explaining the measures with the minister of the economy and planning the minister of work and social security and the minister of finance and prices the following day a second mesa redonda with the same participants largely answered the public s queries and concerns cuba s state sector employs over 3 million workers compared to some 1 4 million in the non state sector which consists of cooperatives private farmers usufruct farmers who use state land under rent free loan the self employed and small businesses of the state sector workforce 52 or 1 6 million workers are in the enterprise sector consisting of productive and commercial entities which sell trade and receive revenues since 2014 many workers in the enterprise sector benefited from incentives to increase production linking pay to performance removing salary caps and providing payment in hard currency cuban convertible peso are received by 60 of workers in the sector the new salary rise does not apply to them but to the 48 of state sector workers in the budgeted sector some groups of workers in the latter including healthcare workers received a pay rise in recent years but others including the education sector were left behind workers in the political organisations of people s power and a group in public administration had not received a pay rise since 2005 the new salary scale both raises the incomes of the lowest earners the minimum monthly salary rises from 225 pesos to 400 up from 125 in 2005 and expands the wage differential between these and the highest earners from between 2 9 to 7 5 times this aims to reverse the pyramid so jobs of greater complexity and responsibility requiring higher qualifications receive substantially higher remuneration serving as an incentive to work towards leadership positions the average monthly salary in the budgeted sector has risen from 634 pesos in june to 1065 pesos in july above the 2018 average salary in state enterprises which was 871 pesos up from 600 in 2014 salaries in the budgeted sector are capped at 3 000 pesos only those earning over 2 500 pay individual income tax all employees will now pay towards social security 2 5 for those earning less than 500 pesos and 5 for those above social security payments including some pensions were last raised in november 2018 pensions were raised again to a minimum of 280 pesos and all those with pensions under 500 pesos see incomes rise challenges avoiding inflation and increase national production while celebrated the salary rise provokes two issues of immediate concern the danger of inflation rising prices and the need to meet the additional costs to the state without exceeding the previously planned deficit spending above revenue inflation will undermine the positive effect of the pay rise increased purchasing power to the detriment of all cubans not just the beneficiaries in a market economy inflation is caused by increasing the supply of money without a concomitant increase in the value of the goods and services produced economy minister alejandro gil explained that in cuba s planned economy the salary rise should not cause inflation because a the budgeted sector provides free goods and services so increased salaries cannot push up non existent sale prices b most retail trade is under state control and subject to administrative controls that is fixed or capped prices c the state is not raising wholesale or retail prices taxes or other payments consequently said gil the non state sector had no excuse for raising prices prices in all sectors will be closely monitored and the public was urged to report irresponsible and opportunistic price raises to authorities to prevent abuses and speculation with inflation repressed the danger is that as beneficiaries buy more they will quickly exhaust the retails goods currently available generating scarcity already in may 2019 some new limits were introduced for basic foodstuffs purchases following scarcities blamed on the tightening us blockade to prevent either inflation or scarcity the cuban economy must expand the supply of goods and services to the population minister gil revealed plans to develop new and diverse services like national tourism which had grown 13 since the start of the year eating out and communications including internet access and phone credit although currently excluded from the salary rise workers in the state enterprise sector can increase their incomes said gil by producing more but not by charging more local development will be fostered on the basis of local resources to meet demand without increasing imports which bleeds much needed hard currency other measures are being designed to retain the hard currency which cubans receive as pay or remittances and which is often leaves the country for example when individuals travel abroad to purchase goods to bring back to cuba instead of prohibiting this the economy will be directed to meet the demand for such goods and services domestically new financial services products are being created to encourage savings the cost of the salary and pension rise for one year is greater than the 6 4 billion pesos social security budget for 2019 and the planned budget deficit at 6 1 billion pesos how can the state cover the additional cost without increasing the deficit the ministers talked in general terms about re directing investment funds from unimplemented projects and said planned budgets to all entities will be reduced by some 10 obliging them to prioritise their spending meanwhile all social programmes will be preserved some cubans immediately responded to the news by seeking re employment in the state sector but ministers warned against a return to inflated state sector payrolls stating that only essential workers should be recruited broader economic reforms the broader economic strategy seeks to strengthen national production and state enterprises the diversity and quantity of exports import substitution productive linkages self sufficiency in the municipalities local development projects investments retail trade circulation agricultural production food sovereignty and implementation of the housing policy diaz canel talked about overcoming the obstacles and bureaucracy which cubans refer to as the internal blockade and breaking the pattern of relying on imports cuba s principal imports are food and fuels which drain billions in hard currency a critical solution is to increase agricultural production and use of renewable energies moving cuba towards food and fuel sovereignty is a political necessity given the aggressive extraterritorial imposition of the us blockade gil said that the new measures aimed to break the pattern of turning to imports to foster our national industry nothing should be imported that could be produced domestically cuban workers had long complained about this he said to achieve this state enterprises will be given more independence in planning financing investment collaboration and incentives for workers in turn they must eliminate budget deficits and stop using budgets without proper cost assessments the ministers talked about replacing administrative controls with financial and economic mechanisms that is increasing individual material incentives for workers to expand domestic production exports and import substitution essential both to save hard currency and balance the books where surpluses rise bonuses can take workers pay up to five times the average salary currently capped at three times these measures mean a shift from rigid planning which discourages innovations outside the plan anything that increases efficiency must be evaluated for incorporation into the plan said gil decentralising the plan implies decentralising access to resources and so increased autonomy for state enterprises state enterprises whose exports exceed the plan will retain all or part of the extra hard currency earnings after meeting obligations to the state and can use those funds for essential imports or to pay other national producers similarly non exporting state enterprises can retain surplus revenues after payments due to the central fund and decide how to invest those including in projects with domestic non state enterprises and foreign companies restrictions on relations between these entities will be removed cuban enterprises which supply domestic products and services to foreign businesses operating in the mariel special development zone will be permitted to retain 50 of their profits state enterprises will be allowed to sell excess production over their plan in the domestic market non state enterprises may be facilitated to export through arrangements with state entities the aim is to keep hard currency in the country and foster productive chains in the domestic economy other incentives will foster municipal self sufficiency and increased agricultural productivity finatur an existing financial institution in the tourism sector will provide investment credit directly to enterprises outside allocations from the central fund to reduce delays and bureaucracy in funding investments accordingly enterprises will be responsible for paying off their own debt to finatur given us persecution of cuba s use of the us dollar the utility of adopting a crypto currency for commercial transactions is also being evaluated to prevent the ongoing theft of fuel gps will be placed on fuel transporters and the use of digital cards for the purchase of fuels extended the national assembly will discuss the proposed reforms in late july díaz canel recognised the risks and the importance of the population s support in the most difficult times fidel and raul always went to the people this was the essence of the revolution he said as the people were the source of wisdom and creation helen yaffe is a lecturer in economic and social history at the university of glasgow specialising in

tegucigalpa honduras mintpress news went to honduras and spoke with a number of leaders of the honduran resistance amid a 66 day uprising over a neoliberal austerity deal reached between the government as the country marked the 10 year anniversary of the u s backed coup d etat last thursday the honduran government passed a privatization law the run up to which had triggered uprisings challenging the mandate of president juan orlando hernandez and protesting the implementation of a privatization deal reached with the international monetary fund imf a deal kept secret until this week the battle against it was fought tooth and nail with average hondurans following the lead of healthcare and education activists mintpress has obtained a copy of the law the document details the government s plan to sever 6 billion lempiras 242 million usd and includes instituting a maximum wage on public sector contract technical and professional workers amounting to 2 426 a month but promises not to cut healthcare and education an agreement with the im f over the state run electrical company remains in question what is known is that the deal consists of more of the same neoliberal remedies that have already devastated honduran civil society one person interviewed by mintpress called the approach neoliberalism on steroids and she would know her husband is a political prisoner sitting in a u s designed maximum security facility the prison was paid for under the honduran security tax a program backed by former secretary of state hillary clinton that bankrolls the military and police while the rest of the government is gutted adrienne pine a professor of anthropology at american university in washington and expert on honduras told mintpress the fact that education and healthcare were left out is a pretty big win for the movement because that is what they were planning to cut and the healthcare and education workers who have led this struggle against this have prevented those cuts even though there has been this very radical reduction in public spending on may 6 the imf announced it had reached a staff level agreement that was believed to be targeted towards healthcare education and more that same day protests started breaking out but as news emerged on tuesday of the deal becoming law the imf also announced its approval of a plan to restructure the public electric company and said it would give the honduran government 311 million in loans over the next two years around the same time a fresh corruption scandal was unfolding at the electric company professor pine explained to mintpress enee has already been subject to privatization measures over the past few years that have significantly weakened it problems in the enee have to do at their root with the privatization itself but right now it looks like the imf and the u s are justifying the privatization by using examples of corruption at the agency rather than addressing the underlying structural issues the resistance in honduras fought off further privatization of health care and education in a struggle that left piles of students shot and scores of people killed as well as resulting in the political imprisonment of a young man who is accused of fueling a fire at the u s embassy in the capital romel valdemar herrera portillo 23 sits in a military run prison designed by the united states called la tova alongside political prisoners edwin espinal and raúl álvarez in this article mintpress will feature exclusive interviews not just with leaders of the honduran resistance but also with people who have been directly affected by the coup and all that it has brought ten years of resistance the history of the past decade in honduras is among the most telling examples of u s backed regime change in the western hemisphere a powder keg for the migrant crisis that popped up under barack obama and worsened under donald trump the military operation that deposed leftist reformer manuel zelaya from the presidency informs honduran life at every level today mintpress news traveled to honduras around the 10 year anniversary of the coup d etat speaking to a range of leaders of the resistance against the national party which has dominated politics in the country since the coup the national party is led by president juan orlando hernandez joh a widely reviled neoliberal leader believed to be involved in drug trafficking electoral fraud and death squads the post coup neoliberal policies ramped up under joh s reign have rendered honduras a playground for the business elite and drug cartels and brought the poverty rate to levels unrivaled in the region disappearances and lethal violence from police private mercenaries and drug cartels have also skyrocketed revelations that joh has been under investigation by the drug enforcement administration dea since 2013 according to u s federal court documents released this year came as little surprise to many in the resistance joh s brother is himself in prison in the u s on drug trafficking charges but it did pour salt on fresh wounds as the united states backed joh s re election in 2017 even though the honduran constitution explicitly forbids second terms while in honduras mintpress examined the effects of the coup from multiple angles including cuts to education repression against students and teachers cuts to the healthcare sector the political development of hondurans electoral fraud death squads linked to big business the conditions of political prisoners and the plight of human rights workers and the effects of neoliberalism on the healthcare sector mintpress also looked at the role of creative culture in the resistance as mintpress previously reported staff journalist alex rubinstein was detained immediately upon landing in the capital tegucigalpa it was a testament to the government s unease around the anniversary of the coup and in the face of more than 50 days of active uprising i was just let out of detainment at the airport in the capital of honduras they didn t explain why the detained me just asked a bunch of questions stay tuned to mintpressnews as we approach the 10yr anniversary of the us backed coup in this country much more to come pic twitter com vuiansqzxc alex rubinstein realalexrubi june 26 2019 mintpress spent nearly a week in the capital tegucigalpa a city that is both militarized and yet ruled by crime at night a dynamic that makes the often cozy relationship between the state and organized crime palpable throughout much of the city the prevalence of anti joh and anti national party graffiti appears as a glimmering of an uprising in a city otherwise divided into quarters of poverty and opulence from poor libre strongholds like el carrizal to areas where burger king and little caesar s are second and third only to juan orlando united states colonialism is basically omnipresent american fast food restaurants mostly a luxury for the country s tiny middle class operate tax free in the country while those who can t afford a big mac get squeezed on their electricity for example the streets of tegucigalpa tell the story of the resistance to a degree one tag in the city refers to the use of graffiti as a means of communicating a message when justice is silenced the walls speak what follows are excerpts of mintpress news interviews from a range of leaders of the resistance against joh pledged to a political prisoner karen spring a canadian citizen and member of the honduran solidarity network is imminently familiar with repression by the government her husband is veteran human rights defender edwin espinal who was arrested during protests against juan orlando hernandez unconstitutional re election the circumstances around raúl álvarez and espinal s arrests are startlingly suspicious as were those of romel valdemar herrera portillo professor adrienne pine has characterized the incidents as potential false flags mintpress spoke at length with spring about the situation of her husband and other political prisoners she described espinal s past work as an activist being close with berta caceres having witnessing a murder with his previous partner who herself was later killed during a protest being tortured by police and eventually being held at a military run prison designed by the united states without trial and without a date set for it edwin and romel share a cell in the third cell block inside la tova a u s style maximum security facility spring told mintpress news spring has seen what she described as neoliberalism on steroids in her 10 years in the country one measure that she highlighted was the security tax that was implemented with backing from hillary clinton it s a tax on transactions and businesses and funds joh s security model it s a semi private security tax that is controlled by the government but can receive international funding from the development banks all the remittances that are sent from the united states to honduras there is a percentage that is taken out of that in other words migrants who come to the united states to send money to their families in honduras even pay a price through the security tax which has fueled the militarization of honduras and the construction of the prison where edwin is being held spring said spring described la tova where she said medication is hard to come by and food is scarce sunlight can be allowed for one hour every two weeks no books no pens one television for maybe 200 people the prison spring says is designed to provoke conflict and because edwin and raul and romel associated with the opposition prisoners are blaming them for the protests increased prices and roadblocks over the course of the current uprising spring says while the government has taken away privileges and basic rights of prisoners during the uprising spring thinks that attacks against the three are being encouraged they are facing serious death threats they re in a prison that was built to hold and imprison the most dangerous people in honduras so people linked to organized crime in the harshest conditions that you can place anyone in pre trial detention we believe that the fact that they re in there and the authorities won t move them even though they are aware of the death threats is because the orders to keep them there are coming from the highest level of the government juan orlando hernandez spring also told the story of another prisoner by the name of gustavo caceres he sits in what spring described as a normal honduran jail his case is probably the best example of the cruel nature of the public prosecutor s office he has a developmental disability and he can t read he can t write and he can t speak he s not able to learn how to talk because of his developmental issue he can say words here or there he can say comida but he can t form a sentence let alone defend himself when he was arrested they picked him up in a police patrol car and they took him to the station and they laid out a police shield and bags of marijuana and put it in front of him and accused him of having police gear and having drugs when he was arrested even though they planted it on him when caceres was arrested he was selling bags of water to support his family around a protest taking place on a bridge spring said adding they were just arresting people in massive numbers as part of a fear and terror campaign because he couldn t defend himself properly he has been in jail he s the longest imprisoned political prisoner today gustavo washes clothes for other prisoners for a small amount of money which is sent to his family to help pay for food first lady of the resistance mintpress news first covered a conference held by the liberty and refoundation party popularly known as libre on june 27 just one day prior to the anniversary of the coup the party emerged in the wake of the coup with manuel zelaya as its figurehead xiomara castro de zelaya the first lady of manuel zelaya is herself a force in honduran politics she was neck and neck with joh in polls leading up to his first election in 2013 an election also mired in fraud allegations she told mintpress at the conference at the exact moment when we were beginning a process of reforming and transforming our people and our countries giving citizens a real opportunity to participate to feel they re a part of the process and not just a tool that s when the u s got scared she continued on the topic of the u s backed coup today the honduran people are stronger today we understand along with many sectors that were indifferent to the coup but are now with us in this fight that on that june 28 when they perpetrated the coup d état taking their president out of the country along with everything else we ve lost the people understand that the coup d état wasn t done so everything would remain the same they did it to harm the vast majority of the people xiomara zelaya spoke at length with mintpress about the significance of libre in the struggle in honduras and about the debt she personally owes to the people of her country libre comes from the streets libre comes from a fight libre comes from men and women who many of us had never really had the chance to come together and truly see each other libre comes from the blood of martyrs from the men and women that died by our side who we saw fall who were assassinated libre comes from a popular demand it comes from the need for a political space that makes possible an electoral fight that can bring us to power libre stands for the hope of honduran people libre stands for the unity that will allow us to reach a better future for ourselves as a member of libre there is a huge commitment and it s a commitment that we can t put aside because we feel the pain of our people as if it were our own the support that we ve received and the blood that s been spilled what that tells us is that we have a duty to repay the people for everything they ve done in particular i say this as xiomara castro as someone whose husband was forced into exile whose husband was forced out by a coup d état and has confronted military forces but right alongside me there were people i d never met men with no shoes housewives who came out to show solidarity with us who came out to feed my family who came out to protect us as we slept in those few moments we could rest you can t put a price on that there is no way to give back to the people all that they ve done for us and that s why we re here and that s why we keep fighting because we know we have a commitment and we won t give up until we achieve the real change that our society and our people are demanding berta cáceres daughter calls for international solidarity at the libre conference mintpress news spoke to the eldest daughter of berta caceres oliva caceres as mintpress has previously reported over 120 honduran activists have been killed since 2010 making the small nation the world s deadliest place to protect the environment berta cáceres one of the slain activists was the winner of the prestigious goldman environmental prize leaked court documents prove three of the eight men arrested for the murder of berta cáceres are linked to the school of the americas now rebranded as whinsec a u s run military training academy and breeding ground for human rights abusers throughout latin america one of the graduates accused of murdering caceres was the head of security from 2013 to 2015 for the company behind the dam she was opposing an international conspiracy to control neutralize and eliminate any opposition was uncovered in connection to her murder olivia caceres told mintpress the men who killed her were gunmen former army captains guards from desa and high ranking soldiers like major mariano díaz chavez soldiers like the ones who shot her are hitmen that are linked to organized crime in our country olivia cáceres continued my mother was murdered by state backed killers who were protecting the energy company desa the company directly ordered berta cáceres s murder its board of directors we all know it s made up of members of the atala zablah family whom we can mention by name it s a very powerful family both politically and economically powerful here it s among the 17 most powerful families in latin america according to a survey by forbes magazine and that was who gave the order to murder berta cáceres they used soldiers and national police who persecuted harassed and finally murdered berta cáceres in a major operation that was carried out on january 1st and february 22nd however both attempts failed and on the third try they managed to kill her on march 2nd at 11 45 at night they entered her room while she was sleeping olivia caceres was careful not to isolate her mother s murder from the political context in the country telling mintpress we believe there won t be justice for berta until the criminal structure that assassinated her is dismantled she was murdered by a whole criminal structure that we have decided to expose for criminal conspiracy she went on to call for international solidarity with the struggle in honduras we ve been knocking on every door in this country for more than three and half years and we still haven t gotten justice we believe that what the honduran people need and what berta s cause needs now more than ever is international solidarity we re calling out a murder that reflects the whole situation the social injustice and inequality the violence repression the targeted assassinations by a dictatorial regime that s involved in drug trafficking berta s murder reflects the whole catastrophe the poverty the impunity washington s other armies the national party of juan orlando hernandez has been in power since the coup d etat carlos eduardo reina secretary of popular power in the libre party talked to mintpress news about how the coup reshaped the government the coup first took out the president but then installed a coup regime that makes electoral fraud that takes away the votes the energy different things from the government and the people they privatized it a huge oligarchy wants to own the country and take the country s riches from the people the thing is that in honduras it s a very little country and the only thing that supports the government is the army and the army receives orders from the north eduardo reina argued that if honduras was given the opportunity of free and fair elections it would also give them the opportunity to take away the dictatorship menders of the movement dr marco girón a member of the movement for the defense of health and education explained the neoliberal process in depth in honduras when neoliberalism was introduced no one believed that water would be privatized that our electricity would be privatized or our healthcare or education but all of that changed they ve privatized and diminished state institutions they also got rid of the honduran institute for families and children ihnfa which was in charge of child welfare including providing homeless children with food and a roof over their heads this is how neoliberalism has progressed steadily shrinking the state although we still need all the things it provided first went the custodial staff at hospitals which before were state run but since they were custodians no one cared then they started privatizing different sectors they started privatizing the medication then came fake orders empty boxes that never made it to the hospital the anti corruption council states that the health budget is approximately 14b lempiras it s one of the lowest in the world and 50 percent of it is stolen these are preventable deaths to our population it s the same with the education system dr girón argued that the pro public healthcare and education marches will continue until these executive and legislative decrees are rescinded that s where the genesis of the problem is the privatization laws that s the neoliberalism they re imposing on us it s all there that s why the struggle continues and that s why the education and healthcare workers stay in the streets and they ll stay until the repeal of these awful privatization laws which are imported from abroad and which will only bring us more poverty illiteracy diseases and even death raising a resistance andrea chavarría an 82 year old former teacher is known popularly as the grandmother of the resistance in honduras she spoke to mintpress news about what the presidency of manuel zelaya meant for organized educators when commander manuel zelaya rosales took power teachers got our first victory after it was taken from us here in honduras struggles are won in the streets when teachers started taking to the streets our president mel zelaya who has been one of the best presidents who we ve ever had he received us in the presidential palace he let us right in through the front door and we were going to take it by force right he received us he opened the gates and we formed a commission then he hopped on a truck and said it s approved chavarría continued we were demanding a permanent contract health insurance vacations a bonus they approved them we finally had benefits they ve taken all that from us now the students are sitting on gravel the parents have to pay for cleaning services for security for learning materials because the government doesn t provide anything the teachers as we say here in honduras are cornered we have no privileges the privileges we had earned in the streets were taken from us same goes for the doctors since i was a young woman i ve always defended my rights because i thought of myself in the present not the past or the future today s youth are the present of honduras despite my age and health problems i stand with them and support them because they tell me grandma you give us strength if you can do it why not us i applaud those youth those college students from meu university student movement because they re valiant and to me the youth is the present students stand for their rights on june 24 some 40 military police invaded the national autonomous university of honduras unah which is supposed to have autonomy from the military since 1957 meaning it can t be raided police had claimed that students had kidnapped a soldier but activists say the students were just planning protests five students were shot with live rounds and eight students were injured in total one professor also had a cardiac episode because of the tear gas activists said in front of a defaced entrance sign at the university mintpress spoke to dorian alvarez reyes a sociology student who witnessed the chaos he explained that the sign covered in bullet holes painted in red and with the word autonomous crossed out and replaced with military so that it reads national military university of honduras was a symbol of the blood spilt by students and a protest against the infringement on the university s autonomy moments before protesters set fire to a paper mache casket with the word autonomy written on it teaching through tear gas luisa cruz a teacher at unah spoke to mintpress at a concert held on the night of the coup anniversary she said it made her feel terrible that her students were unsafe even as a mother of university aged kids it s really a terrible issue about human rights it also has happened at public high schools and public universities as well we are a country that is living a really bad time in regard to the human rights issue the united states is supporting a corrupt narco dictatorship in honduras why because they need a government that says yes to anything the u s government says because they are interested in having us as a military platform so they can invade whoever they want venezuela and nicaragua cruz continued to explain the raid on her university there was a protest by the students out on the street and with a very ridiculous excuse that the students got ahold of a policeman or soldier they shot bullets and of course tear gas all over there was about eight students wounded and i guess two of them were very badly wounded cruz said it wasn t the first illegal invasion by police while the university has hired people to go in and kick students asses inside the university campus that s why she said the university authorities are really a shame cruz went on to discuss why the government cracked down so harshly on students the government knows that the student movement is really hard they re really tough and they re really numerous there s a whole bunch of them and these guys have lived a coup d etat and they know what it is to be living under dictatorship that s why they really are afraid of these students and it s the only thing that has dignity at the university not even the professors are dignified i really feel ashamed of where i ve been working for so many years the rising costs of education which are correlated with the increased influence of gangs and cocaine trafficking since the coup have led many students to eschew education and turn to drug use and dealing in order to improve the situation of the youth in honduras cruz told mintpress it would require hands off by the u s as a first step they have us like this we are on our knees in this country i don t know if you know about all those migrants heading off to mexico and the u s border well it s no wonder i mean there s a whole bunch of people here that don t have anything to eat or that live on a dollar a day what are you going to eat with a dollar a day not even in this country can we eat with a dollar so there s a lot of people leaving the country because they have no hope dancing as resistance walking through the crowd at a resistance concert on the 10 year anniversary of the coup a man went from trash barrel to trash barrel picking through them for food after univision a news station deeply distrusted by the honduran resistance broadcast footage of venezuelans picking through garbage earlier this year it sparked an international incident yet establishment media has almost entirely ignored the plight in honduras which has become the poorest country in the continental americas since the u s backed coup and on the night of the anniversary of the military operation that changed everything the honduran resistance was celebrating with a concert at the center of town the band café guancasco played their anti joh anthem which translates roughly to the place you re going is out joh in an effort to understand how hondurans could find joy despite the neoliberalization of their economy and incredible repression i asked a translator recommended by an expert to mintpress news how it was possible this band is called café guancasco café guancasco is a word that means gathering to celebrate something and we re celebrating that we re still alive we are celebrating that we are doing a resistance against joh and we re celebrating that he is going to get the hell out of here defending human rights in honduras pedro joaquin amador a human rights worker in honduras talked to mintpress news about what it s like for human rights workers in this country it s very difficult he said you have a lot of obstruction of justice in honduras and the military and police we have a lot of difficulties getting information about all the victims of this country when it happened the coup to right now in 2019 with the protest against juan orlando hernandez amador went on to discuss the repression tactics used by the government during the current uprisings he decried the use of tear gas and chemicals they shoot us with military weapons and there s a lot of people killed he said adding that international bodies should focus not only on venezuela and nicaragua but also honduras poetry and resistance edgardo florián a poet and author of seven books told mintpress that he doesn t really get involved with politics anymore because of how much it has taken from him and was driven to tears remembering those killed by the honduran government in the 10 years since the u s backed coup i ve been beaten hit by the gases but basically the economy of the country is not the same florián said telling mintpress that it has made it hard for him to get by joh must leave power people don t want him florián said the only people that want him are the people who receive a bag of food or maybe some bread 50 lampiras just to go out with a flag joh has been so desperate for support that the national party has been caught handing out 50 lempiras 2 usd to desperate citizens to protest on his behalf we are people who don t sell out their ideas just for 50 lempiras florián said ironically the joh supporters participating in what was billed as a pro peace march wound up viciously beating a student journalist florián said that joh promises good things but inside he s another kind of person he s something cold a dark soul he went on to talk about the first person killed in protests against the coup our first victim as he describes it and now it s a lot of people some we know them others we don t even know the ramifications of the coup and the neoliberal policies that upheaved honduran society are felt in each and every sector of it the business class and organized crime are flourishing and will soon reap the benefits of yet another law that will come into effect in november which further criminalizes activists and media while lessening penalties for drug trafficking the middle class the creative class the working class and poor the women and lgbtq citizens the elderly and the human rights workers the left leaning political class and the families of environmental protectors all of these groups have had their livelihoods devastated by the coup and the politically savvy blame washington ten years after the coup changed everything the trump administration is cutting funds from the united states agency for international development usaid a u s soft power institution that helped foment the coup in the first place and spark the migrant crisis in response to the crisis that was designed to stoke trump s base and assert a cold hearted foreign policy the white house diverted funds earmarked for central american countries to venezuelan opposition leader juan guaido presumably the united states wants to back a successful coup d etat there and begin an even larger

washington ap president donald trump is flipping interest rate theory on its head as he tries to blame the fed for holding back growth trump went after the federal reserve on friday after advancing a dubious argument this week that blue collar workers have gained the most from the strong stock market a look at both matters the fed trump on twitter because of the faulty thought process we have going for us at the federal reserve we pay much higher interest rates than countries that are no match for us economically in other words our interest costs are much higher than other countries when they should be lower correct and we are in a world competition winning big but it is no thanks to the federal reserve had they not acted so fast and so much we would be doing even better than we are doing right now the facts trump s support for the fed slashing rates to rival europe s lows flies in the face of basic economics he s repeatedly said the fed has been stifling stronger growth and openly criticized fed chairman jerome powell his own choice to lead the u s central bank but the fed s decision to hike rates four times last year was based on the belief that u s growth had strengthened and that there was an eventual risk of inflation or asset bubbles that might hurt the economy if the fed kept short term rates too low the general theory is that central banks cut rates in countries in a downturn or period of weak growth a bit of stimulus meant to get an economy back on track in fact trump was mistakenly critical of fed efforts to revive growth during barack obama s presidency when he argued the issue from the other side trump tweeted in 2011 that reckless policies of low interest and flooding the market with dollars would cause record inflation but that inflation never materialized because the economy was still recovering from the great recession even with last year s fed rate hikes the borrowing costs of the u s government are historically low they ve even declined recently as financial markets have adjusted to the likelihood of slower economic growth this year and the possibility of fed rate cuts the interest charged on u s 10 year treasury notes has fallen from nearly 16 in 1981 to roughly 2 today despite an explosion in government borrowing this decline has made it easier to finance deficit spending such as trump s 2017 tax cuts that were meant to achieve stronger growth over the long term still the interest rates being charged on 10 year debt are higher for the united states than for other countries such as britain 0 74 france 0 07 germany 0 32 and japan 0 14 so why is that one clear reason is that growth is anemic in those countries according to data provider factset the u s economy is expected to grow significantly faster than the economies of britain france germany and japan the market and the central banks judge that those countries need the stimulus from rates that are close to zero or even negative still investors believe the u s economy also needs a boost because the benefits of trump s tax cuts have waned and uncertainty over the administration s trade battles with china and other nations they expect a rate cut at the fed s july meeting a sign that lower rates might be needed to keep the economy on course rather than propel it faster ___ the market trump i think a number that makes me the happiest is that proportionately the biggest gainer in this entire stock market when you hear about how much has gone up blue collar workers the biggest proportionate gainer remarks at cabinet meeting tuesday the facts wealthier americans have largely benefited from the stock market gains not blue collar workers the problem with the president claiming the stock market has helped working class americans is that the richest 10 of the country controls 84 of stock market value according to a federal reserve survey because they hold more stocks wealthier americans have inherently benefited more from the 19 gain in the standard poor s index of 500 stocks so far this year about half of u s families even hold stocks so plenty of people are getting little to no benefit from the stock market gains the statement fits a pattern in which trump portrays policies that have comparatively favored the wealthy as primarily helping the middle class for example the president promised in 2017 that his tax cuts would be a middle class miracle but much of the magic went to millionaires people earning more than 1 million received a combined total tax cut last year of 36 billion or 64 428 per filer according to the joint committee on taxation those earning between 50 000 to 75 000 a solidly middle class income got back a combined 22 4 billion or 819 per filer what trump may be claiming with regard to the stock market is that working americans are disproportionately benefiting in their 401 k retirement savings trump has said that 401 k plans are up more than 50 his data source is vague during the cabinet meeting the president said somebody told me but 401 k balances have increased in large part due to routine contributions by workers and employers not just stock market gains the employee benefit research institute shows that only one group of americans has gotten an average annual 401 k gain in excess of 50 during trump s presidency these are workers age 25 to 34 who have fewer than five

hong kong july 19 2019 bss afp asian markets rallied friday as comments from a top federal reserve official were pounced on by investors as indicating the central bank will unveil a deep interest rate cut at the end of the month john williams the influential vice chairman of the fed s policy setting board said in a speech that central banks should move quickly to support the economy when borrowing costs were already low he pointed to studies suggesting that when there are few stimulus options available officials should move more quickly than you otherwise might rather than waiting for disaster to unfold while a spokesman later clarified that williams was not outlining fed policy and was not flagging a half point cut analysts said the remarks provided an insight into how officials were thinking markets have been wavering this week over how big the bank s expected reduction would be with 25 basis points priced in but traders hoping for 50 basis points williams remarks put probabilities of multiple rate cuts higher after strong economic indicators had put doubts on the number of rate reductions this year and how deep the cut will be said oanda senior market analyst alfonso esparza wall street ended in positive territory and asia was on course to end the week on a strong note despite concerns about the global outlook and a lack of progress in china us trade talks tokyo went into the break 1 7 percent higher while hong kong and shanghai were both up one percent in early business seoul and taipei also added one percent while sydney climbed 0 8 percent singapore put on 0 4 percent wellington added 0 3 percent and manila advanced 0 6 percent warning for stocks however jeffrey kleintop chief global investment strategist at charles schwab co warned that weakness in the world economy would eventually drag on markets i don t think a few rates cuts is going to make the difference whether it s 25 or 50 basis points at the end of this month he told bloomberg tv while the bond market is pricing in a realistic probability of the slowdown stocks have gone the other direction this year and may be in for a surprise bets on lower rates were also providing support to higher yielding riskier currencies with the australian dollar and south korean won climbing 0 6 percent and the indonesian rupiah 0 5 percent higher south africa s rand the turkish lira and mexican peso were also well up however the greenback did claw back slightly against its major peers following steep losses on thursday the softer dollar was also helping oil prices rally while donald trump s claims that the us had shot down an iranian drone that threatened an american naval vessel also provided strong support however vanguard markets stephen innes said the commodity remained under pressure from concerns about demand despite moves to loosen monetary policy it s not central bank liquidity that oil markets need but global economic growth he said all the money in the world isn t going to alleviate the fact markets are mired in a trade war induced global economic slump that is factoring in both consumer and industrial consumption metrics key figures around 0230 gmt tokyo nikkei 225 up 1 7 percent at 21 394 23 break hong kong hang seng up 1 0 percent at 28745 53 shanghai composite up 1 0 percent at 2 929 57 pound dollar down at 1 2545 from 1 2548 at 2050 gmt pound euro down at 89 77 pence from 89 87 pence euro dollar down at 1 1262 from 1 1277 dollar yen up at 107 55 yen from 107 30 yen west texas intermediate up 92 cents at 56 22 per barrel brent north sea crude up 1 20 at 63 13 per barrel new york dow flat at 27 222 97 close london ftse 100 down 0 6 percent at 7 493 09 close
quick take thursday s price action was characterized by a centric selloff across the board after fed s vice chair and ny fed president williams his dovish rhetoric right before the fed goes dark until the meets on july 31st the market took his comments by heart even if he later tried to play them down by saying today s speech was not about potential policy actions to be conducted this month and while the usd recouped a significant portion of its us led losses judging by the cme fedwatch pricing of a 50bp rate cut last at 48 from as high as 71 a few hours later yesterday stood at 32 the market verdict still seems to suggest the conviction for an aggressive fed cut is on the rise the was also knocked down against its main peers as a report made the rounds that in an unprecedented move the ecb may be considering to revise its inflation goal mandate in a sign that the central bank may have to resort to more stimulus for longer amid the puzzling phenomenon of low global inflation on the flip side the sterling finally celebrated a positive day and it wasn t just a mere gain but the largest posted in the month of july as the uk parliament passed the benn amendment that will block a sept oct parliament shutdown in case the new uk pm had the perilous audacity of strategizing with a hard brexit by running out of time the and the the latter boosted by the reassurance provided by today s aus jobs that the rba will stay pat for a few months on rates put on another solid performance the same cannot be said about the canadian dollar suffering an imbalance of supply as the market plays the divergence trade against intermarket flows as warned in yesterday s report lastly both the yen and the swissy trod water once again by trading generally flat from an equally weighted performance view hence capitalizing only against the weakest eur usd cad narratives in financial markets the information is gathered after scanning top publications including the ft wsj reuters bloomberg forexlive institutional bank research reports fed s williams nyse goes beyond previous dovish remarks fed s vice chair and ny fed president williams made some clear dovish comments on thursday very consistent with the message carried by fed s chair powell and other fed speakers during the month of july the comments have shifted the focus back towards a more aggressive easing of 50bp in july with the usd plummeting as a result the sharp markdown in the us dollar is predicated on the basis that today s remarks were even more dovish than his prior comments on july 11th and the fact that he made it right before what s referred to as the dark period which takes effect from friday at the end of ny trading until july 31st hence the comments one would think were intended to clearly send a message of where the fed stands this is what fed s williams shared in today s speech the policymaker said it is better to take a preventative approach than to wait for disaster reminiscence of powell s word code an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure in the last fomc williams reinforced his dovishness by noting research shows that when neutral rates are low you should not keep your powder dry adding that long term forces lowering neutral rates set to linger williams currently estimates neutral rates in the us to be around 0 5 and that inflation expectations are far more anchored these days dovish the headlines have cemented the case for the fed to cut its interest rate by 50bp this month as reflected by the whopping 71 chance assigned by the cme fedwatch tool note new york fed williams later on the day added his speech was not about potential policy actions at the july fomc meeting which has sent the usd back up again recouping part of its losses fed s clarida joins the fed s dovish party if not sufficient evidence of the consistent easing message projected by fed members since the last fomc today s intervention by federal reserve vice chairman richard clarida should make it blatantly obvious as the policymaker outlined that the us economy is in a good place but uncertainties that may influence the us growth have increased adding that global data is disappointing and inflation soft again these are the exact same risks identified by powell and other members to justify a preventive adjustment of rates lower clarida also hinted that since monetary policy operates with a lag risks must be accounted for before data turns too late moment of reckoning for the ecb inflation mandate in a report carried by bloomberg it was revealed that the ecb is considering to study a potential revamp of its inflation goal framework with some of the ecb staff seemingly critics of the below but close to 2 definition as part of the mandate in what s still a confidential and preliminary work the immediate reaction by the market was to mark down the euro as a school of thought is that by potentially being laxer on the doctrine that surrounds the mythical 2 inflation goal the central bank makes the admission to potentially pursue longer stimulus programs based on the acceptance of lower inflation projections the post crisis era has proven to defy old established theories such as the philip curve with the preponderance of evidence proving that the relationship between unemployment and inflation is an obsolete approach to influence policy interestingly the fed has also recognized in the last few weeks the risk of low inflation for longer and its willingness to accept this reality in what appears to be a coordinated effort to re evaluate and adjust inflation targets in accordance with the new paradigms which for now is seen as the recognition that in a world of ultra low inflation accommodative policies should be dominant with a much lower usd a tool the fed may utilize to re activate the reflationary environment through higher commodity prices friendlier credit conditions in ems and the ability of usd funded corporations to keep up its profitability levels elevated concessions by the eu on brexit an illusion eu s chief brexit negotiator barnier time and time again reiterates that there will be no renegotiation of the brexit withdrawal agreement which narrows down the possible outcomes to either a no deal brexit a general election or second referendum the hard line position on the irish border by the contenders to the post of uk pm boris johnson and hunt make the option of renegotiation with the eu dead in the water nonetheless as a bona fide gesture that may be interpreted as a slight positive input the door was left open should uk politicians have a rethink and consider an alternative arrangement for the irish border uk retail sales an outlier but brexit dominates while uk economic data has turned largely into a sideshow fully eclipsed by the brexit conundrum today s uk june retail sales at 1 0 vs 0 3 m m expected is certainly an outlier fueling the gbp rally growth in non food stores and second hand goods led the upbeat print while food stores and department store sales were in contrast the negative inputs do not expect the data to alter the outlook for the gbp nor the boe to budge as brexit is what matters shutting down parliament won t fly the positive buy side flows in the sterling today were mostly driven by the benn amendment in the uk parliament aimed to prevent a sept oct parliament shutdown with a vote of 315 274 even if the new uk pm were to suspend sessions in the parliament in sept and oct members of the commons would still be required to attend which would make any effort to strategize a no deal brexit due to running out of time a no go at the margin it was a gbp positive as it allows more room for the uk government to agree on a compromise which may include a general election second referendum or the least likely a renegotiation of the existing deal rba can afford to wait for further cuts today s australian employment change for the

business confidence survey for q2 came at 6 vs 1 prior while on the flip side business conditions which accounts for trade sales profitability and employment weakened further to 1 since the reserve

asian markets rallied on friday as comments from a top federal reserve official were pounced on by investors as indicating the central bank will unveil a deep interest rate cut at the end of the month john williams the influential vice chairman of the fed s policy setting board said in a speech that central banks should move quickly to support the economy when borrowing costs were already low he pointed to studies suggesting that when there are few stimulus options available officials should move more quickly than you otherwise might rather than waiting for disaster to unfold while a spokesman later clarified that williams was not outlining fed policy and was not flagging a half point cut analysts said the remarks provided an insight into how officials were thinking markets have been wavering this week over how big the bank s expected reduction would be with 25 basis points priced in but traders hoping for 50 basis points williams remarks put probabilities of multiple rate cuts higher after strong economic indicators had put doubts on the number of rate reductions this year and how deep the cut will be said oanda senior market analyst alfonso esparza wall street ended in positive territory and asia was on course to end the week on a strong note despite concerns about the global outlook and a lack of progress in china us trade talks tokyo went into the break 1 7 percent higher while hong kong and shanghai were both up one percent in early business seoul and taipei also added one per cent while sydney climbed 0 8 per cent singapore put on 0 4 per cent wellington added 0 3 per cent and manila advanced 0 6 per cent warning for stocks however jeffrey kleintop chief global investment strategist at charles schwab co warned that weakness in the world economy would eventually drag on markets i don t think a few rates cuts is going to make the difference whether it s 25 or 50 basis points at the end of this month he told bloomberg tv while the bond market is pricing in a realistic probability of the slowdown stocks have gone the other direction this year and may be in for a surprise bets on lower rates were also providing support to higher yielding riskier currencies with the australian dollar and south korean won climbing 0 6 per cent and the indonesian rupiah 0 5 per cent higher south africa s rand the turkish lira and mexican peso were also well up however the greenback did claw back slightly against its major peers following steep losses on thursday the softer dollar was also helping oil prices rally while donald trump s claims that the us had shot down an iranian drone that threatened an american naval vessel also provided strong support however vanguard markets stephen innes said the commodity remained under pressure from concerns about demand despite moves to loosen monetary policy it s not central bank liquidity that oil markets need but global economic growth he said all the money in the world isn t going to alleviate the fact markets are mired in a trade war induced global economic slump that is factoring in both consumer and industrial consumption metrics afp
asian markets rallied on friday july 19 amid expectations that the united states federal reserve would cut interest rates for the first time in a decade later this month to kickstart flagging growth this came after a senior fed official indicated that there was a need to act ahead of an economic slowdown with the us china trade war pushing us manufacturing into a recession last month and other data pointing to slowing growth the markets were betting that the fed would aggressively cut rates by as much as 50 basis points to revive the economy across asia japan rose 2 per cent south korea gained 1 35 per cent and hong kong was up 1 07 per cent shanghai shenzhen taiwan singapore and the rest of south east asia all posted gains of less than 1 per cent new york fed president john williams had said on thursday that policymakers could not wait for economic disaster to hit before adding stimulus central banks are responding earlier and more aggressively as the world economy slows and inflation remains benign on thursday indonesia and south korea cut their benchmark interest rates by 25 basis points for the first time in years ahead of the fed s policy decision on july 31 since may india malaysia and the philippines have cut interest rates as has australia singapore is also expected to ease its monetary policy this is very different from the great financial crisis when inflation was high which made it harder for central banks to cut rates pre emptively mr chua hak bin an economist at maybank kim eng research said low inflation had reduced the risk a rate cut now is seen as an insurance move and the repercussions seem minimal but if you act later the costs could be higher because the policy impact comes with a lag he added all eyes are on us second quarter gdp data to be released next week market consensus points to a slowdown to 1 9 per cent quarter on quarter from 3 1 per cent in the first quarter amid the ongoing trade spat

gold price 18 00 per ounce of silver 11 00 per pound of molybdenum and using an 8 discount rate the integration plan generates significant synergies and lowers execution risk by bringing together the extensive mineral resource of agua rica with the existing infrastructure of alumbrera to create a unique high quality and low risk brownfield project that the parties believe will bring significant value to shareholders and local communities and stakeholders this unique and innovative project will serve to position catamarca as a focal point for development in northwestern argentina the parties are pleased to have collectively advanced the integration of agua rica and alumbrera and now to have advanced the pfs under the oversight and with the support of a technical committee comprised of their respective representatives the parties also recognize and appreciate the collaboration of the national government of argentina and provincial government of catamarca along with several state owned entities which led to the integration plan thereby supporting advancing the project with the pfs based on mineral reserves updated as at june 30 2019 the pfs estimates a mine life of 28 years with average annual production over the first 10 years of approximately 533 million pounds of copper equivalent 1 including 107 000 ounces of gold and contributions of molybdenum and silver costs are expected to fall well within the lower half of the cost curve with average cash costs over the first 10 years estimated at 1 29 per pound and competitive aisc 2 of 1 52 per pound for the same period the initial capital cost estimate of 2 4 billion realizes significant synergies from using the infrastructure and facilities of alumbrera the project is expected to generate strong economic returns

a throughput rate of 110 000 tpd with scenarios considering a higher throughput rate to be evaluated in the value seeking study and subsequent full feasibility study preliminary evaluations have indicated the potential for significant upside to the project economics from increases to throughput with existing mineral reserves to 115 000 tpd which would improve npv to over 145 million and require only a marginal increase to initial capital the pfs significantly advances agua rica and underscores agua rica as a long life low cost project with robust economics and significant upside potential opportunities to realize further upside include converting economic grade inferred mineral resources within the pit and expanding throughput scenarios to increase metal production and returns among others the parties have undertaken considerable preliminary work to ensure the highest standards of environmental protection the environmental design criteria have been defined using the best practices of the mining industry international guidelines legal requirements and corporate policies with the sole objective to prevent or minimize impacts to the environment while embracing the unique characteristics of the region about the agua rica alumbrera integrated project agua rica is a large scale copper gold silver and molybdenum deposit located in the catamarca province argentina 25 kilometres north of andalgalá the project has proven and probable mineral reserves of 11 8 billion pounds of copper and 7 4 million ounces of gold contained in 1 104 million tonnes of ore mineral resources include 260 000 tonnes of measured and indicated mineral resources containing more than 1 6 billion pounds of copper and 954 000 ounces of gold additionally inferred mineral resources of 743 000 tonnes represent significant upside potential to further define an increase to mineral reserves and life of mine the pfs for the integrated project considers the agua rica deposit will be mined via a conventional high tonnage truck and shovel open pit operation average life of mine material moved is expected to be approximately 108 million tonnes per year with ore feed of 40 million tonnes per year and average life of mine strip ratio of 1 66 ore extracted from the mine will be transported from the open pit by truck to the primary crusher area and then transported via a conventional conveyor to the existing alumbrera processing plant to route the overland conveyor system approximately 5 2 kilometres of tunnel development will be required the conveyor extends 35 kilometres to the alumbrera process plant where it will feed the existing stacker conveyor via a new transfer station relatively modest modifications to the circuit are needed to process the agua rica ore in order to produce copper and by products concentrate which will then be transported to the port for commercialization an in situ blending strategy has been defined to manage the concentrate quality over certain years of the mine life which will allow the project to achieve the desired targets further optimizations to this strategy will be studied in the next design phase the mineral reserves pit contains 160 million tonnes of inferred mineral resources classified as waste in the base case the majority of this material is not scheduled to be mined until late in the mine life and could displace lower grade material within the pit representing an immediate opportunity to improve the base case by increasing average annual production if the inferred mineral resources can be converted to mineral reserves the high quality and well preserved existing infrastructure of alumbrera is fully utilized in the integration tailings storage facility power supply water supply ancillary buildings and logistical installations among other infrastructure are all included this significantly reduces the environmental footprint of the project given the level of progress achieved in the pfs the parties have begun the process to prepare the environmental impact assessment eia for the integrated project as well as continuing engagement with local stakeholders and local communities the company plans to commence a review of strategic and value creating alternatives in the interests of advancing the project to development this review may be commenced as soon as this year and continue through the period that a full feasibility study is advanced any additional upside opportunities for the project that will be considered as part of the feasibility study will be taken into account as part of this review the project represents exceptional value across many fronts already which is expected to improve with the upside opportunities the parties will continue to work in close consultation with local communities governments and catamarca authorities to ensure project design adheres to strict permitting standards that reduce agua rica s environmental footprint in addition the project will implement the mining association of canada s towards sustainable mining protocols a rigorous performance management system that helps mining companies evaluate and manage their environmental and social responsibilities agua rica also plans to renew its iso 14001 and oshas 18001 certifications and continue to engage extensively with local communities and promote diversity and shared values in the region other news early results of previously announced cash tender offer of notes the company reported today that it has received 462 420 000 of notes tendered under its note purchase offering which now allocates in full the cash reserved toward its debt reduction plan this well positions the company toward achieving its goal of meaningfully retiring outstanding debt and thereby significantly improving its financial position in order to pursue organic growth and value creating opportunities including the opportunity that the integrated agua rica project represents mineral reserve statement

copper sold all in sustaining costs per pound of copper sold ebitda the company believes that these measures together with measures determined in accordance with ifrs provide investors with an improved ability to evaluate the underlying performance of the company non gaap financial measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under ifrs and therefore they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies the data is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with ifrs management s determination of the components of non gaap and additional measures are evaluated on a periodic basis influenced by new items and transactions a review of investor uses and new regulations as applicable any changes to the measures are duly noted and retrospectively applied as applicable cash costs and all in sustaining costs the company discloses cash costs because it understands that certain investors use this information to determine the company s ability to generate earnings and cash flows for use in investing and other activities the company believes that conventional measures of performance prepared in accordance with ifrs do not fully illustrate the ability of its operating mines to generate cash flows the measures as determined under ifrs are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flows from operating activities the measure of cash costs and all in sustaining costs aisc along with revenue from sales is considered to be a key indicator of a company s ability to generate operating earnings and cash flows from its mining operations this data is furnished to provide additional information and is a non gaap financial measure the terms cash costs per pound of copper sold and aisc per pound of copper sold do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under ifrs and therefore they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies non gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with ifrs and are not necessarily indicative of operating costs operating profit or cash flows presented under ifrs cash costs include mine site operating costs such as mining processing administration production taxes and royalties which are not based on sales or taxable income calculations but are exclusive of amortization reclamation capital development and exploration costs the company believes that such measure provides useful information about its underlying cash costs of operations cash costs are computed on a weighted average basis as follows cash costs of copper shown on a per pound basis costs directly attributable to geo and copper will be allocated on that attributable basis non attributable costs will be allocated based on the relative value of revenues for each metal which will be determined annually at the beginning of each year costs attributable to copper sales are divided by commercial copper pounds sold aisc figures are calculated in accordance with a standard developed by the world gold council wgc a non regulatory market development organization for the gold industry adoption of the standard is voluntary and the cost measures presented herein may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies aisc per sold seeks to represent total sustaining expenditures of producing and selling the total costs used as the numerator of the unitary calculation represent cash costs defined above and includes cost components of mine sustaining capital expenditures including stripping and underground mine development corporate and mine site general and administrative expense sustaining mine site exploration and evaluation expensed and capitalized and accretion and amortization of reclamation and remediation aisc do not include capital expenditures attributable to projects or mine expansions exploration and evaluation costs attributable to growth projects income tax payments borrowing costs and dividend payments consequently this measure is not representative of all of the company s cash expenditures in addition the calculation of aisc does not include depletion depreciation and amortization expense as it does not reflect the impact of expenditures incurred in prior periods aisc per pound of copper reflect allocations of the aforementioned cost components on the basis that is consistent with the nature of each of the cost component to geo or copper production activities ebitda ebitda is a non gaap financial measure which excludes the following from net earnings income tax expense finance costs and depletion depreciation and amortization management believes that ebitda is a valuable indicator of the company s ability to generate liquidity by producing operating cash flow to fund working capital needs service debt obligations and fund capital expenditures management uses ebitda for this purpose ebitda is also frequently used by investors and analysts for valuation purposes whereby ebitda is multiplied by a factor or ebitda multiple that is based on an observed or inferred relationship between ebitda and market values to determine the approximate total enterprise value of a company
some hawkish economists and analysts warned of an inflation breakout that would see people handing over buckets of cash for a loaf of bread loading instead inflation has fallen the rba whose stated aim is to have inflation between 2 and 3 per cent hasn t met its own goal for more than two years according to subbaraman and ticehurst the june and july rate cuts by the rba are part of a grander global central bank effort to run a hot economy despite near record low unemployment the aim as stated by rba governor philip lowe is to drive unemployment down to at least 4 5 per cent in a deliberate ploy aimed at lifting wages growth and with it the inflation rate with the australian economy motoring along rates will start to return to something approaching normal but that brave plan is just as hazardous as houdini getting out of a straitjacket while hanging from the top of a new york skyscraper no less than the head of the us federal reserve jerome powell told members of congress this month that the connection between low unemployment and higher inflation had become weaker over recent years to the point that it is now a faint heartbeat as subbaraman and ticehurst point out the lower interest rates go the less impact they have as debt levels grow australian household debt is among the highest in the world the ability to push up interest rates gets even more difficult the continuation of ultra loose monetary policy can support growth in the short run but it makes normalisation ever more difficult the nomura analysts argue loading it would be foolish for central bankers to admit as much but their room for monetary policy normalisation to build policy space to fight the next recession is narrowing in other words they are trapped how trapped in a paper recently published by the bank for international settlements economists pierre olivier gourinchas and helene rey looked at the world s current unusual economic conditions they found that on only two previous occasions the roaring twenties and the exuberant 2000s has the ratio of consumption to wealth fallen below its long term historical average each episode was followed by a severe global financial crisis and depressed real rates for an extended period of time they found the extended period of time in the case of britain the united states and the eurozone is looking like low interest rates all the way out to at least 2025 central banks are critically aware of the dangers of cheap money for long periods of time here the combination of low rates and profit hungry banks helped drive up housing prices in sydney and melbourne by more than 50 per cent in a little over five years that same cheap money has also filtered into the sharemarket loading that combination boosts the wealth of a few increasing another concern held by central banks inequality a special survey by the australian bureau of statistics of household incomes confirmed that while income inequality has been relatively steady since 2003 04 it is a different story in terms of wealth the richest fifth of households have enjoyed a 67 per cent rise in their wealth over the past 13 years the most of any group the wealth of the bottom fifth of the population grew by just 3 per cent over the same period outside of inequality a huge run up in household debt fuelled by the cheap interest rates it has overseen has wider implications governor lowe recently noted that the record level of debt held by australians had reduced their propensity to take on new and better paying jobs risk taking pivotal to a vibrant economy is waning reserve bank of australia governor philip lowe says high household debt levels may be a reason people are failing to push for new jobs or higher wages credit alex ellinghausen it may also be affecting businesses with evidence that stagnant wages and prices mean firms keep on staff rather than find ways to boost their overall productivity the bank for international settlements the organisation that warned of the dodgy home loans at the centre of the global financial crisis used its recent annual report to argue zombie firms are now stalking the world s high streets and industrial parks they sap economy wide productivity growth not only by being less productive themselves but also because they crowd out resources available to more productive firms evidence suggests that their increase over time has had an economically significant macro economic impact it found so the rba sits with official rates at 1 per cent with a government that wants to protect its projected budget surplus at all costs wages that are failing to grow and productivity going nowhere efforts to bring down the dollar one way to boost the economy are being thwarted by nations around the globe in effect doing the same thing the situation could get worse marcel thieliant senior economist with capital economics argues that while official interest rates at 0 5 per cent should be enough to get the economy moving there is a 1 in 3 chance the rba will need to be even bolder quantitative easing buying government bonds would be the stepping stone to something this country has never seen federal reserve chairman jerome powell has warned the link between falling unemployment and higher inflation is now a faint heartbeat credit ap while the bank hasn t displayed much love for negative interest rates we suspect that they would still be launched if qe fails to generate the desired results he notes if escaping the clutches of low interest rates is difficult getting away from negative rates

and thank you everyone for joining us for our second quarter 2019 earnings call i will begin our discussion with a summary of results on slide 3 this morning we reported second quarter 2019 net income of 150 million or 1 03 per share compared to first quarter net income of 164 million and 1 12 per share during the second quarter we recorded 30 million of additional tax expense to reverse certain previously claimed tax credits related to dc solar the impact of this expense per share was 0 21 adjusted for this expense second quarter net income was 180 5 million or 1 24 per share an increase of 7 from the adjusted earning per share of 1 16 in the first quarter of 2019 and up 5 year over year east west achieved record operating revenues of 420 million in the second quarter an increase of 4 from 405 million in the first quarter and an increase of 8 from 390 million in the second quarter of 2018 quarter over quarter net interest income grew by 1 and we also saw substantial fee income growth of 25 reflecting robust customer demand for our interest rate swap products in response to the inverted yield curve year over year net interest income grew by 8 and fee income grew by 9 the growth in revenue combined with strong expense control drove improvement in our operating efficiency and an expansion of our pre tax pre provision profitability to 2 51 in the second quarter of 2019 up by 8 basis points linked quarter additionally quarter over quarter the non performing asset ratio decreased to 28 basis point of total assets and net charge off decreased to 9 basis point of average loans while allowances for loan losses coverage was essentially stable at 0 98 of loans overall we are pleased with our operating performance this quarter turning to slide 4 we had another quarter of solid loan growth as of june 30 2019 total loans reached a record 33 7 billion growing by 871 million or 11 linked quarter annualized from march 31 2019 and growing by 12 year over year in the second quarter average loans of 33 billion grew by 7 linked quarter annualized growth was well diversified across our major commercial and consumer loan portfolios our commercial real estate loans increased by 227 million 7 annualized followed by consumer which were up by 182 million or 9 annualized consumer loan growth was predominantly from single family mortgages our average c i loans increased by 157 million or 5 annualized average loan yields in the second quarter declined by 2 basis points linked quarter to 5 28 excluding accretion income second quarter 2019 adjusted average loan yields declined by 1 basis point to 5 26 reflecting an unchanged fed funds rate and the decline in libor rates on slide 5 you can see that total deposit grew to a record 36 5 billion as of june 30 2019 an increase of 204 million or 2 annualized from march 31 2019 and up by 3 7 billion or 11 year over year as of june 30 2019 our loan to deposit ratio was 92 5 and it was 93 4 based on average balances during the quarter as we have previously stated we are comfortable operating with a loan to deposit ratio in the range of 90 to 95 which is where we are currently at our cost to deposit increased by 4 basis points linked quarter to 1 11 this is a deceleration from recent trends and reflects proactive management of both deposit pricing and our success in growing lower cost deposits for comparison for the preceding four quarters the linked quarter increase in the cost of deposits had ranged from 12 basis points to 17 basis points in the second quarter average deposits of 35 3 billion grew by 5 linked quarter annualized primarily from an increase in time and noninterest bearing demand deposits partially offset by a decrease in money market accounts i m particularly pleased with the growth in noninterest bearing demand deposit this quarter despite a very competitive environment one of the highlights of the second quarter was a successful demand deposit campaign in our branch network geared toward small business owners the small business deposit campaign includes cash management products and resonates very well with our customers we have been able to generate new granular relationships whose growth and expansion we can support for many years to come and that in aggregate already have a meaningful impact to the bank turning to slide 6 our second quarter return on assets was 1 45 and return on equity was 12 9 excluding the impact of the reversal of previously claimed tax credits our operating return on assets was 1 74 and our operating return on equity was 15 5 our operating tangible return on equity was 17 4 this quarter despite macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility east west continues to execute over the past 12 months tariffs and trade tensions have ratcheted up yet east west has delivered attractive loan and deposit growth as well as attractive bottom line profitability year over year our loans have grown by 12 and our deposits have grown by 11 as you can see from the chart on slide 6 our profitability metrics are consistently attractive the five quarter range of our reported tangible return on equity has been 14 5 to 19 5 and excluding non operating items our operating tangible return on equity has ranged from 17 to 19 5 for the past five quarters an important factor in our ability to maintain consistently strong performance is the diversification of our balance sheet among various commercial and consumer business lines as well as the diversity of our customer base in our target markets u s china relationship entered a new normal that is more contentious and competitive however the interrelationship between the two economies is becoming more balanced most recently china has made some changes to open up its economy to foreign direct investments and improve intellectual property protections constructive policy changes such as these open up healthy new growth opportunities for the u s cross border business against this backdrop east west can play a more significant role as the financial bridge between the two largest economies in the world providing our clients with expertise to understand and navigate the changing u s china dynamic our knowledge combined with our cross border banking solutions gives us a differentiated approach to winning customers and i m confident that our teams will continue to generate sustainable core banking business in this current setting and now i would turn the call over to irene for a more detailed discussion of our income statement and outlook irene h oh executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you dominic on page 7 we have a slide that shows a summary income statement and a snapshot of notable items during the quarter this quarter we incurred 30 million of additional income tax expense for the reversal of previously claimed tax credits related to dc solar this impacted our eps by 0 21 per share our adjusted eps this quarter were 1 24 compared to 1 16 in the first quarter of 2019 an increase of 7 we reported an effective tax rate of 33 for the second quarter excluding the tax credit reversal our tax expense would have been 43 million and effective tax rate would have been 19 for the full year we project that our effective tax rate will be approximately 20 including the impact of the 30 million tax credit reversal from this quarter or approximately 15 excluding the tax credit reversal the full year tax rate assumes tax credit investments of 90 million in 2019 as of june 30 we had closed on 17 million of these investments moving on to slide 8 second quarter net interest income of 367 million increased by 1 linked quarter and grew by 8 year over year second quarter net interest income growth was largely due to loan growth partially offset by the decrease in the net interest margin the second quarter gaap net interest margin was 3 73 and the adjusted nim excluding the impact of accretion was 3 71 both margins contracted by 6 basis points linked quarter the impact of accretion income continues to be nominal it was 1 7 million in the second quarter compared to 2 2 million in the first quarter or 2 basis points of impact to the nim the 6 basis points quarter over quarter change in our net interest margin breaks down as follows a 1 basis point decrease from lower loan yields including fees and discounts a 1 basis point decrease from lower yields on other earning assets a 2 basis point decrease from higher funding costs and a 2 basis point decrease from the funding if shipped as dominic mentioned in his remarks we are making good progress on controlling our deposit costs this takes time but results were already evident in the second quarter as of june 30 2019 the end of period cost of our deposits was 1 11 down by 1 basis point from 1 12 as of march 31st the end of period cost of our interest bearing deposits was 1 57 as of june 30 up by only 2 basis points from 1 55 as of march 31st we expect to improve our deposit cost from here irrespective of any actions by the federal reserve of course cuts to the fed funds rate will also be helpful in reducing funding and deposit cost further date since the federal reserve started increasing the fed funds rate in december 2015 we had an implied beta of 56 on a loan yields excluding accretion and an implied beta of 37 on our cost of total deposits again relative to the change in the average fed funds rates please note we added slide nine to our earnings deck which has been a part of our investor deck this slide details our loan portfolio by the underlying interest rate indices you can see that 31 of the loan portfolio is tied to prime 27 is tied to the one month libor and 5 is tied to three month libor this is continued to contribute to the stability of our loan yields this quarter for context our weighted average loan yield was 5 27 for the month of june compared to 5 25 for the month of march or 5 20 for the month of december given the robust pace of our loan growth and the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet we have been moderating our overall asset sensitivity the percentage of fixed rate loans and hybrid loans in fixed rate periods is increasing as a proportion of our total portfolio up to 30 as of june 30 2019 compared to 25 a year ago this change largely reflects success in the origination of our 30 year fixed rate single family mortgage loan product that we d be planned to offer in august of last year similar to many of our single family residential loan products this is also a reduced documentation loan with a high down payment and low loan to value requirement it has been well received by our consumers customers and today is 50 of our new sfr originations current pricing for this 30 year loan product is 5 25 with no points at the beginning of 2019 we reintroduced wars at 50 basis points below the starting rate for new and renewal c i loans and we are more comfortable with originating fixed rate cre loans for smaller balances although customer preference during the second quarter has favored the variable rate option due to the shape of the rate curve in addition we have been managing our securities portfolio to maintain and essentially stable yield by replacing maturity cash flows with investments with both slightly higher yields and longer durations now turning to slide 10 total noninterest income in the second quarter was 53 million and fee income and net gains on sales of loans although 49 million a 25 increase from 31 million 39 million in the first quarter of 2019 as dominic discussed the fee income growth was primarily due to an increase in interest rate contract revenue which grew 7 million from last quarter this business line is a core segment of our income and we are pleased with its performance as a counterweight to interest income pressures and a decreasing interest rate environment foreign exchange income increased by 2 million linked quarter largely reflecting favorable revaluation of foreign currency denominated balance sheet items but foreign exchange customer revenue was also up quarter over quarter lending fees increased by 1 million reflecting broad based growth and ancillary loan fees and related income and letters of credit issuance fees including trade finance fee and credit enhancement fees moving to slide 11 second quarter noninterest expense was 178 million down 5 linked quarter due to a decrease in the amortization of tax credits and other investments our adjusted non interest expense excluding amortization of tax credit investments in core deposit intangibles was 160 million down by 1 linked quarter the largest decline was in compensation in employee benefits which are generally seasonally higher in the first quarter with the strong fee income growth this quarter our second quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was 38 compared to 39 8 in the first quarter over the past five quarters our adjusted efficiency ratio has been stable ranging from 37 9 to 39 9 our second quarter 2019 pre tax pre provision income of 260 million increased 7 quarter over quarter and our second quarter pre tax pre provision profitability ratio was 251 million compared to 243 million from the first quarter over the past five quarters our pre tax pre provision profitability ratio has ranged from 2 43 to 2 51 in slide 12 of the presentation we detail out critical asset quality metrics allowance coverage of loans continues to be stable and we had linked quarter decreases in both nonperforming assets and net charge offs our allowance for loan losses totaled 331 million as of june 30 or 98 basis points of loans held for investment compared to 97 basis points as of march 31st and 96 basis points as of december 31st 2018 nonperforming assets as of june 30 2019 are 119 million or 28 basis points of total assets compared to 138 million or 33 basis points of total assets at march 31st and 27 basis points of total assets a year ago the linked quarter decline in non performing assets largely reflects a decrease in non accrual commercial loans due to resolutions and pay offs during the second quarter our npas continue to be at historically low levels for the second quarter of 2019 our net charge offs were 8 million or annualized 9 basis points of average loans and we recorded provision for credit losses of 19 million this is a decrease from net charge offs of 14 million or 18 basis points of average loans and the provision for credit losses of 23 million in the first quarter of 2019 the annualized net charge off ratio was 14 basis points of average loans in the year ago quarter moving to capital ratios on slide 13 east west capital ratios remain strong tangible equity per share of 29 20 as of june 30 grew 30 linked quarter and grew by 17 year over year our regulatory capital ratios increased by 23 to 47 basis points year to date east west board of directors has declared third quarter 2019 dividends for the company s common stock the common stock cash dividend of 0 275 is payable on august 15 2019 to stockholders of record on august 1 2019 and with that i ll move on to reviewing our 2019 outlook on slide 14 our outlook covers results for the full year of 2019 compared to our full year 2018 results in light of the current forward interest rate curve we have updated our net interest income growth and net interest margin expectations we now assume to cost to the fed funds rate of 25 basis points each at the end of july and the end of october 2019 accordingly we now expect our adjusted net interest margin excluding the impact of discount accretion to range between 3 60 and 3 70 compared to 3 75 to 3 80 previously the anticipated impact of accretion income is unchanged at 2 basis points to the net interest margin achieving the high or low end of the net interest margin outlook will depend on our ability to reduce deposit costs particularly for exception price deposits in response to interest rate movements this will be a function of active deposit pricing strategy but also how market competitors price deposits overall in advance of the anticipated rate cuts we are seeing less pressure from customers for higher rates and request for exception price deposits we currently estimate that a 25 basis point fed funds cut would reduce our net interest income by approximately 1 5 to 2 using the static shock analysis but we will be able to offset that through organic balance sheet growth with the decreased nim outlook due to interest rates we now expect net interest income excluding discount accretion to grow at a high single digit percentage rate compared to a growth rate of low double digits previously the rest of the items of our outlook are unchanged including noninterest expense provision for credit losses and the full year tax rate and detailed out in this slide with that i will now turn the call back to dominic for closing remarks dominic ng chairman president and chief executive officer thank you irene we are pleased with the solid results of the second quarter and look forward to continued strong performance in the second half of the year and also with that i would now open up the call to questions operator questions and answers operator we will now begin the question and answer session our first question today comes from jared shaw of wells fargo securities please proceed jared shaw wells fargo securities analyst hi good morning irene h oh executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning jared dominic ng chairman president and chief executive officer good morning jared shaw wells fargo securities analyst maybe starting with the on the deposit side with the strong growth in the dda balances is that promotion still going on and i guess as we look out over the rest of the year how much more growth could you see from that dominic ng chairman president and chief executive officer yes that promotion is still going on we started like in early march and in fact was planning to be a few months and then but we are extending it to the end of august and we will continue to assess if it continue to go really well and then there s still like to it and it will continue to do more jared shaw wells fargo securities analyst okay and so if we see increased concentration there that could be a potential offset to some of the margin pressure dominic ng chairman president and chief executive officer we were hoping we are hoping that go into that direction because the most important thing that we do this business solution campaign is to really bring in more small business customers it wasn t really the intend to just as an offset against the deposit in terms of interest bearing deposits quite frankly it is helpful but our plan in the second half of the year is to really continue to proactively manage interest bearing deposit rate trying to scaled it down knowing that there will be an anticipation of fed fund rate cut and i feel that our frontline branch managers and branch staff and also our lending officers and relationship managers etc they very much understand that with this kind of like future interest rate direction there is high likelihood that rate is going to come down and therefore they are going to be working hard to ensure that we will walk accordingly to get the rate into appropriate level but in the meantime what i liked about the small business deposit campaign is that we will be and we have already been brought in over 2000 customers that these are the customers that i think that have a higher likelihood to grow and in the long run will be sort of very important core customers for our branches in terms of having these non interest bearing checking account customers not only because of the rate which is zero but more importantly they will be the kind of customers that can help us to get more referrals and then we can also get personal banking and wealth management banking etc jared shaw wells fargo securities analyst i guess what s driving such a stronger price strong response obviously that s really great growth in an environment that s difficult to find the dda growth is it more of the full relationship opportunity or is it just the sales opportunity the sales effort on the part of east west dominic ng chairman president and chief executive officer i think it s a combination of several folds one is that we bundle cash management products and then also merchant card services with these online banking account we make it very easy for these customers to sign up and on top of that our managers in different regions have done a really really good job in terms of targeting the small business customers and i think that it s a i would account most of the success coming from a very very laser strategic focus in terms of what are the demographics that most likely will resonate to this product package that we have and then we start going out there knocking on doors and visiting them and provide the type of suite of products services that we can provide to these customers which result in the kind of numbers that we have today so i think that mostly is coming from a well planned strategic focus in terms of targeting the right type of prospective clients and also good execution because our branch staff are extremely well trained in terms of able to articulate and explain why our product mix is more superior to what the community banks or some of the other money center banks that these folks are banking with and somehow that we got a lot more win than we originally anticipated jared shaw wells fargo securities analyst great thanks so much operator our next question comes from ebrahim poonawala of bank of new york merrill lynch please proceed ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning i m just wondering dominic if you could talk about the commercial loan growth so it looks relatively healthy i think we are in a period where there is some skepticism around loan growth generally given sort of late cycle concerns so would love to get your thoughts around where growth is coming both c i and cre side and why you feel ok from a credit perspective on bringing diesel on at this space at this currently dominic ng chairman president and chief executive officer well as you have seen in our earnings release that loan growth is coming from pretty well diversified categories cre single family mortgages c i all have decent growth and it s just one of those east west way of making sure that we do not have any over concentrated growth in one particular category and so when i look at it in terms of your view of late cycle i think that maybe for any particular specific category or industry may have some of these concerns but if we look at our single family mortgages we have always been very very focused in doing single family mortgage origination at very low loan to value and our commercial real estate also had very i mean lower loan to value than most of the peer banks in the country so we feel pretty good about where we are today the loans that we make so despite the fact that for example if you look at some of the prices there is that concern about maybe there is not that much upside but when we are making single family mortgage at about 50 60 loan to value yes our borrowers may not have much upside of appreciation but then clearly as a lender being east west bank we also don t have any downside so we feel pretty comfortable about these loans that we are making today ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it and it seemed like there is a possibility that the china us trade negotiation may get drawn out it doesn t look like to date from where i see there has been any material impact to your business and i realize it s hard to sort of provide clarity on this but as you think about if trade negotiation gets stretched out do you based on everything that you ve seen so far anticipate any impact either from a growth standpoint or credits standpoint dominic ng chairman president and chief executive officer at this point we feel pretty confident about with our guidance and our view is that east west work under many different scenario we have a very healthy well diversified balance sheet if any one particular category end up slowing down because of some external environment circumstances the other engine start going stronger and sort of the help balance it out i think if you look at the last 12 months this sort of tariff rhetorics and discussion in terms of media headlines has been going on for quite some time now and we continue to be able to put out these numbers because we have multiple engines that we can get going and this quarter is a good testament because if you looked at all different categories from c i cre single family it s all going strong so we feel pretty good that that we will be able to continue to put out the kind of financial performance that we expected and more importantly i think again i think we need to understand that east west in terms of our balance sheet in terms of our size we are substantially well we are very very small compared with these overall gdp between us and china so there are plenty of business for us to get with or without tariffs we are so minute in that universe and there were so much more that we can go after and even if that economy sort of like all that pie shrank down by 30 40 it s still a massive universe for us to business to do business i think the most important thing is that we always worked on making sure we have better knowledge longer expertise than the other banks in terms of understanding the space as long as we have that better knowledge and better expertise we always know how to navigate under whatever circumstances so with tariff there is one sort of there is one paradigm without tariff there is another direction so as i said in my remarks earlier you know this new normal of us china will be a little bit more competitive a little bit more contentious but on the other hand that doesn t mean they re not doing business as i mentioned earlier china actually have put into law welcoming foreign direct investments in financial services which includes insurance asset management banking etc and also allow us companies to have over 50 of maybe eventually 100 ownership in automobile industries and many other industries the business or the industry that are not allowed to invest in china that they called a negative list used to be like 400 to 500 industries that are forbidden to be in china has now shrunken down to only 48 so all of those are information that you looked at and in addition to the intellectual property protection law that they start sort of like putting in and strengthened it and all of those actually are providing an environment for foreign investment to gain more confidence to be investing in china now granted while there is a lot of political rhetorics that s going on back and forth the reality is that that gradual changes are being made so in the long run there is still going to be plenty of opportunity for east west to provide advisory services to our customers to help them from us to look into opportunity in china and also vice versa and the other thing don t forget is that east west has a very very strong retail banking business that mainly are focusing on the asian american population in united states and that really doesn t have a lot to do with the cross border business as you can see in the last quarter it is the retail branchers that step up and knocking on doors for small business owners which result in a substantial growth in our dda balances so we got plenty of engines to work on so that s why we feel pretty good about our prospects in the next six months and also the 2020 in addition to that i think that we will continue to focus on our diversification of our loan portfolio and making sure that we would never get ourself caught in a situation that we have over concentration in any particular category which result in undue risk ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it thanks for taking my questions operator our next question comes from brock vandervliet of ubs please proceed brock vandervliet ubs analyst great thanks for taking my question just to kind of follow up on that other one i can see from the guide and the 10 loan growth that speaks to the diversification so i understand that just drilling down more on the bridge banking and c i the c i its year over year growth is well under the double digit range not so much just sequentially are you seeing some evidence of slowing or more tentative behavior among your the chinese clients and the bridge banking business now irene h oh executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think honestly brock some of our numbers if you look at it year to date and year over year we did start off a little bit slow in the first quarter so if you look at a quarter over quarter and that growth rate maybe that s a little bit more normalized level we re not seeing anything i think systemic and also the first quarter honestly we got off to a slow start of the year brock vandervliet ubs analyst okay and skipping over to fees you noted the irc fee pick up and gearing to the current shape of the curve is that sustainable here irene h oh executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah that s a great question obviously with the levels the volumes and the number of transactions that we entered into with our client that s a function of the shape of the curve and how attractive the rates were we do expect with where things stand right now that we ll continue to have good fee income from our derivatives teams i think i ll also add probably realistically not the levels and the revenue levels in the second quarter but still at a good pace i d also add that over the course of the last couple of years here we ve expanded our capabilities the offerings as well expanding to energy derivatives were also helping more of our c i customers swap their interest rate risk as well so we re confident that this continued to be a strong line of business for us brock vandervliet ubs analyst got it thank you appreciate the color operator the next question comes from ken zerbe of morgan stanley please proceed ken zerbe morgan stanley analyst all right great thanks irene h oh executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning ken ken zerbe morgan stanley analyst maybe just good morning i guess maybe just going back to that loan growth question like i was thinking the same thing i d say you did get off to a slightly slower start but when you think about the loan categories like which is the category that you feel most comfortable that s going to accelerate in back half of 19 to reach your 10 target dominic ng chairman president and chief executive officer i think the single family mortgages we probably can continue to sustain and grow a little bit more in the second half irene h oh executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah and also c i as well right all categories dominic ng chairman president and chief executive officer yeah for c i usually there is seasonality we ve always come out much stronger in the fourth quarter so in the third quarter it may not be coming as strong but i think the likelihood of coming strong in the fourth quarter is much higher it s just tested in the last few years at east west bank we always have that sort of like fourth quarter a strong result because of the seasonality ken zerbe morgan stanley analyst got you okay and then switching gears in terms of the tax credit and amortization i think it was down a little bit this quarter can you guys provide any guidance in terms of where that might be for the next couple of quarters especially given the whole dc solar thing irene h oh executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so we don t really at this point in time expect any more impact from dc solar i ll also add the results for the second quarter we did have some equity pickup so small amount so that offset the amortization in that line item a couple of million or so but if we year ballpark what we re looking at is a little bit lower in the third quarter or we re showing 17 million in the third quarter and 23 million in the fourth quarter so you can plug that in ken zerbe morgan stanley analyst got you perfect and then just maybe if i could sneak in one last question just in terms of the tax credits i mean i understand dc solar was a very unusual one off kind of issue but when you think about the negative impact that dc solar had on your tax credit income like kind of all in how did that compare to sort of the benefit that you ve received over the last several years i mean i can t imagine it would offset all of the benefit but just trying to get a sense of magnitude irene h oh executive vice president and chief financial officer the benefit i think to our bottom line from our tax credit investment strategy far outweighs the impact of dc solar ken ken zerbe morgan stanley analyst okay all right thank you very much operator the next question comes from aaron deer of sandler o neill partners please proceed aaron deer sandler o neill partners analyst hi good morning everyone irene h oh executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning aaron deer sandler o neill partners analyst sticking with the theme of the loan growth i want to dig in just a little bit on the c i growth my guess is that some of the strength here this quarter came again from your syndication team given some of the scrutiny that we re seeing among the syndicated credit particularly in kind of higher leverage category can you talk about the types of credits that you re adding from that group and what kind of underwriting that you re employing with those irene h oh executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so our syndication team and the loans that we have there as a percent of our c i book as a percent of our loan book it s relatively at the same pace we re slightly under 3 of our total loan book what we try to maintain there is a high credit quality and diverse portfolio and we also maintain really a strict discipline as far as looking at the industries the sectors pricing to see if we want to sell even at a small loss so we re pretty comfortable with that as far as a discipline that we have of course the underwriting and the process is the same as every other loan that we have in our books as well aaron deer sandler o neill partners analyst okay and then on the deposit side it sounds like you re pretty confident that you should be able to bring some deposit costs down here can you talk about over the next couple of quarters what volume of cds you have expecting for renewal and where you think the offered renewal rates might be in those relative to what the majority rates are unidentified speaker sure so when we look at our levers for deposit repricing it really does come as you say from some of our cds that are maturing and then also we had discussed in the prepared remarks also some of our exception priced money market accounts so if we look over the course of the next six months next three months we have 2 5 billion of cds maturing debt the weighted average coupon on those rate on those is 1 97 billion approximately 25 of our total cd book and i think when we look at that honestly there is a fair portion of those where we think we can price that down over the course of also the next three months after that in the fourth quarter we have a similar level of cds that are maturing at a slightly higher cost aaron deer sandler o neill partners analyst okay great thanks for taking my questions operator our next question comes from michael young of suntrust please proceed michael young suntrust analyst hey thanks for the question just wanted to touch on irene the overall alco strategy and kind of where we re moving obviously we ve seen the higher preponderance of fixed rate originations you talked about some of the cd repricing but are there any other kind of levers that are being pulled or things you have in mind as we move forward in particular i saw like fhlb borrowings up a little bit so if you could just talk about some of those pieces irene h oh executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so from a balance sheet perspective yeah we are asset sensitive what we have done as i mentioned in the prepared remarks is look and see how we can organically kind of pivot that asset sensitivity into asset classes where we re comfortable risk relative to return and the shape of the curve we re getting paid enough for taking on that extension so for us because we have products such as a single family loan origination i knew that we d have that there is a little bit less competition we can get a little offer a fair rate for our customers but get a little bit more pricing so things like that i think makes sense for us and honestly with the shape of the curve going out long right now for cre is a little bit challenging we are slowly doing that for smaller balance customers but not in an expansive way on the overall funding side one of the actions that we did take in the second quarter was looking and pivoting to lower cost funding and that was some of the reasons why we went with the fhlb borrowing michael young suntrust analyst okay great and maybe just bigger picture this might be a question for dominic but you ve been pretty vocal in the past about your ability to bring down the expense base if needed if revenue kind of is a little more challenged obviously you ve kind of reduce the nii guide but maybe fees are kind of offsetting that so you don t feel the need to kind of pull that lever yet is that the right way to think about it dominic ng chairman president and chief executive officer yeah i mean also if you look at it is still a you look at our performance in the second quarter i thought it looks pretty good so in that standpoint i think that not that we would not be because of revenues growing strong that we would no need to manage expenses we never run the bank like that we run expenses in a most prudent way that is that there are areas that we need to invest for growth in the future and we re going to have to put the money for that purpose and then that there are way that we can not to spend too much obviously it s not that difficult for us to tighten the belt and this is something that we will continue to evaluate going forward and we are very fortunate and we like i said for the last 12 months we continue to put out some very decent profitability and if there is for whatever reason that suddenly the us and the global economy slowed down dramatically that really are not conducive for us to do i mean too much loan origination and so forth but we need to hunker down and then lower our expenses it wouldn t be that difficult for us to obvious duty what i call the logically writing and that s something that we always are active managers and we ll continue to active manage our balance sheet and actively manage our business michael young suntrust analyst okay thanks operator our next question comes from chris mcgratty of kbw please proceed chris mcgratty kbw analyst great thanks for the question dominic i m interested in your updated thoughts on capital management you guys are accumulating a lot of capital and you re also growing very quickly can you just update us on priorities the potential for a buyback if banks remain out of favor and maybe steps you might be taking to prepare for that thanks dominic ng chairman president and chief executive officer well we are always very actively looking at as i said before for the best to shareholders interest and the buyback discussion with the board has been sort of like become a more interesting topic for discussion but so we will continue to evaluate what you see is that you know again we have over 17 plus return of equity and we continue to find way to grow loans at as of the second quarter at 11 so at this stage right now we will continue to actively evaluate this potential buyback opportunity let s put it at that yeah chris mcgratty kbw analyst great and aside from that the other piece of the capital return tool would be inorganic growth it wouldn t seem like that would be kind of a necessity given the organic momentum is that kind of how you re thinking about inorganic growth entering the back half of the year dominic ng chairman president and chief executive officer well organic growth is what we ve been doing but obviously i we always want to have dry powder just in case there is any acquisition opportunities out there irene h oh executive vice president and chief financial officer we re assuming that s what you referred to with the inorganic growth chris mcgratty kbw analyst that s right irene h oh executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah ok dominic ng chairman president and chief executive officer okay yeah so i mean we will continue i mean we are pretty open minded there is really nothing specific that we sort of have a religion against it so the way that we look at it has always been higher dividends stock buyback acquisition organic growth we look at all of those different direction and i make sure that whichever one is best for our shareholders and then we ll put that as a first priority and then sometimes we are going to do all of them in the same time it all depends on the opportunities out there so what we re trying to do is that make a logical sound decision and make sure we take care of our shareholders chris mcgratty kbw analyst great and if i could slip one on the margin before i step back i think irene you said on the prepared remarks your deposit betas cycle today were about 37 and that really was 8 or 9 rate hikes i m interested in kind of your thoughts beyond the cd repricing on the ability what kind of assumed beta might you have if the fed cuts a couple of times any thoughts there would be great irene h oh executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah you know with our guidance that we ve given the assumption for the betas are really not that off from what we ve had historically we re assuming about 40 on the deposit side chris mcgratty kbw analyst great thank you operator the next question comes from matthew clark of piper jaffray please proceed matthew clark piper jaffray analyst hi good morning irene h oh executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning matthew clark piper jaffray analyst just on the buyback have you guys saw regulatory approval yet in case you do want to authorize one irene h oh executive vice president and chief financial officer we have not but also you know with the changes that s no longer necessary as well matt as of july 9th dominic ng chairman president and chief executive officer we don t need matthew clark piper jaffray analyst great and then just on dc solar i think there s about 18 million left i guess that s equity risk correct me if i m wrong but can you just give us an update as to why you think there is no need to further reduce that exposure irene h oh executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so the adjustments that we are doing is really like a book to tax provision adjustment with what we are the tax return that we are filing in october for the 2018 year and are also for 2017 we re making adjustment as well for tax investments that we made in the past in the 14 and 15 year at this point in time based on the information that we have we re comfortable taking the position that we ll be able to continue to receive those tax credits matthew clark piper jaffray analyst okay great thank you operator the next question comes from gary tenner of d a davidson please proceed gary tenner d a davidson analyst thanks good morning most of my questions have been asked but just as related to the small business deposit campaign i missed some of your prepared remarks have you is effectively all of the sequential growth in dda from that campaign or had do you quantified it in your prepared remarks irene h oh executive vice president and chief financial officer we haven t quantified in our prepared remarks but if you look at quarter over quarter a lot of the increase did come from that campaign dominic ng chairman president and chief executive officer a vast majority of the dda increases as these very small business accounts that we opened one at a time gary tenner d a davidson analyst and then so when you say a campaign i mean you re not obviously paying rate so is it just a marketing blitz in sales campaign or is there something else dominic ng chairman president and chief executive officer well we give out gifts like a backpack coolers yoga mat there are many choices gary tenner d a davidson analyst okay so kind of old school banking if you open a deposit dominic ng chairman president and chief executive officer yeah gary tenner d a davidson analyst okay thank you very much that s all i wanted to know operator the next question comes from lana chan of bank of montreal capital markets please proceed lana chan bmo capital markets analyst hi good afternoon i wanted to just circle back on funding for loan growth of 10 for this year i think previously you had assumed that you d be able to fund most of that growth through core deposit growth is that still the case or embedded any of margin guidance are you expecting more it to be funded by borrowings and maybe run off in securities irene h oh executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah at this point in our guidance we are not assuming that we will have more borrowings to fund that loan growth we think organically from all of the different avenues that we had and the success that we re seeing we will be able to fund that loan growth i d add to dominic s prepared remarks we did comment about the range of the loan to deposit ratio that we re comfortable with and we re within that that is also certainly something that we want to stay within but understanding that at 92 we have a little bit room if we want lana chan bmo capital markets analyst okay thank you appreciate it operator our next question comes from david chiaverini of wedbush securities please proceed david chiaverini wedbush securities analyst hi thanks question on credit quality so there was a nice improvement in non performing loans this quarter coming down about 20 million i was curious are you seeing any negative credit migration or stress on your borrowers from the tariffs at this point dominic ng chairman president and chief executive officer in terms of credit quality issues i think that we have borrowers that are having some challenges in terms of everyone sort of like getting a little bit concerned at the beginning because of what do we do with these tariffs because that uncertainty is i guess it drives a lot of headline news and then that caused maybe a lot of disruption in terms of stock market and so forth the reality is that our customers they all we have to find a way to figure out how to deal with this issue i mean as a matter of fact we have some of our relationship managers right now in asia touring factories in thailand and vietnam because our customers are doing some of the relocation just as expected so every single customer have a different way to deal with the tariffs and also east west are totally aware of any of the potential risk that comes from it and we manage our credit accordingly so as of today i think fortunately we do not have a single dollar of loss due to tariff david chiaverini wedbush securities analyst good to hear thanks very much dominic ng chairman president and chief executive officer are there any other questions and operator operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to dominic ng chairman and ceo for any closing remarks dominic ng chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator and thank you all for attending this conference and i look forward to speaking with you all in october thank you irene h oh executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you

some hawkish economists and analysts warned of an inflation breakout that would see people handing over buckets of cash for a loaf of bread loading instead inflation has fallen the rba whose stated aim is to have inflation between 2 and 3 per cent hasn t met its own goal for more than two years according to subbaraman and ticehurst the june and july rate cuts by the rba are part of a grander global central bank effort to run a hot economy despite near record low unemployment the aim as stated by rba governor philip lowe is to drive unemployment down to at least 4 5 per cent in a deliberate ploy aimed at lifting wages growth and with it the inflation rate with the australian economy motoring along rates will start to return to something approaching normal but that brave plan is just as hazardous as houdini getting out of a straitjacket while hanging from the top of a new york skyscraper no less than the head of the us federal reserve jerome powell told members of congress this month that the connection between low unemployment and higher inflation had become weaker over recent years to the point that it is now a faint heartbeat as subbaraman and ticehurst point out the lower interest rates go the less impact they have as debt levels grow australian household debt is among the highest in the world the ability to push up interest rates gets even more difficult the continuation of ultra loose monetary policy can support growth in the short run but it makes normalisation ever more difficult the nomura analysts argue loading it would be foolish for central bankers

some hawkish economists and analysts warned of an inflation breakout that would see people handing over buckets of cash for a loaf of bread loading instead inflation has fallen the rba whose stated aim is to have inflation between 2 and 3 per cent hasn t met its own goal for more than two years according to subbaraman and ticehurst the june and july rate cuts by the rba are part of a grander global central bank effort to run a hot economy despite near record low unemployment the aim as stated by rba governor philip lowe is to drive unemployment down to at least 4 5 per cent in a deliberate ploy aimed at lifting wages growth and with it the inflation rate with the australian economy motoring along rates will start to return to something approaching normal but that brave plan is just as hazardous as houdini getting out of a straitjacket while hanging from the top of a new york skyscraper no less than the head of the us federal reserve jerome powell told members of congress this month that the connection between low unemployment and higher inflation had become weaker over recent years to the point that it is now a faint heartbeat as subbaraman and ticehurst point out the lower interest rates go the less impact they have as debt levels grow australian household debt is among the highest in the world the ability to push up interest rates gets even more difficult the continuation of ultra loose monetary policy can support growth in the short run but it makes normalisation ever more difficult the nomura analysts argue loading it would be foolish for central bankers

when today friday july 19 2019 where interview airing on cnbc s closing bell the following is the unofficial transcript of a cnbc exclusive interview with boston fed president eric rosengren and cnbc s sara eisen which aired on cnbc s closing bell m f 3pm 5pm today friday july 19th the following is a link to video from the interview on cnbc com all references must be sourced to cnbc sara eisen i noticed that you don t mention president trump in your speech why is that eric rosengren because it s not specific to individuals and central bank independence is really about how the central banker behaves and how they respond and so the speech highlights that accountability is an important part of independence and so we re very accountable to congress we re not independent from congress but what we do have is goals set out by congress but independence on how we move those tools the tools being things like our balance sheet and interest rates and so it s very important in any kind of central bank that you have a clear goal that s set out by elected representatives but nonetheless have the flexibility to do the more technical aspects of central banking sara eisen do you think his constant and very public attacks at rallies and in tweets influences the credibility and independence in the fed ultimately eric rosengren it has no effect on how i think about monetary policy and people are entitled to opinions if we hear interesting and important facts that we haven t thought about we take that into consideration and unless it s data driven it doesn t have much of an influence on how i think about what we should be doing sara eisen there s a new tweet i ll just read you part of it i mean he says there s a faulty thought process we have going for us at the federal reserve we pay much higher interest rates than countries that are no match for us economically in other words our interest costs are much higher than their countries when they should be lower no thanks to the federal reserve had they not acted so fast so much we would do be doing even better than we are right now is he right that if we hadn t seen all the tightening we ve seen we d be more competitive eric rosengren well it s important to get back to what the goals of the federal reserve are so it s price stability and maximum employment so when we set interest rates it s not to focus on the exchange rate it s not to focus on the stock market it s to focus on in the medium to long term getting the right outcomes for inflation and unemployment and that s what we really are focused on in the meeting and so there are lots of collateral things that can happen when we raise or lower interest rates but really the attention is not to some of the things that sometimes you highlight on cnbc we re not focused on investors in particular we really are focused on getting the right outcome for that congressionally mandated price stability and maximum employment over time sara eisen do the tweets get mentioned during the meetings eric rosengren they do not sara eisen at all eric rosengren i can t recall them being mentioned at all sara eisen and you think that actually has no impact psychologically in the back of your mind that the president is making it very clear what he wants to see in terms of policy eric rosengren all i can say is it s not influencing how i think about monetary policy sara eisen i wanted to ask you about new york fed president john williams created quite some drama yesterday a spike up in odds of a 50 basis point cut in the july meeting after saying that actions should be taken swiftly to prevent an economic downturn they walked it back what exactly do you think was the communication objective here eric rosengren so i can t speak to other members of the fomc i really focus on how i m seeing the economy and my own view on the economy is that the economy is doing actually quite well so in terms we re not really having an economic slowdown if you take it back to the middle of june and think about where we were in the middle of june most of the data s come in pretty good so we had the g20 and while it wasn t a perfect outcome it was certainly a good outcome that we didn t have further disruption in trade if you look at the employment report the june employment report was quite strong much stronger than may if you average over the last three months a little bit over 170 000 payroll employment that s a strong employment result for the economy if you look at inflation the cpi came in stronger than people expected my own expectation is when we get the gdp report at the end of this week that core inflation is going to look pretty good and very consistent with what we re seeing with the dallas trimmed mean which is right at 2 and finally if you look at consumption the consumption data has been quite strong that s 70 of the economy and that s quite consistent i think with getting an overall gdp report we ll see next friday what we actually get but i m expecting something around 2 which is a pretty good outcome sara eisen so why are we talking about an interest rate cut in a few weeks eric rosengren so my own view is that unless the data actually starts showing some slowdown that s what we should really be focused on and the data to date we still have data before the meeting sara eisen so you re not in the cut camp eric rosengren so my focus is to see if there s any evidence that we re seeing a slowdown and to date i m not seeing that that doesn t mean there s not uncertainty and there s certainly uncertainty in trade and a lot of focus with trade and there s certainly uncertainty about some of our foreign trading partners so there s no doubt that china has been weakened by the trade concerns and their economy has been slowing down there s concerns in europe about a slowdown as well particularly with the potential of a more disruptive brexit so there s not there s certainly uncertainty in the world that we have to worry about and you don t just worry about how the current data s coming in you do have to think about how the data will be going forward but i would say most of the news that we ve been getting at least over the last month has been pretty good sara eisen so where are you on this idea of an insurance cut to cut rates preserve the downturn as the uncertainties and the outlook pile up eric rosengren so i think we need to separately a couple of ideas in that question one is uncertainty so uncertainty about what if you look at the vix the vix is not particularly elevated so that s telling you that the stock market s not particularly volatile relative to its history if you look at credit spreads credit spreads aren t particularly elevated if you thought we were about to go into a recession normally you see those spreads widen if you look at forecasting uncertainty and look at the survey of professional forecasters they re not particularly wide they haven t changed dramatically showing a concern of a recession so by those measures of uncertainty we re not seeing substantial uncertainty in terms of insurance and what you re taking insurance out against i would say that insurance is something that we normally take out when the stock market declines very substantially sara eisen we re at record highs eric rosengren so think of 9 11 think of ltcm think of october 87 those were all instances where we made the argument that we were taking out insurance they were all periods where financial markets had moved very substantially but we hadn t gotten economic data that indicated a slowdown and so we did take out insurance around those three instances as you just pointed out the stock market is close to highs the unemployment rate is close to a 50 year low so i think there are financial stability concerns it s not costless to take out insurance you pay a premium for the insurance and one of the ways that you think about that cost is what you re doing to financial stability so financial stability can come in many different respects but certainly a period where asset prices are elevated you should be a little concerned about actually heating up those asset prices if you think about leveraged loans and think about the corporate sector we have taken on a lot of leverage over this course of this recovery and there are some concerns that when we have the next downturn that could result in an amplification of that downturn so we have to think about some of the collateral effects of taking out that insurance so we need to think about the potential costs i agree with the overall view that if we are going into what is clearly a downturn you want to act aggressively and the reason for that is because we don t have that much room before we hit zero interest rates so we don t want sara eisen but you re not convinced that s where we are eric rosengren i m not convinced that the data that we re seeing right now shows that and the uncertainty is something that we have to live with you know by traditional measures of uncertainty i don t think they re particularly elevated certainly the trade concerns are a concern certainly the foreign concerns are a concern sara eisen see i was going to ask you 25 basis points or 50 basis points cut it sounds like you re not even in the camp that we should be cutting right now eric rosengren wait and see how the additional data comes in we have a gdp report and i don t have a make a decision until the sara eisen the last print eric rosengren week of the fomc sara eisen had a three handle in front of it i mean and you ve been saying all the positive data so it sounds like what you re saying is the cost of moving cutting while the economy is doing quite well is actually higher than the cost of not doing anything if we are headed into more uncertainty in a downturn eric rosengren well these are all judgment calls and so in order to determine whether the economy is the economy has definitely slowed down from where we were last year we were growing around 3 last year we re talking about more like 2 growth 2 growth is definitely less than 3 but it s still a little bit stronger than we what we think the potential for the economy is so given that the economy is quite strong given that i do think that inflation is going to be very close to 2 and given that the growth in the economy is satisfactory i think that s an environment where you don t have to take a lot of action now should the economy change if the trade situation changes dramatically if we start getting surprised by how slow china or europe are then that s something we definitely should react to sara eisen there are pockets of weakness though manufacturing industrial production capital spending what story is that telling eric rosengren so we care about gdp overall we don t target individual components of gdp so consumption s quite strong how do you get with consumption strong a 2 growth rate when consumption s 70 of the economy it s implying that business fixed investment s going to be a little bit weaker and it s implying that the net export side s not going to provide a lot of oomph to the economy so when you balance that all out 70 is pretty strong the other 30 is a bit weak one of the reasons it s weak is because of some of the trade issues that we ve been seeing but when you balance it out we get an economy growing about what you would expect at this stage of the cycle sara eisen what about the bond market it s now pricing in multiple interest rate cuts for this year what is the bond market seeing that you re not seeing eric rosengren so one of the things that the bond market s showing the ten year has come down quite substantially it s gone from roughly 3 25 down to the low twos my interpretation of that is a lot of the easing that s occurred so that is an an easing it s a sara eisen yeah eric rosengren financial accommodation the long it s less expensive now to borrow long than it was before i would argue that the main reason that s occurring is because of the weakness in our trading partners so the ecb has made several announcements that they are likely to continue easing if you look at the german ten year bond it s negative right now so the entire yield curve in germany is negative rates in japan are very low as well so when global rates of many of our major trading partners are coming down that has an influence on u s markets and so one of the ways that would manifest itself is downward pressure on our ten year rate so i don t take as much information from the ten year bond being low right now in terms of what that means potentially for an economic downturn i know there are plenty of people who do focus on slope of the yield curve or focus on the ten year bond but i think right now in the current environment where we re seeing such low rates around the world it s not surprising at all to me that our rates have come down they re still much higher than they are in japan or german for example sara eisen you mentioned trade as one of the uncertainties weighing on growth how much do you think the tariffs and the uncertainty that s created over the next move between the u s and china specifically is hurting the economy eric rosengren i think right now it s probably tense if we had tariffs on the remaining amount of trade with china and presuming that china would respond to that as well i think then you would be talking about products that affected consumers in a much more direct way so in many respects consumer it hasn t been as obvious to consumers because most of the products that have been targeted have not been consumer products so if there were another round i think it would be much more visible i think it would be concerning particularly if that occurred in addition to additional tariffs on europe so there has been talk about auto tariffs and other tariffs being imposed that s not my expectation so when i m making a forecast right now i m assuming that there s not another round of tariffs that occur sara eisen sort of on a similar line how much do you think the strong dollar which is overvalued by many measures including imf this week is weighing on the economy eric rosengren so we care about the overall economy right now so my forecast for the economy is roughly 2 growth for this quarter and continued around 2 growth over the rest of the year so is the trade sector slowing us down relative to where we otherwise would be it certainly is is it slowing us down enough that i would be concerned not if we re growing at 2 and that s because the consumer is also having a lot of good news the stock market is at a high the unemployment rate is at a low sara eisen a lot of people think the stock market is at a record high and has taken this leg higher on expectation that the federal reserve is going to be cutting interest rates so do you factor that into your thinking when it sounds like what you want is not a cut and that would be a disappointment to the market eric rosengren so one of the financial stability concerns is you want sustainable growth over time and if you push financial markets too much if you look at the last two recessions the recession with the dot com bubble was that stock prices became too inflated and had to come down and certainly the financial crisis it wasn t just the stock market but it was certainly a contributing factor in why the economy got so weak so we should care about financial stability the last two recessions have a very large financial stability component so we don t want interest rates to be so low that we push asset prices only temporarily up only to be disappointed as time goes on and have more of a reaction on the negative side when the economy does slow sara eisen isn t that what s happening though eric rosengren right now it s all on the upside but i think as long as the economy s doing well if that continues we don t need accommodation sara eisen do you feel pressure by the fact that other central banks have sort of kicked into easing year this year including some of the biggies like you mentioned the ecb eric rosengren well the other countries are in a very different place so their unemployment rate is not at 50 year lows and their stock market is not at all time highs so each country has to decide for its own situation what appropriate monetary policy is the fact that other countries are in a much weaker situation it makes sense if i was in japan or if i was at the ecb that i d seriously be thinking about easing the u s economy is not at that point the economy is actually quite quite reasonable at this stage so if that were to change i d be happy to ease at that point but i don t want to ease if the economy is doing perfectly well without that easing sara eisen so who s who s going to have a tougher job christine lagarde or jay powell eric rosengren i think everybody has a tough job in central banking sara eisen another question there has been a nomination judy shelton and for the federal reserve board of governors obviously has to get senate confirmation she s been an advocate of the gold standard and this idea of sound money do you think that s a health conversation to have right now inside the fed eric rosengren so we welcome diversity of views my own personal view is

by elimc first of all i am going to say that there are definitely people who have a financial interest in selling fear i would be wary of anyone who claims to know the future having said that i am going to be a contrarian and say that it is possible that we can have hyperinflation at some point i say this because i have a fundamental question about whether or not democracy can coexist with free market capitalism there is an area of economics called rational choice theory most rational people don t like free markets even rich ceos don t want their own corporations to exist in a free market they want their competitors to live in a free market and they want their own companies to be subsidized by the government now think about someone who pays no federal income tax the person who pays no federal income tax receives benefits from the government at no cost mitt romney was right when 47 of the population paid no federal income tax in 2009 they will rationally decide to vote for the politicians who promise free money and low taxes i m not promoting any politicians on either side of the aisle as their self interests are rarely aligned with my own this may be bad for our country in the long term but it is completely rational for the voter who is receiving short term gain since 1975 the united states has spent more on entitlement spending than on the rest of the budget combined the majority of government expenses are cash transfers with social security old people are taking money from the labor of their grandchildren who will likely be poorer than them this is known as inter temporal maximization it is rational for the elders to vote for a program that will burden their grandchildren in fact their grandchildren could not even vote to stop social security because they were not born yet this is an example of democracy is creating an ever larger government the size of the government continues to grow medicine housing and education have all skyrocketed in price and created massive inequality this is due to actions by the government stopping these problems would require the government to get out of these sectors for example all economists from both sides of the aisle agree that the mortgage interest deduction needs to be eliminated however no politician will ever do it because it goes against their rational self interest of keeping their job the voters would vote them out because of rational choice theory we can guarantee that the goal of politicians will be to hold hearings on steroids in baseball and giving ribbon cutting ceremonies the unpalatable alternative to these insignificant actions is to try to fix actual problems in society by reforming populist programs we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us if you follow the linear trajectory of increasing government interference in the free market over the last 100 years and if you understand rational choice theory you realize the inevitable conclusion is a cumbersome bureaucracy where business only succeed or fail with the blessing of politicians because gdp growth is so low in this scenario the federal reserve is forced to print money to make up for policy failures in dc but this merely creates more inequality because of overinflated asset prices and hides the lack of real gdp growth when enough years pass by and enough debt builds up people start to lose confidence in the dollar because gdp growth only comes from printing people get concerned that the dollar can truly be the reserve currency of the world if we reach this point the gold bugs will be vindicated is the us going to have hyperinflation we don t know 100 years ago the federal reserve didn t even understand how to manage a currency that wasn t backed by gold so i doubt we have everything figured out however we really don t know when if hyperinflation will happen however the market can stay irrational longer that you can stay solvent so even if you are correct that hyperinflation is coming and you hedge your position with gold you might die of starvation before the fiat apocalypse happens if you watched too big to fail there is an autistic character who figures out housing is overvalued before anyone else however his fund almost goes bankrupt waiting for the crisis to happen and he has to freeze jittery investors accounts so they won t withdraw their money from his fund you don t want to predict a crisis too early here is a strategy if you believe in hyperinflation put 5 of your money into precious metals or cryptocurrency if hyperinflation of the us dollar occurs and precious metals cryptocurrency goes up 20x you are still hedged 100 of your original position of course at that point it might not matter because society could turn into a post katrina situation where people are killing each other for ice cubes wealth might simply be whoever has the most guns and water at that point there have been a number of currency collapses over the years i have a 25 million dollar bill from zimbabwe but it is worthless because there currency collapsed a few years ago and now no one accepts zimbabwe dollars for anything except maybe as a gag gift

china is keeping all its economic policy tools within reach as the trade war with the united states gets longer and costlier but still sees more aggressive action like interest rate cuts as a last resort should the dispute get uglier policy sources say heading off a sharper economic slowdown remains beijing s top priority though officials fear easing too much could fuel debt and financial risks according to government advisers involved in internal policy discussions the politburo a top decision making body of the ruling communist party is expected to meet later this month to discuss economic and policy issues for the rest of 2019 barring a trade meltdown or other shock the most likely options to boost growth in coming months include more fiscal spending and liquidity infusions by the central bank in various forms sources said building on similar steps over the past year but financial markets may be more focused on what china signals in early august if the u s federal reserve cuts interest rates as widely expected on july 31 while a fed cut would give china more room to move possibly with a symbolic trimming of its short term market rates reuters sources said there was no urgency do so noting there is already ample liquidity in the financial system and asserting earlier stimulus measures are showing signs of kicking in monetary policy should be a bit looser we should cut rates after the fed but the benchmark rate is not very useful one said but a second source said the central bank could still cut the benchmark if economic conditions deteriorate sharply under special circumstances if the external shock is strong the fed continues to cut rates and the global economy is bad and trade frictions return it s possible to cut the benchmark once the main aim of using this tool is stabilising market confidence further reductions in banks reserve requirement ratios rrr are likely freeing up more funds for lending to sectors of the economy facing the biggest strains the sources said the people s bank of china pboc has already cut levels six times since early 2018 we can use other tools if such things shocks don t happen the room for cutting rrr for all banks is not big the room for a targeted rrr cut is bigger the second source said president donald trump said on tuesday the united states still has a long way to go to conclude a trade deal with china but could impose tariffs on an additional 325 billion worth of chinese goods if it needed to do so the policy sources said china s government will prevent quarterly economic growth from falling below 6 in the second half the lower end of beijing s 6 6 5 full year target range the state council information office the central bank and the finance ministry did not immediately respond to reuters requests for comment debt risks on the rise again chinese policymakers have repeatedly vowed not to open the credit floodgates in an economy already saddled with piles of debt a legacy of massive stimulus during the global financial crisis in 2008 09 and subsequent downturns but after stabilising in 2018 debt is on the rise again as the government ramps up stimulus the pboc reportedly told banks recently to stop cutting mortgage rates amid concerns about the risks of a property bubble the policy room is not that big as we ve been doing a lot on both monetary and fiscal policy fronts already said another source we cannot print too much money that will have big side effects china s total corporate household and government debt rose to 303 of gdp in the first quarter of 2019 from 297 in the same period last year the institute of international finance iif said this week faltering growth debate over whether china needs more forceful easing heightened this week after data showed second quarter economic growth slowed to a 27 year low weighed by weak demand at home and abroad amid intensifying u s trade pressure but june factory output retail sales and investment all grew more than expected raising hopes that policy loosening over the past year is beginning to pay off i don t expect any big policy changes said the first source external demand may weaken in the second half but policies unveiled earlier could help boost domestic demand beijing is leaning more heavily on fiscal stimulus this time round it has announced tax cuts of nearly 2 trillion yuan 290 83 billion and a quota of 2 15 trillion yuan for special bond issuance by local governments for infrastructure projects though more issuance would push up overall debt levels one option is to let local governments sell even more bonds but this could only be considered if the economy continues to falter and more funds are needed to keep projects going once the quota is used up insiders said in the first half local governments net bond issuance was already 70 7 of the annual quota the sources also said beijing is putting a high priority on employment in crafting policy amid concerns about social stability

president trump dramatically escalated his pressure on the federal reserve to cut interest rates later this month attacking for the first time the federal reserve bank of new york in his months long criticism of the central bank trump has sharply criticized the fed for almost a year saying its decision to raise interest rates four times last year squelched economic growth and prevented the stock market from rallying we are in a world competition winning big but it is no thanks to the federal reserve trump wrote in a series of twitter posts friday morning had they not acted so fast and so much we would be doing even better than we are doing right now this is our chance to build unparalleled wealth and success for the u s growth which would greatly reduce debt don t blow it advertisement many economists dispute his views warning that low interest rates at this point in the business cycle could create dangerous bubbles that damage the economy with little notice but the fed appears almost certain to cut interest rates later this month taking an unusual step when the unemployment rate is below 4 percent one reason trump has continued to exert pressure on the fed is a growing fear that the economy could be slowing a predicament that could cause major political headaches for republicans heading into 2020 in explaining their openness to cutting rates this year fed officials have cited slowing global growth low inflation and uncertainty caused by trump s trade war as the principle reasons why they would make the step fed leaders are set to announce what they will do with the interest rate on july 31 wall street widely expects a cut but there is heavy debate about whether it will be a modest reduction or a more sizable one the benchmark u s interest rate is currently in a range of 2 25 to 2 5 percent a low level by historical standards but the highest rate since the great recession rocked the global economy a decade ago advertisement few presidents in modern history have publicly jawboned the central bank as much as trump and it has raised concerns about politicization and the prospect that trump has eroded the central bank s independence but trump and top aides have brushed the criticism aside and continued their blistering attacks the upshot for americans and businesses is that the cost of borrowing money is likely to fall in the coming months which white house officials hope will lead to more business investment and a higher stock market it is one of many ways trump is trying to juice the economy heading into the 2020 elections trump has also sought major tax cuts and spending increases as a way to boost growth even while driving up the deficit and he has pressured foreign leaders to lower oil prices in a way that he believes will help the u s economy advertisement aside from his constant verbal attacks trump has tried to transform the fed in numerous ways he has appointed all but one of its current five governors and he has announced intentions to nominate two more after four others were unofficially rejected by the senate the stock market was mostly flat last year with investors spooked about various trade wars launched by trump against china and other countries the stock market has rallied for much of 2019 setting fresh records this month in part driven by comments from the fed that it will stop raising interest rates and multiple hints that it plans to lower the cost of borrowing soon share this article share trump has taken credit for the stock market increase in recent weeks but he has only ramped up his pressure on the fed not to reverse course that appeared to be the purpose of his criticism aimed at federal reserve bank of new york president john williams in part because some thought the fed official was showing signs of waffling advertisement williams who is considered one of the fed s most prominent voices appeared to strongly suggest that the central bank would make a larger than expected cut in july a sentiment that boosted the stock market when you only have so much stimulus at your disposal it pays to act quickly to lower rates at the first sign of economic distress williams said thursday in a speech at the central bank research association the new york fed tried to walk back the remarks later in the day with a spokesperson saying that williams was referring to what the right course of action is generally not for the end of this month in a twitter post trump wrote i like new york fed president john williams first statement much better than his second he wrote his first statement is 100 correct in that the fed raised far too fast too early advertisement there is an active debate on wall street about whether the fed will do a modest quarter point interest rate cut or a more substantial 50 point reduction trump is signaling his strong preference for the bigger cut but wall street currently gives that a 41 percent likelihood according to the cme fedwatch tool where investors make predictions about what the fed will do up until this point trump had leveled almost all of his fed criticism at the central bank s chairman jerome h powell someone trump nominated for the job in late 2017 trump has asked aides whether he has the power to remove powell from the fed and has frequently refused to express confidence in powell s stewardship of the central bank powell has said he works independently of political interference but trump has sought to install political loyalists on the central bank in recent months in an effort that some lawmakers worried would have eroded the institution s economic integrity advertisement trump s recent demands for low interest rates are a marked departure from the exact opposite viewpoint he used to hold when it came to the central bank in 2011 trump attacked the fed then led by chairman ben bernanke for keeping interest rates low

christopher j meade general counsel and chief legal officer good morning everyone i m chris meade the general counsel of blackrock before we begin i d like to remind you that during the course of this call we may make a number of forward looking statements we call your attention to the fact that blackrock s actual results may of course differ from these statements as you know blackrock has filed the reports with the sec which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of blackrock to differ materially from what we say today blackrock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward looking statements so with that i ll turn it over to gary gary s shedlin chief financial officer thanks chris and good morning everyone it s my pleasure to present results for the second quarter of 2019 before i turn it over to larry to offer his comments i ll review our financial performance and business results while our earnings release discloses both gaap and as adjusted finance results i will be focusing primarily on our as adjusted results global trade tensions once again escalated in the second quarter and market volatility followed us equities climbed to record highs though domestic equity markets move down 7 in may only to increase 7 in june our emerging markets remain challenged and the 10 year treasury bond traded below 2 finance accelerated rebalancing and derisking activity shifting out of equities and into fixed income and cash blackrock s globally diverse investment platform combined with industry leading risk management and portfolio construction technology was purposely designed to not only withstand today s market volatility but thrive in it our strategic positioning fosters deeper partnerships with clients enables us to meet their goals in a variety of market environments and drives more consistent and differentiated organic growth blackrock generated a record 151 billion of total net inflows in the second quarter with 9 annualized organic asset growth as clients once again turned to blackrock for solutions oriented advice to meet their long term investment needs lower total organic base fee growth of 3 reflected mix change favoring lower fee fixed income and cash assets and the impact of volatility driven outflows from higher fee ishares s financial instruments and precision exposures during the month of may second quarter revenue of 3 5 billion was 2 lower than a year ago driven in part by lower securities lending revenue and lower performance fees in the current quarter including 61 million of costs associated with the successful launch for closed end fund operating income of 1 3 billion was down 11 compared to a year ago earnings per share of 6 41 was down 4 as lower operating income and higher effective tax rate were partially offset by higher non operating income and a lower diluted share count in the current quarter non operating results for the quarter reflected 79 million of net investment income primarily driven by the revaluation of certain strategic minority investments and higher marks on unhedged fixed income fee capital investments but also reflected additional interest expense associated with the mid april issuance of debt to partially finance the acquisition of efront our as adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 24 we continue to estimate the 24 as a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2019 so the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of non recurring or discrete items and the issuance of additional guidance on tax legislation second quarter base fees of 2 9 billion were down 1 year over year despite the positive impacts of organic growth and acquisitions primarily driven by lower securities lending revenue the negative impacts of divergent equity beta and foreign exchange movements on average aum and strategic pricing investments quarterly securities lending revenue declined 33 million or 18 compared to record levels a year ago due to reduced gross exposures partially linked to hedge fund deleveraging in the second half of 2018 lower demand for hard to borrow us equities in the softer m a environment and lower spreads in addition the trend of reduced european seasonal demand continued from previous years divergent equity beta and fx continue to impact year over year base fee growth while the s p 500 was up 7 on average year over year many markets linked to our higher fee equity products including asia emerging markets and global natural resources were down 8 over the same time period resulting in an overall decline of 2 in our revenue weighted equity composite index dollar appreciation over the last year had a negative 1 impact on our year over year base fee growth sequentially base fees were up 3 as a result of higher average aum and the effect of one additional day in the quarter on an equivalent day count basis our overall fee rate declined 0 4 basis points in the second quarter reflecting this diversion equity beta and the impact of mix shift toward lower fee fixed income and cash assets performance fees of 64 million decreased 30 from a year ago reflecting lower revenue from long only equity products however we have seen improved performance in many of our single strategy hedge funds since year end better positioning us to generate performance fees in the second half of the year quarterly technology services revenue increased 20 year over year reflecting continued momentum in institutional aladdin and the impact of the efront acquisition which closed in may the combination of efront with aladdin sets a new standard and investment in risk management technology and reinforces aladdin s value proposition as the most comprehensive investment operating system in the world as larry will discuss in more detail overall demand remained strong for our full range of technology solutions and we are already seeing revenue synergies related to the combination of efront and aladdin advisory and other revenue of 53 million was down 25 million year over year primarily reflecting lower fees from advisory and transition management assignments total expense was up 4 year over year driven by higher g a expense which reflected fund launch costs and acquisition related expense in the current quarter g a expense was up 77 million year over year and 82 million sequentially primarily due to 59 million of product launch costs associated with closed end fund launches during the quarter we exclude the impact of these product launch costs when reporting our as adjusted operating margin quarterly g a expense also included approximately 20 million in professional fees and contingent consideration fair value adjustments related to historical acquisition activity intangible amortization expense was up 10 million sequentially reflecting amortization of intangible assets acquired in the efront acquisition our second quarter as adjusted operating margin of 43 1 was down 210 basis points from a year ago but up 120 basis points sequentially as us equity markets return to historic highs from a year ago despite a more challenging overall revenue capture environment driven by current market volatility we continue to see strong performance in future drivers of differentiated growth including etfs alternatives technology and portfolio construction and remain deeply committed to investing responsibly for the long term our capital management strategy has always been to first invest in our business and then return excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases in connection with the previously mentioned efront acquisition which closed on may 10 we raised 1 billion in 10 year debt at a 75 basis point spread to treasuries this represented the tightest credit spread ever for a 10 year senior debt issuance by public asset manager as a reminder in the first quarter we completed our targeted level of share repurchases for 2019 repurchasing 1 6 billion worth of common shares while we will be opportunistic in repurchasing additional shares during the remainder of the year we did not repurchase any shares of common stock in the second quarter quarterly net inflows of 151 billion were positive across asset classes investment styles regions and client types flows from particularly strong demand across our fixed income platform reflecting changing client preferences and validate our unique ability to partner with clients globally to meet their long term needs in a variety of margin environments blackrock s institutional franchise generated a record 87 billion of net inflows representing 6 annualized organic base fee growth those were led by fixed income and reflected demand for our top performing active strategies and liability driven investment solutions institutional active net inflows of 73 billion were driven by 59 billion of active fixed income flows which included two sizable client wins blackrock s global insights and unique ability to offer a holistic solutions are resulting in more significant strategic fundings than ever before multi asset net inflows reflecting continued growth in our life path target date franchise and active equity net inflows of 3 billion were primarily into quantitative strategies where long term performance remains strong ishares net inflows of 36 billion representing 8 annualized organic asset growth reflected continued growth in core fixed income factor and sustainable etfs as previously seen in periods of significant market volatility similar to the dynamic we saw in 2018 we saw outflows from higher fee financial instrument and precision exposure etfs which clients used to express real time capital market sentiment and tactically allocate risk exposure quarterly outflows from these products resulted in ishares annualized organic base fee growth of 1 for the second quarter and had a dilutive impact on blackrock s overall annualized organic base fee growth ishares cross 2 trillion in aum during the quarter and achieved a number one share of industry flows globally in the us and in europe and in key product areas including fixed income factors and sustainable etfs we continue to project a doubling of the global etf market by the end of 2023 including significant growth in fixed income factors and esg as well as in europe retail net inflows of 2 billion reflected strength in blackrock s municipal fixed income franchise and the event driven liquid alternatives funds as well as the successful close of the 1 4 billion blackrock science and technology trust too blackrock s largest closed end fund launch in the last seven years and the industry s largest in the last five years momentum in our alternatives franchise continued with approximately 3 billion of retail and institutional net inflows in the second quarter in addition we have approximately 24 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of alternative strategies representing a significant source of future base and performance use finally blackrock s cash management platforms were 26 billion of net inflows as we continue to leverage scale for clients and deliver innovative digital distribution and risk management solutions in summary our second quarter results highlight the value clients place in our investment platform and our ability to use technology and risk management to develop broad based solutions across etfs alpha seeking and alternative strategies while we can t control market volatility the diversification and breadth of our business positions us to serve clients in a variety of environments helping to drive consistent and differentiated organic growth through economic cycles we will continue to invest responsibly on behalf of clients and shareholders to execute our strategy for long term growth with that i ll turn it over to larry laurence d fink founder chairman and chief executive officer thanks gary good morning everyone and thank you for joining the call for several quarters i ve spoken about the increasing depth and breadth of conversations blackrock is having with clients and this quarter s results demonstrates how those conversations are resonating leading to significant strategic wins we generated 151 billion of total net inflows in the second quarter representing 9 annualized organic growth inflows were driven by a record activity in fixed income and cash and were positive across all client types asset classes regions and both active and index strategies as clients assessed the full breadth of blackrock s platform in a more volatile environment the deliberate investments we have made in blackrock s investment and technology platform are manifesting in the quality and quantity of our engagements with clients while financial results are not immune to market volatility as gary described we have we are having comprehensive conversations with more clients globally than ever before about outcomes and solutions asset allocation portfolio construction and investment in risk management technology the combination of these capabilities and expertise into a one blackrock approach gives us a distinct and unique global perspective and gives us a distinct voice with so many clients around the world and it is translating into a larger deeper strategic mandates for blackrock following improved investor sentiment and global equity market rally to the start of the year macro and geopolitical uncertainty once again returned the us china trade tensions flared renewing concerns about a slowdown in global growth emerging markets equities have been negatively impacted and are down for the quarter at the same time us equities have hit a record high in europe while uncertainties around brexit continue to weigh on investor sentiment a focus on interest rate policy has also led to an unusual situation where a strong demand for safety has supported fixed income price appreciation while equities have been delivering income and after a period of rising rates both the federal reserve in the ecb has shifted toward a more dovish stance the market now expect several federal reserve rate cuts by the end of 2020 and the ecb has highlighted a readiness to introduce new easing measures to address inflation shortfalls and hopefully to extend the economic expansion the combinations of these events on top of the melt up in us equity markets has driven a shift in risk sentiment in financial markets globally investors are derisking and rebalancing out of equities into fixed income and cash in order to achieve their intended asset allocations in their portfolios as the investment landscape evolves clients continue to turn to blackrock today clients are looking for better more resilient portfolios that can help them meet their goals they continue to demand transparency value and convenience in addition to sustainable long term returns and better long term outcomes blackrock s client centric approach and scale positions us well to deliver on each of these client demands as our investments in asset allocation our investments in portfolio construction a spectrum of investment solutions and technology along our ability to bring all of those capabilities together that are generating growth and long term value for blackrock shareholders last month blackrock crossed the 10 year anniversary of our announcement to acquire barclays global investors our willingness to disrupt ourselves in the industry by bringing active and index together is creating the foundation of what blackrock is today more importantly what makes that transaction and each of our subsequent acquisitions so successful was our desire and discipline to integrate the organizations into one one platform one unifying global culture and one technology while we face a different landscape in a set of challenges now the culture and the approach that drove us to that combination 10 years ago are just as relevant today a willing to reimagine our business to think comprehensively about our clients portfolios and to innovate and to use technology in new ways all to help meet our clients needs blackrock s global voice is translating into large client wins with insurance companies pension and wealth distribution partners our conversation with clients are about understanding their investment challenges and helping them shape and execute strategic portfolio construction decisions the strong organic asset growth we saw in the second quarter reflects this approach and contributed to record institutional net inflows driven by a number of significant strategic client mandates as clients chose to derisk and rebalance their portfolios blackrock saw significant demand for fixed income strategies we generated our second consecutive record quarter for fixed income with a 110 billion of net inflows diversified across our active and index fixed income platforms inflows were led by a 65 billion into active fixed income strategies where performance remain strong with 82 and 86 of the assets above the benchmark or peer medium for the three and five year periods we also saw increased demand in our cash management business which generated net inflows of 26 billion representing a 23 annualized organic asset growth results benefited from client derisking activity as well as a number of significant cash client wins in addition to the ability of our diverse investment platform the capture shifts in client preferences across asset classes long term growth for blackrock will be driven by our strategic positioning and our competitive advantages blackrock has the most diverse investment platform by investment style from index and ets to alpha seeking and to illiquid alternatives which enables us to be the leader in the industry and to do more toward portfolio construction to have global scale in our increasingly establishing a local identity which positions us to capture growth in high potential markets around the world and we have leading risk management and technology capabilities to serve the entire asset management value chain these differentiators aligned with areas of highest client demand and are fueling blackrock s ability to grow faster than the industry average ishares is one of those areas of highest client demand and generated 36 billion of net inflows in the second quarter ishares captured the number one market share of etf flows globally in europe and united states and a diversified mix of high growth categories including fixed income factors and sustainable etfs as well as the core area of our etf platform flows were led by fixed income in core and included 9 billion of net inflows into factor and sustainable etfs we also saw clients use certain financial instruments and precision exposure etf to express risk off views and tactical asset allocation decisions it is a high secondary market liquidity and the unique options and lending markets around these etfs that it make them so valuable to institutional investors as gary mentioned risk off and volatility driven outflows from these higher feed etf mass organic fee growth across other ishares categories all of which are longer term in nature ishares crossed an important milestone in the quarter reaching 2 trillion in aum this is just five years after reading 1 trillion and 10 years since we acquired the 385 billion franchise importantly 80 of growth over the last five years has been driven by client inflows and we remain confident in the long term secular growth opportunities for etfs and we expect the industry could double in the next five years with ishares maintaining its market leadership we are investing in our platform to deliver high quality exposures to clients globally and to increase the adoption of etfs with new clients and for new use cases for example we are seeing more investors use fixed income etfs which recently crossed the 1 trillion in industry assets in an increasing number of ways since blackrock launched the first fixed income etf in 2002 these products have made it more convenient for all investors to access a diverse range of exposures institutions are adopting them as replacement for their individual bond holdings to enhance efficiencies of their portfolio management process individuals are using them to help generate predictable income or as a part of our broader portfolio ishares fixed income etfs have also repeatedly demonstrated they offer the clients an additional source of liquidity and transparency during the times of market stress the combination of blackrock s history as a bond manager our expertise in etfs and industry leading technology and data capabilities create significant differentiation for ishares in this space and we believe this is just a beginning it took 17 years for fixing etfs to reach 1 trillion in aum and they still represent less than 1 of the 105 trillion global bond market we believe they are well positioned to double to 2 trillion globally within five years especially a secular forces like bond market modernization regulation and a move toward portfolios will take effect and create that type of systematic demand sustainable etfs represent another strategic growth area for ishares as clients increasingly look for strategies that target a measurable esg impact and financial returns we launched the ishares esg leaders fund in the second quarter which generated over 1 billion of net inflows representing the best asset gathering in an equity etf launch in 15 years since launching our ishare sustainable core etfs in october we have doubled assets to 13 billion and our clients discussions suggest increasingly more client demand beyond etfs and across our investment platform we re seeing greater demand for esg or sustainable investments blackrock has invested to develop significant expertise in this space we are leveraging our insights and technology to analyze sustainability related risks and opportunities across asset classes so we can better deliver long term results and opportunities for clients across index active and alternative investment strategies demand for illiquid alternative also remain as remain strong as investors search for yield and attractive risk adjusted returns in a sustained low rate environment we generated 3 billion of net inflows and commitments across our illiquid alternatives business in the second quarter led by credit infrastructure and private equity solutions our teams are consistently deploying capital on behalf of our clients with another 1 billion of committed capital deployed in the quarter as clients increase our exposure to private markets they want more than individual alternative products increasingly clients are looking for alternative solutions that fit in the context is our whole portfolios as well as technology to better understand risk and comprehensively manage portfolios across public and private markets blackrock has our clients both on the alternative investment solutions and investment and risk management technology our acquisition of efront which closed this quarter further strengthens our positioning and ongoing growth in our illiquid alternative business and will be supported and enhanced by our efront over time blackrock s leading technology capabilities continue to support and enhance the strong results we are seeing across our entire platform technology services revenues grew 20 year over year including the impact of efront acquisition that closed in may we are excited to share that we have already received our first combined client win notification for an efront contract alongside in a line and contract extension this early success is a reflection of the immediate collaboration and teamwork across aladdin and efront and reinforces our value proposition as a most comprehensive investment operating system in the world with aladdin wealth blackrock is enabling our wealth management partners to offer transparency and convenience to their own clients aladdin wealth is giving advisors better capabilities to connect with our own clients and providing wealth managers with a better risk management portfolio construction tools our goal is to make aladdin worth a leading technology platform for wealth managers and deepen our value proposition with our partners and our financial advisors we see strong momentum going forward as industry consolidation shifting product usage and regulatory requirements are creating the need for more holistic more flexible technology driven solutions at both institutions and wealth managers blackrock is well positioned to capitalize on these trends and is committed to enhancing our technology capabilities to continually meet our clients needs over the course of blackrock s 30 year history and in the 10 year since the financial crisis and our acquisition of bgi markets have experienced various periods of volatility and uncertainty i firmly believe that in markets like these clients put an even greater premium on the differentiating value proposition that blackrock can offer we remain focused on what we can control bringing together the entire firm to serve clients strategically investing in our competitive advantages and leveraging our global scale to be more disciplined in how we invest we are deepening our strength by adapting our businesses to be challenging client needs being a leader in the highest future growth areas of our industry and serving our clients more broadly than any firm in our industry by continuing to keep clients needs at the forefront of our priorities we will continue to be driving differentiated growth for our shareholders and i m confident we re very well positioned core business for the future with that let s open it up for questions questions and answers operator your first question comes from the line of ken worthington from jp morgan your line is open laurence d fink founder chairman and chief executive officer good morning ken kenneth worthington jp morgan analyst hi good morning thank you for taking my question so really going after cash management in fixed income sales i m hoping you could talk about the pipeline for both so clearly 2q was huge there was a sort of a change in the read outlook lots of repositioning what portion of that repositioning might be left as we look forward there and then it seems like blackrock was a disproportional winner in both fixed income and cash strategies you did mention some of the drivers in your prepared remarks but if you could just maybe highlight the factors that you see which may have driven not only just good sales but market share wins here as well laurence d fink founder chairman and chief executive officer thank you ken so i would say what we are seeing more than ever before clients are finding the management of fix income more difficult in the if they in house manage it they are looking for deeper relationships to have either windows to the market by employing firms like blackrock at the manage a core part of their portfolios in fixed income and in some cases now they re looking to outsource the entire platform of fixed income and they re looking for more of a technology solution as a component of that and it just leads to what i ve been saying each quarter ken that is having this holistic outcome orientation with our clients is leading to these type of broad conversations we have many deep broad conversations ongoing now and we don t see that type of behavior dissipating in terms of these types of big types of opportunities but a part of that also is just a systematic approach to fixed income where we re able to provide both index or etf solutions alongside active solutions and i do believe they coexist together we are seeing more clients who are employing etf solutions for fixed income alongside active solutions and so having that comprehensive conversation having the ability to source more product and that s obviously in this environment now smaller organizations are having a harder time sourcing whether it s in the private credit markets or even in the public credit markets and so this is where it s scale is becoming even more important and also having that global footprint in terms of relationships is building these types of flows i ll let rob talk about the cash side but we we have been saying this is a huge competitive opportunity for us and and we think much of it is starting to manifest in this quarter and we believe in the quarters to come rob kapito president so let me just accent larry s comments so the depth and the breadth of the conversations that we are having with clients is really resonating now and leading to these large strategic wins because clients are looking for a long term strategic partner so these conversations are about understanding the investment challenges they have and helping them execute strategic portfolio construction decisions and we have now the unique ability to offer a holistic solutions and this has to include technology portfolio construction modeling capabilities have various asset allocation strategies that involve both passive and active strategies and includes trading and includes analyzing credits and it also includes balance sheet management so all of these things have been more significant to get these strategic fundings in ever before and i think the results you saw in this quarter really reflect this and the clients are putting an even greater premium on this differentiated value proposition that we offer part of this is also cash we saw 26 billion of cash management net inflows in the second quarter and we are now number three globally as a money market provider and these flows come from both large separate account wins and strong flows into our institutional money market funds as we continue to innovate leverage scale and deliver a digital distribution and risk management solutions so as a reminder more than 95 of blackrock s cash assets under management is institutional where we are differentiated with our scale risk management and technology so we believe this differentiated set of cash offerings including money market funds separate accounts ctf etfs and other short duration strategies help us to serve our clients and lastly i would say in cash we are transforming our cash management business by delivering distribution and risk management technology through a portal that we have called cachematrix and also through aladdin so we are creating a technology first distribution strategy and this is driving our success in cash as well as holistic approaches to get these large strategic wins operator your next question comes from the line of bill katz from citi your line is open william katz citigroup analyst okay thank you very much good morning everyone thank you very much for your comments and taking the question this morning so larry just want to step back a little bit and i was wondering if you could sort of help sort of frame out what gets the active equity market going again and within that at least from flow perspective and from within that how does products like presidium with active shares play into that and then what might be the risk to the passive business if any laurence d fink founder chairman and chief executive officer let me talk about active equities and let gary talk about presidium but i want to do comment about what does it do to passive etfs we had active positive flows in our equity business last year last quarter it was in a form of a closed end fund where we raised 1 6 billion and we saw good inflows in our scientific active equity team where we had great performance so i where you see with other other asset managers where they have flows it s all performance based you have to prove over time value for their money this is one of the big things we ve always been talking about if you cannot show the value or the fees for their returns you re going to continue to see inflows in other types of products you re going to continue to see more flows into alternatives because of the inability of getting active alpha in equities and so when you think about a holistic approach pension funds or insurance company they allocate their active risk across the whole spectrum of investments if they don t believe they could get the value for their money in active equity s they re going to move where they could get active alpha into more illiquids and that s the trend you re seeing and so you re seeing more a transformation in the alternative space where they re getting more active alpha and you re seeing that s being barbelled by predominance in etfs so if more and more managers can provide value for their money in terms of active alpha returns after fees then we are we re going to see systematic more flows back in the active in the equity side and so i m not here to project that the whole industry is going to have active returns i think it s harder and harder as i ve been commenting over the years about active managers producing active alpha with all the democratization of information it s becoming much harder to differentiate yourself and that s what we ve seen and so we have systematically been shifting our equity teams into more schematics into more model based and scientific into i would say more specific portfolios with fewer shares stock holdings and so we believe that s where active equity is going to be migrating and we ve been doing that over the last two years and now we re starting to see some of the success on the rise of active etfs which i ll let gary talk about that has that will have no impact no impact on index based strategy people are using index based strategies for a purpose and that is really the getting back to my conversation about alpha allocation so when you think holistically about your alpha allocation where are you going to get your active alpha so that s the bigger issue more than anything and i do believe when people go into index based strategies across factors or across sustainable types of products those are more precision instruments those are instruments to give them those type of preference that s not going to change and so we i ll let gary talk about presidium but if active investing becomes a larger component then there could be increased role of active etfs but let me have gary talk about that gary s shedlin chief financial officer so bill i ll say just two things and then we ll move on one is obviously blackrock is a strong proponent of industry innovation and anything that basically enhances investor access to the markets were all for that and secondly i would say that our goal for the future is to be rapper agnostic so to the point larry makes it an investor wants a passive product retail investor they can you choose between an index mutual fund or an etf if it s an institutional account whether it s a co mingle trust fund or a separate account and i think similarly to the extent an investor chooses they want an active product we similarly think if the future holds that they can choose between a traditional mutual fund or an etf and that s good for investors then we ll obviously make sure that we position ourselves to be part of that industry growth early signs i think are still out i mean there are some benefits versus a traditional mutual fund for an active etf and the concept as may be more tax efficiency and less cash drag but obviously there are still some complication as it relates to transparency the implications that transparency has creates and redeems in bid ask spreads and how that instrument is going to trade and so i think its early days we re going to continue to watch the development of the product itself and how it relates to the ecosystem around it and we will ultimately make the best decision for investors going forward operator your next question comes from the line of patrick davitt from autonomous your line is open laurence d fink founder chairman and chief executive officer good morning patrick patrick davitt autonomous research analyst good morning guys i think last quarter you mentioned the nine clients ramping up on aladdin for wealth and that it was still kind of early days in terms of seeing meaningful identifiable incremental organic growth on that could you update us on that number and maybe to what extent you re seeing more line of sight to increase adoption of blackrock product through that ramp up process laurence d fink founder chairman and chief executive officer so the biggest opportunity for aladdin is to make it the language of portfolio construction for wealth managers for financial advisors and also for individual investors so aladdin is currently live with 11 clients globally this is aladdin for wealth we continue to see very strong client interest i would caution you to say that when we get an aladdin assignment there is sometimes three this could be as long as six month implementation part of that before they come alive and there s also of course ramp up fees that we have until they get large and they start to grow so we are seeing more and more demand and quite frankly for every one client that takes on aladdin or aladdin for wealth it creates demand to become the standard and how people are going to look at technology and what this does is simply brings risk transparency and portfolio construction capabilities both in the institutional market and in the wealth market and also when we re having conversations about our risk technology it also piques their interest in what we can do with their portfolios and balance sheets and adds on to other business that we might do with them and quite frankly vice versa so when it comes to aladdin for wealth there is a whole education process for advisors to use the technology and you can have any app you want but you actually have to use it and we re finding the increased interest is not only because of the risk technology it provides it s becoming an asset gathering tool for these advisors so our expectation is it s going to grow we have more client interest in it and it s i think going to continue to grow as it s been growing in the past for us operator your next question comes from the line of brian bedell from deutsche bank your line open brian bedell deutsche bank analyst great thanks very much for taking the question if you could just guide into the nature of the active fixed income institutional mandate i know you touched a lot about this on this larry but if you can talk about maybe what do you think has changed for blackrock in offering holistic solutions obviously you guys have been well positioned for that for quite some time but you see more optimistic on those types of mandates going forward so is it the technology that s pointing in that s actually generating this growth or is it something else and then just added to that is the fixed income ishares usage as substitutes for bonds are you seeing that as a fairly permanent secular trend that should help the fixed income grow quarter in quarter out larry fink chairman and chief executive officer thanks brian let me i m going to let rob answer most of it but this really is just a very vivid example of our positioning as an organization globally where our scale is bringing our the ability to source assets our consistency in performance our agnostic ability to provide passive and active in fixed income and so it s really manifesting now it s a deeper product conversation but rob why don t you rob kapito president yeah i think the quick and dirty answer is just that they need a strategic partner it s not about just about filling or checking a box with one particular product so when you can go and you can provide the technology to them you can provide opportunities for modeling portfolios portfolio construction when you can give that answer and have the products in house to give them the appropriate asset allocation whether it be passive and active whether you can actually trade get the allocations to provide them the products that they need whether you can do the credit work on their current portfolio and improve it and whether you can actually look holistically depending upon what type of client is and help them with balance sheet management because in a period of low interest rate every basis points counts and that s were also cash comes in to be able to provide the appropriate allocations in that balance sheet to improve it or the portfolio itself really makes it different in the low interest environment so that s where we re seeing the interest in having more dialogue with us because i think this approach is unique in our industry the second part is really what s driving fixed income to go more and more into an etf structure and you re going to hear a lot from blackrock about this because there s really four or five different reasons one is there is an evolution in portfolio construction and millions of people are actively using fixed income etfs in new and innovative ways to achieve a variety of outcomes so keep in mind it is still a great way to de risk your portfolios it is a good way to have more liquidity more transparency more diversification and better tax it s just a better wrapper there s going adoption now by institutional investors so institutions like pension funds asset managers and insurance companies rely on fixed income etfs for a very quick efficient market access as the bond market now starts to modernize electronification of bond markets are going to support the growth of fixed income etfs as well as in trench bond etfs as part of a vibrant fixed income marketplace so technology is also helping this market to grow and then as the previous question alerted us too there s constant etf innovation this is the development of new bond etf exposures and what it s adding is the most important part of this which is convenience of investors to access the fixed income market with better liquidity at a better price and we are constantly now coming up with new tools to customize portfolios and drive future bond etf adoption it is right now a very small portion of the fixed income market we are very optimistic about the future growth as larry mentioned global fixed income etf assets under management crossed 1 trillion in june and even at 1 trillion fixed income etfs represent less than 1 of the 105 trillion global bond market so we have high expectations for growth and we think we re going to benefit from the growth in this market operator your next question comes from the line of craig siegenthaler from credit suisse your line is open laurence d fink founder chairman and chief executive officer hi craig craig siegenthaler credit suisse analyst hey good morning larry so i wanted to see which of your recent investments in digital tools are providing blackrock the biggest competitive advantages in our clients and also when you take a step back and look at your major competitors in financial services and firms that also have the etf businesses like the vanguard schwab s jp morgan s with digital direct to consumer distribution platforms what are your thoughts in entering the wealth management space at some point laurence d fink founder chairman and chief executive officer gary gary s shedlin chief financial officer i ll give you an update on our investments i think obviously we ve made a number of minority investments craig which are definitely part of our capital management strategy i think we are looking to use our balance sheet and the stable cash flow that our business generates more aggressively to basically position us to effectively learn and partner with a number of very innovative companies without necessarily having to take full control day one i think it basically helps us add value to their business and ultimately derisks our strategy of ultimately having the options to combine with those companies over time or frankly they may benefit from their unique culture and basically our broader reach so today we basically got a number of them obviously icapital and scalable are most well known again i think scalable kind of expense our global advisor capabilities and what we ve done with futureadvisor into europe which i think is being is very successful icapital obviously is more on the front end of the alternative strategy and will at some point really whether we own it or not will basically pair very nicely with what we re doing on an efront aladdin technology combination we ve obviously done other things even more unique and our minority investment into invest net i think has been incredibly beneficial not only in terms of the fact that the stock has gone up significant since we bought it but more importantly it offers an opportunity to get aladdin on the desktops of thousands and thousands of ria s in the way that effectively helps them not only benefit their own practices but helps distribution of our underlying assay capabilities and then there s a number of smaller issues smaller companies whether it s embark or acorns again which gives us an opportunity to learn about the evolution of distribution in a more technological way and to basically help these companies drive more value as it relates to the issue of going direct we have no intention of going direct we are an intermediate model we partner with lots of companies to distribute our products and frankly all of the investments that we re making are intended to be basically beneficial to our shareholders into clients but frankly respecting the fact that we are an intermediated model going forward laurence d fink founder chairman and chief executive officer and i would just say one on a more holistic basis what i see a letter that focus on the societal changes and we are seeing new societal changes with more millennials and more gen x and they are much more adept in using technology we need to be at the forefront of helping them i do believe the retirement crisis in america is a component of lack of financial literacy and so aided by a it is all our respective jobs is to use technology to improve financial literacy and improve better transparency for people who are investing we need to take the fear out of managing of money for most people if we could reduce that fear of management of money i think the outcome will be leading to more people putting their money to work and that s one of the structural promise we see in europe and other parts of the world and so to me it is only it s going to have to be through better and more unique technology and that is what s driving us to try to provide leading technology aladdin for wealth to create more transparency when you think about the movement especially on the advisor side with more and more movement toward illiquids by when you think about icapital and then efront if we could provide better transparency and information on the illiquids side alongside aladdin for wealth it will lead to better financial literacy toward investing in illiquids but it will probably lead to better outcome investing for everybody and so when you think about how we are trying to design our technology and our technology offerings it is all the foundation and some of the things that i write about and how we can then take this and really build a unique position in all the societies we work in in terms of trying to provide better financial literacy better financial outcomes and so that s the entire foundation of what we re trying to do operator ladies and gentlemen we have reached our allotted time for questions mr fink do you have any closing remarks laurence d fink founder chairman and chief executive officer well i want to thank everybody for joining us this morning and for the continued interest at blackrock our strong second quarter results is really linked to that these deliberate investments we ve made over time and what i ve been continuously talking about are deep partnerships we ve built with clients globally being footprinted globally by providing a deeper purpose in all the communities we operate we see meaningful opportunities that continue to leverage our differentiating scale blackrock s purpose of trying to help people having an achieved better financial outcomes we re trying to use our leverage to invest in our investments and technology capabilities for the ultimate value creation for our clients and through the value creation for our clients is going to lead to longer term deeper value for our shareholders going forward everyone have a good summer hopefully people have some time to take off and we ll talk to you in fall operator duration 58 minutes call participants christopher j meade

asian stocks are taking their cues from their us counterparts to push higher after fed officials appeared to call for us monetary policy stimulus in the near term on thursday federal reserve bank of new york president john williams said that central banks must take swift action when faced with adverse economic conditions also federal reserve vice chairman richard clarida said yesterday that policymakers don t need to wait until things get so bad before cutting interest rates safe haven assets have been boosted by risk appetite that is being curtailed by the thought of waning us economic growth the yen has strengthened below the 107 6 level against the us dollar gold prices briefly breached the 1450 handle while the yields on 10 year us treasuries aren t straying far away from the two percent mark although central banks around the world have embarked on policy easing in a bid to support their respective economies investors are left to ponder whether the stimulus will be enough to offset the effects from heightened us china trade tensions which have already dragged global growth lower dovish fed makes for softer dollar environment for the rest of july the dovish commentary by fed officials underscored expectations that the us central bank will lower interest rates by a larger quantum at the federal open market committee fomc meeting later this month at the time of writing markets now expect a 43 5 percent chance of a 50 basis point cut at the july 30 31 fomc meeting as seen in the fed funds futures despite the better than expected june non farm payrolls retail sales and factory output data the fed is expected to press ahead with at least a 25 basis point interest rate cut this month given that us inflation remains muted while global uncertainties continue to prevail lower us interest rates should help ensure that us economic growth momentum remains steadfast however ramped up expectations over a bigger july fed rate cut are undermining the greenback and arelikely to contribute to a softer dollar environment for the rest of this month the weaker dollar is set to play into the hands of gold and yen bulls oil tumbles as slowing global demand overshadows rising geopolitical tensions wti crude has declined by over six percent so far this week while brent futures have shed over five percent us inventories increased by over nine million barrels last week which added to market jitters that the growth in global demand is lagging severely behind the rise in output the slowdown in global growth has overshadowed market sentiment for oil as rising geopolitical tensions have failed to live up to their potential of sending prices higher with us china trade negotiations merely offering a pittance to risk appetite since the tariff truce was announced at the end of june any further deterioration in the global demand outlook could open up further downside for oil prices still markets can take some comfort in the opec decision to extend its supply cuts through march 2020 which should help support oil prices over the coming months
people who get a kick out of watching children at play must love the spectacle staged in washington every time the issue of the federal debt ceiling comes up but they re the only ones by michael hiltzik los angeles times people who get a kick out of watching children at play must love the spectacle staged in washington every time the issue of the federal debt ceiling comes up but they re the only ones for most responsible onlookers the spectacle is nerve racking taxpayers face higher government costs and suspended programs people who provide services to the government for pay including public employees get stiffed investors fret over the possibility that a federal default on its debt will produce a surge in interest rates and a stock market crash and a long term crisis of confidence in the safety of u s government securities economists worry about potentially cataclysmic effects on global financial systems most politicians wish in their hearts that the debt ceiling would just go away yet it s still with us despite universal judgment that it s useless and a perennial waste of everyone s time even president trump displaying shockingly wise economic judgment has dissed the debt ceiling for many years people have been talking about getting rid of the debt ceiling altogether he said in june 2017 there are lots of good reasons to do that trump hasn t repeated that sentiment since then as far as we can tell that s too bad because the debt ceiling is back after a suspension of roughly 13 months enacted as part of a bipartisan budget bill in february 2018 the debt ceiling went back into effect on march 9 at the level of government debt in the marketplace at that moment 22 trillion in other words the government instantly hit the ceiling since then the treasury has kept the government going through what are known as temporary extraordinary measures and what managers of household budgets know as moving money around these include deferring payments to government funds that would otherwise require issuing government debt thus leaving some borrowing headroom for other purposes the funds include the government employee retirement fund and a thrift savings plan investment fund which holds retirement investments made by government workers the funds will be made whole once the debt ceiling crisis passes but at a cost to taxpayers that could run into the hundreds of millions of dollars the extraordinary measures can work only for a short period after which they run out by the treasury s current reckoning that point comes in mid september in other words that s the drop dead date for raising the debt ceiling adding to nervousness about the date is that it s been creeping closer the treasury originally said it would have enough options to keep the debt ceiling from being breached until november then it revised its projection to the end of october and again to september the changes result chiefly from shortfalls in government tax collections because of the tax cut bill republicans enacted in december 2017 on the promise that it would pay for itself it hasn t let s be clear that the consequences of breaching the debt ceiling would be dire if the government defaults on its bonds by missing a payment its cost of borrowing would instantly rise placing a further burden on the budget and cratering the value of treasury securities held by individuals pension funds and sovereign nations the safe haven stature of t bonds and the dollar would be deeply impaired interest rates would rise for all forms of debt mortgages credit cards state and local borrowing government output of social security checks tax refunds medicare reimbursements military salaries and more would be reduced or halted before we get into the substance of the current discussions which involve house speaker nancy pelosi and treasury secretary steve mnuchin let s canter through the historical background of this stupid government rule the debt ceiling originally was enacted to give the treasury more freedom to issue debt not less that was in 1917 at that time congress was required to vote on every bond issue which the members rightly considered a pain in the rear they decided that it would be better to give treasury blanket authority to issue bonds but not unlimited authority so it imposed an aggregate limit by the 1960s the limit became a hindrance to fiscal policy raising it turned into a routine since 1962 congress has raised the limit roughly 100 times on average more than once a year more recently unfortunately the debt ceiling acquired the image of a brake on fiscal irresponsibility on capitol hill the idea being that if the government were forbidden to borrow it would have to live within its means this was a gift to tea party types and other conservatives whose goal was to shrink federal programs typically those that served the working class and the poor they could proclaim themselves guardians of public resources with the debt ceiling serving as their line in the sand this was always mere posturing spending decisions are made by congress almost always without regard to the debt ceiling which comes into play later when the treasury is tasked with finding the money for congressional mandates the government accountability office delivered a reality dose about this as bluntly as possible in a report in february 2011 the debt limit does not control or limit the ability of the federal government to run deficits or incur obligations the agency wrote rather it is a limit on the ability to pay obligations already incurred politicians who never stop jabbering about the need for individuals to accept personal responsibility for their finances always seem to forget that when the topic turns to the need for government to make good on its borrowing the government has always managed to avoid default but sometimes it has been a close call in 2011 congress passed an increase only hours before the ultimate deadline averting default but prompting standard and poor s to downgrade the creditworthiness of u s government debt for the first time ever in 2013 the ceiling was raised with a day to spare in 2017 weeks and in 2018 a month producing the suspension that expired on march 9 serious economic policy thinkers aren t comforted by this sort of brinkmanship in 2003 when the debt limit kicked in for three months the government had to call in bonds held by a civil service retirement fund early costing the fund and its members more than 1 billion in lost interest former reagan economic advisor bruce bartlett accurately called the debt ceiling fight in 2009 a uniquely american political crisis with its roots in political theater the danger always is that the children in whose hands this weapon rests can t be trusted to understand its potency in 2010 for instance a republican congressman from south carolina airily dismissed concerns about the consequences of a default on u s government debt i have heard people say that if we don t do it it will be the end of the world he said then i have yet to meet someone who can articulate the negative consequences that was mick mulvaney who is now director of the office of management and budget fortunately treasury secretary mnuchin like all his predecessors is fully alive to the negative consequences he has been urging action on the debt ceiling since the spring but progress has been stalled by discord on broader budget issues on monday pelosi turned down his proposal for a short term rise in the debt ceiling to be enacted next week before congress leaves for its summer recess pelosi and her house democratic caucus want an agreement that protects nonmilitary spending from cuts which the trump white house so far has refused to accept pelosi isn t asking enough she should demand abolition of the debt ceiling as the price of lifting it now almost every deal to raise the debt ceiling in recent years has produced bad policy one way or another the consequences of breaching the ceiling are just too serious for this weapon to remain in partisan arsenals on either side of the aisle it does nothing but get in the way of intelligent fiscal management get rid of it already

participants prepared remarks operator good morning and welcome to the kansas city southern second quarter 2019 earnings conference call this presentation includes statements concerning potential future events involving the company which could materially differ from events that actually occur the differences could be caused by a number of factors including those factors identified in the risk factors section of the company s form 10 k for the year ended december 31 2018 filed with the sec the company is not obligated to update any forward looking statements in this presentation to reflect future events or developments all reconciliations to gaap can be found on the kcs website www kcsouthern com it is now my pleasure to introduce your host pat ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer for kansas city southern patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer okay thank you and good morning everyone welcome to our second quarter earnings call just make a comment on slide 4 which is the list of the line up for today s presentation i m not going to read through this i think they re very well known to the audience here so i ll move on to slide 5 with a quick overview of the quarter and a few headliners as you saw from the press release revenues increased 5 to a record level for any quarter of 714 million second quarter operating ratio little bit of explaining necessary here we ve reported a 70 9 operating ratio which includes the impact of an impairment charge additional impairment charge we took in the second quarter adjusting for that impairment charge we got to 63 7 which is 30 basis point improvement from last year but that included negative impact of 130 basis points of pure accounting i ll say related to the loss of the ieps tax credit and the increase of fuel surcharge revenue mike upchurch will go through this in much greater detail later and explain the 130 basis points and probably more importantly explain what this looks like going forward but this is a really pure accounting as we re just inflating the revenue side as well as the cost side of our income statement which has a negative effect on the operating ratio but it has very little effect on operating income or other things that matter as you go down the income statement so i think it is correct to look at the 30 basis point improvement from the adjusted level excluding the impairment charge as well as the 130 basis point excise tax impact that we absorbed or overcame in the quarter due to the pure accounting consequences of both higher fuel costs and higher fuel surcharge revenue and i think mike has a slide later on that goes through that in really good detail second quarter diluted eps 1 28 adjusted again for the impairment charge was at a record 1 64 increase of 6 versus prior year couple of key themes that we ll probably cover 2 or 3 times over the course of the call and q a operating performance significantly improved which drove improved customer service operating metrics and cost profile again looking at the improvement in core operational savings which is the 30 basis points year over year plus overcoming the impact of the fuel the ieps tax situation and as you ll see later on we re making great progress in psr implementation and other operational excellence initiatives and we are going to give you updated guidance on the full year impact and kind of 2019 impact of those savings and those initiatives and the punchline here is we re more than doubling the positive impact of those savings i am very very pleased with the commitment and enthusiasm of the team it s truly a cross functional there s a very high level of commitment and engagement across the organization we have weekly psr update meetings led by sameh with large number of people from many different organizations and i said on those periodically i said in on the meeting we had on wednesday of this week and we re just very very pleased with the level of engagement that we re seeing another common theme that you ll hear more i mean obviously the volume outlet outlook or volume performance was not as strong as we would have liked volume s basically flat but there is a story behind that that i think mike naatz will reveal in his comments that we look at our portfolio of business and breakdown by business unit going forward we still see 60 of our portfolio as favorable in terms of the that the growth that we re seeing 10 or times 20 neutral so that could flip either way as circumstances develop and market conditions change over the course of the year and only 20 negative and as you can see in the difference between our carload volumes and our revenues there is a mix story here so we certainly don t see gloom and doom ahead of us and see opportunities for growth in some of the oversized growth areas that we ve talked about for the last several quarters and the psr work we re doing the focus on operational excellence has put our network in really terrific position to deliver strong operating leverage as and when volume growth and revenue growth improves and mike again will give you more detail on our estimates our current estimates for psr savings going forward flipping to slide 6 just want to update our guidance this is similar guidance categories that we gave at the end of the first quarter and we re changing a couple of these volume growth we now see flat to slightly down for the full year in 2019 but again i ll restate what i said a minute ago and mike will get into this in more detail when we look at our total portfolio we think 60 of our business is showing favorable positive trends 20 neutral and 20 negative which includes intermodal which of course is driving the big explanation between the flat volume levels that continuing to hang in there with our revenue guidance that we gave earlier which was 5 to 7 for the full year same guidance we gave at the end of the first quarter so we still feel that that revenue growth is going to be possible for us this year operating ratio we are moving to the low end of our previous guidance of 60 to 61 by 2021 and i ll again bring up the impact of the fuel tax issue the loss of the ieps tax credit so not only are we going to the low end of the range but we are absorbing the impact of the loss of the ieps credit and the inflation of the balance sheet both on the cost and the revenue side that that will have to operating ratio going forward and as i mentioned mike will get into more detail about the magnitude of that during the quarter and then going forward eps we re staying with our previous guidance of low to mid teens on a compound annual growth rate for the next three years so no change in eps and then capex we are bringing our capital expenditure forecast for 2019 down we are confident that we ll be able to trim our capex forecast from previous guidance by 40 million to 60 million our previous guidance was 640 million to 660 million for 2019 we now expect that number to come in below 600 million and again a lot of that is a function of improved operational efficiency and we are really just beginning in fact had a kick off meeting here a couple of weeks ago with the team who is looking at completely redesigning our transportation service plan as sameh will refer to this as whiteboarding when he gets into his comments which we think will have further benefits in the second half of this year and beyond in terms of the number of train starts and the yard congestion and overall improvement in our operating performance so with that i will turn the presentation over to jeff songer jeffrey m songer executive vice president and chief operating officer all right thank you pat good morning starting with the review of key operating metrics for the quarter on slide 8 dwell of 21 2 hours improved 11 year over year while gross velocity of 12 5 miles per hour improved 9 year over year we continue to see strong year over year improvement in our key metrics particularly in mexico where dwell across the majority of our major terminals has shown significant improvement flooding had some impact to velocity and interchange in the north end of the u s network as we incurred several days of outages across some segments the greatest impact was to interchange of bulk commodities in kansas city regarding asset utilization i would like to highlight that the number of operational cars online has decreased 17 versus peak 2018 levels our focus has been to reduce high cost foreign equipment by improving cycle times and working with customers to right size fleets border performance for the quarter remained solid and supported a 10 year over year growth in cross border volumes led by significant growth in mexico energy reform shipments a milestone was reached in our border operations in july as international crews have now been in place for one year this initiative continues to support cross border volume and we are seeing a 20 reduction in time spent crossing the bridge for those trains utilizing international crews expanding upon psr metrics on slide 9 we continue to see positive trends in all metrics through the first half of the year gross velocity has improved 10 versus prior year and we are now tracking this metric to exit the year at 14 miles per hour reductions inline of road equipment failures improved execution of tsp and modifications to our service design and reduce train starts have all helped with system fluidity train length improved by 2 as our tsp and train start consolidation work continues in the second half of the year we will undergo additional service redesign which sameh will discuss in more detail fuel efficiency has improved by 3 for the year multiple initiatives including velocity improvements locomotive utilization train start reductions and fuel technology are all contributing to this improvement in the second half of the year we will install fuel technology on an additional 100 road locomotives which will bring us to roughly 50 of our road fleets equipped also of note we have received all 50 of the new locomotives planned for 2019 and do not currently plan any locomotive purchases for 2020 as pat indicated we feel very good about the progress and pace of our psr initiatives and as you will see in mike s financial review we are more than doubling the expected psr cost benefits for the full year 2019 i will now turn the presentation over to sameh to provide more detail on our overall psr efforts sameh fahmy executive vice president precision scheduled railroading good morning as jeff mentioned we have been making significant improvements in network velocity in about 10 better year over year and dwell about 8 better we are seeing the best consolidated gross velocity this time of year across the network than we have seen in any of the last five years we also see further improvements ahead as on many days we achieved 15 16 miles per hour in the u s and 13 14 miles per hour in mexico these are much higher numbers than the average of 11 miles per hour reported last year these improvements were achieved by very hard work every day by the whole operation team with intense focus on every low velocity train and peeling the onion on clauses example a train that arise in nuevo laredo and departs 24 hours later as it waited for a window to cross the border bridge that has also been an intense effort to scrutinize work in yards which as an example vanegas having nine trains doing work versus a planned six as we drill down we find that cars were added to a train in sanchez and now needed to be switched out in vanegas which is not our best yard for switching velocity and dwell gains translated into the removal of 12 of our locomotives and 7 of our cars and great improvement in fuel efficiency in addition four ways of train consolidation resulted in a 10 reduction in planned line of in mexico we ll continue to focus our efforts into converting our operational gains to the bottom line and as pat mentioned mike upchurch is going to go more into the financial details of this now moving forward the same way as a field visit to houston in march brought fruits in partnership with union pacific a one week visit to san luis potosi yard in june was a true eye opener we observed a lower level of compliance to plan with yard assignments adjusted daily which is an indication of a suboptimal train plan with field personnel trying to compensate for the deficiencies but by doing so they create impure car blocks that need to be reclassified in the next yard and the one after that and so on downstream this is when it became clear that the new redesign white boarding as pat mentioned earlier needs to be done was great focus on yard and the border and will be completed in q4 the objective will be to eliminate excessive classifications free up capacity increase velocity reduce dwell and improve service as you know an important part of psr is to create capacity for free and we re taking a big chunk out of our original capital plan as mike will describe in his presentation example money that was set aside to upgrade yards is being taken out and we are going to the side what to do with that when the plan the new design plan for trains and for classification and for yards is completed an immediate action ahead of the new tsp is to implement on august 12 a new blocking agreement for northbound traffic interchanging with at laredo that will emphasize creating blocks at origin points further slows in our network and will reduce significant portion of the switching at nuevo laredo yard that will reduce the number of times we touch a car which again is one of the key principles of psr mechanical delays will also be a great focus we have made significant improvement in failures per day per year for locomotives from 4 6 down to 3 1 but we still have lots of room to go to take it down to 2 0 and we still have a lot of room to go on cars we get about 40 to 45 hours of train delays per day due to mechanical and that can be cut substantially and we re working on it last and this has come up on the in the past couple of days we re also beginning to shift focus to the engineering side to increase the productivity in off our gangs ties per hour and rail per hour rail footage per hour and that would allow us to shrink the curfews and effect less the train delays and at the same time improve our capital dollar i ll turn it now to mike naatz for the commercial side michael j naatz executive vice president and chief marketing officer hey thank you sameh and good morning everyone i ll start my comments on page 13 overall second quarter revenue was up 5 on flat volumes as you can see our q2 performance was mixed across our business units we continue to see very strong performance in our cross border traffic led by the mexico energy reform business and this drove growth on our cross border revenue and volumes of 13 and 10 respectively there are mindful of the economic environment trade situation and we continue to carefully monitor the current state of affairs and as you heard from pat 80 of our portfolio has a favorable or neutral outlook during the quarter our revenue per unit grew by about 4 driven by a shift in business mix from the lower revenue per unit intermodal volumes to the higher revenue per unit chemical and petroleum business increased fuel revenues also affected our revenue per unit during the quarter we achieved pricing renewals consistent with the prior year and we view the current pricing environment is stable as expected the chemical and petroleum segment delivered strong quarterly year over year results with our mexico energy reform business providing revenue growth of 136 and volume growth of 125 our ag and mineral unit showed a slight year over year volume decrease due to a large part to an unexpected customer outage and timing of volumes contributing to tougher year over year comps however we continue to see favorable transportation cycle times resulting from the benefits of operational improvements across border traffic and we expect to see this trend continue into the second half energy volumes were down due to decreases in frac sand and canadian crude or partially offset year over year growth in utility coal traffic and this was despite the flooding impacts that occurred in the second quarter year over year revenue in our industrial consumer business unit was down 2 and 7 lower volumes the volume declines were primarily attributable to softness in the paper market which was driven by abundant truck capacity and a shift from cardboard to alternative packaging methods the automotive segment saw a revenue increase of 5 on flat volumes plants were impacted by planned outages early in the quarter and we expect year over year growth to improve in the second half of the year as plants reopen and new production begins to slowly ramp up intermodal segment was down slightly seeing a 1 reduction in revenue and a 3 decrease in volumes we continue to see strong growth in our cross border intermodal business with a 10 increase in volume and a 7 increase in revenue this was offset by decreases in domestic traffic due to truck availability and the lazaro volumes and revenues were up 2 and 4 respectively moving on to slide 14 you ll see our revenue outlook for the second half of 2019 and as pat mentioned we are expecting year over year volume to be flat to slightly down but we do maintain our revenue guidance on the lower end of the 5 to 7 range we remain very positive on the chemical and petroleum business unit and the mexico energy reform story additionally we expect to see growth in the automotive and ag and min segments primarily due to continuing service improvements industrial and consumer segment outlook is adjusted to neutral for the second half of 2019 given recent trends in the paper markets and available truck capacity and truck availability paired with pricing impact of increased fuel costs will drive a somewhat unfavorable second half outlook for our intermodal business unit and with that i ll turn things over to our cfo mike upchurch michael w upchurch executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning everyone i ll start my comments on slide 16 second quarter revenues were up 5 primarily due to 4 increase in revenue per unit reported operating expenses increased 69 million primarily due to a restructuring charge of 51 million consisting largely of an impairment of locomotives and freight cars no longer required in our business adjusted operating expenses increased 4 leading to a 63 7 adjusted operating ratio for the quarter it is important to note that the mexican government s decision to terminate the fuel excise tax credit for the rail industry beginning april 30 2019 had a negative impact on our adjusted operating ratio of approximately 130 basis points i will review more details on the impact to our financial statements on the next slide setting aside the negative impact of the loss of the fuel excise tax credit our operating performance was far better than our reported or adjusted results our adjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter was 29 2 in line with the 29 to 30 guidance we ve provided for 2019 we do expect our full year adjusted etr to be in the range of 27 to 28 due to the mexican fuel excise tax being included in income taxes since ieps has now been eliminated for the remainder of 2019 we will no longer adjust fuel excise tax credit into operating expenses in june the treasury department proposed additional guidance concerning guilty tax and we now expect our effective tax rate to be 28 to 29 in 2020 and beyond and from a cash tax rate perspective we are forecasting 2019 to be 21 2020 to be 23 and 2021 to be 25 and while the treasury department has largely saw concerns that caused unintended consequences to kcs we will still end up paying approximately 16 million in taxes in 2018 and 2019 that we believe were not intended under the principles of tax reform act of 2017 finally reported eps was 1 28 which is inclusive of a 0 38 impact related to our restructuring charge on an adjusted basis eps was 1 64 and was predominantly due to increased operating income although we also saw some benefit in reduced share count turning to slide 17 i want to now review the estimated impacts of the loss of the ieps fuel tax credit in the first column just represent our adjusted 2q results through operating income the second column represents the estimated 2q impacts of losing the fuel tax credit beginning april 30 and the amount of 2q revenue build to customers in our fuel program that started may 11 as you can see we recorded an incremental 7 2 million in revenue during the quarter that would not have been recorded had the excise tax credit been retained offsetting that incremental revenue is the 13 6 million lost fuel excise tax credit resulting in 6 4 million less operating income during the second quarter or 130 basis point negative impact to or the final column is our attempt to provide you some guidance for future quarterly periods the final column reflects the same lost excise tax credit of 13 6 million offset with an estimated 12 8 million recovery in our fuel program we do not recover 100 of the loss credit as some customers who have all inclusive rates including fuel costs that won t be able to be adjusted until contracts expire as illustrated by the operating income impact of less than 1 million in the quarter we do not expect a material impact to operating income or net income from the lost fuel excise tax credit however moving the lost fuel excise tax credit from expenses into our fuel program will create an approximate 80 basis point deterioration in our or since the increased fuel expense will have essentially an equal amount of fuel surcharge revenue so there s three takeaways here the quarter was considerably better if you set aside the loss of the credit there s an immaterial impact to operating income and net income but we do have the dynamics of an 80 basis point increase in our operating ratio as a result of moving the credit into revenues so with that let s turn to more exciting things on slide 18 i want to provide you an update on our psr expense savings on our first quarter call we reviewed an initial psr saving estimate with you at that time we had visibility into a reduction of approximately 16 million of 2019 expenses or 25 million annually after an additional quarter of work we now have visibility to 2019 expenses that are 2 5 times our previous estimate or 40 million for 2019 and 55 million annually as you can see on the slide we are seeing better progress in every single expense category some of our early initiatives have focused on reducing the size of the fleet particularly older less reliable locomotives not only are we seeing depreciation in maintenance benefits from a reduced fleet we re also experiencing fuel benefits by shedding older less fuel efficient locomotives and we have improved the reliability of the fleet by reducing service interruptions by 35 and reducing the duration of service interruptions by 15 or 45 that have led to a 15 reduction in our mechanical resources with respect to fuel we re also beginning to see more savings materialize from the adoption of fuel saving technologies such as ge s trip optimizer to run trains in most fuel efficient gear or notch aesf to minimize idling time and smart hpt to right size the locomotive power being used for each train additionally train consolidation is also helping fuel efficiency by running longer trains so in summary we will continue to aggressively pursue more expense savings as we streamline our operations and develop a new transportation service plan in the quarter we did incur a 51 million restructuring charge which is predominantly related to disposal of more locomotives and freight cars that we won t need in our business as we continue to develop plans to streamline our operation it is possible we could have further restructuring charges in the future since we re only six months into our efforts turning to slide 19 quarterly adjusted operating expenses increased 4 over 2q 2018 kcs generated a fuel excise tax credit of 8 million in the second quarter of 2018 but obviously no credit in operating income in 2019 due to the change in tax laws thus creating a negative year over year comp wage inflation of 3 in the u s and 5 in mexico led to a 4 million increase in compensation costs and foreign exchange contributed a 2 million increase offsetting those increases were 2 million in savings from an improvement in fuel efficiency 1 million in labor savings due to crew start reductions and 4 million of improvement in equipment expense the result of a more fluid network as we saw our foreign cycle times continue to improve 8 year over year on slide 20 compensation and benefits expense increased 6 million or 5 average quarterly headcount excluding the insourcing of the mechanical facility and insourcing of it contractors declined 50 basis points wage inflation increased comp and benefits by 4 million and insourcing and fx each contributed to 1 million increases but we did begin to see approximately 1 million in savings from crew start reductions and continue to believe our overall headcount will be down for the year as we continue to make progress with psr particularly once our new transportation service plan is finalized turning to slide 21 fuel expense increased 2 million due to increasing fuel prices in mexico as you can see in the bar chart mexican fuel prices have continued to increase from 2 86 a year ago to 3 15 in 2q a 10 increase offsetting those increases we achieved efficiency gains by moving about the same gtms this quarter as we did in 2q 2018 but using 3 fewer gallons an indicator of technology improvements and running more fuel efficient trains finally on slide 22 let me briefly discuss our capital allocation priorities as our free cash flow continues to grow we will have a nice problem a significant buildup in cash enough to continue to invest in our business and return more capital to shareholders our top priority is to continue to invest in our business to generate better revenue growth however we are reducing our 2019 capital expenditure guidance from 640 million to 660 million to less than 600 million this reduction is due to two factors first our psr efforts have freed up capacity on our network as fluidity improves and second we are adjusting our capital program to the realities of less than expected volume growth we have reduced investments in various growth and capacity projects until the volume environment is more predictable and we have finalized our transportation service plan that said we will continue to invest in our cross border capacity to stay ahead of the double digit growth we ve seen in the last 18 months as for shareholder returns we continue to buy shares under the 800 million share repurchase program authorized by our board in august of 2017 during the quarter we ve repurchased 773 000 shares for a total of 92 million and are pacing ahead of a pro rata schedule to repurchase our shares under the authorized program in light of this acceleration management plans to review our capital allocation strategy with our board of directors before the end of the year and with that i ll turn it back to pat patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer okay thanks mike i ll just touch on a couple of things and restate a few things for emphasis before we open it up for q a we feel really good about the progress we re making obviously we d like to see a more robust volume environment but as mike explained 60 to 80 of our portfolio we still see as favorable and with the exception of intermodal we still see good growth opportunities in the quarters ahead in the what we what i referred to is the oversized growth areas that we talk about a lot automotive refined products moving into mexico and plastics coming out of the gulf coast so those businesses still look very solid they re producing both volume and revenue growth and in spite of overall flat volumes we re still seeing good revenue growth and sticking with our volume revenue guidance from earlier this year mike also mentioned our cross border product continues to grow double digits in both volume and revenue and we feel there is lots of opportunity for that to continue we are paying and delivering core operational improvements which are driving improved service levels better asset utilization and increased profitability in cash flow we re handling the same volume levels overall that we have off last year with 12 fewer locomotives 7 fewer railcars and 10 fewer crew starts and we think there there s more to come in the months and quarters ahead as sameh and jeff both mentioned we re just beginning to completely restructure and whiteboard our transportation service plan which we re confident will lead to further asset savings and cost savings and service improvements in the months and quarters ahead we re taking our psr related operational savings up by more than 2 5 times in terms of the impact to 2019 and beyond and we ll continue to update investors as we get further into this and particularly in the third and fourth quarter when we see the results on the benefits of our tsp white boarding exercise and we still feel very good generally about our overall portfolio again i ll just restate 60 to 80 neutral or favorable a few outliers that are having a bigger impact on volumes than they are on revenues reducing our capex accordingly improving free cash flow i think our free cash flow conversion rate is increasing as well so all in all in spite of some troubling signals in the economy and still some unresolved trade issues we feel really good about the progress we re making and still feel good about the outlook so with that i will open the call for questions operator president and chief executive officer the first question comes from chris wetherbee of citi please go ahead chris wetherbee analyst yeah hey thanks good morning guys patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer good morning chris wetherbee analyst maybe mike can you start on slide 17 i just want to make sure i understand sort of what the moving parts with the fuel tax credit this week and kind of get that out of the way in the second quarter i think you guys have been expecting an 80 basis point headwind that ended up coming in a bit bigger than that is the sort of the way that we re thinking about this now the way that we should be looking at it going forward so maybe if you could sort of tell us what happened the difference in the quarter between the 80 basis point and the 130 basis point and then as we go forward in the context of the rest of the year and obviously the 2021 guidance we should be assuming that includes this 80 basis point ongoing headwind michael w upchurch executive vice president and chief financial officer yes yes exactly chris the guidance assumes we re going to absorb this negative 80 basis point impact and we re going to be on the low end of the range so you should view that as improvement driven by both of those items and the 80 basis points is what we believe will be the impact going forward in each quarter the reason it was a little higher in the first quarter or second quarter what was for really for two reasons one we had the timing issue of losing the credit on april 30 and not getting it on customer bills until mid may and then secondly since we re not going to adjust this anymore the in quarter benefit related to the ieps credit that we did get is sitting down in income taxes but that s exactly right i think you got that right there is a chris there is a the 80 basis points over time there s a part of our as mike mentioned a part of our customer base that pays and an all in rate so between contract renewals we don t have specific fuel surcharge so it ll take a while for us to catch up if you will and perhaps adjust those contracts to reflect that all in rate versus rate plus fuel so that 80 basis points could come down as those contracts are renewed and it s also important i think we ve mentioned this in other venues we are challenging this decision the loss of the ieps tax credit applies to railroads only so our truck competitors and other modes of competition did not have the same regulation and then we will come down in their case so we think it s discriminatory for us and we are challenging it and we certainly elevated this in our dialog with government officials in mexico but i certainly don t want to make any prediction about the outcome of that but we re trying to defend ourselves here from a market competitiveness standpoint as well as our customers interest and that we ll continue to do that chris wetherbee analyst okay and ultimately there were very little impact on operating income it looks like less than 1 million a quarter or so michael w upchurch executive vice president and chief financial officer that s the point you ve got to a because you re increasing your revenue item and an expense item by roughly the same amount it has a bigger impact on operating ratio but when you really go down the income statement and think about the dollars and pesos involved it s minimal chris wetherbee analyst okay and if i could ask a quick follow up just on the capital structure mike you had some comments there couldn t help but notice that capex guidance come down a little bit obviously profitability with the or improving is going up leverage is sort of trickling toward the lower end of maybe where the peers are moving so how should we think about sort of the capital structure as we go forward seems like a high class problem to have that free cash flow generation is likely to step up as we move forward so when you re thinking about things like accelerated stock repurchases or anything else that you might be thinking about from a capital structure perspective michael w upchurch executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah well you got that exactly right we have a nice problem and we ll continue to have nice problem more and more cash flow generation as a result of the items that you indicated obviously increasing cash from ops and lower capex are going to create a better dynamic for us going forward obviously this is a decision we ll have to reach with our board and i did indicate we would be meeting with the board specifically on our capital allocation policy before the end of the year so stay tuned we don t have any news today but we will soon chris wetherbee analyst okay perfect thanks very much for the time i appreciate it michael w upchurch executive vice president and chief financial officer okay thank you chris operator executive vice president and chief financial officer your next question comes from amit mehrotra of deutsche bank please go ahead amit mehrotra analyst thanks operator good morning everybody michael w upchurch executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning amit mehrotra analyst mike i m not going to ask you about the excise tax credit so you re welcome michael w upchurch executive vice president and chief financial officer thank god amit mehrotra analyst but i did want to ask about the revenue growth guidance being left intact despite the lower volume outlook obviously it implies a uptick in yields in the back half compared to the first half which typically isn t the case if you look at prior years so if you could just help us think about the underlying assumptions there just give us a little bit more comfortable with the assumed acceleration michael w upchurch executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah sure we had indicated in our or pat indicated kind of volume being flat to slightly down if you look at our results through the first half of the year we were down roughly a point a lot of that related to first quarter tetris strikes that obviously we certainly hope won t happen in the back half of the year so flat to slightly down and then i think you need to think about mix obviously the intermodal business is a little bit challenging in today s environment so with the lower revenue per unit you can read into that we ve got a little bit softer outlook on intermodal in the back half of the year but offset by refined product which has a very good length of haul and what we think will be good grain volumes going forward amit mehrotra analyst right so it s not it s really the mix of volume as opposed to any assumed acceleration in pricing is that the way to think about it michael w upchurch executive vice president and chief financial officer correct amit mehrotra analyst okay and then let me just for my follow up i just wanted to ask about the different buckets of the cost structure are we going to see a more sizable reduction in the workforce it s by far the biggest piece of the cost structure i would just imagine the structural improvements we re making could translate to greater opportunity for labor productivity whether that means proactive reduction in the workforce or maybe a limited need to replace those who leave through attrition and your attrition is a little bit maybe high single digits every year so if you can just talk about that and when if at all more step function increase in labor productivity are going to be part of this plan going forward michael w upchurch executive vice president and chief financial officer i ll provide some initial comments here and then maybe ask sameh and jeff to provide a little more detail but i ll state the obvious the best of all possible outcomes is that we improve labor productivity and then we see growth opportunities come in to create a demand for those services those assets those people but we don t necessarily have complete control over the rate of growth that we re seeing there yeah i think obviously the things we re doing in terms of fewer train starts redesigning the network i said this before in previous quarters we re getting out of our own way we re moving congestion we re running a more fluid and efficient railroad and that s just going to result in fewer at the same volume levels that s going to result in the need for fewer locomotives railcars and in crews and then has a further ripple effect in terms of mechanical assets engineering possibly as well so in a flat volume environment the things we re doing should result in further productivity improvements and possibly lower headcount requirements going forward we also have and we ve talked about this for a long time we have work rules in mexico that are not lined up with the way things work in the u s and we think there are some opportunities for gains there as well the mantra of our psr efforts as some of you know is service fee gets grow so we re hoping that by doing all of these things and improving the way we run our railroad producing a more consistent reliable and resilient network that we are able to take better advantage of some of the growth opportunities that we see and we can put all those assets to use but if that growth doesn t occur quickly then we will see further headcount and labor productivity savings i don t know if jeff and sameh have anything to add to that sameh fahmy executive vice president precision scheduled railroading i will just and then i ll let jeff expand on it jeff is we re spending a lot more time on this on the labor relation front but in general by reducing train delays which we have been putting a lot of emphasis on and that s how we have been achieving a lot of velocity improvement we clearly have reduced our crews as an example by reducing train starts well again you have the need for less crews because we have fewer trains by reducing switching in yards and enforcing compliance at least with the existing plan to begin with and i hopefully with the new plan the new service plan train design and yard design we should reduce switching even more well by definition we re going to need also less crews in yards so you look at all these and then add to it the mechanical side where we have taken the worst locomotives out of the fleet that had eight failures per year and 10 failures per year when decent good locomotives have about two failures per year there is a significant reduction in the workload in shops so you add all that together you achieve a lot of staff reductions now on the mechanical side we have done and done a lot of new staff reductions some of that has been offset by some of the insourcing activities because labor in shops makes a lot more sense to be reporting to the company not reporting to a vendor and as a result we have had significant savings in money on that so yes the count can go up but the money i think one shop alone was 4 million less per year in expense we also went ahead and close one shop in monterrey so insource san luis potosi but we close monterrey so the mechanical side we have taken the actions on the transportation side because of the work rules that pat mentioned we cannot just arbitrarily go and take action we still have four men crews in many cases and many situations and we have to work on that with our colleagues from the union and i think jeff he can expand on that jeffrey m songer executive vice president and chief operating officer yeah just a couple of more talking points to tell two countries have been in the u s we ve actually added some crews as part of our efforts and sameh talked about houston again that s just it s more fluid today but it remains a difficult spot it s our highest recrew area of our network and so we ve said it s better to have a little excess resource there and maintain and improve the fluidity versus trying to manage too tight cross border we ve talked about we ve added several crews in nuevo laredo and with international crews on the flip side in mexico we do have opportunities we ve talked in the past about still having three and four person train crews those are collective agreements we are actively working on however that s just progressing a little slower than we would like keep in mind though that the crews while we don t have furlough ability similar to u s if the crews are running trains as we ve talked about crew starts they re collecting just minor benefit from a dollar perspective i know mike mentioned we ve had about 1 million to kind of efficiencies with the train start reduction so not 100 focused on the head count for mexico because of those cost factors but it s still something we re going to continue to work on through the rest of the year we believe there is opportunity and hopefully we get some get some work completed with the mexico union if not that ll just proceed a little slower as you mentioned through attrition amit mehrotra analyst okay i appreciate the comprehensive answer thanks everybody happy weekend operator analyst thanks and good morning justin long analyst thanks and good morning michael w upchurch executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning justin long analyst so just to clarify on the 2021 or target does that just include the 55 million of psr opex savings that you spoke about or some number that s higher than that based on other initiatives you have in the pipeline and then mike also on the psr savings could you talk about what you ve recognized in first and second quarter as we think about what s incremental on the back half to get you to that 40 million number michael w upchurch executive vice president and chief financial officer well let me start with i guess your second question on psr savings the amounts that we disclosed here on page 18 are recorded throughout the course of the year so we now expect 40 million to be the savings as a result of psr actions but that would go up each quarter as you re getting full benefit for those initial reductions that we identified so i don t know if that entirely answers your question the 40 million is kind of a build up throughout the rest of the year and the exit rate will be higher which will lead us to 55 million of annual expense savings in 2020 with respect to your other question we clearly have a view today of having better expense savings as a result of our first six months of psr activities that s why we move to the lower end of the guidance that we had set for 2021 and remember not only did we move to the lower end of the guidance but we re also going to absorb the 80 basis point negative impact from the loss of the fuel tax credit so obviously where we re at in psr savings today did factor into us improving our outlook out into 2021 patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer just to add to that there are lots of moving pieces to operating ratio including revenue and volume growth incremental margins pricing etc and then there are other things that we ve talked about just recently here and in the presentation about the tsp white boarding we fully expect that that s going to produce another possibly another wave of improvement here and then some of the labor issues that jeff and sameh talked about we i would say we don t have all of that because we re at the beginning stages of some of that into our guidance so we ll update guidance as we get better clarity and better information on some of these initiatives but i don t i ll state it this way you didn t state it this way justin so bear with me here a little bit we certainly haven t declared victory on this at this point we still feel like we re fairly early on and have room to improve further justin long analyst okay that s helpful and then secondly i wanted to ask about intermodal clearly this is an area where we ve seen a bit more pressure recently but when do you think intermodal volumes can start to inflect positively and do you need the truckload market to improve in order for that to happen or can you see intermodal growth from company specific areas even in a loser truckload capacity environment michael j naatz executive vice president and chief marketing officer i think that we can certainly pursue growth opportunities and we are doing that for example the cross border intermodal traffic continues to grow despite overall pressure on the u s domestic marketplace i do think though with respect to the u s domestic marketplace we re going to need truck capacity to tighten up in order to improve that situation justin long analyst okay thank you operator analyst the next question comes from allison landry of credit suisse please go ahead unidentified participant analyst hi this is in on for allison landry thanks for taking my question as you just said we ve been seeing some softening in the u s trucking market i was wondering if you could talk about the mexican truckload market a little have you been seeing similar softening in mexico and has that been a drag on intermodal volumes as well thank you michael j naatz executive vice president and chief marketing officer so actually we indicated that we saw improvements in our lazaro intermodal business it doesn t seem to be experiencing quite the same challenges that we re experiencing on the u s domestic side of the marketplace we have a little bit of a disadvantage because of the discriminatory pricing actions resulting from the fuel situation so we ll have to address that over time as we look at our contracts that are in our volume requirements michael w upchurch executive vice president and chief financial officer i d just add to that and what mike said earlier about the u s domestic versus other segments of our market in our appendix and background information to our presentation we do call out the cross border and lazaro intermodal volumes and revenue so you can see we are seeing growth in those markets and the area that we are seeing the most weakness which is a big part of our intermodal business but certainly not all of it is the u s domestic unidentified participant executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks and then also can you give us an update on your initiatives in the houston area specifically are you seeing incremental progress in this area and what do you view as the biggest risk to reconfiguring traffic further sameh fahmy executive vice president precision scheduled railroading i can comment on that this is sameh we have definitely made some operational adjustments to the houston area we change from a method if you like of staging trains ahead of that area to try to avoid congestion on all that to a new method where we actually push our trains frankly through it and also not worry too much about some of the it s difficult to explain in on a call but some of usage of sightings to park trains which end up using the sidings for parking instead of train meets the other thing we did is that we also stopped using the tours which were costing us a lot of money but also losing a bit of control on the transit time of a train a combination of these things have really provided a lot more consistency in the transit time of that area we see 12 miles 13 miles per hour for that area when we used to see about 7 or 8 miles per hour and it s happening now whether there is a pickup of volume or reduction in volume we are getting consistency and that s really important and the other nice thing happening now after we did an exercise with our colleagues from up for 2 5 days around the clock watching exactly what s happening in that area is that not only we change our own matter at kcs of avoiding that staging and trying to predict and forecast and all that but also the transit time itself in the area has improved because of much better dispatching and we see it in the amount of recrews that we ensure we got a lot of trains now that goes through the whole area without any recrews so you can guess through that 120 mile very important area between beaumont and kendleton in six hours which is very good it used to be sometimes 15 and 18 hours so i think we got this one pretty much under control and now we are focusing as i said on my slide on the border and we are focusing on yards these are the next two big areas where we believe we can make a breakthrough and improve our velocity and our dwell and all the other things unidentified participant executive vice president precision scheduled railroading thank you operator executive vice president precision scheduled railroading the question comes from tom wadewitz of ubs please go ahead tom wadewitz analyst yeah good morning wanted to ask you i guess a bit about some of the yard work and white boarding what s the i guess you didn t talk about the monterrey yard i think that s something in the past that has been mentioned as a point of congestion maybe just where are you at in terms of how the yards are functioning are they kind of cleaned up from the initial work that you ve done and primarily what you re going to look for going forward is a reduction in train starts how do we think about the i guess what you re aiming for in the white boarding and what the result may be on the mexico operations sameh fahmy executive vice president precision scheduled railroading let me start and then i ll jeff maybe you can continue here i think there are two things when we think about yards there is the inventory of the yard and i believe that s what you are referring to when you are talking about monterrey and that is an inventory that was 1 000 cars higher back in december than it is today and lot of effort has been taken on that trying to look at cars that sit for a long time and trying to understand why they sit and working also with customers because a lot of these a lot of tracks in the yard are often used for what we call constructive placement which means the car is ready to go to the customer but the customer is not ready to take it so we have been working a lot with our key customers in the monterrey area in a very positive and partnership way and it has brought great fruits that s one side when we talk about yards the other one is more of the operation and the arrival of trains and the departure of trains and the switching in the yard and when i talk about san luis potosi and the week we spend there walking in the yard and sitting in the tower and talking to people ok talking to people tells you much more than anything you can read in annual report they tell you exactly what the issues are and what the solutions are when you look at the yard you find that while there was a train held up on the north side there was a train held up on the south side because some trains came in close to each other not according to plan but they came close to each other because of train delays then you also find that there is a train working in the yard meaning and all setting out of block and picking up a block that was not even supposed to work in the yard that s what i talk about when i say compliance with plan things that go out of plan because another yard on its own initiative decided to add some cars to a train but now you have to work on that same train like it was added in sanchez an example i gave now in san luis potosi you have to make some of these cars out ok and that was not in the plan so you kind of block the movement in the yard look observations of these yards sometimes does not make things easy for the work in the yard and blocks through trains as an example and that s where that compliance becomes important even with the existing plan and making sure also the train arrive when they are supposed to arrive and not bunched up and then in the new plan the new design the new white boarding then you work on trying to avoid the work itself in the first place like get smart about where you do the blocking of the cars for their destinations and try to do the blocking as deep down in the network as you can at the origin and this way you don t switch the car and then switch it again and then switch it again in three different yards but you try to reduce that amount of work and when you reduce that amount of work that s how you create capacity without spending any money because you don t have to reconfigure the yards now ok and you may even change the mission of some yards if we looked at san luis potosi there is a nice interquartile yard for intermodal which is not far from it and it s a greenfield you can build very long tracks without any problem while the old san luis potosi yard is constrained in the middle of a city it s a very old yard so trying when you got a long train and the yard like that you have to do what we call bubbling bubbling it like split it in two tracks and when it departs you have to combine it again you go in a new yard like interquartile and you can build a long track i think i gave you a very large explanation but i think we are passionate about this exercise tom wadewitz analyst yeah i mean that s great i guess for the follow up it sounds like there may be two different lot of opportunities where one of them is compliance and then one of them is the plan what if it s a what are you doing to really drive the culture change and the compliance and then just in terms of the way you implement after the way porting is this a design across all the terminals in mexico do you kind of flip the switch in fourth quarter or do you go terminal by yard by yard and do things one yard at a time thank you jeffrey m songer executive vice president and chief operating officer yeah this is jeff i ll just expand on that you hit it right on so i m looking at this kind of in two phase first phase we ve seen some good work is simply compliance and compliance to current tsp as sameh mentioned in monterrey yard that s been on the one big differences that we ve had and just execution increased focus increased focus on a daily basis through brian s team and the use of additional data and dashboards and tactical kind of business process folks really sitting in and dissecting the day to day operation of the yard that s all added benefit as well as working with customers rightsizing fleets sameh mentioned ct car so i think that s really the bulk of the work that s gone on thus far is more of that day to day tactical accountability and execution as we look forward again we ve talked about a lot of the psr opportunities with tsp is in mexico because of our i would say overly complex intermodal manifest product that s just how we operate down there so looking at the yards and the handlings reducing handlings simplifying those products or improved fluidity but also better product offering for our customers is really kind of the next second half of the year i really think that s really what we re going to get to more long term and structural changes to our tsp tom wadewitz analyst thank you operator analyst the next question comes from brian ossenbeck of jpmorgan please go ahead brian ossenbeck analyst good morning thanks for taking the questions patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer okay brian ossenbeck analyst so pat i wanted to ask you more about the service that was your mantra and you re expecting to see some growth here maybe in the second half of the year in places like grain where the service starts to improve we can see that in your metrics but whereas the ones that we don t see externally is some sort of up service besides being dwell so what can you tell us about how you re viewing that internally which you re talking to with the customers do you have a plan to roll out a plan compliance or something along those lines patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer yes we have a number of different metrics that we look at is as far as customer service and customer satisfaction i feel like from the moment that we actually started and announced our psr initiative and started to work with customers we saw almost from day one improvement in a lot of our key customer metrics and the feedback we re getting from customers and i ll go back in a minute to talk about why kind of picking up on some of the couple of previous questions about how we are going about this in a really cross functional way even as we redesign the tsp which we just talked about the engagement of the sales and marketing team the communication with customers all of those things we re trying to do this in a really thoughtful and cross functional way so that we can get the full benefit of the changes we re making and making sure that our customers are very well aware and informed before we make certain changes so that they can make adjustments not only make adjustments to their supply chain strategies and execution but they d become aware of improvements capacity availability best example is grain one of the reasons we think that we re going to see some improvement in our grain and ag min business is improving cycle times has allowed us to do the same amount of volume with certain customers with fewer assets our first choice when we look at the consequence of that is not to immediately go cut up cars and go to the scrap yard it s to say can we fill that capacity with additional volume and go out and try to sell that capacity take advantage of our improved performance and shorten cycle times and as you can expect it s not like customers immediately have sales on the shelf ready to go so it takes a while for that cycle to be completed in other words customers are going to want to see that these improvements in cycle times and operational metrics is sustainable for some period of time before they go out and put their neck on the line and sell that capacity to their customers but that s always the first choice and i think we talked about this with a number of you one of the barometers that i look at it s kind of a high level metric but it s not terribly sophisticated that the number of unit grain shuttles that we re able to run across our network and for me that gives me an indication of the health and fluidity of our entire network because a lot of those shuttles run from eastern illinois or kansas city all the way down into the heart of mexico so there are five or six different traps we run into trouble around shreveport they get trapped we run in trouble around houston or at the bridge or in monterrey yard even though these trains aren t being handled in monterrey so there are a number of different traps but when we look at the total number of grain trains that we re able to run in any given month or whatever period you choose that s just sort of an indication of the total overall health of our entire network and the last couple of months we ve had record levels of performance even to some extent that have been affected by the flooding at the points of origin in illinois and missouri so for example we ran 42 grain shuttles in the month of may and that freed up a lot of capacity so our first question we ask ourselves when we do that is can we take that capacity can we take those cars crews and locomotive and sell them and fill it up so now i m probably wandered away from your core question but that s kind of an indication of how we re thinking about taking advantage of the benefits that we re producing here and getting back to that service and growth orientation brian ossenbeck analyst all right that s great thanks pat appreciate the comprehensive response there patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer we are way too comprehensive answers here so brian ossenbeck analyst that was a good one i appreciate it the shorter question follow up for mike and mike we ve seen volumes come down from 3 to 4 to flat to possibly down but the revenue guide has stayed the same can i understand the mixed shift and some of that accelerating in the back half of the year but as i look at the change in ieps and more revenue fuel surcharge revenue going to the top line looks that might be 2 percentage points and i think it helps put some context around there how much of the revenue guide staying the same is really from the mixed shift which we ve seen through the first half of the year and how much from the change and how fuel surcharge is being pushed through the geography of the financial statement thanks michael j naatz executive vice president and chief marketing officer so i think revenue is going to be driven by changes in core pricing changes in fuel related expenses and then of course changes in volume with respect to the volume one of the things to keep in mind is that the intermodal volume is disproportionate compared to the revenue so for example if i were looking at my volume numbers you might see that 45 of our volumes are related to intermodal business but only 15 of our revenues are related to intermodal business so there is a very disproportionate impact on volume and revenue and i think that s why you re seeing the revenue continues to be higher even though we ve decreased our overall volume forecast does that help brian ossenbeck analyst yeah and just so maybe to clarify if the fuel surcharge in the slide that mike upchurch had about how that impacts the top line i don t know if that was another kind of factor to consider here michael w upchurch executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah that s what we try to do with the last column on slide 17 is to give you an estimate of what the future quarters might look like obviously we re not talking about what the quarterly total revenues are some going to stay away from percentages but i m sure you can do those calculations with your model we re kind of looking at that 12 8 million brian ossenbeck analyst okay thanks that helps i appreciate it operator analyst the next question comes from ken hoexter of bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead ken hoexter analyst hey great good morning and solid job on the improving psr results great to see just on mike maybe on the 51 million charge maybe you can kind of delve into that talk to us what that s for given that you ve had it three quarters in a row now you mentioned it may continue this is i guess not really typical for rails adopting psr to take such charges but i know historically you ve been a little different given your leases and some of the things you ve been trapped in so maybe talk about what that generates for you and what that s contributing from michael j naatz executive vice president and chief marketing officer yeah ken the charge in the second quarter was predominantly related to locomotives and freight cars that we no longer need in our business so we will be disposing of those either selling or scrapping those i don t think the fact that we ve taken two charges is unusual and i think there could be another one coming sometime in the third or fourth quarter we ll continue to make decisions about equipment and we ll continue to be making decisions about number of resources we need to move trains as we go through the train consolidation and with service plan redesign ken hoexter analyst i guess just trying to clarify that others have kind of just parked locomotives is this getting rid of leases that you ve had or i just want to understand what s the charge as opposed to just parking equipment michael j naatz executive vice president and chief marketing officer it s writing off the net book value of the equipment that we re no longer going to need michael w upchurch executive vice president and chief financial officer and i think the sequence that we ve gone through ken in the case of locomotives is again we taken action we reduced train starts we do something that we think is going to free up capacity and reduce congestion we parked the assets for a period of time and then once we sort of become convinced that that change is going to stick we sell them scrap them get rid of them they re gone and we ve sold quite a few of the locomotives and the impairment charge i think relates to those assets that we have maybe gone through that cycle of parking for a while and then conclude that they are no longer necessary and actually get rid of them ken hoexter analyst okay and then i presume that helps your d a through there just a follow up on the train if i guess sameh you talked about maybe lengthening trains target of 6 000 feet is there something you need to invest more on sidings in mexico or the u s side is that something that s your goal because that s what your network is designed for maybe talk about the potential that increase side by train length size sameh fahmy executive vice president precision scheduled railroading no i ken from a siding lengths we are ok but we still have a lot of very short trains in mexico in the u s the train lengths is very decent grain trains coal trains manifest trains are very nice and quite long and the tonnage is heavy which is the way you want to be in mexico we have some very very short trains and we see them every day thus taken only at the endpoints of the network like lazaro and toluca and some of these locations because the way our structure of trains is we drop off a lot of blocks until we get to the endpoint and then the train becomes short and then when it departs from the opposite direction it is our short and then it picks up a lot of traffic so in the new design we are going to take a look at this to see how can we increase the length even at the endpoints of the network so it s more of a design issue ken than a sidings issue jeffrey m songer executive vice president and chief operating officer he ken i would add just a little color our infrastructure is in good shape for that i think as we started this process 6 000 was a target and as we get into more of the tsp definition and redesign and white boarding as sameh mentioned here in the second half of the year i think your targets for next year will be above that so i think that was a starting point for us to say here is opportunities we see in these commodities i ll say it again with mexico intermodal manifest products we know we have opportunity as we get through the whiteboard exercise i would be very surprised if we don t have more opportunities than that but the infrastructure we have is fine to handle that ken hoexter analyst wonderful appreciate the time i feel like i m giving you guys short answers thank you operator analyst the next question comes from scott group of wolfe research please go ahead scott group analyst hey thanks good morning guys almost good afternoon the long term guide sort of implies around 150 basis points of margin improvement a year do you think we get that in the second half mike or is the fuel headwind sort of too much to overcome and if we don t get that full 150 for 19 do we have visibility at this point to over 150 basis points for next year michael w upchurch executive vice president and chief financial officer well i think if you re asking ken in the back half of 2019 be better than the first half yes we think so with respect to our longer term guidance you can kind of do the math getting into low 60s yeah the 80 basis point headwind on the ieps and then you can do the math on what that requires on an annual basis but if you think about what we ve done through normal operations this year in the first six months we re about 160 basis points better than a year ago scott group analyst let me guess this differently is it fair that we re changing the guide just six months and that we wouldn t be sort of improving the or guidance if it was going to be about 2021 step function we ve got some confidence about more of a step function coming sooner than later is that fair mike michael w upchurch executive vice president and chief financial officer well we wouldn t put the guidance out if we didn t have some confidence in that i d maybe take you back to our january discussion around how we set this we were barely a month into the process and so it shouldn t be very surprising that we re seeing bigger and bigger savings opportunities as we move through this but we do still have things like ptc headwinds that we re trying to overcome in 2019 that won t be there in 2020 and 2021 so all along our guidance had been the first year improvement may not be as good as the second and third year improvement scott group analyst okay makes sense just real quick i see sameh you ve got a slide we ve taken 7 of the cars out we have line of sight to another 3 the locos you ve taken 12 out what do you have line of sight to there for incremental locos sameh fahmy executive vice president precision scheduled railroading the it will depend a lot on the revenue i mean we like pat mentioned a number of times we are hoping that the improved service which is palpable and our customers are telling us that they see the improvement in service that that will generate more business as a matter of fact i think on the commercial call mike this week or last week we won back a customer a customer came back to us because of improved service so if we improve service that would have an impact on how many how we ll size our assets like that said we d love to keep the remaining assets that we have and use them for absorbing more revenue patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer and it s as you know it s easier to get line of sight on cars because that tends to relate to specific customers or commodities or aspects of our business locomotives are used across the entire franchising in entire portfolio so that s why we re being a little more cautious about guiding to any further locomotive reductions sameh fahmy executive vice president precision scheduled railroading and on the car side we still have a lot of system intermodal cars that we have in storage i mean we would love to get more business and using with it scott group analyst okay thanks for the time guys patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer okay operator president and chief executive officer the next question comes from bascome majors of susquehanna please go ahead bascome majors analyst thanks you talked a little bit about attrition earlier i don t think you gave an attrition rate for the business right now can you talk about the kind of inherent attrition rate in the u s or mexico and where it s tracking today michael w upchurch executive vice president and chief financial officer it s kind of 6 7 normal attrition bascome majors analyst is that the same on both sides of the border michael w upchurch executive vice president and chief financial officer that i don t know i just know overall bascome majors analyst all right and on capex mike you talked about 18 of revenues feeling like the right level when we get beyond this year historically you ve done a lot of chunky co investment projects to grow the business with some of your customers would that include those kinds of projects and regardless of that answer do you have a line of sight into anything like that coming up next year or the year after thank you michael j naatz executive vice president and chief marketing officer yeah sitting here today we don t have big projects like a sasol if that s what you re referring to if those opportunities come our way we ll take a look at them and see whether it makes sense to invest but no there is nothing of that scale built into the 2020 2021 capex to revenue guidance that we ve provided bascome majors analyst thank you operator analyst the next question comes from brandon oglenski of barclays please go ahead david zazula analyst good morning this is david zazula on for brandon thanks for taking my question maybe for mike you guys had an interchange partner go on media yesterday ordering passage of the usmca just wondering if you could comment a little bit on how you think the potential added foreign investment might impact flows on the railroad and how that could affect your operational and capital planning patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer i ll take that and i yes we re very much in support of usmca it s something that s very important to our company our customers our communities and i ve been quite vocal in both washington and mexico city supporting the passage of that trade agreement in spite of the uncertainty of usmca and for the last couple of years look back over the last several quarters we ve seen just exceptional growth in our cross border volumes we do feel that the cloud of uncertainty has curtailed investments even though some of the data that s published about direct foreign investment in mexico continues to increase we think that there are investments that maybe companies have been considering that they ve held off or delayed because of concern about the passage of the trade agreement i ve gotten out of the business of predicting what congress will do a long time ago feel like there is no reason that this trade agreements should not be approved it s certainly better than nafta and it s way better than no trade agreement and we ll continue to be involved in trying to influence the outcome in the direction of the debate and hope to have some resolution on that in the next probably not until after the recess in the u s congress but hopefully by the end of the year david zazula analyst great thanks operator analyst this concludes our question and answer session i d like to turn the conference back over to pat ottensmeyer for closing remarks patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer okay well we will i will wrap up very quickly thank you for your time and attention and when we do our next shareholder and investor survey please give us high marks for comprehensiveness of answers thank you very much and we

the agreement signed between the pti led government and the imf for structural reforms in the economy is evoking resistance from people of all walks of life businesses from small to big employees trade unions daily wage earners teachers agriculturalists industrialists industrial workers everyone seems to be agitating against the imf s prescriptions of high taxes and increases in oil gas and electrify prices giving rise to unprecedented inflation in the country recently the protest of the trading community led to a call for a shutter down strike across the country according to reports 80 percent businesses in different big cities were closed further the all traders association of pakistan has said that it will cotinue with an indefinite shutter down and that traders won t be filling their 2019 tax returns if no agreement is reached between the traders and the fbr as a matter of fact protest is not only confined to the business community the opposition parties are also agitating against the repressive taxation and inflationary measures taken by the government in the 2019 2020 budget under imf pressure bilawal bhutto zardari chairman of the ppp is the most vocal critic of the government s budgetary steps and has called the 2019 budget the ptimf budget according to bilawal bhutto this budget is economically killing common people workers and businesses mariyam nawaz sharif vice president of the pml n has recently announced that she will launch a protest movement across the country by leading rallies in major cities moreover opposition parties have forged an alliance in this regard with the view to mobilize the people against the current government for imposing repressive economic policies of high taxation causing a massive price hike of everything from food to medicines and gas to oil this is not a good omen for the country which is already bleeding from terrorism and its wounds are yet to be healed such a confrontation between business opposition and government will further aggravate the economic situation the immediate outcome will be low investment low growth less jobs more poverty more social tensions and growing political uncertainty no government can afford to see such an economic situation developing the government should immediately take confidence building measures to restore the confidence of the business and consumer communities in this regard the recent interview of unilever ceo ms shazia syed is very seminal she has a message for prime minister imran khan the government should work on confidence building the economy needs stimulation we need some certainty on growth because of the tough economic conditions she says consumer is feeling the stress they re not in an adventurous mood food inflation is in double digits utility bills have gone up substantially ms shazia syed s interview entails that at the moment market is facing a low animal spirit a term used by prominent british economist john maynard keynes to explain a situation when investors and consumers are unwilling to invest and spend respectively in the market due to uncertainty this low animal spirit situation ultimately leads to stagflation high inflation and high unemployment and stagnant demand to avoid this situation keynes supported deficit financing and suggested that the government should borrow and pump in more money in the market to restore the confidence of both investors and consumers to put the economy back on the rails ironically instead of adopting this approach to address the low animal spirit of the market the pakistan government has adopted neoliberal solutions to our economy consisting of contractionary measures such as increasing interest rate 13 25 percent increasing taxes and reducing government spending this is bound to suffocate the already ailing economy and reduce investment increase unemployment and create more social and political unrest in the country which is already replete with many challenges on internal and external front the cuts in public sector spending means less money for health and education this is described by political economists like susan strange in her book a fate worse than debt as bad economics which is being promoted by the imf in developing countries no doubt the state has to play an important role in such conditions to overcome the market deficits and boost businesses through economic stimulus packages to address the low animal spirit prevailing in the market even global management consulting firms like mckinsey are critical of the neoliberal approach to solve the economic problems of developing countries through quarterly capitalism a reference to the quarterly evaluation of imf conditionalities offering short term solutions rather than building long term capitalism with a human face to boost businesses protect workers and vulnerable sections of society so instead of squeezing business the government should work on addressing the inefficiencies of the state which are creating economic problems whether one likes it or not businesses are the emerging potential force in the economy these days keeping in view the declining capacity of the state to manage resources efficiently in any economy the state has to perform three key functions first it has to generate revenues second it has to make those revenues available to those who can potentially and productively utilize them businesses and entrepreneurs third it has to build institutions to address issues such as inequalities poverty unemployment and economic conflicts between haves and have nots associated with growth and wealth generation but our state has miserably failed in all three core functions as a result we see our state lurching from crises to crises and losing the trust of both people and businesses while enslaving the economy to global institutions of which the main job is accumulation of money from developing countries in the cloak of so called stabilization needless to say the infinite greed and accumulation of wealth through debt payments has evoked unprecedented resistance to the holy trinity of capitalism the imf the world bank and the wto that is devoted to serve the interests of g 7 countries rather than developing countries the resistance is not confined to pakistan it is global and emanates from the imf s approach of one size fits all while ignoring the social and political context of the country requesting imf assistance if we look at the literature available on the subject we will find imf programmes have evoked resistance in other countries too such as indonesia mexico argentinian brazil bolivia columbia costa rica honduras kenya and etc in indonesia in 1998 riots erupted against rising inflation unemployment and poverty as a result of the imf programme signed between the imf and a dying dictator according to figures the imf and the world bank together disbursed around 45 billion to the suharto regime during his 32 year brutal rule yet 50 percent population lived below the poverty line there is more or less the same story in latin american countries known as the red continent for left oriented revolutions where imf programmes met with tough resistance in the form of strikes shutter downs demonstrations demanding an end to the imf prescription of liberalization privatization price hikes and decline in public services in the end i would suggest that the government should adopt prudent economic policies to boost business and protect workers and common people from the shocks of imf driven economic policies further it should work out a strategy to develop consensus on economic policies by taking all the stakeholders on board a solo flight will land the government nowhere

the ruling class s consensus in support of globalizing the american economy is working quite well for its architects the cosmopolitan class while leaving behind the great american middle sen josh hawley r mo says during his keynote address at the national conservatism conference hawley slammed what he called the political consensus that reflects the interests not of the american middle but of a powerful upper class and their cosmopolitan priorities that has been supported by both republicans and democrats for decades the goal of the cosmopolitan class hawley says is mass globalization not only of the american economy but of the american way of life with efforts for closer and closer economic union more immigration more trade on whatever terms to blur the boundaries between america and the rest of the world and eliminate land and economic borders call it the cosmopolitan consensus hawley said of the ruling class s globalist priorities hawley continued the goal is to build a global consumer economy one that will provide an endless supply of cheap goods most of them made with cheap labor overseas and funded by american dollars but it s about more than economics according to the cosmopolitan consensus globalization is a moral imperative that s because our elites distrust patriotism and dislike the common culture left to us by our forbearers the cosmopolitan elite look down on the common affections that once bound this nation together things like place and national feeling and religious faith they regard our inherited traditions as oppressive and our shared institutions like family and neighborhood and church as backwards the cultural and economic model that has been foisted on american citizens by the ruling aristocracy hawley said is one entrenched in a progressive agenda of social liberation in tune with the priorities of their wealthy counterparts around the globe this cosmopolitan economy and culture has worked quite well for the ruling elite but has left the american middle class behind with economic and social destruction according to hawley whom it has not served are the people whose labor sustains this nation hawley said whom it has not helped are the citizens whose sacrifices protect our republic whom it has not benefited is the great american middle because in this bargain foreign competitors get to make the goods and we just buy them and then they buy up american companies with the profits and yes in this bargain there are lots of jobs jobs on wall street or in hollywood or in silicon valley hawley continued because the truth is the cosmopolitan economy has made the cosmopolitan class an aristocracy at the same time it has encouraged multinational corporations to move jobs and assets overseas to chase the cheapest wages and pay the lowest taxes this hawley said has left middle america with flat wages with lost jobs with declining investment and declining opportunity that has translated into a social crisis for the working class declining rates of marriage declining birth rates falling life expectancy as well as an opioid and drug addiction epidemic hawley said is it any surprise that in the last half century as our leaders have pursued a program the american middle does not espouse does not support and does not benefit from that public confidence in american government has collapsed is it any wonder that american voters regularly tells pollsters they feel unheard disempowered and disrespected because who now listens to the american middle the cosmopolitan agenda has driven both left and right the left champions multiculturalism and degrades our common identity the right celebrates hyper globalization and promises that the market will make everything right in the end eventually perhaps in truth neither political party has seemed much interested in the american middle for quite a long time and neither has seemed much interested in the republic the middle sustains a comprehensive survey by pew research center released in march reveals an overwhelming divide between the country s working and middle class and the ruling class as well as their allies in the donor class about 73 percent of americans said the gap between the rich and poor will continue to grow a plurality of nearly 40 percent said the country will be weakened culturally due to a growing multicultural population 44 percent said the standard of living for americans by 2050 will be worse than today s standard nearly half of the working class said automation will take their jobs in the future and majorities across economic groups said the lower class is likely to increase and the middle class is set to decrease cities like chicago new york city los angeles san francisco and washington d c have become nearly unlivable for middle class americans as income inequality booms in part due to historic levels of immigration to the u s that is driving up housing costs and rents for decades free trade has helped

enter the world trade organization wto nearly five million american manufacturing jobs and 50 000 manufacturing facilities have been eliminated from the u s economy meanwhile the washington dc imposed

on sunday july 7 kyriakos mitsotakis led his conservative nea demokratia new democracy party to a convincing win in the greek parliamentary elections gaining 158 out of 300 seats the following day the yield on the greek 10 year government bond at one point touched 2 01 the lowest since greece joined the eurozone on january 1 2001 and slightly lower than that of the 10 year us treasury note the bond market considered the savviest of financial markets had delivered a resounding vote of confidence in the new greek prime minister it was also the result of an overall comeback from the european debt crisis which plagued the greek economy for much of the past decade will mitsotakis be able to justify such advance accolades and make good on his electoral promise of less state fewer taxes and more investments a harvard graduate ba mba ex banker chase london alpha bank national bank of greece and former minister of administrative reform he is greek political royalty his father konstantinos was prime minister 1990 93 and kyriakos was first elected to parliament a decade later in january 2016 he became president of nea demokratia the party cofounded by his father which he led to victory earlier this month nearly 50 of the popular vote went to left wing parties with former ruling party syriza taking the lion s share four years of misrule by the syriza coalition and its leader alexis tsipras notwithstanding the political left has survived the election this leaves the door open for syriza to slow down any reform drive of the new administration by launching an anti austerity front laced with nationalist rhetoric if need be the irony is that syriza after his election on a far left platform four years ago actually caved in to european union austerity demands tsipras swiveled 180 degrees from his radical election rhetoric inking a controversial bailout deal that saw greece accept austerity through 2060 and surrender control of its public assets for the next century the cost has been huge with major cuts to education healthcare and pensions and the deal split syriza according to george souvlis of the european university institute the party was dissolved half left and what remained was an empty shell with the radical left having abandoned its principles in favor of a neoliberal bailout greece was ripe for change race to center vassilis karatzas an athens fund manager and cio at levant partners says the election result was part of a race to the center call it a return to reality greeks had come to realize that there s no easy way out that there are no magical solutions he said pointing out that nea demokratia has polled ahead of syriza since 2016 the year mitsotakis took over as party president the results are in greece is politically stabilizing 72 of the popular vote is shared between center right 40 and the now center left syriza 32 when it came to populism left or right greece was the first in and now is the first out karatzas said such newfound political stability the precondition for investment in the country is the single largest indispensable ingredient for in depth economic recovery the mitsotakis government is targeting private investment foreign and domestic in the amount of 100 billion euros over the coming five to ten years and knows that it needs to get on with it if stability is to be maintained a competent finance and economic policy team appears to have been put in place the prime minister himself will lead administrative reform and streamlining of the executive finance minister christos staikouras an imperial college london mba and former bank of england analyst is described as an experienced technocrat and polar opposite of his flamboyant motorcycling predecessor yanis varoufakis who mitsotakis once memorably remarked undermined greece s negotiating position with brussels every time he opens his mouth the logical outcome of varoufakis s policies was the closure of greek banks in june and july of 2015 and the imposition of capital controls bank of greece governor yannis stournaras will likely be relieved that he now deals with a government that s competent in finance he has announced that his first priority is the immediate lifting of all remaining capital controls imposed by the previous government while he s at it he may want to consider cutting bank of greece staff from a bloated 15 000 to at most the german bundesbank s 9 900 investment over austerity mitsotakis it appears is looking to take a different tack than his predecessor pushing investment and structural reform as opposed to relying on austerity to stabilize greece s financial position brussels does not appear willing to give him much leeway for supply side structural reforms no surprise then that he s a man in a hurry but the attitude seems right greece is not poor he has said just badly run under syriza and its predecessor governments from 2008 to 2018 the effective greek corporate income tax rate grew by 5 8 percentage points according to a study by the tax foundation a washington think tank while the average rate for the 31 countries surveyed decline by 1 5 percentage points with its current corporate tax rate of 29 greece ranks 25th out of 35 oecd countries on the international tax competitiveness index these are massive disincentives to investment no greek national who at the height of the greek debt crisis of 2010 2012 took his capital out of the country is going to bring it back in merely to be robbed by the tax collector a close second to extortionate taxes on the list of disincentives to invest is lack of investment projects of significant size several large projects have been systematically torpedoed by the syriza government most notable among them plans by chinese logistics giant cosco to expand the port of piraeus which is regarded as a key element in the chinese belt and road initiative a goldmine project by canadian mining company eldorado gold in northern greece and a massive 8 billion urban development project to transform the terrain that once was the athens ellinikon international airport cutting of corporate taxes from 29 to 20 in two stages between now and 2021 is one of the first stated economic and financial legislative priorities of the new government equally urgent according to the central bank governor will be passing legislation to reform antiquated insolvency laws and to allow banks to more effectively resolve masses of bad credit in the banking system so as to extend new credits for investment projects why is that reform legislation so urgent as of the end of 2018 a shocking 48 of loans at greek banks were non performing amounting to 88 6 billion by comparison across the eu the average non performing loan ratio currently is 4 emphasis on cutting taxes and resolving non performing loans to stimulate new investment is the right recipe and what has been missing in greece according to holger schmieding chief economist at berenberg bank london and previously at bank of america in the greek debt crisis schmieding told asia times greece and its official creditors put far too much emphasis on austerity to suppress demand instead of structural reforms to raise supply alexander kritikos economist at the german institute for economic research in berlin similarly underlines the critical significance of structural reform greece needs an improvement of regulatory boundary conditions an improvement in the quality of state institutions above all reform of the justice system to speed up civil proceedings in the enforcement of contractual claims he said in eight of the past ten years the greek economy has contracted in 2011 it shrank by 9 2 unemployment reached 27 5 in 2013 economic and job growth is the mitsotakis government s make or break political task like the character rod tidwell in the film jerry maguire greeks will say show me the money when it comes to judging mitsotakis said fund manager karatzas a first success came this past tuesday greece tapped markets to raise 2 5 billion from the sale of 7 year bonds at a low yield of 1 9 bids topped 12 5 billion mitsotakis said this is a vote of confidence in greece s growth prospects he is right and he showed them the money middle east editor alison tahmizian meuse contributed reporting from beirut

1 planning as a synonym for socialism the term planning is mostly used as a synonym for socialism communism and authoritarian and totalitarian economic management sometimes only the german pattern of socialism zwangswirtschaft is called planning while the term socialism proper is reserved for the russian pattern of outright socialization and bureaucratic operation of all plants shops and farms at any rate planning in this sense means all around planning by the government and enforcement of these plans by the police power planning in this sense means full government control of business it is the antithesis of free enterprise private initiative private ownership of the means of production market economy and the price system planning and capitalism are utterly incompatible within a system of planning production is conducted according to the government s orders not according to the plans of capitalists and entrepreneurs eager to profit by best filling the wants of the consumers but the term planning is also used in a second sense lord keynes sir william beveridge professor hansen and many other eminent men assert that they do not want to substitute totalitarian slavery for freedom they declare that they are planning for a free society they recommend a third system which as they say is as far from socialism as it is from capitalism which as a third solution of the problem of society s economic organization stands midway between the two other systems and while retaining the advantages of both avoids the disadvantages inherent in each 2 planning as a synonym for interventionism these self styled progressives are certainly mistaken when they pretend that their proposals are new and unheard of the idea of this third solution is very old indeed and the french have long since baptized it with a pertinent name they call it interventionism hardly anybody can doubt that history will link the idea of social security more closely than with the american new deal and with sir william beveridge with the memory of bismarck whom our fathers did not precisely describe as a liberal all the essential ideas of present day interventionist progressivism were neatly expounded by the supreme brain trusters of imperial germany professors schmoller and wagner who at the same time urged their kaiser to invade and to conquer the americas far be it from me to condemn any idea only on account of its not being new but as the progressives slander all their opponents as old fashioned orthodox and reactionary it is expedient to observe that it would be more appropriate to speak of the clash of two orthodoxies the bismarck orthodoxy versus the jefferson orthodoxy 3 what interventionism or mixed economy means before entering into an investigation of the interventionist system of a mixed economy two points must be clarified first if within a society based on private ownership of the means of production some of these means are owned and operated by the government or by municipalities this still does not make for a mixed system which would combine socialism and private ownership as long as only certain individual enterprises are publicly controlled the characteristics of the market economy determining economic activity remain essentially unimpaired the publicly owned enterprises too as buyers of raw materials semi finished goods and labor and as sellers of goods and services must fit into the mechanism of the market economy they are subject to the law of the market they have to strive after profits or at least to avoid losses when it is attempted to mitigate or to eliminate this dependence by covering the losses of such enterprises with subsidies out of public funds the only result is a shifting of this dependence somewhere else this is because the means for the subsidies have to be raised somewhere they may be raised by collecting taxes but the burden of such taxes has its effects on the public not on the government collecting the tax it is the market and not the revenue department which decides upon whom the tax falls and how it affects production and consumption the market and its inescapable law are supreme 4 two patterns of socialism second there are two different patterns for the realization of socialism the one pattern we may call it the marxian or russian pattern is purely bureaucratic all economic enterprises are departments of the government just as the administration of the army and the navy or the postal system every single plant shop or farm stands in the same relation to the superior central organization as does a post office to the office of the postmaster general the whole nation forms one single labor army with compulsory service the commander of this army is the chief of state the second pattern we may call it the german or zwangswirtschaft system differs from the first one in that it seemingly and nominally maintains private ownership of the means of production entrepreneurship and market exchange so called entrepreneurs do the buying and selling pay the workers contract debts and pay interest and amortization but they are no longer entrepreneurs in nazi germany they were called shop managers or betriebsfuhrer the government tells these seeming entrepreneurs what and how to produce at what prices and from whom to buy at what prices and to whom to sell the government decrees at what wages laborers should work and to whom and under what terms the capitalists should entrust their funds market exchange is but a sham as all prices wages and interest rates are fixed by the authority they are prices wages and interest rates in appearance only in fact they are merely quantitative terms in the authoritarian orders determining each citizen s income consumption and standard of living the authority not the consumers directs production the central board of production management is supreme all citizens are nothing but civil servants this is socialism with the outward appearance of capitalism some labels of the capitalistic market economy are retained but they signify here something entirely different from what they mean in the market economy it is necessary to point out this fact to prevent a confusion of socialism and interventionism the system of hampered market economy or interventionism differs from socialism by the very fact that it is still a market economy the authority seeks to influence the market by the intervention of its coercive power but it does not want to eliminate the market altogether it desires that production and consumption should develop along lines different from those prescribed by the unhindered market and it wants to achieve its aim by injecting into the working of the market orders commands and prohibitions for whose enforcement the police power and its apparatus of coercion and compulsion stand ready but these are isolated interventions their authors assert that they do not plan to combine these measures into a completely integrated system which regulates all prices wages and interest rates and which thus places full control of production and consumption in the hands of the authorities 5 only method of permanently raising wage rates for all the fundamental principle of those truly liberal economists who are nowadays generally abused as orthodox reactionaries and economic royalists is this there are no means by which the general standard of living can be raised other than by accelerating the increase of capital as compared with population all that good government can do to improve the material well being of the masses is to establish and to preserve an institutional setting in which there are no obstacles to the progressive accumulation of new capital and its utilization for the improvement of technical methods of production the only means to increase a nation s welfare is to increase and to improve the output of products the only means to raise wage rates permanently for all those eager to earn wages is to raise the productivity of labor by increasing the per head quota of capital invested and improving the methods of production hence the liberals conclude that the economic policy best fitted to serve the interests of all strata of a nation is free trade both in domestic business and in international relations the interventionists on the contrary believe that government has the power to improve the masses standard of living partly at the expense of the capitalists and entrepreneurs partly at no expense at all they recommend the restriction of profits and the equalization of incomes and fortunes by confiscatory taxation the lowering of the rate of interest by an easy money policy and credit expansion and the raising of the workers standard of living by the enforcement of minimum wage rates they advocate lavish government spending they are curiously enough at the same time in favor of low prices for consumers goods and of high prices for agricultural products the liberal economists that is those disparaged as orthodox do not deny that some of these measures can in the short run improve the lot of some groups of the population but they say in the long run they must produce effects which from the point of view of the government and the supporters of its policies are less desirable than the previous state of affairs they wanted to alter these measures are therefore when judged from the point of view of their own advocates contrary to purpose 6 interventionism the cause of depression it is true many people believe that economic policy should not bother at all about long run consequences they quote a dictum of lord keynes in the long run we are all dead i do not question the truth of this statement i even consider it as the only correct declaration of the neo british cambridge school but the conclusions drawn from this truism are entirely fallacious the exact diagnosis of the economic evils of our age is we have outlived the short run and are suffering from the long run consequences of policies which did not take them into consideration the interventionists have silenced the warning voices of the economists but things developed precisely as these much abused orthodox scholars had predicted depression is the aftermath of credit expansion mass unemployment prolonged year after year is the inextricable effect of attempts to keep wage rates above the level which the unhampered market would have fixed all those evils which the progressives interpret as evidence of the failure of capitalism are the necessary outcome of allegedly social interference with the market it is true that many authors who advocated these measures and many statesmen and politicians who executed them were impelled by good intentions and wanted to make people more prosperous but the means chosen for the attainment of the ends aimed at were inappropriate however good intentions may be they can never render unsuitable means any more suitable it must be emphasized that we are discussing means and measures not ends the matter at issue is not whether the policies advocated by the self styled progressives are to be recommended or condemned from any arbitrary preconceived point of view the essential problem is whether such policies can really attain the ends aimed at it is beside the mark to confuse the debate by referring to accidental and irrelevant matters it is useless to divert attention from the main problem by vilifying capitalists and entrepreneurs and by glorifying the virtues of the common man precisely because the common man is worthy of all consideration it is necessary to avoid policies detrimental to his welfare the market economy is an integrated system of intertwined factors that mutually condition and determine one another the social apparatus of coercion and compulsion i e the state certainly has the might to interfere with the market the government or agencies in which the government either by legal privilege or by indulgence has vested the power to apply violent pressure with impunity are in a position to decree that certain market phenomena are illegal but such measures do not bring about the results which the interfering power wants to attain they not only render conditions more unsatisfactory for the interfering authority they disintegrate the market system altogether they paralyze its operation they bring about chaos if one considers the working of the market system as unsatisfactory one must try to substitute another system for it this is what the socialists aim at but socialism is not the subject matter of this meeting s discussion i was invited to deal with interventionism i e with various measures designed to improve the operation of the market system not to abolish it altogether and what i contend is that such measures must bring about results which from the point of view of their supporters are more undesirable than the previous state of affairs they wanted to alter 7 marx condemned interventionism karl marx did not believe that government or trade union interference with the market can attain the beneficial ends expected marx and his consistent followers condemned all such measures in their frank language as reformist nonsense capitalist fraud and petty bourgeois idiocy they called the supporters of such measures reactionaries clemenceau was right when he said one is always a reactionary in somebody s opinion karl marx declared that under capitalism all material goods and likewise labor are commodities and that socialism will abolish the commodity character both of material goods and of labor the notion commodity character is peculiar to the marxian doctrine it was not used before its meaning is that goods and labor are negotiated on markets are sold and bought on the basis of their value according to marx the commodity character of labor is implied in the very existence of the wages system it can disappear only at the higher stage of communism as a consequence of the disappearance of the wages system and of payment of wage rates marx would have ridiculed the endeavors to abolish the commodity character of labor by an international treaty and the establishment of an international labor office and by national legislation and the allocation of money to various national bureaus i mention these things only in order to show that the progressives are utterly mistaken in referring to marx and the doctrine of the commodity character of labor in their fight against the economists whom they call reactionary 8 minimum wage rates bring about mass unemployment what these old orthodox economists said was this a permanent rise in wage rates for all people eager to earn wages is only possible as far as the per head quota of capital invested and concomitantly the productivity of labor increases it does not benefit the people if minimum wage rates are fixed at a level above that which the unhampered market would have fixed it does not matter whether this tampering with wage rates is done by government decree or by labor union pressure and compulsion in either case the outcome is pernicious to the welfare of a great section of the population in an unhampered labor market wage rates are fixed by the interplay of demand and supply at a level at which all those eager to work can finally find jobs in a free labor market unemployment is temporary only and never affects more than a small fraction of the people there prevails a continuous tendency for unemployment to disappear but if wage rates are raised by the interference of government or unions above this level things change as long as only one part of labor is unionized the wage rise enforced by the unions does not lead to unemployment but to an increased supply of labor in those branches of business where there are no efficient unions or no unions at all the workers who lost their jobs as a consequence of union policy enter the market of the free branches and cause wages to drop in these branches the corollary of the rise in wages for organized workers is a drop in wages for unorganized workers but if fixing of wage rates above the potential market level becomes general workers losing their jobs cannot find employment in other branches they remain unemployed unemployment emerges as a mass phenomenon prolonged year after year such were the teachings of these orthodox economists nobody succeeded in refuting them it was much easier to abuse their authors hundreds of treatises monographs and pamphlets sneered at them and called them names novelists playwrights politicians joined the chorus but truth has its own way it works and produces effects even if party programs and textbooks refuse to acknowledge it as truth events have proved the correctness of the predictions of the orthodox economists the world faces the tremendous problem of mass unemployment it is vain to talk about employment and unemployment without precise reference to a definite rate of wages the inherent tendency of capitalist evolution is to raise real wage rates steadily this outcome is the effect of the progressive accumulation of capital by means of which technological methods of production are improved whenever the accumulation of additional capital stops this tendency comes to a standstill if capital consumption is substituted for an increase of capital available real wage rates must drop temporarily until the checks to a further increase in capital are removed the malinvestment i e the squandering of capital that is the most characteristic feature of credit expansion and the orgy of the fictitious boom it produces the confiscation of profits and fortunes wars and revolutions are such checks it is a sad fact that they temporarily lower the masses standard of living but these sad facts cannot be brushed away by wishful thinking there are no other means to remove them than those recommended by the orthodox economists a sound money policy thrift in public expenditures international cooperation for safeguarding durable peace economic freedom 9 traditional labor union policies harmful to the worker the remedies suggested by the unorthodox doctrinaires are futile their application makes things worse not better there are well intentioned men who exhort union leaders to make only moderate use of their powers but these exhortations are in vain because their authors do not realize that the evils they want to avoid are not due to lack of moderation in the wage policies of the unions they are the necessary outcome of the whole economic philosophy underlying union activities with regard to wage rates it is not my task to inquire what good effects unions could possibly bring about in other fields for instance in education professional training and so on i deal only with their wage policies the essence of these policies is to prevent the unemployed from finding jobs by underbidding union rates this policy splits the whole potential labor force into two classes the employed who earn wages higher than those they would have earned on an unhampered labor market and the unemployed who do not earn anything at all in the early thirties money wage rates in this country dropped less than the cost of living hourly real wage rates increased in the midst of a catastrophic spread of unemployment for many of those employed the depression meant a rise in the standard of living while the unemployed were victimized the repetition of such conditions can only be avoided by entirely discarding the idea that union compulsion and coercion can benefit all those eager to work and to earn wages what is needed is not lame warnings one must convince the workers that the traditional union policies do not serve the interests of all but only those of one group while in individual bargaining the unemployed virtually have a voice they are excluded in collective bargaining the union officers do not care about the fate of non members and especially not about that of beginners eager to enter their industry union rates are fixed at a level at which a considerable part of available manpower remains unemployed mass unemployment is not proof of the failure of capitalism but the proof of the failure of traditional union methods the same considerations apply to the determination of wage rates by government agencies or by arbitration if the decision of the government or the arbitrator fixes wage rates at the market level it is superfluous if it fixes wage rates at a higher level it produces mass unemployment the fashionable panacea suggested lavish public spending is no less futile if the government provides the funds required by taxing the citizens or by borrowing from the public it abolishes on the one hand as many jobs as it creates on the other if government spending is financed by borrowing from commercial banks it means credit expansion and inflation then the prices of all commodities and services must rise whatever the government does to prevent this outcome if in the course of an inflation the rise in commodity prices exceeds the rise in nominal wage rates unemployment will drop but what makes unemployment shrink is precisely the fact that real wage rates are falling lord keynes recommended credit expansion because he believed that the wage earners will acquiesce in this outcome he believed that a gradual and automatic lowering of real wage rates as a result of rising prices would not be so strongly resisted by labor as an attempt to lower money wage rates it is very unlikely that this will happen public opinion is fully aware of the changes in purchasing power and watches with burning interest the movements of the index of commodity prices and of cost of living the substance of all discussions concerning wage rates is real wage rates not nominal wage rates there is no prospect of outsmarting the unions by such tricks but even if lord keynes assumption were correct no good could come from such a deception great conflicts of ideas must be solved by straight and frank methods they cannot be solved by artifices and makeshifts what is needed is not to throw dust into the eyes of the workers but to convince them they themselves must realize that the traditional union methods do not serve their interests they themselves must abandon of their own accord policies that harm both them and all other people 10 the social function of profit and loss what those allegedly planning for freedom do not comprehend is that the market with its prices is the steering mechanism of the free enterprise system flexibility of commodity prices wage rates and interest rates is instrumental in adapting production to the changing conditions and needs of the consumers and in discarding backward technological methods if these adjustments are not brought about by the interplay of the forces operating on the market they must be enforced by government orders this means full government control the nazi zwangswirtschaft there is no middle way the attempts to keep commodity prices rigid to raise wage rates and to lower interest rates ad libitum only paralyze the system they create a state of affairs which does not satisfy anybody they must be either abandoned by a return to freedom of the market or they must be completed by pure and undisguised socialism the inequality of income and fortunes is essential in capitalism the progressives consider profits as objectionable the very existence of profits is in their eyes a proof that wage rates could be raised without harm to anybody else than idle parasites they speak of profit without dealing with its corollary loss profit and loss are the instruments by means of which the consumers keep a tight rein on all entrepreneurial activities a profitable enterprise tends to expand an unprofitable one tends to shrink the elimination of profit renders production rigid and abolishes the consumers sovereignty this will happen not because the enterprisers are mean and greedy and lack these monkish virtues of self sacrifice which the planners ascribe to all other people in the absence of profits the entrepreneurs would not learn what the wants of the consumers are and if they were to guess they would not have the means to adjust and to expand their plants accordingly profits and loss withdraw the material factors of production from the hands of the inefficient and convey them into the hands of the more efficient it is their social function to make a man the more influential in the conduct of business the better he succeeds in producing commodities for which people scramble it is therefore beyond the point to apply to profits the yardstick of personal merit or happiness of course mr x would probably be as happy with 10 million as with 100 million from a metaphysical point of view it is certainly inexplicable why mr x should make 2 million a year while the chief justice or the nation s foremost philosophers and poets make much less but the question is not about mr x it is about the consumers would the consumers be better and more cheaply supplied if the law were to prevent the most efficient entrepreneurs from expanding the sphere of their activities the answer is clearly in the negative if the present tax rates had been in effect from the beginning of our century many who are millionaires today would live under more modest circumstances but all those new branches of industry which supply the masses with articles unheard of before would operate if at all on a much smaller scale and their products would be beyond the reach of the common man the market system makes all men in their capacity as producers responsible to the consumer this dependence is direct with entrepreneurs capitalists farmers and professional men and indirect with people working for salaries and wages the economic system of the division of labor in which everybody provides for his own needs by serving other people cannot operate if there is no factor adjusting the producers efforts to the wishes of those for whom they produce if the market is not allowed to steer the whole economic apparatus the government must do it 11 a free market economy best serves the common man the socialist plans are absolutely wrong and unrealizable this is another subject but the socialist writers are at least clear sighted enough to see that simply to paralyze the market system results in nothing but chaos when they favor such acts of sabotage and destruction they do so because they believe that the chaos brought about will pave the way for socialism but those who pretend that they want to preserve freedom while they are eager to fix prices wage rates and interest rates at a level different from that of the market delude themselves there is no other alternative to totalitarian slavery than liberty there is no other planning for freedom and general welfare than to let the market system work there is no other means to attain full employment rising real wage rates and a high standard of living for the common man than private initiative and free enterprise

chairman thank you gary good morning everyone kevin and chris and john are at other locations with me today they ll be on the phone though steven tipton is with me brian jennifer donna tracy and randy pretty much the same for so good morning and welcome home bancshares second quarter 2019 earnings release and conference call this is quarter number 52 since our initial public offering and once again home produces another solid quarter for the most part the other 51 have been the same except for a few quarters during the financial crisis times we hit we ve bumped a little bit and that of the 51 the 26 have a record quarter record profit quarters in a row that s why home was named the best bank in america by forbes for the second time in a row we re not only proud of sales and being the best bank in america from our roa an efficiency return on tangible common equity net interest margin asset quality were the best in other important segments as well as helping our communities our communities recognize the importance of excuse me we recognized the importance of supporting our communities in which we serve we serve thousands of volunteer hours for our people our commitment to community reinvestment fair lending and diversity with both our money and time we have presented three quarters as you can see from the press release today 50 and 51 donna townsell who said how do you want to present this time do you want to do these boxes or how do you want to be able to use the last quarter or the fourth quarter and they look so good i said let s show three quarters these have not been easy times with rate uncertainties think about it in 18 we had a rate increase every quarter been told by experts we re going to have two more in that team been told we re going to pause temporarily and now we re being told to expect two or three rate cut who in the world are they listening to i think they re writing on a different financial rollercoaster and the rest of us are riding they miss this one about as far as they did y2k you remember that or as rates mac mbc did on election night and i quote there is no way trump can win that was amazing and certainly comical both the fed and magna i don t know how you say that magna whatever it is did not listen to the right people obviously they have been they were talking when they should have been listening but don t shoot to master they are just following the law it s congress that enacted the law and sent him to enforce it it s another example of people who have no experience writing laws in spite of the feds year over year interest rate we have a responsibility to manage our assets in a manner that is in the best interest of our shareholder and communities we serve the key is not to panic to hold the course they were obviously totally wrong again these huge messes create a major loss of credibility for them at the end of the day your management is trying to operate profitably in the middle of this chaos i say when you re piloting an airplane and there s a major problem like an engine going out don t panic just fly the airplane so we re what we are doing is just running the bike and doing our best to ignore all who s staring not complaining that s our job though it would be nice to have a little more stability couple that with going over 10 billion the regulatory environment is like being on a different universe other than the risk management hardly any of it has of the new regulatory expectations or involving safety and soundness a prime example is bsa and aml it really would be interesting to have congress do a cost effective in the study of bsa and aml i promise you the results will be breathtaking the waste of money is almost criminal there are much better uses to money than wasted like this bankers throughout the country should rally together to get congress to do a study sorry to be a little windy and we ll get back to trying to run a good bank we keep a sharp eye on the markets and listen to our guys and gals on the ground plus personally visiting our customers and shareholders they re far too many models being created too many quants too many intellectuals without real life experience and not enough people to people on the ground interaction with regulators they need to get out of their offices and listen to real people instead of talking to each other and those that have no business experience one can always make an argument for the negative where the real or perceived but there is no substitute for experience there is no substitute for experience reports from experienced people on the ground that live in reality is the amazingly powerful source the fed should look at the models collect the quant data and the opinions of all the inexperienced phd intellectual people who ve never been there never been in the pothole and then i ask those in the real world what s going on in the economy while heavily on those in the field and gather the information from different parts of the country i get it their latest strength i know better and i must take care of the rest of us deplorable and walmart shoppers but most the time we are by far more honest more reliable and the most reliable form of information i can get we d together built a financially strong and solid banking organization is located with a huge presence in the second or third fastest growing state in the country along with strong performance from our south alabama operation coupled with a solid arkansas market and tack on our new york profit center your company remains best in class and all performance matters we continue to remain in a conservative mode on loans and m a while volatility continues to swirl around both politically and economically we think not pushing the envelope focusing on internal operations and taking what the market gives us and both m a and loans is a proper position to ensure that we ll be around when the opportunities come again we appreciate your support and let s talk about the highlights of the quarter and a strong deposit months i think it was 250 we averaged about 240 for the month and we did about what we do stephen where we have last month in the stephen tipton chief operating officer q1 we were up almost 170 million and we re a little over 720 million in the last three quarters john w allison chairman that s good that s 720 million last three quarters excuse me loan to deposit ratio we were 106 million randy we re down to 97 41 we need to get some loans c randall sims president chief executive officer and vice chairman way to low john w allison chairman last stable interest margin in the phase this chaos i think you look at that and the fourth quarter we re 4 30 the first quarter of 4 30 and we re 4 28 this quarter but remember that the quarter had over 500 000 i don t know that you know that you maybe i m telling for the first time 500 000 expense on preamortization writedown that was impacted by the margin because of the unexpected fall in interest rates resulting in faster prepayment speeds on some of the securities i think brian will talk more about that brian s davis treasurer and chief financial officer yeah well john w allison chairman let s talk about the cost of funds and i want you to go back with me four quarters three quarters two quarters and one quarter and i want you listen these numbers four quarters ago our cost funds increased 6 192 000 three quarters ago it dropped to 3 357 000 and then last quarter quarter before last i guess it is now 2 519 000 in this quarter 283 000 so i think the cost of funds may be something that s not going to be as prevalent as it has been in the past strong asset quality almost the best ever strong capital ratios industry leading ratios common equity to assets 15 84 and tangible common equity excuse me the tangible assets 9 96 almost 10 return on tangible common equity 21 strong loan production over 1 billion with loan production beginning 24 000 at 6 14 we had 512 million with payoffs during the quarter at 5 54 so the production coming down with what went off at 60 basis points higher great job by the team overall loan yields i ve been telling you where we re going to push it we started all with last year it s hard to turn the shift but overall loan yields were up three basis points to 6 06 and those three basis points added 897 000 to income for the quarter that s even though average loans were down 30 million i think we ended up 70 million for the end of the quarter but average loan were down but the interest income on the three basis points was 897 000 congratulations to our team you give them a mission and they seem to get it done we continue to maintain strong cost controls with the sub 40 efficiency ratio and a strong roa of 1 92 for our shareholders we increased dividend 0 01 per quarter and will continue to repurchase stock in the last year and a half we have bought back a 168 400 000 worth of stock 8 716 000 shares at an average price of 19 27 so far this year we spent 64 million or 3 416 722 shares at 18 73 last year we bought 5 3 million shares at for 104 million 19 62 average so we ll continue to be in the repurchased business you will see loan writings changed in the queue this quarter in the past all credits that were construction or agro related automatically ready to forward which lands to the conservative nature of our company let me make this clear there is no miss so there is no misunderstanding this is an interim policy and not a regulatory requirement actually this was a nice change from the regulators they actually thought we re being too hard on our sales after sketched with the regulators we agreed to take a look the approximate change were 1 5 billion of the 4s moved to 3s and two credits totaling about 70 million moved to a pass credit five the balance remained in the four totally our call the two credits move into a five one was an apartment construction project on the university campus with one of our largest and oldest customers in the bank the project was weather delayed and missed the starting school semester apartment is now 68 occupied expected to be productive cash flow by the end of the year probably did not need to move because the temporary nature and the quality of the customer that we moved condo project it s in one of our best markets the owner said to keep it as rental because he thinks it s in the best long term interests of his family as a result the project does not flow as rentals does not cash flow as rentals he has over 12 million liquidity as a grade to sell one of his buildings as a condo and pay down the balance enough to cash flow the project neither credit has ever been past due and management does not expect a loss on either credit as always his company is totally transparent and wanted to report the changes and allow time for discussions on the call if necessary we pride ourselves being known as the company that tells it like it is good or bad so a few shorts but it s kind of like the trump russian charade there is no better there and i think chris is temporarily out of the manifesto business however it appears as some of your pocket journalists are still around you appeared to enjoy the boxes in the last quarter s presentation and reports directly from each person responsible for that line of business not sure we ll continue that in the future every quarter but certainly helped to get us a better understanding of how we looked at margin and operation brian started first last time he will also be first today and cover the margin in the pieces impacting performance then we ll be chris poulton and john marshall tracy and steven and then our chairman randy sams will wrap it up and kevin hester will be on the phone for any questions so at this point in time i will turn it over to brian and see if you can keep us clear you did a good job last time i heard but i ve got it right brian brian s davis treasurer and chief financial officer okay well thank you mr allison the second quarter was a good quarter for our net interest income and net interest margin tax equivalent basis we recorded net interest income of 142 3 million for q2 2019 compared to 140 8 million for q1 2019 our net interest margin was 4 28 for the second quarter of 2019 compared to 4 30 for the first quarter of 2019 as mr allison mentioned during the second quarter of 2019 the interest rate environment declined for example the 10 year treasury went from 2 50 on march 31 to 2 01 on june 30th this decline has increased the prepayment space on our investment securities as a result we saw an increased premium amortization of 515 000 from q1 to q2 if the premium amortization had remained flat from q1 to q2 our q2 margin would have been 4 30 or unchanged from q1 2019 last year our cfg division had a few payoff events which increased our margin for the first six months of 2019 they do not have any additional interest income for payoff event form cfg loan production was very strong in the second quarter of 2019 we saw loan production of more than 1 billion at an average rate of 6 1 this breaks down into 484 million at an average rate of 6 3 for cfg and 538 million at an average rate of 6 for the community banking footprint we are pleased with these levels of production and rates while maintaining our strict underwriting standards another positive was the impact of the change in the yield on our loan portfolio we were able to increase the yield on the loan portfolio by three basis points this equates to a 823 000 improvement in loan interest income for q2 when compared to q1 accretion income for the fair value adjustments reported in purchase accounting was 9 2 million during q2 compared to 9 1 million during q1 for an increase of 100 000 in conclusion even though reported margin declined two basis points our daily net interest income of 1 5 million per day remained unchanged for q2 compared to q1 however if the investment premium amortization had remained flat from from q1 to q2 we would have reported an improvement of approximately 5 000 of additional net interest income per day for q2 2019 with that said i ll turn the call back over to mr allison john allison chairman did you say 823 000 i reported 897 000 brian s davis treasurer and chief financial officer yeah i check my number while you were talking and i came up with 823 000 that s what stephen and i were talking on over here john allison chairman well it s 823 000 it was 8 something right so there s nothing wrong with that that s good brian s davis treasurer and chief financial officer it s over 800 000 john allison chairman it s over 800 000 brian s davis treasurer and chief financial officer that s right john w allison chairman don t mislead the public so i guess next we d go chris poulton chris you on chris poulton president of centennial commercial finance group yes sir thank you and thank you johnny second quarter at ccfg was highlighted primarily by a significant increase in new loan production which brian just discussed as you may recall during last quarter s earnings call i noted that our loan pipeline specifically the approved but not closed loans stood at an all time high i m pleased to report that during the second quarter we closed the majority of those loans and we originated just under 500 million in new loan commitment to put that in perspective we generally originate between 800 million and 1 billion in a given year a little over half of those new commitments were funded during the quarter which resulted in approximate a 143 million of net loan growth for the second quarter notably just about half of the new production came out of the west coast lpo as we continue to see good progress from darren robinson and his team in l a while payoffs continued and will continue to be a feature of our portfolio we do continue to see good opportunities in our respective markets and i remain pleased with the potential loans in our pipeline thank you for the time and i ll hand it back over to you johnny john w allison chairman thanks chris next up is john marshall go ahead john marshall president good afternoon thank you mr allison for the opportunity to provide an update on show premiere finance in the second quarter profitability grew in the second quarter and we continue to run ahead of budget this may be attributed to asset growth of 5 1 million stable margins and good expense management our efficiency ratio remain below 30 for the quarter commercial and consumer loan originations totaled 34 2 million an increase of 5 7 million over the first quarter are up roughly 20 in addition 11 million in commercial commitments were approved in our pipeline of retail assets grew due to an increase in applications of 38 by volume 34 by dollar portfolio growth has been stifled somewhat year to date by unusually high prepayment rates as consumers take market gains and reduce their personal debt that trend appears to have abated in june and july month today the total combined portfolio was 448 9 million at the end of the quarter compared to 443 8 million at the end of q1 and 436 million at the end of the year in 2018 since joining centennial bank in july 2018 interest earning assets are up 62 6 million while we re not a financial center or a branch marine related deposits have grown to 1 3 million doubling in the second quarter our growth strategy for both commercial and retail is to add new manufacturers both domestic builders and international and their attendant distribution channels in north america working with their dealer networks for commercial floor plans and to leverage these relationships for new retail referral sources in addition we receive commercial and retail referrals from centennial bankers particularly those scattered around the florida market and we had success in co branding events at boat shows and marine industry trade shows with our parent centennial bank as always we re also grateful for our broad base of marine loan brokers for the majority of our retail referrals we continue to deepen and increase those relationships we also anticipate launching a super yacht retail marine finance program in the third quarter of this year growth has not been achieved at the expense of asset quality our delinquent loans were down substantially below 1 million at the end of 2q compared to 1 4 million at the end of the first quarter and 5 8 million at the end of 2018 commercial commitments have all been freshly underwritten and approved through centennial banks loan approval process and average retail borrower fico scores had origination have climbed from 770 at the year end of 2018 to 775 in the first quarter and it s and may breach 777 in the second quarter a commodity type nature of the retail side of our business continues to put pressure on our margins in addition pressure came from the recent fed decisions and the market reactions to the fed as it relates to the 10 year treasury an index that is commonly pegged by us and our competitors for establishing retail rates we see that with an average origination rates in the fourth quarter of 18 a 5 01 climbing to 5 52 in the first quarter of this year and then pulling back slightly to 5 37 last quarter i expect continued downward pressure in the third quarter the third quarter growth outlook is mixed while we ve seen an uptick in application volume and retail originations dealers are beginning to express some pessimism and tapering back their purchase orders nonetheless i remain confident in our ability to achieve growth profitability and asset quality objectives with that i conclude my remarks and i thank you john w allison chairman thank you john tracy french tracy m french centennial bank president chief executive officer good afternoon to you thanks john as you may recall last quarter i mentioned our focus was going to be on net interest margin and improving asset quality the numbers posted today for the second quarter or show just that we improved our loan yield we ve watched our deposit cost and improved our non performing loans to give a little bit of shout out to our community banking our net interest margin remained 4 2 as it was the first quarter which is up from 4 18 at the end of last year also like to give a little tip of the hat to some of our regions on the deposit growth that they ve had little rock market has been up about 7 and a little over 7 year to date in southeast florida s up over 11 year to date and then next we will shout out to the north florida market as they are up in non interest bearing checking accounts 16 5 year to date so congratulations to some of those and really congratulations to all and steven will give a little color on the deposits a little later well the quarter centennial bank had a return on assets of 2 1 and efficiency ratio of 36 45 with the total revenue of 204 million as it has been mentioned i am pleased to see the strong loan production from the community bank segment i want to compliment our lending teams for their continued effort in this competitive landscape steven do you want to give a little color on the loans and deposits stephen tipton chief operating officer thank you tracy as you and brian mentioned the community bank loan production for q2 was strong with the contribution split fairly evenly between arkansas and florida while payout volume in the florida portfolio continues to be elevated we did see in the period loan growth for arkansas and alabama on the deposit side has been mentioned we saw another strong quarter of growth 280 million led by southeast florida region with over 120 million in the end of period growth johnny mentioned the interest rate environment today is quite different from where we were just three months ago and we will closely monitor the impact of declining interest potentially declining interest rates on both sides of the balance sheet our efforts are now focused on deposit pricing while maintaining core relationships with that i ll turn it back over to you mr allison john allison chairman thank you go to randy sims our chairman and let him wrap it up randy sims chief executive officer well one way to wrap something up is to say congratulations to everyone s for another good quarter as you ve heard from everyone the numbers are again some of the best you know we seem to always talk about the numbers so i d just like to take a minute to mention we are making improvements in many areas of the bank with the intent to strategically take our operational areas to a higher level that not only provides new capabilities for our customers but also improves our infrastructure for future growth our rt division that we rarely talk about is busy concentrating on continuing to improve structure as well as implementing new fintech initiatives along with operational and retail divisions we ve deployed via person to person payments implementing new functions within the mobile app and completely updated our customer website we continue to add interactive teller machines in appropriate locations and new project products such as spin to win a prize linked savings program all to enhance the customer experience with the best and capabilities and products in addition the bank has taken on a new initiative of strengthening our internal structure including operational areas as well as taking our regulatory departments to new levels of experience and depth these efforts and improvements position us to continue our goal of being a high performing bank not just now but well into the future it prepares us for whatever opportunity the market may provide and with these improvements comes expense but as you heard our numbers have remained strong as johnny stated this is quarter 52 and our high performance has been consistent so let me just recap some of those strong numbers and wrap this quarter up we finished with total assets of 15 287 575 000 income was 72 2 million resulting in diluted earnings per share of 0 43 as compared to 0 42 from the last quarter which means the market expectations roa was consistent and very strong with the last quarter at 1 92 more importantly we were able to achieve a strong net interest margin at 4 28 down just a little from the last quarter at 4 30 as you heard from the others we are working very hard on both sides of the balance sheet to maintain the margin once again our profitability was helped by a very strong efficiency ratio of 39 93 it was good to see it under that 40 again as we continued to control our costs but also make enhancements within our bank infrastructure i am very proud of this number given the improvements we have been making and the negative effect of durbin estimated at 3 million for each and every quarter it s been a very strong quarter for deposit growth as you heard ending at 11 35 billion with them approximately 280 million in growth resulting in a loan deposit ratio of 97 41 as compared to march 31 at 99 20 and yes mr allison that s keeping that engine running really low like 30 miles per hour i like it when it runs hot and you re making a lot of money john w allison chairman honestly i understand c randall sims president chief executive officer and vice chairman and of course as you have heard from others we had over 1 billion in loan production and an average rate of 6 1 which again is one of the reasons why we re able to maintain a strong net interest margin our asset quality has and continues to be solid indicating a very optimistic and secured outlook for 2019 and of course strong capital ratios as always and you will always see that from home bancshares we now have two quarters behind us and i think you d agree that once again the results we presented today are powerful numbers we look forward to the third quarter and another opportunity to once again perform in the high level for our shareholders and that pretty much wraps things up john w allison chairman randy thank you it s interesting going over 10 billion and what we ve been able to accomplish when you think about durbin yes it took 3 million spread out of our pocket this quarter and usually accretion is going down so that s pulling out and then when you go to this next universe regulatory lives with the expense that we incurring there and still be able to meet the numbers i m beginning to get a feel for why in the past that the analysts have lowered expectations for banks like us and multiples when you go over team because they think these guys well these people be able to keep up well can they keep up with the increased expenses can they keep up with illusion durbin can they keep up with it and i wouldn t sure we could do that we get it the first quarter and it was lake of breath of fresh air to me we did it well we did it a little easier this quarter than we did it did the first quarter so i see that now and there s some understanding for that so i m pretty pleased i tell some other days that where are you we re kind of treading the water but we are ok treading the water we got through the first quarter it s kind of relieve entered the second quarter and it was better in the second quarter so hopefully the third quarter will be better than the second quarter but these reports were really good and i want to congratulate this team of people you know the one thing about our team is you give them a mission and they get after it they try to make it work and i ve told our people last all this we started pushing the rates everybody didn t push rates if you want to know what the quality of a bike you ve ask them what the margin is you know if they given stuff why is it 310 315 are they given stuff away they say we won t have good asset quality all they got bad loans because they pushed that up that s not correct at all that s totally incorrect we got the best asset quality we ve ever had it s as good it s good as it is in the country we just asked for the additional rate you know we ve we maintain that relationship we visit with that customer and i like all that is still important to building the relationship you hear people talk about relationship what their relationship is that they give a cheap rate so we ve never backed off on that and our team had the mission was given to them last august and you can see what they ve done with that they ve been able to continue to push rates now what s going to happen now is the weight will drop 50 basis points the stronger product continue matter of fact we just got our executive loan committee today and we re at 570 566 in a quarter so some of the ways we ll drop those rates in a hurry we don t do that we try to get the maximum we can get out of it and and our team does that and against all odds they continue to produce for the shareholders i guess randy there s easy monkeys be doing it but it s my pleasure and i mean that to work with such a great dedicated group of professionals and they get the job done congrats to you guys gary i think we re ready for q a questions and answers operator we will now begin the question and answer session our first question comes from brady gailey with kbw please go ahead brady gailey kbw analyst hey good afternoon guys john w allison chairman hi brady brady gailey kbw analyst when you look at your net interest margin you all done a good job of holding that pretty steady around the 4 30 mark as we look forward with the yield curve doing what it s doing and then i m guessing we re going to see lower levels of yield accretion for you guys in the back half of this year and into 2020 do you think that it s realistic that you could see some nim slippage here or do you think that maybe deposit costs start coming down and you re able to hold it around this 4 30 level john w allison chairman i ll take that and stephen might chime in a little bit after that and then i will give you the answer and i ll follow up from him and then i might have comment i ll start off with the accretion we have been around 9 million plus in accretion each quarter the last three quarters i ll really predicted it go down into the 8 million range this quarter we did have an increase in pay off accretion the pay off accretion was up about a 500 000 this quarter from the previous quarter so there s a good chance that might not be reoccurring so we would have that pressure of 500 000 with equate to about two basis points on the nim if you look at the models that we have and we ve disclosed these model numbers before for a short analysis i mean we re really for the most part neutrally gap but we are technically slightly asset sensitive these asset sensitive and models are correct which we can do things to try to change the outlook from those models it would show that we would have some margin compression this upcoming stephen tipton chief operating officer or john w allison chairman yeah the one that s coming up here at the end of the month should cost us a quarter of the models about 2 million of net interest income which could equate six basis points but we re going to try to do things to try to improve on that stephen tipton chief operating officer hi brady this is stephen and that s a tag on there where we spent a lot of time over the last month or so trying to identify on the deposit side what opportunities we expect will have if the fed lowers a quarter at the end of the month we we ve indicated before we have a decent sized bucket in the funding side that is tied to either live or reference rates or tied to t bill rates that have already started to come down a little bit we saw some good benefit from that july 1 on their quarterly reset so we feel like we re trying to identify what we can match up on the funding side to the loan side as to what the variable rate and then the investment portfolio might be kind of wildcard brady gailey kbw analyst all right and then my second question is on the expense side it sounds like you guys have some continued investments that need to be made in the infrastructure just from being a bank that s over 10 billion in assets yeah i was just wondering how your quarterly expenses have actually been going down in the last couple of quarters so as you look to invest more in the expense infrastructure do you think that it will that have a notable impact on expense growth going forward stephen tipton chief operating officer well as you re saying it hasn t so far and we don t we continue to do things to try as we re improving and putting some money into infrastructure some of that infrastructure is software that become makes you more efficient some of that infrastructure is our people that again make you more efficient so it s kind of looking into the future and saying well are your expenses going to go way up well the expenses might go up a little on the front end but we make it investments in infrastructure to become more efficient and therefore try to keep our expenses down and even lower them but yeah you could see some increase but i would hope that it would be followed by a decrease and as we improve things and we don t make those investments without some realistic outcome of improvement and lower costs that makes sense i mean is that what you re looking for brady gailey kbw analyst yeah thanks for the color that s great john w allison chairman oh good i m going to wrap this up for you we re not going to let the expense to go up and margins will remain flat well continuously it s forward to go down right i mean margin should in this environment go down we have about 2 8 million with the loans are going to reprocess we re about 75 fixed that s good force or adjustable we got about 144 billion worth of funds that will adjust if they just prime if they re going to take prime they need to do that that ll help us it gives us of a gaap of about 1 billion in there and you know this team works very hard we got a call from one of our top flat recent presence and mark me down 15 basis points already have already taken the cost of deposits down so as we work like hell on the way up we ll work like hell on the way down so maybe a little blip temporarily but i don t think it s i don t think it ll be a long term blip for us because this team has a way of finding and fixing it as you well know so as we battle it hard on the way up we ll battled hard all the way down stephen tipton chief operating officer can say one more thing only expenses we are challenged by taking our regulatory group to another level and we are meeting that challenge and we are investing in that but at the same time we have a strategic initiative on the other side of people that are doing nothing but looking for ways to automate things so as we invest in taking a regulatory to another level that team is looking to see where we can automate that to keep those costs down and they re that team is also looking at other areas of the bank and i give you examples but i m not going to take the time to do that but they also look and analyze where can we automate something that actually reduces our cost and the number of people that we have to have so what we got wow one thing is maybe making our expenses go up over here we had another group over here that is trying to drive expenses down so i just want i want to know that we re working on both sides of that and it has always been our goal to keep that efficiency ratio where everyone is proud of it operator the next question comes from stephen scouten with sandler o neill partners please go ahead stephen scouten sandler o neill partners analyst hey guys good afternoon how you all doing john w allison chairman good stephen congratulation on the all recent trade stephen scouten sandler o neill partners analyst thank you sir thank you we ll see how it all plays out but it should be good direction for us so thank you john w allison chairman you think they re stephen scouten sandler o neill partners analyst i don t know what do you think john john w allison chairman i hope so stephen scouten sandler o neill partners analyst i appreciate that time will tell my friend time will tell hey i m curious if you guys are seeing any sort of inflection point on the payoff levels in florida in particular sounds like that s where you re seeing a lot of the pay downs and production has been phenomenal so i m just wondering if you think we might see some time here in the near future or more that comes to the bottom line and grows the bank a little bit quicker kevin d hester chief lending officer this is kevin i can take that or stephen if you want to go ahead stephen tipton chief operating officer no please do kevin d hester chief lending officer stephen the next two quarters at least i don t think you re going to see that we ve got as we re looking in the pipeline the next two quarters look like they re pretty heavy on the payoff side as much as i d like to report that they re not that we do see pretty heavy movement in the next couple of quarters at least brian s davis treasurer and chief financial officer no let me ask if you look at the last three quarters it s been around it s been a little north of 500 million and i think what kevin mentioned we re seeing that plus a little bit of forecasted so things change you know you can move around from quarter to quarter but it s we re still seeing the volume there john w allison chairman i think you heard me refer to it as grease pig one day it s hard to get your arms around that and even though when i think it s not going to be as good it s better when i think it s going to be better it s not and so it s somewhat difficult to get your arms around that but according to what the projection is that they re going to be it would be down the next two quarters but i ve seen that many quarters before and it didn t turn out to be that way so that s a difficult one to forecast because you never know if you know what s coming and you never know what would you going to fund i think our funding we grew 160 million 150 million 145 million what was it unfunded brian s davis treasurer and chief financial officer unfunded commitments were up about 145 million from quarter to quarter john w allison chairman to 2 6 billion or brian s davis treasurer and chief financial officer 2 35 billion john w allison chairman 2 35 billion so it gives you an idea of what s coming stephen scouten sandler o neill partners analyst okay appreciate that and john it sounds like you ve been watching a lot of msnbc lately so with the rates looking like they re going to go down here what are you guys doing to prevent against some of these rate cuts i mean are you do any hedging or otherwise to kind of put in protections if in case if those guys are right john w allison chairman we haven t done that i want some are friends only upside spend millions of dollars on the hedging process and get their hand handed to them you know the fed says they re going down it might be 90 days and they go up ahead so it s i like the so i could get a dart board and it totally hits up or down or a quarter or a half i d like they just throw a dart boards what they ve been doing looks like lately so and i don t watch too much in the msnbc i did watch comedy hour on the night of the presidential election i did we got force in place and significant force in place and 75 feds are adjustable so i think we re really on a down right now i think we re in pretty good position i actually think we re in a better position on the way down than we were on the way up and we fought to keep it to hold our margin all the way up so i can assure you we ll fight to keep it on the way down i think i said that earlier so i would be disappointed that we ll be disappoint if you know how hard i pushed i think we got a shot it may go down few ticks but i think we got a shot and hold it within range stephen tipton chief operating officer one thing to remember is that we are a bank made up of a lot of different communities and those communities drive the market those communities are is the market that we look at and that we serve and then this up and down that goes up and down and whatever the fed decides to do is disrupts that i wish that the fed would leave things alone and let the market do what it always does but where i have a little bit of advantage i believe because we serve small community markets and those changes are not as drastic as what we see on the national level stephen scouten sandler o neill partners analyst makes sense make sense maybe one last question for me i was curious what you expect on the pace of the buybacks or kind of how you think about that moving forward if there s a capital level you might manage to or if you think they might pick back up to the levels we saw in the previous two quarters versus a little bit a less active this quarter stephen tipton chief operating officer well we have we ve kind of overbought in first quarter we spent more than we had about 180 million i think somewhere in that range approved by the regulators and we spent 50 million something may in the first quarter which was a little brian s davis treasurer and chief financial officer we spent 52 million in the first quarter and we spent 13 million in the second quarter and you re right we had 188 million approved from the regulators stephen tipton chief operating officer yeah we re really evaluating what s in the best interest with all that capital rolling in right now what s in the best interest of the company to slow down the bad back to maybe look at a sinking fund to pay off some debt at some point in time it s coming in the future so we re really in the process evaluating that at this point in time we ll continue to be in the buyback business not sure how much we ll be in we will continue to be in that market and sometimes we ll buy heavy and sometimes we won t if i put it on sale we ll jump in there stephen scouten sandler o neill partners analyst very good thank you guys appreciate the time congrats on the quarter brian s davis treasurer and chief financial officer thanks operator the next question comes from michael rose with raymond james please go ahead michael rose raymond james analyst hey good afternoon guys i just had a accounting question so i just heard the comment around the unfunded commitments and obviously with show premiere finance coming on those two things is my understanding is they re treated pretty punitively under cico so as we think about going into 2020 does this curtail your desire to continue to grow shore premier finance or chris group up in new york john w allison chairman i mean when we get to cico i mean we re we ll set whatever it is we need to start for the day one accounting mark but i would not envision that it s going to change how we look at that at all and that s just the way of doing business stephen tipton chief operating officer michael this is steve i think maybe they coming there just because they contractually some of the shore finance is longer term and i think i don t think we would change that our desire to be in that business particularly with what john mentioned in the underwriting standards and what we re seeing today just because of the accounting change and it gets the business we want to be in and be exposed to continue to be a part of michael rose raymond james analyst but it wouldn t limit your necessarily limit your growth plans and neither of those businesses stephen tipton chief operating officer i don t think so michael rose raymond james analyst is that what i m hearing stephen tipton chief operating officer yeah michael rose raymond james analyst okay and i don t think these sorry if i missed it but i don t think the m a questions been asked and i don t think john you mentioned in the prepared remarks so just wanted to get an update on your thoughts on the m a landscape at this point what you guys are seeing john w allison chairman i did mention them in the remarks that we will remind conservative on m a will take what they give us on the m a and on the loan side so i don t think this is time to be pressing the home loan i think what i said where we re continually looking we re continually running models here with other banks the moe thing is as i said last quarter it s kind of the table for us because it doesn t we re having difficulty finding somebody that has the quality it s not a moe mean there s not very few people at run a bank like we run a bank and it s difficult to do at m a in perfect particularly in last who s going to ultimately run it at the end of the day so i mean we ve seen a couple of them and they want to run it but quite honestly they don t run near the performance that home bank s shares run so some of that as they go who s going to run it who is going to be the boss i don t mind if somebody is running a 2020 hour way and may want to be the boss expand but they re running at once in roa will be the boss they probably not going to get hook up with home banks here so we re still looking michael rose raymond james analyst i was just going to say sorry i missed that in the prepared comments john w allison chairman that s ok michael rose raymond james analyst that s clear one final question for me we ve heard a couple of banks talk about the lag effect on the downside if we do get a couple of rate cuts on deposit rates and i guess my question is do you think your interest bearing deposit costs have keep should we get rate cut john w allison chairman i do i think close i think we re right at it if you heard my comments maybe you did maybe you want to go to my all comments but i went back four quarters it was 6 3 million cost to fund increase and then i m recalling from memory then 3 2 million increase in cost of funds to 2 5 million to 283 000 this quarter which is a pretty good indication of what s happening there so i looked at it yesterday and excuse me i looked at it today and it was flat so what i m seeing a lot seeing interest income up slightly i m seeing interest expense down slightly so that s a good indicator for the company michael rose raymond james analyst okay sorry i missed some of the commentary in the beginning thanks for taking my questions john w allison chairman i know you have a bunch of have a bunch of calls right in this time operator the next question comes from matt olney with stephens please go ahead matt olney stephens inc analyst hey guys good afternoon john w allison chairman hi matt matt olney stephens inc analyst i think randy mentioned that the loan to deposit ratio is now at 97 but the loans has been for a while is this a strategic change and are you going to operate here or will randy get his way and we ll see this move back up john w allison chairman c randall sims president chief executive officer and vice chairman the regulators like it i don t particularly like it and we ll be somewhere in between that s probably good answer somewhere in between but deposits has been awfully strong 700 plus 700 million plus in the last three quarters and it s i have to give thrice the credit for because he established that new policy if you ll remember several years ago we started asking for it so we re going to stop it we re not going to stop matt olney stephens inc analyst and then john you mentioned you feel like you have some protection with some flaws can you give us an idea of what point do those flaws come into play how many fed cuts we have to see stephen tipton chief operating officer yeah matt this is stephen take that we ve got on the ccfg portfolio there s a couple 100 million today that are protected with the flaws you have functionally all of the production and i think your christ s comments on how good his production was for the quarter all of this production so far this year should be protected as it begins to fund which as a good portion of his production has yet to fund we ve got about 150 million or so on the community bank side that s protected today in a 25 basis point downright scenario and then those numbers increase a little bit as if rates were to continue to go down so we ve got 350 or so that s protected today if they do lower rates into this month matt olney stephens inc analyst and stephen i would assume that if rates were to go down beyond 25 bps that 350 would increase is that fair stephen tipton chief operating officer yes yes that s fair i don t have those numbers in front of me here but yes that s fair matt olney stephens inc analyst okay okay guys that s all for me thanks for your help stephen tipton chief operating officer don t bet to farm on that matt matt olney stephens inc analyst i wouldn t do that operator the next question comes from jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please go ahead jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst thanks good afternoon john w allison chairman hi jon jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst hi kevin what can you go back over that i was a little confused by the pay off information you were talking about you were saying it s elevated the next couple of quarters are not elevated the next couple quarters i missed out kevin d hester chief lending officer yeah stephen made and he mentioned a number of 500 last quarter and i think what we have and then johnny made the comment it is early it s early in the third quarter and certainly for the fourth quarter things can change and things can move in and out of quarters and up and down as you go through but as we ve got it as we re seeing it right now the payoff numbers are even a little higher than what we saw last quarter and productions been strong maybe we can out produce it and that be a good thing but unfortunately we re just seeing we re seeing people take things off the table and sell projects and move them to permanent and it just work that jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst okay so the message would be hoping for modest loan growth working hard to get there but you ve probably seeing some repricing higher in yields there s an offset is that fair kevin d hester chief lending officer yeah i think that s fair jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst okay ok is john marshall still on john marshall president hi good afternoon jon s here jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst hey john you made a comment about consumer health and maybe picking up a little bit in june and july but then you also talked about dealers pulling back can you expand on that a little bit and just let us know what you re seeing in terms of the consumer and why you think the dealers might be pulling back john marshall president they had a little bit of a conflicting message coming out we ve seen volume increase from an app based standpoint and from a funding standpoint and the quality of those applications is measured by fico scores it s also improving but in our conversations with our dealers they re looking forward and they re pushing back on their manufacturers just a little bit in the amount of inventory that they re interested in holding as we move forward into probably not the third quarter in the fourth quarter of this year or perhaps first quarter of next year and i don t know you know i asked it what is it that they re seeing are there any technical indicators that would suggest that they want to hold less inventory and it s more of a gut feeling so right now we ve got sort of mixed signals we ve got retail buyers are buying a lot more boats but then we ve got dealers appearing to pull back just a little bit jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst okay good that helps john marshall president i m hoping those two will offset each other and so it ll be neutral for us and we ll continue to meet our growth goals jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst okay good i was just most interested in the narrative on why but that helps me chris maybe for you pipelines and commitments obviously were very high do you see that continuing coming into q3 in the rest of the year chris poulton president of centennial commercial finance group yeah good afternoon we do we like the pipeline still as we move through a lot of our waiting to close stuff this past quarter so that was nice but we continue to like to see what we re seeing through there we review it once a week generally like to see about 1 billion in the pipeline not all that ll make its way through but as long as we have a billion plus in the pipeline i usually feel pretty good about where we re headed we have a little over 1 billion in the pipeline today so i would say we continue to think they re interesting there s interesting opportunities and transactions out there i don t think that s changed we certainly take a i would say shift toward a more defensive nature as it relates to both the pipeline in the portfolio so let go the payoff sentiment in our business that s a good thing loans aren t supposed to be out there forever and while money is cheap and plentiful there s some of the credits we d like them to to go ahead and move on out jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst okay fair enough and then maybe just a bigger picture question for i don t know if it s randy or tracy or someone but it sounds like you all don t feel like a rate cut is needed at all based on what you re saying but i m just curious if you re seeing anything that bothers you or that s incrementally a little bit more troubling from an economic point of view or not thanks john w allison chairman we haven t seen our portfolio still shows all businesses doing just fine so whether that is a rate cut or not for the company wise as i mentioned i was going to ask for the deposits and then and it seemed to be working pretty well he guessed that the speaker here john we ve called our variable rate customers last two days and are all coming inside of new fixed rate loans next week i m just kidding so we re going to ask them to come in and fix them up for that process but it s we worked on the interest rates here every day and that s something that we ve done for several years now and when it goes up it goes up when it goes down it goes down so we feel like our company is positioned pretty well to work through whatever the challenges we get thrown out on interest rates so we ll go up or down jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst okay stephen tipton chief operating officer from a personal nature i ll just tell you that especially where i am in the beach areas and on the coastline it is so dead gone crowded they need to put some fences up and keep people out there are people that need to go home i have never in my life seen it that crowded four and five of umbrellas deep all the way down as far as you can see it there is no slowdown of the economy or any indicators of what s going around where i am and everything that we hear in conway and our markets is things are pretty good jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst okay need to put up some of that that s back handling on the size of the panhandle stephen tipton chief operating officer yeah i was a little slow on that one john w allison chairman we stay really close to our markets and what s going on our people on the ground live in it so i mean we re not seen any disruption in the markets anywhere jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst thank you we could say okay good thanks for the help operator the next question comes from brett rabatin with piper jaffray please go ahead brett rabatin piper jaffray analyst hey guys good afternoon john w allison chairman hi brett brett rabatin piper jaffray analyst wanted to just to go back to the margin for a second and from a filing perspective about 60 of your book is variable can you give us how much might be libor and then the securities book is pretty small relative to earning assets but just thinking about what you re doing in that book presently and then do yield pop back up going forward in that portfolio as well john allison chairman i ll let steve and brian talk about that you got that upside down it s a about 70 75 fixed or adjustable balance is variable so we don t have much variable stephen tipton chief operating officer yeah brett this is stephen i think what gets picked up in the filings are some of the we ll call it more adjustable type deals where we re fixing to write for a period of time and then it was just two years now those sometimes you get picked up as a variable rate yeah i think what we ve identified that is subject to potentially move say in the next quarter or so as a truly variable type note is about 2 8 billion half of that or so is on the ccfg side that is subject to move above a floor the other half would be on the communities bank side the majority of that is tied to libor we ve got about 800 million or 900 million that s tied to wall street journal prime and then the balance of that would be tied to libor so we think a little bit of movement there over the last couple of months in libor but that s where the portfolio stands as we see it brett rabatin piper jaffray analyst okay and then the security book any color there john w allison chairman i mean it is what it is i mean we ve got 361 million of it that variable and repriced within the next 30 days and then after that it gets pretty small amounts brett rabatin piper jaffray analyst okay and then the other question i want to ask is this is the first quarter in a while we ve seen a provision from you guys and your credit is obviously stellar and i think that s one of the pitches for owning your company in the next few years as credit should be better than peers could you give us maybe some thoughts on provisioning from here should we expect the standard 1 of new loan production or maybe give us a if you can about how you think about the provision going forward john w allison chairman well we had a exceptional quarter this time much better than it than the quarter actually looked and we thought it was a good work we ve always been reserve builders we ve always liked to have about 1 reserve just kind of how the company is run actually my past lap i ran a 150 and i just think that s i think it s just a solid number i understand we ve got all these complicated measures of how we have to calculate reserves today but those were that 150 workforce and the worst financial crunch i have ever seen in my life so we re running about one now and we got marks of about another 120 that ran so i m not supposed to add those together i guess you can t tell you where i think we are and i think we re well reserved see lots of people out here with 43 and 46 and 47 reserves if we have a crunch that s not will be enough that s what the asset quality says that won t be enough so we re just a believer we had a good quarter it looked like we found a match charge off closed charge offs for the little quarter and we just kind of look at it every quarter and see how it has got that but asset quality of that i mean i probably we probably could justify four overs five but we ll keep as much in there as we can brett rabatin piper jaffray analyst okay and then just lastly i want to go back to capital for a second you mentioned buybacks let s say you re not involve in the m a in the next few quarters and you re really profitable what do you do with capital if you know buybacks are not sort of enough in terms of what you re thinking about managing capital what you do as capital continues to accumulate john w allison chairman well we have some trust preferred out there and we also have 300 million worth of subdebt so i mean accounts is capital one is still that so i mean we re dead reversed at home bank shares we don t like that it counts as capital we don t like that s the right way to treat that but we did raise 300 million and it would be our effort to pay that off at some point in time or start accumulating money to take it in advantage how many months 33 months left brian brian s davis treasurer and chief financial officer we ve had it 27 months we have 33 months till it gets to where we start losing part of the capital treatment after 5 years is callable and then we will get 80 in capital treatment john w allison chairman but we ll continue brian about dilution on buyback stock and i understand it is diluted but it has been it it has been one of the best uses of capital for our company for some time and as i said what we bought like 8 7 million shares in the last 18 months and 168 million worth so particularly if they want to take us down the price that will be an active buyer brett rabatin piper jaffray analyst okay i appreciate all the color john w allison chairman thank you operator the next question comes from brian martin with janney montgomery scott please go ahead brian martin janney montgomery scott analyst hey guys john w allison chairman hi how are you brian you ve changed jobs change the government brian martin janney montgomery scott analyst i was like stephen as well so his comments hey you guys have covered a lot of this but just the maybe for stephen just on the you talked about the variable rate and fixed rate helping on the funding side of the market sensitive deposits what s the level those are currently they could adjust in the next quarter or so so stephen stephen tipton chief operating officer first as john mentioned maybe the first part of the q a but we ve done about a 1 5 billion or so that are tied to some index either treasuries lab or wall street journal from that functionally should flow 100 native with that as it changes and then we ve got another 1 ish billion or so that we ve identified kind of call it market top of the market type rates that we can affect over time so that s our task and thanks for tracy and johnny both mentioned well will work to work those rates down if we see the fed make a move on the 31st brian martin janney montgomery scott analyst okay and it sounds as though just kind of hearing all the comments on margin that i guess you d probably think it s fair to say that the core margin kind of actually accretion is probably i guess maybe near a bottom if you do get a rate decrease given kind of the initiatives maybe it s as johnny said a couple of ticks lower but shouldn t be materially lower in a lower in the down rate environment i guess is that kind of in summary kind of a fair statement stephen tipton chief operating officer i think it s a fair statement and like that john w allison chairman yeah as brian mentioned i mean those the models show that it could put a little bit of pressure on it but i think that s based on the assumptions that we have and we re evaluating all of that now to see if we can do better than that brian martin janney montgomery scott analyst okay all right and i think it was brian said it was six basis points if you get it 25 that s with the models show should be a 25 basis point decrease brian s davis treasurer and chief financial officer yeah that is correct brian martin janney montgomery scott analyst okay and the last two for me was just the johnny talked about the buyback versus a debt repayment i mean how quickly could you do something on the debt repayment or i guess is that more near term or is it a little bit longer term given you ve got a couple of years and the capital treatment stephen tipton chief operating officer yes it s not callable it s stephen it s brian it s not callable till 22 we shouldn t have change brian martin janney montgomery scott analyst okay we got 33 months until that comes up brian and so i mean we start few months but the problem is going to be with me i mean we start accumulating the total amount you re said 150 million to 200 million and the deal comes up i said i m will be your biggest problem is going to be maybe we might let depends on what the next deal looks like compared to what paying down the debt looks like so most sense is if we do a deal we ve never done a deluded deal we ve always been a creative snow and our stocks creep back up a little bit getting back into 2 20 times to 2 30 times tangible book we just took a look at i mean if you are 96 i think we rank six or seven when you take out the nonbank so to speak in margin in the country so we re pretty proud of that as again earlier in the call i said just bank what the margin is found out where there s the real monster whether given brian randy sims and i really believe in those models brian s davis treasurer and chief financial officer we are going to improve them run once again c randall sims president chief executive officer and vice chairman and i just what the models i just what the models said assuming the other guys around the table do nothing except just let it roll out brian s davis treasurer and chief financial officer well the models notification models do it and go on vacation the first actually our communities john w allison chairman let the model looked about that way all the way up to you we re pretty much flat i think we re we maybe we could be in better shape on the way down we ll see brian martin janney montgomery scott analyst yeah and the last couple just on the pipelines you talked about the payoffs johnny but just as far as the production i mean i guess here your sense i mean there s a pretty wide swing in from 1q to 2q and the production value i guess this one of them feel more realistic or do you think it s the production volumes maybe somewhere in between and then in the back half of the year john w allison chairman you had the first quarter you have shock and all from the data from what the fed in december i mean it shook the world the s p 500 total return phone had the worst month since 1929 i mean that was just that was a major error and it shook everything so i think it took a while to recover back so i m optimistic that production will be better i mean new york funded started funding some of this quarter but still have a lot to fund as time comes on and and we re up 100 we ve got about 2 3 billion and you ll see some of that funding so i suspect we might be down a little bit and i must tell you that we might be down a little bit on loans this quarter and the reason i m telling you that is the last time i said we d be up we were down so long as they were down and maybe up brian martin janney montgomery scott analyst okay and just lastly was the on the expenses i guess it sounds like they could move up a tick from here based on what randy was saying but just kind of looking thinking about the efficiency i guess worth had here around this 40 level i guess is that something you expect to be able to maintain that tick up a little bit and then as randy said you get the benefits and then ratchet back down a little bit john w allison chairman we ve always had a good efficiency ratio it s gone below 40 up below 40 a little bit above 40 don t look for any major changes in that i m just telling you we re doing some really good things for the bank and for the future and we re spending the money to take our regulatory areas up to the level that not only the regulars won t but that need to be done so i don t take so much from what i ve said brian martin janney montgomery scott analyst yeah i got it all right thanks guys nice quarter john w allison chairman you bet thank you very much operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to mr allison for any closing remarks john w allison chairman thank you gary and thank everyone for your participation in our call and we ll talk to you in what

greetings ladies and gentlemen welcome to the home bancshares inc second quarter 2019 earnings call the purpose of this call is to discuss the information and data provided in the quarterly earnings release issued this morning the company presenters will begin with prepared remarks and then entertain questions advertisement advertisement the company has asked me to remind everyone to refer to their cautionary note regarding forward looking statements you will find this note on page 3 of their form 10 k filed with the sec in february 2019 it is now my pleasure to turn the call over to mr allison john w allison chairman thank you gary good morning everyone kevin and chris and john are at other locations with me today they ll be on the phone though steven tipton is with me brian jennifer donna tracy and randy pretty much the same for so good morning and welcome home bancshares second quarter 2019 earnings release and conference call this is quarter number 52 since our initial public offering and once again home produces another solid quarter for the most part the other 51 have been the same except for a few quarters during the financial crisis times we hit we ve bumped a little bit advertisement advertisement and that of the 51 the 26 have a record quarter record profit quarters in a row that s why home was named the best bank in america by forbes for the second time in a row we re not only proud of sales and being the best bank in america from our roa an efficiency return on tangible common equity net interest margin asset quality were the best in other important segments as well as helping our communities our communities recognize the importance of excuse me we recognized the importance of supporting our communities in which we serve we serve thousands of volunteer hours for our people our commitment to community reinvestment fair lending and diversity with both our money and time we have presented three quarters as you can see from the press release today 50 and 51 donna townsell who said how do you want to present this time do you want to do these boxes or how do you want to be able to use the last quarter or the fourth quarter and they look so good i said let s show three quarters these have not been easy times with rate uncertainties think about it in 18 we had a rate increase every quarter been told by experts we re going to have two more in that team been told we re going to pause temporarily and now we re being told to expect two or three rate cut who in the world are they listening to i think they re writing on a different financial rollercoaster and the rest of us are riding they miss this one about as far as they did y2k you remember that or as rates mac mbc did on election night and i quote there is no way trump can win that was amazing and certainly comical both the fed and magna i don t know how you say that magna whatever it is did not listen to the right people obviously they have been they were talking when they should have been listening but don t shoot to master they are just following the law it s congress that enacted the law and sent him to enforce it it s another example of people who have no experience writing laws in spite of the feds year over year interest rate we have a responsibility to manage our assets in a manner that is in the best interest of our shareholder and communities we serve the key is not to panic to hold the course they were obviously totally wrong again these huge messes create a major loss of credibility for them at the end of the day your management is trying to operate profitably in the middle of this chaos i say when you re piloting an airplane and there s a major problem like an engine going out don t panic just fly the airplane so we re what we are doing is just running the bike and doing our best to ignore all who s staring not complaining that s our job though it would be nice to have a little more stability advertisement advertisement couple that with going over 10 billion the regulatory environment is like being on a different universe other than the risk management hardly any of it has of the new regulatory expectations or involving safety and soundness a prime example is bsa and aml it really would be interesting to have congress do a cost effective in the study of bsa and aml i promise you the results will be breathtaking the waste of money is almost criminal there are much better uses to money than wasted like this bankers throughout the country should rally together to get congress to do a study sorry to be a little windy and we ll get back to trying to run a good bank we keep a sharp eye on the markets and listen to our guys and gals on the ground plus personally visiting our customers and shareholders they re far too many models being created too many quants too many intellectuals without real life experience and not enough people to people on the ground interaction with regulators they need to get out of their offices and listen to real people instead of talking to each other and those that have no business experience one can always make an argument for the negative where the real or perceived but there is no substitute for experience there is no substitute for experience reports from experienced people on the ground that live in reality is the amazingly powerful source the fed should look at the models collect the quant data and the opinions of all the inexperienced phd intellectual people who ve never been there never been in the pothole and then i ask those in the real world what s going on in the economy while heavily on those in the field and gather the information from different parts of the country i get it their latest strength i know better and i must take care of the rest of us deplorable and walmart shoppers but most the time we are by far more honest more reliable and the most reliable form of information i can get we d together built a financially strong and solid banking organization is located with a huge presence in the second or third fastest growing state in the country along with strong performance from our south alabama operation coupled with a solid arkansas market and tack on our new york profit center your company remains best in class and all performance matters we continue to remain in a conservative mode on loans and m a while volatility continues to swirl around both politically and economically we think not pushing the envelope focusing on internal operations and taking what the market gives us and both m a and loans is a proper position to ensure that we ll be around when the opportunities come again advertisement advertisement we appreciate your support and let s talk about the highlights of the quarter and a strong deposit months i think it was 250 we averaged about 240 for the month and we did about what we do stephen where we have last month in the stephen tipton chief operating officer q1 we were up almost 170 million and we re a little over 720 million in the last three quarters john w allison chairman that s good that s 720 million last three quarters excuse me loan to deposit ratio we were 106 million randy we re down to 97 41 we need to get some loans advertisement advertisement c randall sims president chief executive officer and vice chairman way to low john w allison chairman last stable interest margin in the phase this chaos i think you look at that and the fourth quarter we re 4 30 the first quarter of 4 30 and we re 4 28 this quarter but remember that the quarter had over 500 000 i don t know that you know that you maybe i m telling for the first time 500 000 expense on preamortization writedown that was impacted by the margin because of the unexpected fall in interest rates resulting in faster prepayment speeds on some of the securities i think brian will talk more about that advertisement advertisement brian s davis treasurer and chief financial officer yeah well john w allison chairman let s talk about the cost of funds and i want you to go back with me four quarters three quarters two quarters and one quarter and i want you listen these numbers four quarters ago our cost funds increased 6 192 000 three quarters ago it dropped to 3 357 000 and then last quarter quarter before last i guess it is now 2 519 000 in this quarter 283 000 so i think the cost of funds may be something that s not going to be as prevalent as it has been in the past strong asset quality almost the best ever strong capital ratios industry leading ratios common equity to assets 15 84 and tangible common equity excuse me the tangible assets 9 96 almost 10 return on tangible common equity 21 strong loan production over 1 billion with loan production beginning 24 000 at 6 14 we had 512 million with payoffs during the quarter at 5 54 so the production coming down with what went off at 60 basis points higher great job by the team advertisement advertisement overall loan yields i ve been telling you where we re going to push it we started all with last year it s hard to turn the shift but overall loan yields were up three basis points to 6 06 and those three basis points added 897 000 to income for the quarter that s even though average loans were down 30 million i think we ended up 70 million for the end of the quarter but average loan were down but the interest income on the three basis points was 897 000 congratulations to our team you give them a mission and they seem to get it done we continue to maintain strong cost controls with the sub 40 efficiency ratio and a strong roa of 1 92 for our shareholders we increased dividend 0 01 per quarter and will continue to repurchase stock in the last year and a half we have bought back a 168 400 000 worth of stock 8 716 000 shares at an average price of 19 27 so far this year we spent 64 million or 3 416 722 shares at 18 73 last year we bought 5 3 million shares at for 104 million 19 62 average so we ll continue to be in the repurchased business you will see loan writings changed in the queue this quarter in the past all credits that were construction or agro related automatically ready to forward which lands to the conservative nature of our company let me make this clear there is no miss so there is no misunderstanding this is an interim policy and not a regulatory requirement actually this was a nice change from the regulators they actually thought we re being too hard on our sales after sketched with the regulators we agreed to take a look the approximate change were 1 5 billion of the 4s moved to 3s and two credits totaling about 70 million moved to a pass credit five the balance remained in the four totally our call the two credits move into a five one was an apartment construction project on the university campus with one of our largest and oldest customers in the bank the project was weather delayed and missed the starting school semester apartment is now 68 occupied expected to be productive cash flow by the end of the year probably did not need to move because the temporary nature and the quality of the customer that we moved condo project it s in one of our best markets the owner said to keep it as rental because he thinks it s in the best long term interests of his family as a result the project does not flow as rentals does not cash flow as rentals he has over 12 million liquidity as a grade to sell one of his buildings as a condo and pay down the balance enough to cash flow the project advertisement advertisement neither credit has ever been past due and management does not expect a loss on either credit as always his company is totally transparent and wanted to report the changes and allow time for discussions on the call if necessary we pride ourselves being known as the company that tells it like it is good or bad so a few shorts but it s kind of like the trump russian charade there is no better there and i think chris is temporarily out of the manifesto business however it appears as some of your pocket journalists are still around you appeared to enjoy the boxes in the last quarter s presentation and reports directly from each person responsible for that line of business not sure we ll continue that in the future every quarter but certainly helped to get us a better understanding of how we looked at margin and operation brian started first last time he will also be first today and cover the margin in the pieces impacting performance then we ll be chris poulton and john marshall tracy and steven and then our chairman randy sams will wrap it up and kevin hester will be on the phone for any questions so at this point in time i will turn it over to brian and see if you can keep us clear you did a good job last time i heard but i ve got it right brian brian s davis treasurer and chief financial officer okay well thank you mr allison the second quarter was a good quarter for our net interest income and net interest margin tax equivalent basis we recorded net interest income of 142 3 million for q2 2019 compared to 140 8 million for q1 2019 our net interest margin was 4 28 for the second quarter of 2019 compared to 4 30 for the first quarter of 2019 as mr allison mentioned during the second quarter of 2019 the interest rate environment declined for example the 10 year treasury went from 2 50 on march 31 to 2 01 on june 30th this decline has increased the prepayment space on our investment securities as a result we saw an increased premium amortization of 515 000 from q1 to q2 if the premium amortization had remained flat from q1 to q2 our q2 margin would have been 4 30 or unchanged from q1 2019 advertisement advertisement last year our cfg division had a few payoff events which increased our margin for the first six months of 2019 they do not have any additional interest income for payoff event form cfg loan production was very strong in the second quarter of 2019 we saw loan production of more than 1 billion at an average rate of 6 1 this breaks down into 484 million at an average rate of 6 3 for cfg and 538 million at an average rate of 6 for the community banking footprint we are pleased with these levels of production and rates while maintaining our strict underwriting standards another positive was the impact of the change in the yield on our loan portfolio we were able to increase the yield on the loan portfolio by three basis points this equates to a 823 000 improvement in loan interest income for q2 when compared to q1 accretion income for the fair value adjustments reported in purchase accounting was 9 2 million during q2 compared to 9 1 million during q1 for an increase of 100 000 in conclusion even though reported margin declined two basis points our daily net interest income of 1 5 million per day remained unchanged for q2 compared to q1 however if the investment premium amortization had remained flat from from q1 to q2 we would have reported an improvement of approximately 5 000 of additional net interest income per day for q2 2019 with that said i ll turn the call back over to mr allison john allison chairman did you say 823 000 i reported 897 000 brian s davis treasurer and chief financial officer yeah i check my number while you were talking and i came up with 823 000 that s what stephen and i were talking on over here john allison chairman well it s 823 000 it was 8 something right so there s nothing wrong with that that s good brian s davis treasurer and chief financial officer it s over 800 000 john allison chairman it s over 800 000 brian s davis treasurer and chief financial officer that s right john w allison chairman don t mislead the public so i guess next we d go chris poulton chris you on chris poulton president of centennial commercial finance group yes sir thank you and thank you johnny second quarter at ccfg was highlighted primarily by a significant increase in new loan production which brian just discussed as you may recall during last quarter s earnings call i noted that our loan pipeline specifically the approved but not closed loans stood at an all time high i m pleased to report that during the second quarter we closed the majority of those loans and we originated just under 500 million in new loan commitment to put that in perspective we generally originate between 800 million and 1 billion in a given year a little over half of those new commitments were funded during the quarter which resulted in approximate a 143 million of net loan growth for the second quarter notably just about half of the new production came out of the west coast lpo as we continue to see good progress from darren robinson and his team in l a while payoffs continued and will continue to be a feature of our portfolio we do continue to see good opportunities in our respective markets and i remain pleased with the potential loans in our pipeline thank you for the time and i ll hand it back over to you johnny john w allison chairman thanks chris next up is john marshall go ahead john marshall president good afternoon thank you mr allison for the opportunity to provide an update on show premiere finance in the second quarter profitability grew in the second quarter and we continue to run ahead of budget this may be attributed to asset growth of 5 1 million stable margins and good expense management our efficiency ratio remain below 30 for the quarter commercial and consumer loan originations totaled 34 2 million an increase of 5 7 million over the first quarter are up roughly 20 in addition 11 million in commercial commitments were approved in our pipeline of retail assets grew due to an increase in applications of 38 by volume 34 by dollar portfolio growth has been stifled somewhat year to date by unusually high prepayment rates as consumers take market gains and reduce their personal debt that trend appears to have abated in june and july month today the total combined portfolio was 448 9 million at the end of the quarter compared to 443 8 million at the end of q1 and 436 million at the end of the year in 2018 since joining centennial bank in july 2018 interest earning assets are up 62 6 million while we re not a financial center or a branch marine related deposits have grown to 1 3 million doubling in the second quarter our growth strategy for both commercial and retail is to add new manufacturers both domestic builders and international and their attendant distribution channels in north america working with their dealer networks for commercial floor plans and to leverage these relationships for new retail referral sources in addition we receive commercial and retail referrals from centennial bankers particularly those scattered around the florida market and we had success in co branding events at boat shows and marine industry trade shows with our parent centennial bank as always we re also grateful for our broad base of marine loan brokers for the majority of our retail referrals we continue to deepen and increase those relationships we also anticipate launching a super yacht retail marine finance program in the third quarter of this year growth has not been achieved at the expense of asset quality our delinquent loans were down substantially below 1 million at the end of 2q compared to 1 4 million at the end of the first quarter and 5 8 million at the end of 2018 commercial commitments have all been freshly underwritten and approved through centennial banks loan approval process and average retail borrower fico scores had origination have climbed from 770 at the year end of 2018 to 775 in the first quarter and it s and may breach 777 in the second quarter a commodity type nature of the retail side of our business continues to put pressure on our margins in addition pressure came from the recent fed decisions and the market reactions to the fed as it relates to the 10 year treasury an index that is commonly pegged by us and our competitors for establishing retail rates we see that with an average origination rates in the fourth quarter of 18 a 5 01 climbing to 5 52 in the first quarter of this year and then pulling back slightly to 5 37 last quarter i expect continued downward pressure in the third quarter the third quarter growth outlook is mixed while we ve seen an uptick in application volume and retail originations dealers are beginning to express some pessimism and tapering back their purchase orders nonetheless i remain confident in our ability to achieve growth profitability and asset quality objectives with that i conclude my remarks and i thank you john w allison chairman thank you john tracy french tracy m french centennial bank president chief executive officer good afternoon to you thanks john as you may recall last quarter i mentioned our focus was going to be on net interest margin and improving asset quality the numbers posted today for the second quarter or show just that we improved our loan yield we ve watched our deposit cost and improved our non performing loans to give a little bit of shout out to our community banking our net interest margin remained 4 2 as it was the first quarter which is up from 4 18 at the end of last year also like to give a little tip of the hat to some of our regions on the deposit growth that they ve had little rock market has been up about 7 and a little over 7 year to date in southeast florida s up over 11 year to date and then next we will shout out to the north florida market as they are up in non interest bearing checking accounts 16 5 year to date so congratulations to some of those and really congratulations to all and steven will give a little color on the deposits a little later well the quarter centennial bank had a return on assets of 2 1 and efficiency ratio of 36 45 with the total revenue of 204 million as it has been mentioned i am pleased to see the strong loan production from the community bank segment i want to compliment our lending teams for their continued effort in this competitive landscape steven do you want to give a little color on the loans and deposits stephen tipton chief operating officer thank you tracy as you and brian mentioned the community bank loan production for q2 was strong with the contribution split fairly evenly between arkansas and florida while payout volume in the florida portfolio continues to be elevated we did see in the period loan growth for arkansas and alabama on the deposit side has been mentioned we saw another strong quarter of growth 280 million led by southeast florida region with over 120 million in the end of period growth johnny mentioned the interest rate environment today is quite different from where we were just three months ago and we will closely monitor the impact of declining interest potentially declining interest rates on both sides of the balance sheet our efforts are now focused on deposit pricing while maintaining core relationships with that i ll turn it back over to you mr allison john allison chairman thank you go to randy sims our chairman and let him wrap it up randy sims chief executive officer well one way to wrap something up is to say congratulations to everyone s for another good quarter as you ve heard from everyone the numbers are again some of the best you know we seem to always talk about the numbers so i d just like to take a minute to mention we are making improvements in many areas of the bank with the intent to strategically take our operational areas to a higher level that not only provides new capabilities for our customers but also improves our infrastructure for future growth our rt division that we rarely talk about is busy concentrating on continuing to improve structure as well as implementing new fintech initiatives along with operational and retail divisions we ve deployed via person to person payments implementing new functions within the mobile app and completely updated our customer website we continue to add interactive teller machines in appropriate locations and new project products such as spin to win a prize linked savings program all to enhance the customer experience with the best and capabilities and products in addition the bank has taken on a new initiative of strengthening our internal structure including operational areas as well as taking our regulatory departments to new levels of experience and depth these efforts and improvements position us to continue our goal of being a high performing bank not just now but well into the future it prepares us for whatever opportunity the market may provide and with these improvements comes expense but as you heard our numbers have remained strong as johnny stated this is quarter 52 and our high performance has been consistent so let me just recap some of those strong numbers and wrap this quarter up we finished with total assets of 15 287 575 000 income was 72 2 million resulting in diluted earnings per share of 0 43 as compared to 0 42 from the last quarter which means the market expectations roa was consistent and very strong with the last quarter at 1 92 more importantly we were able to achieve a strong net interest margin at 4 28 down just a little from the last quarter at 4 30 as you heard from the others we are working very hard on both sides of the balance sheet to maintain the margin once again our profitability was helped by a very strong efficiency ratio of 39 93 it was good to see it under that 40 again as we continued to control our costs but also make enhancements within our bank infrastructure i am very proud of this number given the improvements we have been making and the negative effect of durbin estimated at 3 million for each and every quarter it s been a very strong quarter for deposit growth as you heard ending at 11 35 billion with them approximately 280 million in growth resulting in a loan deposit ratio of 97 41 as compared to march 31 at 99 20 and yes mr allison that s keeping that engine running really low like 30 miles per hour i like it when it runs hot and you re making a lot of money john w allison chairman honestly i understand c randall sims president chief executive officer and vice chairman and of course as you have heard from others we had over 1 billion in loan production and an average rate of 6 1 which again is one of the reasons why we re able to maintain a strong net interest margin our asset quality has and continues to be solid indicating a very optimistic and secured outlook for 2019 and of course strong capital ratios as always and you will always see that from home bancshares we now have two quarters behind us and i think you d agree that once again the results we presented today are powerful numbers we look forward to the third quarter and another opportunity to once again perform in the high level for our shareholders and that pretty much wraps things up john w allison chairman randy thank you it s interesting going over 10 billion and what we ve been able to accomplish when you think about durbin yes it took 3 million spread out of our pocket this quarter and usually accretion is going down so that s pulling out and then when you go to this next universe regulatory lives with the expense that we incurring there and still be able to meet the numbers i m beginning to get a feel for why in the past that the analysts have lowered expectations for banks like us and multiples when you go over team because they think these guys well these people be able to keep up well can they keep up with the increased expenses can they keep up with illusion durbin can they keep up with it and i wouldn t sure we could do that we get it the first quarter and it was lake of breath of fresh air to me we did it well we did it a little easier this quarter than we did it did the first quarter so i see that now and there s some understanding for that so i m pretty pleased i tell some other days that where are you we re kind of treading the water but we are ok treading the water we got through the first quarter it s kind of relieve entered the second quarter and it was better in the second quarter so hopefully the third quarter will be better than the second quarter but these reports were really good and i want to congratulate this team of people you know the one thing about our team is you give them a mission and they get after it they try to make it work and i ve told our people last all this we started pushing the rates everybody didn t push rates if you want to know what the quality of a bike you ve ask them what the margin is you know if they given stuff why is it 310 315 are they given stuff away they say we won t have good asset quality all they got bad loans because they pushed that up that s not correct at all that s totally incorrect we got the best asset quality we ve ever had it s as good it s good as it is in the country we just asked for the additional rate you know we ve we maintain that relationship we visit with that customer and i like all that is still important to building the relationship you hear people talk about relationship what their relationship is that they give a cheap rate so we ve never backed off on that and our team had the mission was given to them last august and you can see what they ve done with that they ve been able to continue to push rates now what s going to happen now is the weight will drop 50 basis points the stronger product continue matter of fact we just got our executive loan committee today and we re at 570 566 in a quarter so some of the ways we ll drop those rates in a hurry we don t do that we try to get the maximum we can get out of it and and our team does that and against all odds they continue to produce for the shareholders i guess randy there s easy monkeys be doing it but it s my pleasure and i mean that to work with such a great dedicated group of professionals and they get the job done congrats to you guys gary i think we re ready for q a questions and answers operator we will now begin the question and answer session our first question comes from brady gailey with kbw please go ahead brady gailey kbw analyst hey good afternoon guys john w allison chairman hi brady brady gailey kbw analyst when you look at your net interest margin you all done a good job of holding that pretty steady around the 4 30 mark as we look forward with the yield curve doing what it s doing and then i m guessing we re going to see lower levels of yield accretion for you guys in the back half of this year and into 2020 do you think that it s realistic that you could see some nim slippage here or do you think that maybe deposit costs start coming down and you re able to hold it around this 4 30 level john w allison chairman i ll take that and stephen might chime in a little bit after that and then i will give you the answer and i ll follow up from him and then i might have comment i ll start off with the accretion we have been around 9 million plus in accretion each quarter the last three quarters i ll really predicted it go down into the 8 million range this quarter we did have an increase in pay off accretion the pay off accretion was up about a 500 000 this quarter from the previous quarter so there s a good chance that might not be reoccurring so we would have that pressure of 500 000 with equate to about two basis points on the nim if you look at the models that we have and we ve disclosed these model numbers before for a short analysis i mean we re really for the most part neutrally gap but we are technically slightly asset sensitive these asset sensitive and models are correct which we can do things to try to change the outlook from those models it would show that we would have some margin compression this upcoming stephen tipton chief operating officer or john w allison chairman yeah the one that s coming up here at the end of the month should cost us a quarter of the models about 2 million of net interest income which could equate six basis points but we re going to try to do things to try to improve on that stephen tipton chief operating officer hi brady this is stephen and that s a tag on there where we spent a lot of time over the last month or so trying to identify on the deposit side what opportunities we expect will have if the fed lowers a quarter at the end of the month we we ve indicated before we have a decent sized bucket in the funding side that is tied to either live or reference rates or tied to t bill rates that have already started to come down a little bit we saw some good benefit from that july 1 on their quarterly reset so we feel like we re trying to identify what we can match up on the funding side to the loan side as to what the variable rate and then the investment portfolio might be kind of wildcard brady gailey kbw analyst all right and then my second question is on the expense side it sounds like you guys have some continued investments that need to be made in the infrastructure just from being a bank that s over 10 billion in assets yeah i was just wondering how your quarterly expenses have actually been going down in the last couple of quarters so as you look to invest more in the expense infrastructure do you think that it will that have a notable impact on expense growth going forward stephen tipton chief operating officer well as you re saying it hasn t so far and we don t we continue to do things to try as we re improving and putting some money into infrastructure some of that infrastructure is software that become makes you more efficient some of that infrastructure is our people that again make you more efficient so it s kind of looking into the future and saying well are your expenses going to go way up well the expenses might go up a little on the front end but we make it investments in infrastructure to become more efficient and therefore try to keep our expenses down and even lower them but yeah you could see some increase but i would hope that it would be followed by a decrease and as we improve things and we don t make those investments without some realistic outcome of improvement and lower costs that makes sense i mean is that what you re looking for brady gailey kbw analyst yeah thanks for the color that s great john w allison chairman oh good i m going to wrap this up for you we re not going to let the expense to go up and margins will remain flat well continuously it s forward to go down right i mean margin should in this environment go down we have about 2 8 million with the loans are going to reprocess we re about 75 fixed that s good force or adjustable we got about 144 billion worth of funds that will adjust if they just prime if they re going to take prime they need to do that that ll help us it gives us of a gaap of about 1 billion in there and you know this team works very hard we got a call from one of our top flat recent presence and mark me down 15 basis points already have already taken the cost of deposits down so as we work like hell on the way up we ll work like hell on the way down so maybe a little blip temporarily but i don t think it s i don t think it ll be a long term blip for us because this team has a way of finding and fixing it as you well know so as we battle it hard on the way up we ll battled hard all the way down stephen tipton chief operating officer can say one more thing only expenses we are challenged by taking our regulatory group to another level and we are meeting that challenge and we are investing in that but at the same time we have a strategic initiative on the other side of people that are doing nothing but looking for ways to automate things so as we invest in taking a regulatory to another level that team is looking to see where we can automate that to keep those costs down and they re that team is also looking at other areas of the bank and i give you examples but i m not going to take the time to do that but they also look and analyze where can we automate something that actually reduces our cost and the number of people that we have to have so what we got wow one thing is maybe making our expenses go up over here we had another group over here that is trying to drive expenses down so i just want i want to know that we re working on both sides of that and it has always been our goal to keep that efficiency ratio where everyone is proud of it operator the next question comes from stephen scouten with sandler o neill partners please go ahead stephen scouten sandler o neill partners analyst hey guys good afternoon how you all doing john w allison chairman good stephen congratulation on the all recent trade stephen scouten sandler o neill partners analyst thank you sir thank you we ll see how it all plays out but it should be good direction for us so thank you john w allison chairman you think they re stephen scouten sandler o neill partners analyst i don t know what do you think john john w allison chairman i hope so stephen scouten sandler o neill partners analyst i appreciate that time will tell my friend time will tell hey i m curious if you guys are seeing any sort of inflection point on the payoff levels in florida in particular sounds like that s where you re seeing a lot of the pay downs and production has been phenomenal so i m just wondering if you think we might see some time here in the near future or more that comes to the bottom line and grows the bank a little bit quicker kevin d hester chief lending officer this is kevin i can take that or stephen if you want to go ahead stephen tipton chief operating officer no please do kevin d hester chief lending officer stephen the next two quarters at least i don t think you re going to see that we ve got as we re looking in the pipeline the next two quarters look like they re pretty heavy on the payoff side as much as i d like to report that they re not that we do see pretty heavy movement in the next couple of quarters at least brian s davis treasurer and chief financial officer no let me ask if you look at the last three quarters it s been around it s been a little north of 500 million and i think what kevin mentioned we re seeing that plus a little bit of forecasted so things change you know you can move around from quarter to quarter but it s we re still seeing the volume there john w allison chairman i think you heard me refer to it as grease pig one day it s hard to get your arms around that and even though when i think it s not going to be as good it s better when i think it s going to be better it s not and so it s somewhat difficult to get your arms around that but according to what the projection is that they re going to be it would be down the next two quarters but i ve seen that many quarters before and it didn t turn out to be that way so that s a difficult one to forecast because you never know if you know what s coming and you never know what would you going to fund i think our funding we grew 160 million 150 million 145 million what was it unfunded brian s davis treasurer and chief financial officer unfunded commitments were up about 145 million from quarter to quarter john w allison chairman to 2 6 billion or brian s davis treasurer and chief financial officer 2 35 billion john w allison chairman 2 35 billion so it gives you an idea of what s coming stephen scouten sandler o neill partners analyst okay appreciate that and john it sounds like you ve been watching a lot of msnbc lately so with the rates looking like they re going to go down here what are you guys doing to prevent against some of these rate cuts i mean are you do any hedging or otherwise to kind of put in protections if in case if those guys are right john w allison chairman we haven t done that i want some are friends only upside spend millions of dollars on the hedging process and get their hand handed to them you know the fed says they re going down it might be 90 days and they go up ahead so it s i like the so i could get a dart board and it totally hits up or down or a quarter or a half i d like they just throw a dart boards what they ve been doing looks like lately so and i don t watch too much in the msnbc i did watch comedy hour on the night of the presidential election i did we got force in place and significant force in place and 75 feds are adjustable so i think we re really on a down right now i think we re in pretty good position i actually think we re in a better position on the way down than we were on the way up and we fought to keep it to hold our margin all the way up so i can assure you we ll fight to keep it on the way down i think i said that earlier so i would be disappointed that we ll be disappoint if you know how hard i pushed i think we got a shot it may go down few ticks but i think we got a shot and hold it within range stephen tipton chief operating officer one thing to remember is that we are a bank made up of a lot of different communities and those communities drive the market those communities are is the market that we look at and that we serve and then this up and down that goes up and down and whatever the fed decides to do is disrupts that i wish that the fed would leave things alone and let the market do what it always does but where i have a little bit of advantage i believe because we serve small community markets and those changes are not as drastic as what we see on the national level stephen scouten sandler o neill partners analyst makes sense make sense maybe one last question for me i was curious what you expect on the pace of the buybacks or kind of how you think about that moving forward if there s a capital level you might manage to or if you think they might pick back up to the levels we saw in the previous two quarters versus a little bit a less active this quarter stephen tipton chief operating officer well we have we ve kind of overbought in first quarter we spent more than we had about 180 million i think somewhere in that range approved by the regulators and we spent 50 million something may in the first quarter which was a little brian s davis treasurer and chief financial officer we spent 52 million in the first quarter and we spent 13 million in the second quarter and you re right we had 188 million approved from the regulators stephen tipton chief operating officer yeah we re really evaluating what s in the best interest with all that capital rolling in right now what s in the best interest of the company to slow down the bad back to maybe look at a sinking fund to pay off some debt at some point in time it s coming in the future so we re really in the process evaluating that at this point in time we ll continue to be in the buyback business not sure how much we ll be in we will continue to be in that market and sometimes we ll buy heavy and sometimes we won t if i put it on sale we ll jump in there stephen scouten sandler o neill partners analyst very good thank you guys appreciate the time congrats on the quarter brian s davis treasurer and chief financial officer thanks operator the next question comes from michael rose with raymond james please go ahead michael rose raymond james analyst hey good afternoon guys i just had a accounting question so i just heard the comment around the unfunded commitments and obviously with show premiere finance coming on those two things is my understanding is they re treated pretty punitively under cico so as we think about going into 2020 does this curtail your desire to continue to grow shore premier finance or chris group up in new york john w allison chairman i mean when we get to cico i mean we re we ll set whatever it is we need to start for the day one accounting mark but i would not envision that it s going to change how we look at that at all and that s just the way of doing business stephen tipton chief operating officer michael this is steve i think maybe they coming there just because they contractually some of the shore finance is longer term and i think i don t think we would change that our desire to be in that business particularly with what john mentioned in the underwriting standards and what we re seeing today just because of the accounting change and it gets the business we want to be in and be exposed to continue to be a part of michael rose raymond james analyst but it wouldn t limit your necessarily limit your growth plans and neither of those businesses stephen tipton chief operating officer i don t think so michael rose raymond james analyst is that what i m hearing stephen tipton chief operating officer yeah michael rose raymond james analyst okay and i don t think these sorry if i missed it but i don t think the m a questions been asked and i don t think john you mentioned in the prepared remarks so just wanted to get an update on your thoughts on the m a landscape at this point what you guys are seeing john w allison chairman i did mention them in the remarks that we will remind conservative on m a will take what they give us on the m a and on the loan side so i don t think this is time to be pressing the home loan i think what i said where we re continually looking we re continually running models here with other banks the moe thing is as i said last quarter it s kind of the table for us because it doesn t we re having difficulty finding somebody that has the quality it s not a moe mean there s not very few people at run a bank like we run a bank and it s difficult to do at m a in perfect particularly in last who s going to ultimately run it at the end of the day so i mean we ve seen a couple of them and they want to run it but quite honestly they don t run near the performance that home bank s shares run so some of that as they go who s going to run it who is going to be the boss i don t mind if somebody is running a 2020 hour way and may want to be the boss expand but they re running at once in roa will be the boss they probably not going to get hook up with home banks here so we re still looking michael rose raymond james analyst i was just going to say sorry i missed that in the prepared comments john w allison chairman that s ok michael rose raymond james analyst that s clear one final question for me we ve heard a couple of banks talk about the lag effect on the downside if we do get a couple of rate cuts on deposit rates and i guess my question is do you think your interest bearing deposit costs have keep should we get rate cut john w allison chairman i do i think close i think we re right at it if you heard my comments maybe you did maybe you want to go to my all comments but i went back four quarters it was 6 3 million cost to fund increase and then i m recalling from memory then 3 2 million increase in cost of funds to 2 5 million to 283 000 this quarter which is a pretty good indication of what s happening there so i looked at it yesterday and excuse me i looked at it today and it was flat so what i m seeing a lot seeing interest income up slightly i m seeing interest expense down slightly so that s a good indicator for the company michael rose raymond james analyst okay sorry i missed some of the commentary in the beginning thanks for taking my questions john w allison chairman i know you have a bunch of have a bunch of calls right in this time operator the next question comes from matt olney with stephens please go ahead matt olney stephens inc analyst hey guys good afternoon john w allison chairman hi matt matt olney stephens inc analyst i think randy mentioned that the loan to deposit ratio is now at 97 but the loans has been for a while is this a strategic change and are you going to operate here or will randy get his way and we ll see this move back up john w allison chairman c randall sims president chief executive officer and vice chairman the regulators like it i don t particularly like it and we ll be somewhere in between that s probably good answer somewhere in between but deposits has been awfully strong 700 plus 700 million plus in the last three quarters and it s i have to give thrice the credit for because he established that new policy if you ll remember several years ago we started asking for it so we re going to stop it we re not going to stop matt olney stephens inc analyst and then john you mentioned you feel like you have some protection with some flaws can you give us an idea of what point do those flaws come into play how many fed cuts we have to see stephen tipton chief operating officer yeah matt this is stephen take that we ve got on the ccfg portfolio there s a couple 100 million today that are protected with the flaws you have functionally all of the production and i think your christ s comments on how good his production was for the quarter all of this production so far this year should be protected as it begins to fund which as a good portion of his production has yet to fund we ve got about 150 million or so on the community bank side that s protected today in a 25 basis point downright scenario and then those numbers increase a little bit as if rates were to continue to go down so we ve got 350 or so that s protected today if they do lower rates into this month matt olney stephens inc analyst and stephen i would assume that if rates were to go down beyond 25 bps that 350 would increase is that fair stephen tipton chief operating officer yes yes that s fair i don t have those numbers in front of me here but yes that s fair matt olney stephens inc analyst okay okay guys that s all for me thanks for your help stephen tipton chief operating officer don t bet to farm on that matt matt olney stephens inc analyst i wouldn t do that operator the next question comes from jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please go ahead jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst thanks good afternoon john w allison chairman hi jon jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst hi kevin what can you go back over that i was a little confused by the pay off information you were talking about you were saying it s elevated the next couple of quarters are not elevated the next couple quarters i missed out kevin d hester chief lending officer yeah stephen made and he mentioned a number of 500 last quarter and i think what we have and then johnny made the comment it is early it s early in the third quarter and certainly for the fourth quarter things can change and things can move in and out of quarters and up and down as you go through but as we ve got it as we re seeing it right now the payoff numbers are even a little higher than what we saw last quarter and productions been strong maybe we can out produce it and that be a good thing but unfortunately we re just seeing we re seeing people take things off the table and sell projects and move them to permanent and it just work that jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst okay so the message would be hoping for modest loan growth working hard to get there but you ve probably seeing some repricing higher in yields there s an offset is that fair kevin d hester chief lending officer yeah i think that s fair jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst okay ok is john marshall still on john marshall president hi good afternoon jon s here jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst hey john you made a comment about consumer health and maybe picking up a little bit in june and july but then you also talked about dealers pulling back can you expand on that a little bit and just let us know what you re seeing in terms of the consumer and why you think the dealers might be pulling back john marshall president they had a little bit of a conflicting message coming out we ve seen volume increase from an app based standpoint and from a funding standpoint and the quality of those applications is measured by fico scores it s also improving but in our conversations with our dealers they re looking forward and they re pushing back on their manufacturers just a little bit in the amount of inventory that they re interested in holding as we move forward into probably not the third quarter in the fourth quarter of this year or perhaps first quarter of next year and i don t know you know i asked it what is it that they re seeing are there any technical indicators that would suggest that they want to hold less inventory and it s more of a gut feeling so right now we ve got sort of mixed signals we ve got retail buyers are buying a lot more boats but then we ve got dealers appearing to pull back just a little bit jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst okay good that helps john marshall president i m hoping those two will offset each other and so it ll be neutral for us and we ll continue to meet our growth goals jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst okay good i was just most interested in the narrative on why but that helps me chris maybe for you pipelines and commitments obviously were very high do you see that continuing coming into q3 in the rest of the year chris poulton president of centennial commercial finance group yeah good afternoon we do we like the pipeline still as we move through a lot of our waiting to close stuff this past quarter so that was nice but we continue to like to see what we re seeing through there we review it once a week generally like to see about 1 billion in the pipeline not all that ll make its way through but as long as we have a billion plus in the pipeline i usually feel pretty good about where we re headed we have a little over 1 billion in the pipeline today so i would say we continue to think they re interesting there s interesting opportunities and transactions out there i don t think that s changed we certainly take a i would say shift toward a more defensive nature as it relates to both the pipeline in the portfolio so let go the payoff sentiment in our business that s a good thing loans aren t supposed to be out there forever and while money is cheap and plentiful there s some of the credits we d like them to to go ahead and move on out jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst okay fair enough and then maybe just a bigger picture question for i don t know if it s randy or tracy or someone but it sounds like you all don t feel like a rate cut is needed at all based on what you re saying but i m just curious if you re seeing anything that bothers you or that s incrementally a little bit more troubling from an economic point of view or not thanks john w allison chairman we haven t seen our portfolio still shows all businesses doing just fine so whether that is a rate cut or not for the company wise as i mentioned i was going to ask for the deposits and then and it seemed to be working pretty well he guessed that the speaker here john we ve called our variable rate customers last two days and are all coming inside of new fixed rate loans next week i m just kidding so we re going to ask them to come in and fix them up for that process but it s we worked on the interest rates here every day and that s something that we ve done for several years now and when it goes up it goes up when it goes down it goes down so we feel like our company is positioned pretty well to work through whatever the challenges we get thrown out on interest rates so we ll go up or down jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst okay stephen tipton chief operating officer from a personal nature i ll just tell you that especially where i am in the beach areas and on the coastline it is so dead gone crowded they need to put some fences up and keep people out there are people that need to go home i have never in my life seen it that crowded four and five of umbrellas deep all the way down as far as you can see it there is no slowdown of the economy or any indicators of what s going around where i am and everything that we hear in conway and our markets is things are pretty good jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst okay need to put up some of that that s back handling on the size of the panhandle stephen tipton chief operating officer yeah i was a little slow on that one john w allison chairman we stay really close to our markets and what s going on our people on the ground live in it so i mean we re not seen any disruption in the markets anywhere jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst thank you we could say okay good thanks for the help operator the next question comes from brett rabatin with piper jaffray please go ahead brett rabatin piper jaffray analyst hey guys good afternoon john w allison chairman hi brett brett rabatin piper jaffray analyst wanted to just to go back to the margin for a second and from a filing perspective about 60 of your book is variable can you give us how much might be libor and then the securities book is pretty small relative to earning assets but just thinking about what you re doing in that book presently and then do yield pop back up going forward in that portfolio as well john allison chairman i ll let steve and brian talk about that you got that upside down it s a about 70 75 fixed or adjustable balance is variable so we don t have much variable stephen tipton chief operating officer yeah brett this is stephen i think what gets picked up in the filings are some of the we ll call it more adjustable type deals where we re fixing to write for a period of time and then it was just two years now those sometimes you get picked up as a variable rate yeah i think what we ve identified that is subject to potentially move say in the next quarter or so as a truly variable type note is about 2 8 billion half of that or so is on the ccfg side that is subject to move above a floor the other half would be on the communities bank side the majority of that is tied to libor we ve got about 800 million or 900 million that s tied to wall street journal prime and then the balance of that would be tied to libor so we think a little bit of movement there over the last couple of months in libor but that s where the portfolio stands as we see it brett rabatin piper jaffray analyst okay and then the security book any color there john w allison chairman i mean it is what it is i mean we ve got 361 million of it that variable and repriced within the next 30 days and then after that it gets pretty small amounts brett rabatin piper jaffray analyst okay and then the other question i want to ask is this is the first quarter in a while we ve seen a provision from you guys and your credit is obviously stellar and i think that s one of the pitches for owning your company in the next few years as credit should be better than peers could you give us maybe some thoughts on provisioning from here should we expect the standard 1 of new loan production or maybe give us a if you can about how you think about the provision going forward john w allison chairman well we had a exceptional quarter this time much better than it than the quarter actually looked and we thought it was a good work we ve always been reserve builders we ve always liked to have about 1 reserve just kind of how the company is run actually my past lap i ran a 150 and i just think that s i think it s just a solid number i understand we ve got all these complicated measures of how we have to calculate reserves today but those were that 150 workforce and the worst financial crunch i have ever seen in my life so we re running about one now and we got marks of about another 120 that ran so i m not supposed to add those together i guess you can t tell you where i think we are and i think we re well reserved see lots of people out here with 43 and 46 and 47 reserves if we have a crunch that s not will be enough that s what the asset quality says that won t be enough so we re just a believer we had a good quarter it looked like we found a match charge off closed charge offs for the little quarter and we just kind of look at it every quarter and see how it has got that but asset quality of that i mean i probably we probably could justify four overs five but we ll keep as much in there as we can brett rabatin piper jaffray analyst okay and then just lastly i want to go back to capital for a second you mentioned buybacks let s say you re not involve in the m a in the next few quarters and you re really profitable what do you do with capital if you know buybacks are not sort of enough in terms of what you re thinking about managing capital what you do as capital continues to accumulate john w allison chairman well we have some trust preferred out there and we also have 300 million worth of subdebt so i mean accounts is capital one is still that so i mean we re dead reversed at home bank shares we don t like that it counts as capital we don t like that s the right way to treat that but we did raise 300 million and it would be our effort to pay that off at some point in time or start accumulating money to take it in advantage how many months 33 months left brian brian s davis treasurer and chief financial officer we ve had it 27 months we have 33 months till it gets to where we start losing part of the capital treatment after 5 years is callable and then we will get 80 in capital treatment john w allison chairman but we ll continue brian about dilution on buyback stock and i understand it is diluted but it has been it it has been one of the best uses of capital for our company for some time and as i said what we bought like 8 7 million shares in the last 18 months and 168 million worth so particularly if they want to take us down the price that will be an active buyer brett rabatin piper jaffray analyst okay i appreciate all the color john w allison chairman thank you operator the next question comes from brian martin with janney montgomery scott please go ahead brian martin janney montgomery scott analyst hey guys john w allison chairman hi how are you brian you ve changed jobs change the government brian martin janney montgomery scott analyst i was like stephen as well so his comments hey you guys have covered a lot of this but just the maybe for stephen just on the you talked about the variable rate and fixed rate helping on the funding side of the market sensitive deposits what s the level those are currently they could adjust in the next quarter or so so stephen stephen tipton chief operating officer first as john mentioned maybe the first part of the q a but we ve done about a 1 5 billion or so that are tied to some index either treasuries lab or wall street journal from that functionally should flow 100 native with that as it changes and then we ve got another 1 ish billion or so that we ve identified kind of call it market top of the market type rates that we can affect over time so that s our task and thanks for tracy and johnny both mentioned well will work to work those rates down if we see the fed make a move on the 31st brian martin janney montgomery scott analyst okay and it sounds as though just kind of hearing all the comments on margin that i guess you d probably think it s fair to say that the core margin kind of actually accretion is probably i guess maybe near a bottom if you do get a rate decrease given kind of the initiatives maybe it s as johnny said a couple of ticks lower but shouldn t be materially lower in a lower in the down rate environment i guess is that kind of in summary kind of a fair statement stephen tipton chief operating officer i think it s a fair statement and like that john w allison chairman yeah as brian mentioned i mean those the models show that it could put a little bit of pressure on it but i think that s based on the assumptions that we have and we re evaluating all of that now to see if we can do better than that brian martin janney montgomery scott analyst okay all right and i think it was brian said it was six basis points if you get it 25 that s with the models show should be a 25 basis point decrease brian s davis treasurer and chief financial officer yeah that is correct brian martin janney montgomery scott analyst okay and the last two for me was just the johnny talked about the buyback versus a debt repayment i mean how quickly could you do something on the debt repayment or i guess is that more near term or is it a little bit longer term given you ve got a couple of years and the capital treatment stephen tipton chief operating officer yes it s not callable it s stephen it s brian it s not callable till 22 we shouldn t have change brian martin janney montgomery scott analyst okay we got 33 months until that comes up brian and so i mean we start few months but the problem is going to be with me i mean we start accumulating the total amount you re said 150 million to 200 million and the deal comes up i said i m will be your biggest problem is going to be maybe we might let depends on what the next deal looks like compared to what paying down the debt looks like so most sense is if we do a deal we ve never done a deluded deal we ve always been a creative snow and our stocks creep back up a little bit getting back into 2 20 times to 2 30 times tangible book we just took a look at i mean if you are 96 i think we rank six or seven when you take out the nonbank so to speak in margin in the country so we re pretty proud of that as again earlier in the call i said just bank what the margin is found out where there s the real monster whether given brian randy sims and i really believe in those models brian s davis treasurer and chief financial officer we are going to improve them run once again c randall sims president chief executive officer and vice chairman and i just what the models i just what the models said assuming the other guys around the table do nothing except just let it roll out brian s davis treasurer and chief financial officer well the models notification models do it and go on vacation the first actually our communities john w allison chairman let the model looked about that way all the way up to you we re pretty much flat i think we re we maybe we could be in better shape on the way down we ll see brian martin janney montgomery scott analyst yeah and the last couple just on the pipelines you talked about the payoffs johnny but just as far as the production i mean i guess here your sense i mean there s a pretty wide swing in from 1q to 2q and the production value i guess this one of them feel more realistic or do you think it s the production volumes maybe somewhere in between and then in the back half of the year john w allison chairman you had the first quarter you have shock and all from the data from what the fed in december i mean it shook the world the s p 500 total return phone had the worst month since 1929 i mean that was just that was a major error and it shook everything so i think it took a while to recover back so i m optimistic that production will be better i mean new york funded started funding some of this quarter but still have a lot to fund as time comes on and and we re up 100 we ve got about 2 3 billion and you ll see some of that funding so i suspect we might be down a little bit and i must tell you that we might be down a little bit on loans this quarter and the reason i m telling you that is the last time i said we d be up we were down so long as they were down and maybe up brian martin janney montgomery scott analyst okay and just lastly was the on the expenses i guess it sounds like they could move up a tick from here based on what randy was saying but just kind of looking thinking about the efficiency i guess worth had here around this 40 level i guess is that something you expect to be able to maintain that tick up a little bit and then as randy said you get the benefits and then ratchet back down a little bit john w allison chairman we ve always had a good efficiency ratio it s gone below 40 up below 40 a little bit above 40 don t look for any major changes in that i m just telling you we re doing some really good things for the bank and for the future and we re spending the money to take our regulatory areas up to the level that not only the regulars won t but that need to be done so i don t take so much from what i ve said brian martin janney montgomery scott analyst yeah i got it all right thanks guys nice quarter john w allison chairman you bet thank you very much operator this concludes our question and answer session i would

for all but the skeptics saturday marks the 50th anniversary of the moon landing for those of you ready to read something a little different than my onslaught of factor tilt articles this piece is going to use the moon landing to illustrate how dramatic technological revelations may be skewing inflation and economic growth readings important to valuing securities before we go back to the summer of 1969 let s go to providence rhode island in may of 2015 there then fed chair janet yellen delivered an innocuous speech to the chamber of commerce in that speech she stated the federal reserve s objectives of maximum employment and price stability do not by themselves ensure a strong pace of economic growth or an improvement in living standards the most important factor determining living standards is productivity growth at its basest definition the productivity growth that yellen keyed as important to rising living standards is the change in inflation adjusted output per labor hour over time when we talk about productivity in terms of inflation adjusted or real output per labor hour it is easy to measure hours worked in an economy but trickier to measure output and inflation that brings us back to that apollo mission to the moon there is a common anecdote that your smartphone has more computing power than apollo 11 which took 3 men to the moon your iphone actually has thousands of times more processing power than the computer used to land that rocket fifty years ago the computing power used to handle the complex calculations that successfully completed that mission was wildly expensive by the end of the 1960s the u s was spending nearly 5 of gdp a figure close to 1 trillion in today s dollars on the space program think of that in terms of the deflationary impact of the price of computing power the magnitude is astounding and highlights how difficult it is to quality adjust prices as our consumption basket evolves in the inflation metric price deflators used to convert measurements of nominal output to real output reflect both easy to calculate price changes as well as difficult to estimate changes in the quality of the good or service for rapidly evolving technology we often see prices fall as quality improves that is very deflationary as the technology xlk sector has become a more dominant part of our economy this may be exacerbating problems with estimating inflation the five most valuable companies in the united states are microsoft msft apple aapl amazon amzn alphabet goog googl and facebook fb while these companies are extraordinarily valuable internet search e mail digital content digital applications and social networking are free to consumers think about the declining price of cloud computing and digital storage in terms of inflation as these companies have come to dominate industry do we really feel that their impact is being properly measured in economic growth internet search makes you more productive but did gdp figures capture that fact one of the mysteries of this record economic expansion is that wage growth has been stubbornly slow wage growth is inextricably tied to productivity growth which yellen deemed the most important factor to rising living standards economists have offered a myriad of explanations for why wage growth is sluggish they include but are not limited to extraordinary monetary policy redirecting cash from capital investment to financial assets corporations eschewing business investment for share buybacks as a shortcut to earnings growth lower new business formation and the rise of monopoly power in industries underinvestment in infrastructure from local state and federal governments former tax policy which penalized repatriating funds that could be used for domestic business investment less revolutionary new technologies we have all seen the stories that state that for most americans real income wage gains have not changed for decades even if purchasing power is unchanged for these households i do not know many people willing to change their consumption basket today for their consumption basket decades ago people are not trading in their smartphones for rotary phones or broadband for dial up buzz aldrin would not trade today s healthcare for 1960s healthcare even at inflation adjusted prices if inaccurate quality adjustments are leading to an understatement of real output then real economic growth has been higher than current figures suggest could it be that rapid quality improvements have led to overstated inflation and understated improvement in living standards stagnating median wages have bolstered populist candidates here and abroad as you marvel at the audacity of that moon mission 50 years ago i hope this is interesting food for thought over the weekend

looking at it from the outside the u s economy probably appears to be the picture of health a soaring stock market unemployment levels at historic lows and strong growth combine to create the impression of a global powerhouse our economy is the envy of the world president donald trump asserts perhaps the greatest economy we ve had in the history of our country that s why it may have felt odd to see federal reserve board chairman jerome powell confirm last week that the u s central bank will be lowering interest rates this year beginning as soon as the end of this month rate cuts of course are typically deployed when the fed wants to pump up a flagging economy global markets powell s two days of congressional testimony sent a thrill through global markets but the temporary elation of investors belies a number of pressing concerns about the u s and global economies that have the fed chair and his fellow policymakers very concerned these include but are not limited to the continued trade war between the u s and china the pronounced economic slowdown in china and a looming debt ceiling crisis in the u s the question casual observers were asking themselves last week was why would the central bank want to lower rates when the economy looks so strong part of the reason stems from what s known as the fed s dual mandate the central bank is charged with controlling inflation and keeping the economy as close to full employment as possible the latter goal is right now probably as close to being achieved as it is ever likely to be but the former has become a problem u s inflation rates have been lagging well behind the 2 per year rate that the fed believes is healthy in response to reporters questions friday federal reserve bank of chicago president charles evans echoed powell s suggestion that rates are coming down because inflation expectations seem to be below our 2 objective and it s been stubborn it tells me our current setting for policy is on the restrictive side he said like powell evans sits on the committee that makes decisions about u s interest rates trade war digging deeper into powell s remarks it wasn t hard to identify other economic concerns weighing on him as well as pressure from trump to lower interest rates the trump administration is still battling china over trade with punishing tit for tat tariffs in place that are driving up prices for u s consumers and driving down demand for some u s goods washington and beijing announced a truce of sorts last week and said more talks are being planned but negotiations between the two economic giants have so far failed to produce significant results the bottom line for me is the uncertainties around global growth and trade continue to weigh on the outlook powell told the house banking committee last week he said that the plan to resume talks is a constructive step but added it doesn t remove the uncertainty that we see as overall weighing on the outlook the trade war between the u s and china may have taken on even greater significance for the global economy with the revelation over the weekend that the chinese economy is now growing at the slowest pace it has seen in nearly 30 years china s economy growth estimates from the chinese communist party controlled government are typically viewed with some skepticism by trade economists but even those numbers signal bad news for china s massive economy in the second quarter it grew 6 2 far below the kind of numbers it was hitting just a few years ago there is also speculation that the second quarter figure was buoyed by a surge in government spending in the spring that won t be replicated in the second half of the year it s difficult to judge just how much of the slowdown in china is the result of the tariffs that the trump administration has imposed though there is evidence they have hit hard exports in june were down 1 3 year over year and imports fell by a surprising 7 3 in a report issued wednesday the international monetary fund estimated that the trade fight could cost the global economy 455 billion next year however there is also the possibility that the numbers reflect factors beyond the ongoing trade war including the possibility of a regional slump last week singapore reported an unexpected 3 4 annualized contraction in its second quarter gdp similarly south korea another regional economic dynamo reported a gdp contraction in the first quarter debt ceiling worries closer to home powell and his colleagues are also watching warily as congress allows the federal government to creep perilously close to its debt limit a cap on borrowing that can only be lifted through legislative action a fairly unique feature of u s fiscal policy the debt limit places a hard ceiling on the amount of debt the federal government can have outstanding ironically this means that as congress continues to pass budgets that spend more money than the government takes in from taxes fees and other sources lawmakers must periodically vote to allow federal agencies to spend the money that congress itself obligated them to spend battles over the debt ceiling are always worrying to the fed because they have the potential to result in a u s treasury debt default the fallout from such a scenario would not only be economically catastrophic powell warned its full effect would also be impossible to predict i wouldn t be able to capture the range of possible negative outcomes from that he told congress
asian stocks gained and the dollar sagged on friday after a top federal reserve official all but cemented expectations of a u s interest rate cut later this month new york fed president john williams said on thursday that policymakers need to add stimulus early to deal with too low inflation when interest rates are near zero and cannot wait for economic disaster to unfold in a speech read as a strong argument in favour of quick action the comments by williams made it a virtual certainty the fed would opt to cut interest rates by 25 basis points bps at its july 30 31 policy meeting and also fuelled expectations of an even deeper 50 bp reduction financial markets quickly reacted with futures at one point pricing in almost 70 percent chance of a 50 basis point cut at the month end meeting the odds eased to around 40 percent after the new york fed clarified later that williams speech was not about potential action at the upcoming policy meeting wall street shares shook off a sluggish start and moved higher overnight thanks to the dovish comments by williams australian stocks added 0 4 south korea s kospi rose 0 8 and japan s nikkei advanced 1 msci s broadest index of asia pacific shares outside japan was up 0 3 squaring the previous day s losses the index was up only 0 3 on the week as riskier assets were partly capped by u s president donald trump s reiteration of his threat to impose further duties on chinese imports the two sides resumed talks recently to try and end a year long trade war that has rattled financial markets and slowed global growth dovish fed policy expectations do provide support for the equity markets which are set to rebound after suffering losses the previous day but factors such as u s china trade issues and tensions over iran are likely to limit the markets gains said masahiro ichikawa senior strategist at sumitomo mitsui ds asset management the dollar index against a basket of six major currencies stood little changed at 96 778 after losing roughly 0 5 overnight to a two week low of 96 671 in the wake of comments from the fed s williams the greenback was up 0 15 to 107 460 yen after the new york fed tried to clarify williams earlier comments crawling away from a three week trough of 107 210 marked on thursday when the currency lost 0 6 against its japanese peer the euro was 0 1 lower at 1 1262 after climbing 0 45 the previous day u s treasury yields were lower across the board in light of williams dovish views the 2 year yield was at 1 7908 after touching a two week low of 1 7520 the 10 year yield declined to a 10 day trough of 2 023 and was last at 2 045 in commodities u s crude oil futures rose 1 to 55 90 per barrel after slumping 2 6 overnight oil prices had fallen on thursday amid expectations that crude output would rise in the gulf of mexico following last week s hurricane in the region spot gold extended the previous day s rally made on the prospects of lower u s interest rates and brushed a six year high of 1 452 60 an ounce before pulling back a touch to 1 442 25

asbury john c asbury president chief executive officer director thank you bill and thanks to all for joining us today and welcome to our first conference call as the newly rebranded atlantic union bankshares corporation atlantic union followed its good start to the year with a solid second quarter to start we completed a seamless core systems integration of access national corporation rebranded the bank to atlantic union bank on may 20th and rebranded our wealth management group to middleburg financial on the same day we launched zelle the person to person payment network received the most significant customer service award in the company s history by being named number one by j d power for retail banking customer satisfaction in the mid atlantic which they define notably as virginia to new york additionally we were just named for the second year in a row the forbes listed best in state banks we delivered strong loan growth for the quarter while deposits stayed steady and showed improvements in our operating profitability metrics from the prior quarter i won t take too much away from rob s commentary but for the quarter our operating roa was 1 35 up 4 basis points from last quarter operating return on tangible common equity was 16 58 which is a 21 basis point increase from the first quarter operating efficiency ratio was 52 46 which is a 164 basis point improvement from the prior quarter that s communicated previously we ve stepped up our financial targets they are as follows operating our way between 1 4 and 1 6 operating return on tangible common equity between 16 and 18 and an operating efficiency ratio at 50 or below just like in 2018 our financial results will remain noisy through the third quarter as we complete the integration of access national bank integration efforts continue to go well and provide another proof point of our core competency and whole bank integration loan growth was a solid 9 annualized for the quarter despite higher than normal levels of commercial real estate pay downs which have been a persistent trend over the past few quarters commercial and industrial line utilization during the quarter ticked up slightly to approximately 43 as a reminder the access acquisition closed on february 1st 2019 on a pro forma basis as if the access balances were included for the full year our year to date annualized loan growth is at 6 which is in line with our year to date expectations my pipelines are well balanced and remain strong based on everything we know at this time we continue to expect full year 2019 loan growth to be in the high single digit range of 7 to 9 i deposit growth did slow during the second quarter at about 1 annualized we had some seasonal reductions from some larger depositors that we expect will return on the second half of the year year to date deposit growth of 5 is close to matching our loan growth of 6 we continue to believe that we can deliver deposit growth in the upper single digit range for the full year and hope to match loan growth but not necessarily in every quarter i ll speak more on this in a moment turning to our 2019 priorities we continue to make progress against them as i ve said before setting goals tracking back to them and delivering results is fundamental to how we manage this company here are our previously communicated 2019 priorities to diversify loan portfolio and revenue streams we continue to diversify our loan book as evidenced by continuing growth in our commercial loan categories of c i and owner occupied real estate which now comprised one third of our total loan balances we re especially encouraged by the reception we re receiving in the marketplace with our commercial banking emphasis we did see an uptick in interest rate hedging fee income for the quarter as more clients opted to hedge interest rates taking advantage of current the current flat yield curve and a historically low rate environment interest rate hedging typically in the form of plain than ever swaps as an efficient risk management tool for certain clients and we re excited to be able to introduce these products to our new customers that have joined us from the former access national bank franchise in the greater washington region while it s hard to predict how the pace of hedging activity will go in the future we do expect our expanded franchise and the rate environment will continue to produce good results but not necessarily at the same level of this quarter we can compete against anyone in the small to mid market commercial space which covers approximately 99 of all virginia businesses as virginia s regional bank we continue to build on our reputation as a capable responsible our unique capable responsive local alternative to the super regional and national banks we can say with confidence that we are now firmly entrenched as virginia s bank the home team in virginia and we continue to learn how to leverage our home field advantage at the same time we are leveraging attractive incremental growth opportunities outside of our home state through our commercial banking offices in baltimore maryland and charlotte raleigh and greensboro north carolina we ve also never felt better about the fee income growth potential we have in our wealth management group given its expanded capabilities larger scale those combination with middleburg and the growing power of our banking franchise we believe that our wealth management platform can be an appealing offering to customers and a larger contributor to our non interest income going forward next is growing core funding a loan to deposit ratio was 97 6 a little over our long term goal of 95 as i mentioned in the past we ve increased our focus on deposit gathering we can start a competitive treasury management system and built our treasury management team we re excited about our ability to scale and replicate a number of business deposit gathering strategies learn from access especially in our metropolitan markets we re also optimistic about our ability to grow consumer banking deposit base at a faster pace than in the past given the new leadership and new strategies under way in the consumer banking group next it s managing the higher levels of performance as i noted the quarter was noisy with the system integration access from the rebranding cost but we continue to improve all of our operating profitability metrics from the first quarter we ve made progress toward hitting our top tier financial goals next strengthen our digital capabilities now that the access core systems conversion is behind us we intend to direct the freed up program management capacity against our digital strategy as mentioned we launched zelle at the end of the quarter which we consider an essential offering and our positioning as the clear alternative to the large national banks that dominate our markets we ve also now rolled out ncino to our teams which is a best in class end to end commercial banking loan origination system the benefits of ncino are that it reduces cycle time for credit requests by streamlining our credit underwriting processes while improving performance tracking and the control environment during the quarter we also brought on kelly dakin from santander is chief digital and customer experience officer and elevated her role to our executive leadership team kelly is well known to us having previously worked with atlantic union bank president maria tedesco and we re pleased that she chose to join our team atlantic union bank we believe digital is more than just a product but a way of doing business to create a true omni channel delivery system which is our intention we must ensure digital underpins all that we do having kelly in this newly expanded role enables us to integrate the customer experience with our digital strategy doing digital is an enabler of customer experience accelerates progress on our value proposition of making banking easier which is the next priority make banking easier this is both an internal rallying cry and ultimately our value proposition the initial thrust here will focus on the consumer banking transformation which is now moving beyond simply providing great service being nice and taking orders which have been hallmarks of our consumer banking effort the impressive consumer banking backgrounds and expertise of atlantic union bank president maria tedesco consumer banking group executive shawn o brien and head of digital strategy and customer experience kelly dakin give me great confidence that we have the right leadership in place to move this initiative forward we re now under way with the effort and currently focused on taking operational pass out of the branches so our consumer teammates have capacity and skill set to deliver a higher level of needs based relationship banking moving forward we intend to segment our branch network to ensure we are properly geared toward the opportunities in each trade area we ve also completed a review of our retail branch footprint and decided to close four branches in september as i mentioned before maria often notes how our consumer journey starts off in a much better place than past transformations she has led because a cultural drive to deliver a great customer experience already existed at atlantic union is proven by the accolades we receive in retail banking such as our number one ranking by j d power in the mid atlantic while we re proud of the numerous customer service awards we ve earned and continue to earn we need to do much more than simply provide a pleasant banking experience and we will and last integrate access national corporation the access integration continues to go well we ve had a smooth core systems integration over the weekend of may 18 having learned from the xenith integration the teams executed impressively having built a replicable process and change management framework we also layered at a bank name change on this process which added complexity to the effort for example we swapped out more than 400 signs changed innumerable documents and forms and executed a well designed advertising campaign to promote the new brand just to name a few things pulling off a rebranding of the bank in the middle of a systems integration was no small task but we did it and we did it well i m proud to say the rebranding has been undramatic well received across our markets and feedback has been universally complimentary of the new name logo and signage the new brand looks like us feels like us and it s authentic i m now touched on a few other topics from the quarter before turning it over to rob we do have a leadership change under way in our wealth management group which operates as middleburg financial a current leader has elected turned to his hometown of roanoke virginia and joined the team at dixon hubard feinour brown which is a registered investment advisor we acquired last year this both helps with their succession planning and provides an opportunity for us to conduct a nationwide search for a new leader for middleburg financial as with our past searches we ll look for a leader who s been there done that and is accustomed to dealing with more complexity and what faced here at atlantic union bank next i want to provide a quick update on the market opportunity we re seeing with the pending combination of bb t and suntrust we ve hired 21 people from those companies so far this year in a variety of roles anecdotally we re seeing traction in the marketplace for atlantic union is the alternative bank of choice as the not too large and not too small home team alternative we believe we re well positioned to take advantage of this disruption and we re not simply waiting on this to come our way we have an organized project team leading a multifaceted strategy focused on maximizing this opportunity we re likely to accelerate some investment in projects we had slated for 2020 into this year to expedite our positioning to capitalize on what we firmly believe will be a multi year disruption the single largest market share competitor operating in virginia with that said it s a good time for me to again comment on our current thinking regarding our geographic markets and expansion plans we believe that our platform irrefutably virginia s regional bank with the potential to become the mid atlantic s regional bank capable of competing successfully against the national and the super regional banks we believe we have the franchise right now needed to meet our objectives the embedded organic growth potential of atlantic union bank combined with the potential disruption caused by the bb t suntrust merger give us a unique opportunity on which we are laser focused further emboldening us is their home state virginia the commonwealth last week was recognized by cnbc and its annual ranking as the number one state in which to do business in the entire country this is the fourth time virginia achieved that status over the past decade or so while we can t predict what other opportunities may arise to build out our franchise our intentions at this time are to focus on organic growth close any remaining competitive gaps harness the power of this great franchise across our mid atlantic footprint build the bank one customer at a time and deliver on our promise of making banking easier finally credit quality remains strong the economy and our footprint is steady and we do not see evidence of systemic changes to our credit environment charge offs declined to 14 basis points annualized the majority of the charge offs continue to be in our third party consumer loan portfolio while this is a lucrative asset class force give its yield it s not a strategic focus area and it will be wound down over time while charge offs are typically lumpy quarter to quarter we continue to expect full year 2019 to look like 2017 and 2018 from a credit quality perspective barring some change in the macroeconomic environment i continue to believe that problem asset levels at atlantic union and across the industry for that matter remain below the long term trend line eventually we will see a return to more normalized credit losses but we still can t tell you when to expect that except to say we don t see it happening in 2019 in summary atlantic union has a solid 2019 under way we re making progress against our six strategic priorities with loan to deposit growth expected to reach high single digits for the full year we re excited to have come together as one team under the atlantic union bank brand i remain highly confident in what the future holds for us and the potential we have to deliver long term sustainable performance for our customers communities teammates and shareholders i ll close by reiterating atlantic union as uniquely valuable franchise it s dense and it s compact in great markets with a story unlike any other in our region we have assembled the right scale right markets and the right team to deliver high performance and a franchise that can no longer be replicated in virginia a combination with access national bank an attractive virginia economy and a home state that was just named the best state in which to do business incremental growth opportunities in our north carolina and maryland operations and what we believe will be a multi year disruption the two of our largest competitors cause us to believe we have everything we need right here and right now to accomplish our objectives organically i ll now turn the call over to rob to cover the financial results for the quarter robert m gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer well thank you john and good morning everyone thank you for joining us today i d like to take a few minutes to provide you with some details of atlantic unions financial results for the second quarter which we feel this illustrates the earnings potential of this franchise by as in the past quarter we do have some noise in the numbers so please note that for the most part my commentary will focus on atlantic union second quarter financial results on a non gaap operating basis which excludes 5 1 million in after tax merger related costs and 3 2 million in one time after tax rebranding costs it does however include losses from discontinued operations of 85 000 and approximately 950 000 in after tax expenses related to the company s decision to close four branches in the third quarter for clarity i will specify which metrics around a reported versus non gaap operating basis in the second quarter reported net income was 48 8 million in earnings per share were 0 59 up approximately 30 million or 0 12 per share from the first quarter reported return on equity was 7 86 reported return on assets was 1 15 and reported efficiency ratio was 62 43 and a non gaap operating basis which again as noted excludes 8 3 million in after tax related merger related and rebranding related costs consolidating net earnings for the second quarter were 57 1 million or 0 70 per share up from 50 5 million or 0 66 per share in the first quarter the non gaap operating return on tangible common equity was 16 58 which is an improvement of 21 basis points from 16 37 in the first quarter the non gaap operating return on assets was 1 35 that s up 4 basis points from 1 31 in the first quarter and the non gaap operating efficiency ratio improved by 164 basis points to 52 46 from 54 1 in the first quarter as john noted in his comments we expect further improvements to these financial metrics through this year and next with the addition of access as a reminder we remain committed to achieving top tier financial performance relative to our peers we are targeting an operating return on tangible common equity within a range of 16 to 18 an operating return on assets in the range of 1 4 to 1 6 and an operating efficiency ratio of 50 or lower as noted in the first quarter earnings call we expect to achieve these financial metric targets on a quarterly basis in the fourth quarter by 2019 on a full year basis in 2020 once we have fully integrated access and realize the strategic and financial benefits of the combination please note however achievement of these targets in the fourth quarter could be impacted by accelerated investments in project spending designed to expedite our ability to capitalize on the multi year disruption resulting from the suntrust bb t combination as john alluded to now turning to the major components of the income statement tax equivalent net interest income was 141 5 million that s up 11 million from the first quarter due to higher levels of average earning assets which was driven by organic loan growth and the full quarter impact of the access acquisition which closed on february 1st the current quarter s tax equivalent net interest margin was 3 78 a decline of 2 basis points from the previous quarter net accretion of purchase accounting adjustments for loans time deposits and long term debt added 21 basis points to the net interest margin in the second quarter and that s up from the first quarter 16 basis point impact primarily due to additional loan related accretion income the decrease in the tax equivalent net interest margin was driven by a two basis point increase in our cost of funds as earning asset yields held steady at 4 19 in the quarter the flat quarter to quarter earnings after a year was driven by one basis point increase in a loan portfolio yield which was offset by the 1 basis point negative margin impact as a result of the five basis point decline in the securities portfolio yield which was caused by the day count difference between quarters the one basis point quarterly net increase in the loan portfolio yield was comprised of additional loan accretion income of approximately 5 basis points which was partially offset by 4 basis points in lower loan yields driven by lower market interest rates in the quarter and lower loan fees the quarterly 2 basis point increase in the cost of funds to 114 basis points was primarily driven by higher deposit costs which increased 7 basis points from the first quarter to 93 basis points the increase in deposit costs was partially offset by lower wholesale borrowing rates and favorable changes in the overall funding mix between quarters provision for loan losses for the quarter was 5 9 million or 20 basis points on an annualized basis that s an increase of 1 9 million or 5 basis points from the first quarter the increase in the provision for loan losses from the previous quarter was primarily driven by loan growth for the second quarter of 2019 net charge offs were 4 3 million or 14 basis points on an annualized basis as compared to 4 2 million or 15 basis points for the prior quarter as in previous quarters the majority of charge offs came from the non relationship third party consumer loan portfolio which is being run off non interest income increased 5 6 million to 30 6 million for the second quarter from 24 9 million in the prior quarter the increase in non interest income was primarily driven by the full quarter impact of the access acquisition increased levels of loan related swap transaction fees resulting from the flat interest rate curve and seasonally stronger mortgage banking income as a reminder beginning in the third quarter debit card interchange revenue will be reduced by approximately 3 million per quarter as a result of complying with the durbin amendment excluding merger related cost rebranding cost and analyzation of intangible assets in the first and second quarters of 2019 respectively operating non interest expense increased 6 3 million or 7 5 to 90 3 million when compared to the prior quarter the increase in operating non interest expense was primarily due to the full quarter impact of the access acquisition in addition second quarter operating non interest expense included approximately 800 000 in oreo valuation adjustments driven by updated appraisals received during the quarter and 1 2 million in branch closure costs related to the decision to consolidate four branches in third quarter of 2019 we expect to incur 200 000 to 300 000 more in additional grants closing costs in the third quarter the four grants closures will result in an annual run rate expense savings of approximately 1 2 million beginning in the fourth quarter importantly we remain firmly on track to hit our 25 million access related merger cost savings target by the end of the third quarter as noted second quarter expenses also included 4 million of atlantic union rebranding related costs going forward we expect to incur up to 2 million in additional rebate branding expenses over the next quarter in addition to date we have capitalized cost of approximately 2 million related to the installation of new atlantic union bank signage across our footprint which will be depreciated over a five year period the effective tax rate for the second quarter was 16 compared to 14 9 in the first quarter the increase in the effective tax rate was principally due to lower merger related costs for the full year we now expect an effective tax rate in the range of 16 to 16 5 in 2019 now turning to the balance sheet period and total assets stood at 17 2 billion at june 30th an increase of 262 million from march 31 levels and that was driven by loan growth at quarter end loans held for investments were 12 2 billion an increase of 268 million or 9 on an annualized basis on a pro forma basis xenith the access acquisition it closed on january 1st instead of february 1st year to date loan balance has grew 6 on an annualized basis through june 30 looking for it as john has mentioned we continue to project upper single digit loan growth for 2019 with some seasonal variability between the quarter s at june 30th total deposits stood at 12 5 billion an increase of 26 2 million or 1 annualized from march 31 levels on a pro forma basis as if the access acquisition had closed on january 1st deposit balances increased approximately 5 annualized in the first six months of the year which is in line with our loan growth for the year to date growth deposit balance growth was driven by increases in demand deposits money market and time deposit balances and that was partially offset by declines in interest checking account balances turning to credit quality non performing assets total 34 million or 28 basis points as a percentage of total loans which is an increase of 1 8 million or 1 basis point from the prior quarter the allowance for loan losses increased 1 6 million from march 31 to 42 5 million the allowance as a percentage of the total loan portfolio increased 1 basis point to now at 35 basis points at quarter end from a shareholder stewardship and capital management perspective after the quarter ended we announce that the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 150 million worth of the company s common stock through june 30th of 2021 we are committed to managing our capital resources prudently as a deployment of capital for the enhancement of long term shareholder value remains one of our highest priorities so to summarize our second quarter operating results confirm the significant earnings capacity we envision as virginia s regional bank and the company continues to make progress toward strategic growth priorities the access merger systems integration work is now largely behind us and we are confident that we will achieve the strategic and financial benefits from the access combination finally please note that we remain focused on leveraging the atlantic union franchise to generate sustainable profitable growth and remain committed to achieving top tier financial performance in building long term value for our shareholders and with that i ll turn it back over to bill cimino to open it up for questions from our analyst community william p cimino vice president and director of investor relations thanks rob and now we have time for a few questions nicole do we have anybody questions and answers operator the first question comes from the line of catherine mealor catherine mealor keefe bruyette woods inc analyst thanks good morning robert m gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning catherine catherine mealor keefe bruyette woods inc analyst so both john and rob you mentioned accelerated investments and you think you ll have whether this year is there any way to quantify the dollar amount of what you re expecting those investments or maybe where you expect expenses to trend with that in mind robert m gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes catherine it s rob we ve got a number of initiatives under way we ve got a project team looking at all of the opportunities that this disruption may bring to us at this point in time we ve modeled we ve estimated that we could accelerate some investments in the 1 million to 2 million expense over the next two quarters so think about it is adding probably a million to quarter to third and fourth quarter normal operating run rate and so when you the operating run rate that we re looking for going into the third quarter excluding that was about 90 million so more like 91 million if we actually spend that money in third quarter and then it declines to about 89 million where you add back 1 million or so for these investments that are accelerated in the fourth quarter so call it anywhere from 89 million to 91 million in the next two quarters catherine mealor keefe bruyette woods inc analyst okay and is that including or excluding amortization of intangible robert m gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes good question yes that excludes the amortization i should say including that would be you know at the higher level at above 5 million to that those numbers catherine mealor keefe bruyette woods inc analyst okay great and then on the margin any outlook on how you feel like the margin may be impacted if rates are cut robert m gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so we have we run the models based on the interest rate curve we re seeing today which is much different than we talked about at the first quarter earnings call as you recall than we had assumed that there d be one fed funds rate cut in the fourth quarter and we were guiding to about two to three basis points of compression per quarter with the current outlook we have now is we expect the fed to cut at the end of this month at the end of september and then somewhat early in 2020 but for the next couple of quarters we are now instead of two to three core compression guidance we re talking we re in the four to five core margin compression going forward so it has put some more pressure on our nim guidance going forward good news there is we as you recall we have about call it 40 of our book is repricing with fed funds or loan book reprices with fed funds and one month libor is about 23 of our book in about 15 is fed funds so those will reprice fairly quickly with the fed funds exchange on the other side of the balance sheet we have about a million and a half 1 5 billion or so of deposits that are indexed to fed funds so there s some mitigation to that on the cost of funds side but we will continue to see more pressure on the margin that we had previously guided john c asbury president chief executive officer director and then bob if you want to just clarifying again model exactly in terms of net rate cuts robert m gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer so as i mentioned we have a fed cut now modeled in for the end of this month we have a fed cut modeled in at the end of the third quarter which will impact to fourth quarter and then going out to 2020 we expect there will be another one earlier in the year so we re going to see some pressure on the margin at least versus our previous guidance probably right through the first and second quarter of next year if that were to happen catherine mealor keefe bruyette woods inc analyst and then 4 bps to 5 bps of core compression that is in total or per quarter or per rate cut how should i think of it robert m gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer it s going to be in total not in total by quarter yes so some quarterly adjustment catherine mealor keefe bruyette woods inc analyst okay so assuming we have two which is could say about this year so assuming we have a cut in july then it kind of september you re thinking third and fourth quarter core margin basically down by 4 bps to 5 bps per quarter robert m gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah that will be right catherine mealor keefe bruyette woods inc analyst okay great robert m gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes we ll see what happens it s if the fed doesn t cut we re probably talking you know that would improve back to the a positive two three basis points off that four to five basis points we re still expecting to see some compression until we can rightsize our deposit rates based on the lower interest rate environment john c asbury president chief executive officer director for capital we feel like we ve got a very realistic outlook and we work from that and if it s better than that and that s good news catherine mealor keefe bruyette woods inc analyst that s good and then to your point is more near term so that doesn t really factor in significant repricing on the deposit it s quite yet robert m gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes that s right so we re going to be looking very hard at our deposit rates as you know over the past year rates have been going up and we ve been moving rates up we ve had promotional campaigns related to money market and cds we re currently those are under review going forward but there is a bit of a lag on some of those earlier campaigns because for instance money markets we had a six month promotional rate and then it would revert down to the normal wrapped money market rate so there is some of those higher cost deposits will reprice going into third and fourth quarter but you got to see a bit of a lag on that catherine mealor keefe bruyette woods inc analyst really helpful thank you john c asbury president chief executive officer director thanks catherine and nicole we re ready for our next caller please nicole do you know who the next caller is operator the next question is from the line of casey whitman john c asbury president chief executive officer director hi casey casey whitman sandler o neill analyst good morning just in terms of the buyback you recently announced can you give us any indication of how aggressive you plan to be with that and then could the buyback potentially provide some upside to the profitability targets that you ve laid out or perhaps speed up the timeline to get there or are you already sort of assuming some buybacks in there robert m gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah this could be a bit of upside casey from the buyback point of view although we have modeled some repurchases but really depends on how quickly we get the buyback done we re going to be fairly aggressive over the next three quarters in the buyback of course it all depends on where our stock price is what we typically look at is we have an intrinsic valuation model that we run which values what we feel the value of the company is and we look for a 15 plus percent return on investment so if the stock price runs up you re going to see less of a repurchase in terms of share buyback but if you stay if we re staying where we are we ll be pretty aggressive casey whitman sandler o neill analyst got it thanks and so really nice growth in c i particularly this quarter can you give us an idea of that mostly coming from the northern virginia market versus legacy markets and then i also wanted to ask just the 21 people you referenced hiring from bb t and suntrust is that was the already in the numbers this quarter or is that are those recent hires robert m gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah those hefty were they are in the quarter already they re in the numbers so those were hires already on the payroll i mean we re looking to do some more as we go forward casey whitman sandler o neill analyst and i ve been asked a ring to and that s pretty broad based i d say roughly half of those hires were in the commercial banking space all c i related most of the rest are going to be branch managers most typically and we had a few other supporting organizations interestingly about half and half bb t and suntrust favoring would you comment on what we re seeing in terms of our commercial industrial growth by market david v ring executive vp commercial banking group executive sure hi casey 60 of the growth came from the greater washington baltimore market which was part of the access market and the other part of that 60 came from our expansion in the carolinas so as you know we stood up the team in raleigh and we also stood up a team in greensboro recently and so our growth is going from the carolinas market and the other market so rest of 40 is really equally distributed between our central region our eastern region and our southwestern region robert m gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer so we saw growth across the board to your point dave led by greater washington area now access is doing well former access but we also where they are to is a reminder so the old iraq union terms today s commercial team as a part of this the baltimore loan production office so this is nice in terms of we keep pointing to incremental growth opportunities coming out of the north carolina operations maryland the greater washington is a tremendous economy as you well know our largest so we re feeling pretty good about it casey casey whitman sandler o neill analyst great thanks to my questions john c asbury president chief executive officer director thanks casey and nicole we are ready for our next caller please operator your next question is from the line of austin nicholas john c asbury president chief executive officer director hi austin austin nicholas stephens incorporated analyst hey guys good morning john c asbury president chief executive officer director good morning robert m gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning austin nicholas stephens incorporated analyst maybe just first back on the expense guidance i appreciate that the guidance that you provided to catherine but maybe could you just maybe just repeat that and then i guess my kind of follow on question is does that guidance include the 2 million in additional rebranding expenses that you guided to robert m gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so let me backtrack a bit so excluding any of the spending accelerated expanding related to the opportunity with suntrust and bb t we d be looking at about if you include the amortization expenses we re in the about the 93 million 94 million level for q3 and that declines to about 90 million in q4 which is pretty much what we had guided to in terms of run rate once we got all the cost saves from the access deal but for each of those if you had about 1 million 1 5 million i think in the third quarter and these numbers could move the very high level but we re thinking that we ve spent about a 1 million related to the opportunity with suntrust and bb t in the third quarter maybe another 1 million 1 5 million in the fourth quarter so call it you know add that to the numbers you know you re at 91 92 in the next third quarter and then call a 90 91 in the fourth quarter inclusive of that although add back the amortization you re in the 95 96 range i should say austin nicholas stephens incorporated analyst got it okay and then that includes the rebranding expenses as well within that guidance robert m gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes that s correct austin nicholas stephens incorporated analyst got it okay that s helpful and then on the maybe just on the fee income swap fees where we re obviously really strong this quarter any commentary on how you d expect those to trend throughout the year kind of based upon your current rate outlook john c asbury president chief executive officer director austin this is john i ll open this and then ask dave ring had a commercial to comment we ve been obviously talking about this quite quite frequently we think we certainly have several things have changed the franchise is larger we have more larger clients and we now have the opportunity to and have introduced this within the old access franchise so you couple that with more market opportunity plus a rate environment that is very favorable as it relates to interest rate hedging very flat yield curve meaning you don t have to pay out much to lock in longer term hedging historically low rates so that all favors it having said that i don t necessarily see us repeating what we saw in q2 dave ring what is your perspective david v ring executive vp commercial banking group executive we had a really strong q2 we part of it is from low hanging fruit existing portfolio that had an appetite for you know to fix their rates or but we would expect that just do what s right for the customer really and if it turns out that it works for the customer that some interest rate derivative makes sense or interest rate swap makes sense we ll do it so we ll probably return closer to levels that we ve done in the past and then in half of the year with the exception that access clients did not have the ability to do derivatives before so we re going to expose them to this over austin nicholas stephens incorporated analyst that s the great and then we don t know yet austin but for a sophisticated logic clients this is a very flexible attractive option and sort of the new offering there john c asbury president chief executive officer director our model is really to do what s right for the customer when it comes to this our bankers do not have swap goals you just want to focus on what s doing right austin nicholas stephens incorporated analyst got it okay john c asbury president chief executive officer director we are we will start in q3 i don t get into the details but we re still seeing a lot of momentum on it we think that it will continue austin nicholas stephens incorporated analyst okay that s really helpful and then maybe while we re talking about hedging and swaps i guess are there any is there anything layered on that in terms of an interest rate or fixed or floating swaps that the bank has has on that may come off in the next few quarters and then i guess beyond that is there any changes you re making to the overall asset sensitive position of the bank robert m gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah austin on that case we re not looking to unwind any swaps at this point we don t have a lot on our view borrowing base but in terms of yes we ll continue to look at opportunities going for we have pulled the trigger on a couple of things in the second quarter that will help our cost of funds mitigate the or reduce the cost of funds but we ll continue to evaluate that in the third and fourth quarters as we look at the outlook for rates but nothing right now planned in the numbers i shared with you austin nicholas stephens incorporated analyst got it thanks and then maybe just one last one any update on the progress on cecl and maybe when you d expect to kind of telegraph to the market your expectations for kind of the day one impact and kind of ongoing impact robert m gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so you know we continue to work on that we feel like we re in pretty good place regarding our understanding what the impacts going to be we re running continue to run our models we re actually validating our model with an outside third party and we re waiting to get the results of that back before we ll actually say anything publicly about it but again as we said last quarter you can expect to see that the allowance will increase at the very lease it will increase as a result of putting reserve on any of the purchase loans that we ve the loans that we purchased over the last two deals for xenith and access so it s going to be an increase we ll get into more specifics i think on the next call we ll feel more comfortable what the model is running the way we wanted to austin nicholas stephens incorporated analyst got it sounds good thanks for taking my questions guys john c asbury president chief executive officer director thanks austin robert m gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer and austin and thanks everyone for joining us today and we look forward to talking with you next quarter have a good day operator duration 45 minutes call participants william

the chance that britain will leave the european union without a deal is the highest since october 2017 economists polled by reuters say as arch brexiteer boris johnson looks set to take over as prime minister next week johnson was the face of the 2016 campaign to quit the eu and has said he would be willing to leave on oct 31 without a deal the median forecast of that happening was 30 per cent in the july 15 18 poll up from 25 per cent last month and 15 per cent in may the likelihood of a boris johnson premiership and the rhetoric which has surfaced during the campaign suggests that this outcome is more likely than we previously believed said peter dixon at commerzbank with jeremy hunt johnson s rival for the premiership also keen to display his credentials as a hard brexiteer sterling has plunged this week to lows not seen in over two years as investors price in the growing risk of a disorderly brexit lawmakers voted on thursday to make it harder for the next prime minister to try to force a no deal brexit giving some support to sterling and a strong majority of economists polled still think the two sides will eventually settle on a free trade deal as they have since late 2016 when reuters first started asking the question but in second place this month was the more extreme option of leaving without a deal and trading under world trade organization rules the third most likely outcome was the other compromise option of britain remaining a member of the european economic area paying into the eu budget to maintain access to the single market yet having no say over policy fourth place went to cancelling brexit hold it as the chance of a hard brexit has increased so has the likelihood of a recession the median forecast for one in the coming year was 30 per cent and of one in the next two years was 35 per cent up from 25 per cent and 30 per cent respectively in june s poll growth forecasts remained modest with the economy expected to expand 0 3 0 4 per cent per quarter through to the end of next year those forecasts were either left unchanged or lowered so what has shifted are expectations about what the bank of england will do with interest rates no change is now expected to the bank rate which has sat at 0 75 per cent for nearly a year until 2021 at the earliest in june s poll a 25 basis point hike was expected in the third quarter of next year while the uk consumer price inflation backdrop appears relatively benign the fact that wage growth is holding up suggests it s too early to be thinking about rate cuts said james smith at ing but the increasing uncertainty surrounding brexit suggests policy tightening is equally unlikely this year only 27 of 76 economists polled now expect an increase to bank rate before the end of next year compared to 36 of 69 last month on the flip side nine of 76 are expecting a cut by end 2020 compared to five of 69 in june the royal bank of canada a primary dealer of british government bonds changed its call earlier this month and said the boe would be forced to cut interest rates this year because of rising risks to britain from brexit and global trade tensions we don t necessarily share the view that the uk economy will see a substantial pick up in growth even in a smooth brexit rbc economists peter schaffrik and cathal kennedy said in a note to clients monetary policy committee member gertjan vlieghe said in a speech at thomson reuters last week that the bank might need to cut interest rates almost to zero after a no deal brexit that shift in sentiment echoes expectations for other major central banks the european central bank is likely to cut its deposit rate later this year and there are widespread expectations the united states federal reserve will cut at its meeting this month but unlike its peers the boe has less to worry about when focusing on its mandate for price stability the slump in sterling has driven up prices in import reliant britain and the economists who were polled expected inflation to hover around the bank s target for the next three years at least the poll found our morning update and evening update newsletters are written by globe editors giving you a concise summary of the day s most important headlines sign up today

offset by decreases of 36 0 million in certificates of deposit and 2 7 million in savings and club accounts the decrease in the company s certificates of deposit was related to reduced levels of listing service and brokered certificates of deposit which saw decreases of 17 3 million and 132 0 million respectively during the first six months of 2019 these decreases were primarily related to the decrease in loan funding requirements and allowed the company to reduce higher cost wholesale funding levels the company uses listing service and brokered certificates of deposit as additional

decreased by 235 000 or 15 0 percent to 1 3 million for the second quarter of 2019 from 1 6 million for the second quarter of 2018 the decrease in total non interest income was mainly related to lower

compared to 34 2 percent for the second quarter of 2018 the lower effective tax rate in the current period primarily attributable to an adjustment for the second quarter of 2018 related to an increase

is one difference now however almost every central bank in the world from the united states to ukraine is limbering up to cut rates so for once turkey won t stand out and on top of that u s president donald trump doesn t seem to be in any rush to sanction turkey for buying russia s s400 missile defence system but a week can prove a long time in politics graphic turkey has been flying since may

iran s ambassador to ireland masoud eslami has said that us sanctions on iran have affected the islamic republic in a similar way to the irish famine due to similarities in foreign intervention jubilant crowds sang and danced on iran s streets in 2015 as they marked a defining moment in the country s history they beeped horns and whooped from moving cars showcasing behaviour not usually accepted in the islamic republic it was a moment of national unity with the country celebrating iran signing a deal to curb its nuclear programme after years of international isolation and economic problems a diplomatic marathon resulted in the joint comprehensive plan of action or jcpoa which was signed by iran and china france germany russia the united kingdom and the united states to limit iran s nuclear activity in return for easing economic sanctions against iran in 2006 an international sanctions regime was imposed on the country following concerns of their nuclear programme today is an end and a beginning president hassan rouhani declared to the nation on national television and that s what happened iran enjoyed a moment of optimism after the sanctions were lifted fuelled by financial growth and foreign investment it only took four years a new us president and a continued culture of corruption for it all to come crumbling down on the campaign trial for office donald trump pledged to pull out of the deal with iran and he stuck by his word calling it one sided and horrible in may 2018 president trump withdrew from the accord and slapped iran with new sanctions the us commander in chief said the jcpoa did not do enough to curb iran s ballistic missiles programme or address its support for armed groups in the middle east the purchase and acquisition of us dollar bank notes trade of gold and metals the sale to iran of cars imports of carpets and caviar and the sale to iran of commercial passenger aircrafts were all restricted months later the oil and energy sector were also sanctioned along with shipping and financial institutions conducting transactions with the central bank of iran some international companies pulled out of iran out of fear of retaliation from the united states not only was the relationship between iran and the united states plunged into despair so did the iranian economy oil exports fell from 2 8m barrels a day in may 2018 to 1 3m this year it s also likely to fall further the international monetary fund said iran s inflation could reach 40 this year as the country continues to cope with the sanctions according to the imf and its estimates iran s economy shrank by 3 9 last year and is expected to further shrink by 6 this year us officials say that the sanctions have denied the iranian government over 10bn in oil revenue these sanctions have affected iran in a very similar way that the irish people have been affected by the famine which was imposed by foreign intervention iran s ambassador to ireland masoud eslami said those on the ground were clearly not happy with the developments in 2017 the nation was back on the streets with a different message compared to the one two years previously protests swept across iran and continued into 2018 with many frustrated by the government s economic policies however middle east expert azadeh moaveni said iran has been challenged for years and years and didn t have a strong economy to start with it was an economy that never really blossomed because of iran s political isolation and a big motivation of iran s agreement to the nuclear deal was the perceived economic benefit that would flow from it she said ms moaveni said iran is a country that had labour protests about unpaid salaries but things have got progressively worse with the us sanctions we need

wished to remain anonymous said that iranians are not dying of hunger but hardship doesn t have to be hunger general shift to lower quality of life and lower economic capability but of course probably the lower and middle class has been most affected by that he said farhad said prices have tripled since the sanctions but wages have stayed the same which has left people frustrated i got this mocha for 4 in four months time i come and pay for the same thing and it s says 12 so how would you feel he said a lot of families he said have had to scale back on some more expensive types of food such as meat he said when he is visiting iran he s noticed more beggars on the streets and the number of homeless have increased farhad said he feels the international community have started to isolate iran again even those iranians living abroad have problems in research projects some universities told iranian employees you are not allowed to give scientific presentations when you go to iran and you are not even allowed to have a skype conversation with anyone in iran he said it s also more difficult to go home with flights limited to iran from international hubs and the price has also doubled which means they can t visit as much according to farhad he said that it s not all on the us sanctions and the government could do a better job some sectors are suffering from corruption poor practices lack of organisation he said but acknowledged that similar practices happened in greece and italy no matter how good the government is there are some deep rooted issues that can t be addressed he said according to transparency international iran rates 138 out of 180 on their corruption perceptions index however he acknowledged that if the sanctions were lifted it would dramatically improve things and people s lives in iran for now people feel sad and sorry back home he said that sadness and frustration on the ground was heard by the iranian government and a year after the trump administration pulled out of the deal iran decided it had enough mr rouhani in may gave the remaining signatories an ultimatum protect us from us sanctions or we will breach the deal two months later time was up with no agreement and the islamic republic announced that it was breaching the nuclear pact under the pact iran is allowed to produce low enriched uranium at 3 67 and is not allowed stockpile no more than 300kg for research reactors they would need around 20 as much as 90 for weapons at the beginning of july iran breached that stockpile limit and now it is on course to make low enriched uranium up to 5 for what it says is to fuel a power plant it s a long cry from creating nuclear weapons but iran said it would keep reducing its commitments every 60 days unless they were protected from us sanctions iran has also been desperate to get the attention of world powers by pushing their buttons the united states is blaming iran for attacks on some oil tankers in the persian gulf this summer the us also announced efforts to create a military coalition to what they say is safeguard the waters around iran and yemen their relationship with the united kingdom is also strained after britain seized an iranian tanker off gibraltar which was allegedly carrying oil to syria in breach of sanctions iran appears to have made good on its threat to retaliate by attempting to halt a british oil tanker near a crucial waterway for international trade the strait of hormuz it leaves europe in a precarious position stuck between a rock and a hard place tehran and washington the iranian ambassador to ireland called on the irish government to intervene in the diplomatic row speaking to rté news ambassador masoud eslami said that ireland has the reputation and neutrality to initiate diplomatic initiatives to help deescalate tension in the region he also indicated that this could boost ireland s position in bidding for a united nations security council seat as the iranian ambassador thinks ireland can put pressure on others in europe he said he believes the nuclear deal is not dead with the country willing to go back to the negotiation table ms moaveni said the uk and france are trying to cool things down as europe stated the latest breaches of the 2015 nuclear were not significant clearly desperate to save the deal one of those who brokered the deal the eu s foreign policy chief federica mogherini invited iran to reverse the steps and go back to full compliance while the chances of the us going to war with iran is low the house of representatives passed an amendment that would restrict president donald trump s ability to attack the middle eastern country without congressional authorisation for now the door is still open for diplomacy who knows though for how much longer and what happens when iran s next 60 day deadline is up

extremely dovish fed comment from highly regarded federal reserve chair of new york john williams is driving the reversal of the us dollar after he spoke about an academic research report which swelled bets for a 50 bp rate cut in july and triggering liquidity inspired rally across global equity markets williams currently estimates neutral rates in u s around 0 5 our current estimates of r star in the united states are around half a per cent that s now lower than at any time before the great recession 2 we ve seen similar declines in r star in other advanced economies including in japan and the euro area in summary the paper suggests the current fed funds rate is 200 bp above the long run neutral interest rate but more importantly it supports the markets dovish view and would imply that the 100bp of cuts priced into 2020 or 75bp for 2019 and even then it implies that policy isn t overly loose but merely contractionary even in the context of an academic report it does provide a glimpse into the fed thinking and even more poignant is the fact a moderate fed voter presented the research paper asia markets are trading well this morning revelling in the best of both worlds indeed nothing rings the rally bell louder for asia investors than lower u s interest rates and a weaker dollar but today s equity rally will fall well short of liquidity induced frenzy after the market realised fed williams was not talking about fed policy but rather presenting an academic paper especially with the us administration in the market ear reminding everyone that nothing constructive is developing on the trade war front oil markets price action speaks louder than words as consumption and growth data continued to dampen prices even in the face of a deluge of central bank easing it s not central bank liquidity that oil markets need but global economic growth all the money in the world isn t going to alleviate the fact markets are mired in a trade war induced global economic slump that is factoring in both consumer and industrial consumption metrics and with us china marking little progress on a trade deal its more likely consumption metrics will worsen before improving anytime soon you know things are dire when central bank sugar coating fails to get a rise and weaker consumption metrics completely blot out middle east oil supply risk premiums iranian television announced the country seized a foreign oil tanker over the weekend and late in the session the u s president announced the u s military had shot down an iranian drone that had moved close to a u s warship in the persian gulf oil prices moved a little higher after the drone news but notably prices still fell 2 6 from wednesday gold besides the uber dovish lean from fed williams academic report he presented overnight there are logical but some equally sinister forces working in gold favour this morning logical central banks around the world are clambering to ease monetary policy triggering more and more hawks fly the coop which is a considerable boost for gold price the federal reserve looks primed to deliver on the market wishes of 75 basis points in cuts for 2019 while not ruling out a policy bazooka 50 bp cut in july as fed speakers one by one stick to the script unwavering from the current dovish guidance the dalio effect and a herd mentality have boosted demand after the market was caught by surprise regarding his paradigm shift article on linkedin that suggests the famous hedge fund manager is hedging risk in low rate environment through gold indeed music to gold investor s ears sinister treasury secretary mnuchin suggested that the u s administration is not for now shifting to a weaker usd policy which doesn t exactly rule out usd dollar currency intervention at some point which returns focus to the trump factor whose policies are motivated more by domestic politics than economic realities if the president weaponised trade to get his way with mexico who s to say he won t weaponise the dollar to get back at europe but in no uncertain terms while sending a warning shot across the eurozone bow mnuchin reminded the world that the u s is prepared to weaponise the dollar if anyone sidesteps u s oil sanction on iran if you want to participate in the dollar system you abide by u s sanctions mr mnuchin said after discussing iran and other issues with his french counterpart bruno le maire on the sidelines of a g7 financial meeting in france f t

investors a recent feature at the anti fossil fuel desmog blog reported the stunning admission of a former shale ceo that fracking was a fool s errand for industry the shale gas revolution has frankly been an unmitigated disaster for any buy and hold investor in the shale gas industry with very few limited exceptions stated steve schlotterbeck formerly of eqt in fact i m not aware of another case of a disruptive technological change that has done so much harm to the industry that created the change he closed the technological advancements developed by the industry have been the weapon of its own suicide suicide as in the end of the supply driven boom is a large drop off ahead for today s u s record oil production of peak oil peak gas not schlotterbeck s lament is old song latest verse

interest rates there is some truth to mclean s analysis although her conclusion is very overstated undoubtedly the federal reserve s expansionary monetary policy in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis provided more capital than a free market monetary regime would have resulting in more oil and gas drilling and debt than otherwise would have been the case to this extent a buyers market was falsely incentivized leading to producer distress per schlotterbeck still there is the entrepreneurial error of focusing too much on supply and not on lower prices from that supply examples abound of
