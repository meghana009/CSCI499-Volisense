overview with many centers closed for the extended holiday the calm in the global capital markets has been punctuated by reports that the us is considering ending its exemption for eight countries to have bought iranian oil over the past six months the waivers were to end on may 2 but previously it was thought that a couple of waivers like for china and india would be extended oil prices have surged to new six month highs asian equities were mixed with losses in china india and indonesia and gains in japan korea and taiwan most european centers are closed the s p 500 is trading 0 3 lower after alternating last week between gains and losses benchmark bond yields were higher in asia with china s 10 year edging above 3 40 for the first time since the middle of last november european stock and bond markets are closed the us 10 year tested the 2 60 level last week and backed off the us dollar is narrowly mixed against the majors the canadian dollar and the norwegian krone are the strongest in an apparent oil play the euro sterling and yen are practically unchanged the liquid accessible emerging market currencies like the south african rand turkish lira and mexican peso are nursing losses the russian rouble is an exception and that too seems driven by the jump in oil prices asia pacific three japanese meetings this week will command attention the bank of japan meets a bloomberg poll found 45 of 48 surveyed do not expect a change in stance many do expect the boj to downgrade production and export components of its economic assessment bloomberg surveys found an increase in those economists that expect the next move to be easing policy a year ago less than one in five expected the boj to ease further note that before the weekend and before the 10 day holiday beginning at the end of this week the boj surprised the market by announcing a reduction in its long duration bond buying 10 years and beyond our concern is not immediate but later in the year japan faces disinflation pressure from initiative to make young children s education free and cuts in mobile phone service fees coupled with the retail sales tax increase oct 1 the other two meetings this week are prime minister abe s visit to europe and the us recall japan and europe s trade agreement went into effect feb 1 japan and us trade talks are just beginning abe is perceived to be trying to ingratiate himself with the mercurial american president and many note that his visit to the us at the end of the week also coincides with the first lady s birthday trump and abe will likely be meeting three times in as many months after meeting his week trump will visit tokyo next month and maybe the first foreign leader to meet the new emperor in june trump will return to japan osaka to attend the g20 meeting the high level meetings are hoped to facilitate the first part of a two part trade agreement japan s recent trade agreements tpp and with europe have left us producers at a self imposed disadvantage with will be remedied in the first part and then protracted negotiations over reducing japan s roughly 60 bln a year trade surplus with the us the dollar is confined to less than a 15 tick range below jpy112 00 today there is an option there that expires today for about 915 mln last week the dollar was confined to a jpy111 77 to jpy112 17 range according to bloomberg one of its tightest weekly ranges in years the australian dollar is in a quarter cent range but this is sufficient to trade on both sides of its pre weekend range the technical importance of the outside day lies with the close a close below the previous session low 0 7145 would be more negative nearby support is seen in the 0 7100 0 7110 area europe most centers are closed today the economic calendar is light this week following the disappointing flash pmi last week this week s economic feature is the german ifo in the middle of the week sweden s riksbank meets on april 25 no change is expected in its minus 25 bp repo rate and minus 100 bp deposit rate last week sweden reported an unexpected jump in march unemployment 7 1 vs 6 6 which reinforced the standpat outlook politics takes center stage spain s elections are on april 28 it is the third election in four years the critical issue has shifted from the push back against austerity to the catalan separatism the polls suggest the governing socialists may emerge as the largest party but may find it difficult to cobble together a center left coalition the center right appears equally challenged spanish asset markets have taken the political uncertainty in stride spanish bonds have outperformed italian bond though arguably this may say more about italy than spain spanish bonds have outperformed german bunds over the past month by easing half a basis point compared to the three basis point increase in germany with parliament s holiday break ending brexit returns the center ring the key development to note today is that the chair of the 1922 committee of backbenchers reportedly informed prime minister may that she either resigns by the end of june or the party will change the rules to allow it to try to force her out recall that she survived a previous party leadership challenge this will likely encourage may to double her efforts to seek a deal with labour which is the direction of a softer exit which at least until recently was seen as sterling positive sterling finished the last two sessions below 1 30 for the first time in two months it is confined to less than a fifth of a cent and has seen offers in the 1 30 area the euro has held below 1 1250 but has not been below 1 1235 either while there are no large options near the money that are set expire today there is a 1 8 bln euro option at 1 1250 that will be cut tomorrow which is also where the 20 day moving average is found additional resistance is pegged in the 1 1265 1 1275 area on the downside we note that dips below 1 12 have been bought america the economic highlight of the week comes ahead of the weekend in the form of the first look at q1 us gdp it looked dismal at the start of the quarter with the shock from the q4 equity meltdown the government shutdown and the bitterly cold weather however the economy gradually found better traction and most expect growth to be above what the fed regards as the long term average 1 8 today s data consists of the chicago fed s national economic index it is not the stuff the typically moves the market but it is expected to be consistent with the economic narrative of the us economy getting better traction the us also reports existing home sales for march after a nearly 12 surge in february some pullback is nearly inevitable the jump in february took it from a 3 5 year low to an almost one year high in terms of units the 12 month average is 5 29 mln and the 24 month average is 5 41 mln march is expected at 5 30 mln according to the median forecast in the bloomberg survey us earnings season focus shifts from the banks where retail did well to technology this week amazon facebook twitter and microsoft are among the highlights boeing also reports many economists expect boeing s woes to shave q2 gdp by 0 2 0 3 separately note that many large european banks will also report this week the bank of canada meets tomorrow there is no reason to expect a change in policy or the 1 75 overnight interest rate the weakness of non oil exports remains problematic but the labor market and consumption retail sales seem strong enough to keep in check concerns about the impact of housing prices meanwhile with the us no showing any indication of lifting the steel and aluminum tariffs canada remains unlikely to take up the new trade deal with the us and mexico next month is seen to be the last opportunity until after the october election which then may run into us political issue ahead of the 2020 election the us dollar closed last week knocking on cad1 34 which it has not closed above since late march it is testing the 20 day moving average a little below cad1 3360 the last time the dollar closed below cad1 33 was the end of february the challenge is that the tactics that allow one to make money in the range leave one vulnerable to a real breakout the dollar index is consolidating the gains it scored in the wake of the divergent news of disappointing emu and japan flash pmi and a jump in us retail sales it tested the 97 50 area on april 18 and has drifted lower june crude oil wti is pushing through the 65 cap of recent weeks to approach 66 a barrel we have been suggesting a 67 68 technical target since late january many are now talking about 70 if the us does eliminate the waivers around 1 1 mln barrels a day of iranian oil is at risk china and india may protest it may encourage more talk in europe about the need for another payment system outside of swift which is headquartered in europe recall that last year the us forced the bundesbank to block a large cash transfer from an iranian owned bank in hamburg to tehran europe chaffs under what it sees as extraterritoriality it will be another issue that and turkey s interest diverge
use the lexology getting the deal through tool to compare the answers in this article with those from other jurisdictions mining industry standing what is the nature and importance of the mining industry in your country the mining industry has historically been a key driver of the south african economy economic activity in modern day south africa has been centred on mining activities their ancillary services and supplies the country s stock exchange in johannesburg was established in 1887 a decade after the first diamonds were discovered on the banks of the orange river and almost simultaneously with the gold rush on the world famous witwatersrand today the south african mining sector employs approximately 490 000 workers 5 per cent of the south african workforce and contributes to roughly 8 per cent of the country s gross domestic product unsurprisingly the country s mineral wealth is a valuable source of foreign direct investment in spite of prevailing regulatory uncertainty the mining industry remains a key focus point of the government and the private sector and continued efforts are being made to engage foreign investors to stimulate further growth target minerals what are the target minerals south africa has the world s largest resources of platinum group metals manganese chromium gold and alumino silicates the country accounts for over 40 per cent of the global production of ferro chromium platinum group metals vanadium and alumino silicates exports and is one of the world s largest exporters of platinum group metals gold and vanadium in addition south africa has large deposits of copper zinc iron coal and diamonds while south africa is not endowed with any significant lithium deposits it has approximately 80 per cent of the world s high grade manganese ore reserves manganese which is primarily used in steel production is also a key element in the production of lithium ion batteries increased global demand for manganese resulted in a 32 per cent year on year increase in manganese production in south africa in 2017 regions which regions are most active various underground geological formations are found in south africa these formations span across the country and as a consequence mining activities occur in most of its provinces some significant examples of these geological formations include the witwatersrand basin gold uranium silver pyrite and osmiridium deposits the bushveld complex platinum group metals and associated copper nickel cobalt chromium and vanadium bearing titanium iron ore deposits the transvaal supergroup manganese and iron ore deposits the karoo basin bituminous coal and anthracite deposits and the phalaborwa igneous complex copper phosphate titanium vermiculite feldspar and zirconium deposits legal and regulatory structure basis of legal system is the legal system civil or common law based south africa has a mixed legal system its doctrines and concepts are influenced both by the civilian tradition in an uncodified roman dutch form brought by early dutch settlers and by the common law tradition introduced during the british colonial period the mineral resources sector is primarily regulated by statute and in terms of the mineral and petroleum resources development act 28 of 2002 mprda the common law will apply to the extent that the mprda does not regulate a specific issue but the provisions of the mprda will prevail to the extent of any inconsistency regulation how is the mining industry regulated the mining industry is regulated at national level by the department of mineral resources dmr which through its regional offices implements and administers the mprda what are the principal laws that regulate the mining industry what are the principal regulatory bodies that administer those laws were there any major amendments in the past year the mining industry is primarily regulated under the mprda there are currently amendments proposed to the mprda under the mprda amendment bill 2013 which have at the date of publication not yet been passed into law black economic empowerment in the mining industry is currently regulated under the broad based socio economic empowerment charter for the south african mining and minerals industry 2010 the mining charter 2010 the reviewed broad based black economic empowerment charter for the south african mining industry the reviewed mining charter which replaces the mining charter 2010 in its entirety was published on 15 june 2017 however the implementation of the reviewed mining charter was suspended and is currently being renegotiated following intervention by the newly elected president cyril ramaphosa a revised version of the reviewed mining charter is expected to be published towards the latter half of the year the dmr through its national and regional offices is the executive body primarily tasked with regulating the mining industry other statutes relevant to the mining industry include the national environmental management act 1998 nema the specific environmental management acts which were promulgated to operate in conjunction with nema and regulate matters such as waste biodiversity protected areas and air quality the national water act 1998 the labour relations act 1995 and the mine health and safety act 1996 classification system what classification system does the mining industry use for reporting mineral resources and mineral reserves the south african code for the reporting of exploration results mineral resources and mineral reserves samrec is used by the south african mining industry for reporting mineral resources and mineral reserves the first revision of samrec was published in 2000 and was incorporated into the listings requirements of the johannesburg securities exchange jse a second edition of samrec was published in 2007 and amended in 2009 these previous editions have now been superseded by the current version of samrec samrec 2016 which became mandatory with effect from 1 january 2017 samrec stipulates minimum standards for the reporting of exploration results mineral resources and mineral reserves however it does not specify the technical details relating to exploration results mineral resource and mineral reserves the interpretation of technical and geological data can be open to interpretation and may have an impact on project design and financial modelling samrec provides guidelines on the interpretation and reporting of technical and geological data in order to ensure consistency samrec requires that mineral resources are classified and must be reported in order of increasing confidence in respect of geoscientific evidence into inferred indicated or measured categories any mineralisation that does not have demonstrated reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction may not be included in a mineral resource mining rights and title state control over mining rights to what extent does the state control mining rights in your jurisdiction can those rights be granted to private parties and to what extent will they have title to minerals in the ground are there large areas where the mining rights are held privately or which belong to the owner of the surface rights is there a separate legal regime or process for third parties to obtain mining rights in those areas the state is the custodian of south africa s mineral and petroleum resources and has a duty to administer these resources for the benefit of all south africans as a consequence an owner of the surface rights has no claim to the minerals found in on or under the surface of his or her land any person including the owner of the surface rights who wishes to exploit mineral resources in south africa is required to first apply for and obtain the appropriate right under the mprda the minister of mineral resources is authorised to grant or refuse applications for rights under the mprda provided that an applicant meets all the requirements relating to the right for which the applicant has applied the minister is obliged to grant the right publicly available information and data what information and data are publicly available to private parties that wish to engage in exploration and other mining activities is there an agency which collects mineral assessment reports from private parties must private parties file mineral assessment reports does the agency or the government conduct geoscience surveys which become part of the database is the database available online all rights granted in terms of the mprda are required to be registered in the mineral and petroleum titles registration office mptro members of the public do not have an automatic right of access to these records but can subject to the permission of the director general of mineral resources gain access to these records the application process is regulated under the promotion of access to information act 2000 applications for prospecting and mining rights are generally lodged through the dmr s online application portal samrad although only limited information is available via samrad it will inform prospective applicants whether there are existing rights over the areas concerned the holders of prospecting rights are required to submit progress reports and data relating to their prospecting operations to the dmr and the south african council for geoscience cgs no person may dispose of or destroy any record borehole core data or core log data except in accordance with the written direction of the dmr in consultation with the cgs these records are not generally accessible to the public the cgs is a public entity and was established under the geo science act 1993 it was created to develop and publish world class geoscience knowledge products and to render geoscience related services to the south african public and industry if a prospective applicant for a prospecting or mining right requires information on south africa s mineral resources such information is available from the cgs this information includes data received from mining companies universities and research institutions worldwide it maintains several mineral databases some of which are accessible at its library such as the coredata and coal databases acquisition of rights by private parties what mining rights may private parties acquire how are these acquired what obligations does the rights holder have if exploration or reconnaissance licences are granted does such tenure give the holder an automatic or preferential right to acquire a mining licence what are the requirements to convert to a mining licence under the mprda any person natural or juristic foreign or local may apply for and be granted a prospecting right a mining right a retention permit or a mining permit a prospecting right entitles the holder to the exclusive right to prospect for prescribed minerals over a prescribed area of land the holder of a prospecting right also has the exclusive right to apply for and be granted a mining right in relation to the minerals and land to which the prospecting right relates the holder of a prospecting right must lodge such right for registration at the mptro within 60 days after the right has become effective commence with prospecting activities within 120 days from the date on which the prospecting right becomes effective continuously and actively conduct prospecting operations in accordance with the prospecting work programme comply with the terms and conditions of the prospecting right relevant provisions of the mprda and any other relevant law comply with the conditions of the environmental authorisation pay the prescribed prospecting fees to the state pay royalties to the state in respect of any minerals removed and disposed of and submit progress reports and data of prospecting operations to the dmr and cgs a mining right entitles the holder to the exclusive right to mine for prescribed minerals over a prescribed area of land the holder of a mining right must lodge such right for registration at the mptro within 60 days after the right has become effective commence with mining operations within one year from the date on which the mining right becomes effective actively conduct mining operations in accordance with the mining work programme comply with the terms and conditions of the mining right relevant provisions of the mprda and any other relevant law comply with the conditions of the environmental authorisation comply with the requirements of the prescribed social and labour plan pay royalties to the state and submit the prescribed annual report detailed the extent of the holders compliance with the mining charter 2010 and the social and labour plan a mining permit entitles the holder to the exclusive right to mine for prescribed minerals over a prescribed area of land a mining permit relates to small scale mining operations and will only be granted if the mineral in question can be mined optimally within a period of two years and the mining area in question does not exceed five hectares in extent the requirements and obligations imposed on a holder of a mining permit are less onerous than those imposed on the holder of a mining right a retention permit may be granted under certain limited circumstances the effect of which is to suspend the term of the prospecting right for the duration of the retention permit currently applications for these rights are considered on a first come first served basis however if the mprda amendment bill 2013 is passed in its current form the application process may be changed to a dual process where applications will be considered both in terms of a first come first served basis as well as a competitive bidding process renewal and transfer of mineral licences what is the regime for the renewal and transfer of mineral licences the holder of a prospecting right mining right retention permit or mining permit has subject to complying with certain requirements set out in the mprda the exclusive right to apply for and be granted the renewal of such right in relation to the same mineral and same area of land once for a period not exceeding three years for a prospecting right for further periods each of which may not exceed 30 years for a mining right for three periods each of which many not exceed one year for a mining permit and once for a period not exceeding two years for a retention permit the minister has no discretion in relation to applications for renewals if the applicants have complied with the requirements set out in the mprda the minister s prior written consent is required for a transfer of a prospecting or mining right by holder to a third party and the transfer of a controlling interest both a direct and indirect interest in a company that holds a mining or prospecting right the transfer of any interest in a company listed on a recognised stock exchange is exempt from having to obtain the minister s consent the minister s consent must be granted if the cessionary transferee lessee sub lessee or assignee is capable of carrying out and complying with the obligations and the terms and conditions of the right in question and satisfies the requirements for the initial granting of such right a mining permit and a retention permit are not capable of being transferred to a third party duration of mining rights what is the typical duration of mining rights a prospecting right may be granted for an initial period of up to five years and a mining right may be granted for an initial period of up to 30 years these rights may be renewed on terms and in accordance with the procedures discussed above the minister may subject to affording the holder of a right an opportunity to remedy any contravention cancel or suspend a right permission or permit if the holder is conducting prospecting or mining operations in contravention of the mprda breaches any term or condition of such right permit or permission is contravening any condition in the environmental authorisation or has submitted inaccurate false fraudulent incorrect or misleading information for the purposes of the application or in connection with any matter required to be submitted under the mprda acquisition by domestic parties versus acquisition by foreign parties is there any distinction in law or practice between the mining rights that may be acquired by domestic parties and those that may be acquired by foreign parties the mprda does not draw a distinction between local and foreign applicants irrespective of the nationality of the applicant all applicants for mining rights are required to comply with the requirements of the mprda which include compliance with the mining charter 2010 in terms of the mining charter 2010 all mining companies ie companies that hold mining rights granted in terms of the mprda were required to reach a minimum historically disadvantaged south african hdsa ownership of 26 per cent by 31 december 2014 once promulgated the revised version of the reviewed mining charter will set new requirements for hdsa participation going forward protection of mining rights how are mining rights protected are foreign arbitration awards in respect of domestic mining disputes freely enforceable in your jurisdiction prospecting and mining rights vest a limited real right in the holder of the right in respect of the minerals to which the rights pertain and the land to which such right relates in accordance with the constitution of south africa holders of ownership rights may not be arbitrarily deprived of their rights and no person may unlawfully interfere with any entitlement that the rights holders may have in terms of the rights there have been a number of recent judgments in the mining sector in which the courts have found against the state and which evidence the independence of the judiciary and its ability to uphold the rule of law south africa is also a signatory to the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards also known as the new york convention and as a consequence foreign arbitral awards are capable of being enforced through the south african courts surface rights what types of surface rights may mining rights holders request and acquire how are these rights acquired can surface rights holders oppose these requests in terms of the mprda the holder of a mining or prospecting right obtains a statutory right of access to land the holder of a prospecting or mining right may enter the land to which such right relates together with his or her employees and bring onto that land any plant machinery or equipment and build construct or lay down any surface underground or under sea infrastructure that may be required for the purpose of mining both the holder of the prospecting or mining right and the owner of the surface rights must exercise their rights with due regard for the rights and entitlements of the other party the owner of the surface rights may not unlawfully refuse the holder of the prospecting or mining right access to the property or interfere with the holder s ability to carry on the prospecting or mining activity on the land despite the mining or prospecting rights holder s statutory right of access to the property it is common although not a legal requirement for mining companies to enter into access and compensation agreements with land owners the reason for this is to mitigate the potential for disputes and disruptions to mining operations particularly in circumstances where the land is owned or occupied by rural communities participation of government and state agencies does the government or do state agencies have the right to participate in mining projects is there a local listing requirement for the project company there is no legal requirement for the state to participate in any mining projects nor are there any local listing requirements for mining companies the african exploration mining and finance corporation is a state owned mining company that has acquired its own portfolio of rights in terms of the mprda and is currently seeking to play a more active role in the industry government expropriation of licences are there provisions in law dealing with government expropriation of licences what are the compensation provisions section 25 of the constitution expressly provides that no one may be deprived of their property including the expropriation of a limited real right except in terms of a law of general application for a public purpose or in the public interest if the rights holder is deprived of its property the constitution further provides that such a rights holder is entitled to compensation the amount of compensation to be paid and the time and manner of payment is subject to what the rights holder and state agree to or what is determined by court the amount of the compensation and the time and manner of payment must be just and equitable reflecting an equitable balance between the public interest and the interests of those affected having regard to all relevant circumstances protected areas are any areas designated as protected areas within your jurisdiction and which are off limits or specially regulated under the mprda no prospecting right mining right may be granted or mining permit be issued in respect of land comprising a residential area any public road railway or cemetery any land being used for public or government purposes or reserved in terms of any other law or areas identified by the minister because of national interest the strategic nature of the mineral in question and the need to promote the sustainable development of the nation s mineral resources in addition section 48 of the national environmental management protected areas act 2003 nemwa specifically prohibits prospecting mining exploration production or related activities in special nature reserves national parks or nature reserves areas declared as protected environments lake areas world heritage sites marine protected areas and specially protected forest areas forest nature reserves and forest wilderness areas declared in terms of the national forests act 1998 duties royalties and taxes duties royalties and taxes payable by private parties what duties royalties and taxes are payable by private parties carrying on mining activities are these revenue based or profit based the mineral and petroleum resources royalty act 28 of 2008 royalty act sets out the revenue based royalties payable on mineral resources that are extracted within south africa and transferred the royalty act differentiates between refined and unrefined mineral resources the mining royalty percentage is capped at 5 per cent for refined mineral resources and 7 per cent for unrefined mineral resources the royalty act uses two variables to calculate the royalty liability the value of the minerals and the royalty percentage rate which is applied to the base in addition to the payment of royalties mining companies may also be subject to income tax capital gains tax withholding tax transaction taxes such as vat transfer duty and securities transfer tax tax advantages and incentives what tax advantages and incentives are available to private parties carrying on mining activities gold mining companies are taxed in terms of a formula that by and large takes into account the profitability of the company and provides relief in cases where margins are below 5 per cent often referred to as the tax tunnel the gold mining formula was introduced to encourage gold mining investment and the mining of marginal ore deposits mining companies mining for minerals other than gold are taxed at the standard corporate tax rates tax stablisation does any legislation provide for tax stabilisation or are there tax stabilisation agreements in force the royalty act provides that the minister of finance may enter into binding fiscal stability agreements relating to mineral resource rights or in anticipation of such rights guaranteeing the terms and conditions in respect of these rights apply for as long as the extractor holds the rights carried interest is the government entitled to a carried interest or a free carried interest in mining projects the mprda makes no provision that entitles the government to a carried interest or free carried interest in mining projects transfer taxes and capital gains are there any transfer taxes or capital gains imposed regarding the transfer of licences in terms of capital gains the income tax act provides for capital gains tax cgt on any taxable capital gains in the taxable income of any person in calculating the taxable income a mine is entitled to claim expenditure against its mining income previously the disposal of certain assets was exempt for income tax purposes as it was regarded capital in nature the position has now shifted and the disposal of specific mining related assets eg land surface rights assets that qualify for wear and tear mineral rights prospecting rights and intellectual property rights etc will now be taxable in terms of the new cgt legislation distinction between domestic parties and foreign parties is there any distinction between the duties royalties and taxes payable by domestic parties and those payable by foreign parties resident companies in south africa are taxed based on their world wide income and non residents are taxed on south african sourced income subject to any applicable double taxation agreements that may be in force non residents are in addition subject to the cgt legislation as detailed above foreign companies that conduct business in south africa through a branch must also be registered as taxpayers and they are taxed at the standard corporate tax rate of 28 per cent business structures principal business structures what are the principal business structures used by private parties carrying on mining activities mining activities in south africa are principally conducted using public or private limited liability companies a private company may be incorporated by one person and generally needs only have one director a public company may also be incorporated by one person but generally requires at least three directors the essential difference between a public and private company is that the shares of a public company are freely transferable while the constitutional document of a private company must limit the transferability of the company s shares there is no requirement that the shareholder or directors of south african companies must be south african citizens or residents a foreign company may conduct business in south africa through a branch office but is required to register an external company with the companies and intellectual property commission cipc within 20 business days of commencing business activities in south africa external companies are exempted from the majority of the provisions of the south african companies act 2008 external companies are however required to continually maintain at least one office in south africa and to register their address or principal office with the cipc and update this information in the event of a change of address mining operations may also be conducted through a joint venture which may take the form of an incorporated or unincorporated joint venture local entity requirement is there a requirement that a local entity be a party to the transaction mining companies which hold mining rights granted in terms of the mprda were required in terms of the mining charter 2010 to achieve a minimum target of 26 per cent ownership by hdsas by 31 december 2014 the participation by hdsas whether in the form of an incorporated entity trust or individual capacity is usually structured such that the hdsas hold shares directly in a south african operating entity that in turn holds the mining rights bilateral investment and tax treaties are there jurisdictions with favourable bilateral investment treaties or tax treaties with your jurisdiction through which foreign entities will commonly structure their operations in your jurisdiction south africa concluded a host of bilateral investment treaties bits following its readmission to the international stage in 1994 however since 2012 south africa has terminated its bits with a number of european countries including belgium denmark germany italy luxembourg the netherlands spain switzerland and the united kingdom south africa s bits with china and russia are however still in effect the rationale behind the decision to terminate these bits is that the protection offered to investors by the bits will be replaced through domestic legislation in south africa under the protection of investment act 22 of 2015 protection of investment act the protection of investment act was assented to by the president in 2015 but is not yet in force government policy is seemingly to eventually terminate all of the remaining bits in favour of the protection of investment act the protection of investment act does not however offer investors the same level of protection as a bit under the act foreign investors will no longer be afforded greater legal protection than their domestic counterparts and are excluded from recourse to binding investor state international arbitration which has been criticised as lacking legitimacy consistency and transparency instead of binding arbitration foreign investors have the option to refer any investment dispute with the south african government to a mediation facilitated by the department of trade and industry in addition to their ordinary right of recourse to domestic courts and statutory bodies the act offers similar levels of compensation in the event of recovery on expropriation to the south african constitution but not any protection against unfair or equitable treatment financing principal sources of financing what are the principal sources of financing available to private parties carrying on mining activities what role does the domestic public securities market play in financing the mining industry south africa has a sophisticated financial sector and a well developed capital market in the form of the jse companies wishing to raise financing for mining activities are able to look to both domestic banks as well as various international financial institutions which have a presence in south africa the jse plays an important role in financing the mining industry and is a popular destination for foreign mining companies to raise capital through a secondary listing the jse listings requirements make provision for a fast track secondary listings process to enable companies which are already listed on an accredited foreign exchange to establish a secondary listing on the main board or alternative exchange of the jse in order to qualify for the fast track listings process an international company must have been listed on an accredited foreign exchange for at least 18 months accredited foreign exchanges include the london stock exchange the australian stock exchange the new york stock exchange and the toronto stock exchange direct financing from government or major pension funds does the government its agencies or major pension funds provide direct financing to mining projects the public investment corporation pic which is wholly owned by the south african government invests funds on behalf of public sector entities including the pension funds of government employees the pic is one of the largest investment managers in africa and holds a stake in many of the top jse listed companies including mining companies the pic aims to contribute towards the realisation of key developmental priorities of south african government and invests in projects that promote the broader social and economic development of south africa the pic frequently invests in mining projects that fall within its social and economic development mandate the industrial development corporation of south africa idc is a financial institution mandated to promote economic growth and industrial development in south africa and is wholly owned by the south african government the idc aims to develop south africa s industrial capacity and job creation through the funding it provides most of the idc s funding is in the private sector with a focus on broad based and expanded black economic empowerment the idc is involved in funding operations across the mining industry and offers a wide range of financing options including debt equity and quasi equity guarantees trade finance and venture capital security regime describe the regime for taking security over mining interests it is common for lenders to take security over mining assets in south africa this security generally takes the form of share pledges mortgages over the mining rights and general and special notarial bonds over mining equipment however lenders should carefully consider the provisions of section 11 of the mprda before taking security over any mining assets as mentioned above the minister s consent is required for a transfer of a prospecting or mining right by holder to a third party and the transfer of a controlling interest both a direct and indirect interest in a company that holds a mining or prospecting right accordingly the minister s consent will generally be required for lenders to perfect their security foreign lenders ie other than a bank as defined in the banks act 1990 may require the minister s consent to both enter into the security arrangements and again before perfecting the security restrictions importation restrictions what restrictions are imposed on the importation of machinery and equipment or services

this month volatility in the currency market fell to its lowest level in five years in times like this many analysts argue that big moves are on the horizon but it could be upwards of a year before that happens the last time fx volatility was this low was in june 2014 and at that time there were about 10 months of consolidation before a major breakout in 2007 the low volatility environment persisted for about a year and prior to that the most pronounced period of low volatility was in 1996 and the consolidation also lasted about a year we re currently three months into this market environment which means it could be another six to nine months before volatility explodes this makes sense because most if not all major central banks have no plans to change monetary policy again in 2019 and the lack of potential policy surprises minimises the impact of incoming data and the general moves in currencies also the steady gains in stocks keep investors complacent volatility will return when stocks crash because a sharp sell off would be a tipping point that triggers widespread profit taking and broad based risk aversion we got a taste of that in december and january the only question is what could cause this turn in sentiment we know that central bankers are worried about global growth but the moves in equities fail to recognise these concerns stocks could peak if us china trade talks turn south or the eu us trade war heats up if earnings are weak or data stabilises enough for central banks to reconsider tightening rate hike talk could also drive stocks lower sometimes stocks correct for no reason at all they sell off sharply one day and the fear of further losses drive them even lower regardless it may be some time before the selling begins so for now it is best to focus on strategies that thrive in low volatility markets this means fading tops and bottoms being nimble with profit targets and taking your cue from stocks and yields also don t expect

113 00 dollar is bid but not against the yen there s no doubt that 112 is an important level for usdjpy the pair hovered a few pips underneath this level all of last week in the narrowest trading range that we ve seen in years usdjpy should be trading much higher given that the dow jones industrial average ended the week at its strongest level since october us data was also better than expected with retail sales rising by its strongest level since september 2017 and jobless claims falling to a 50 year low with wages on the rise and stocks performing well us consumers returned with a vengeance after the government shutdown the low level of jobless claims reflects a tight labour market that should support consumer spending going forward however usdjpy barely budged because investors do not believe that one month of strong data will sway the central bank s outlook most policymakers have recognised the robustness of the labour market and the potential recovery in spending their main concerns are growth abroad and trade two issues that continue to pose serious risks to the us and global economy usdjpy is not always the best barometer for the market s appetite for us dollars the greenback actually traded higher against all of the other major currencies last week and with stocks rising the move was not driven by risk aversion the worst performing currency was the new zealand dollar which fell hard after weaker cpi the most resilient was the canadian dollar which benefitted from strong trade and retail sales numbers looking ahead while usdjpy is prime for a breakout we don t expect that to happen this week because most markets are closed for easter monday and there are very few market moving us economic reports on the calendar the only number worth

key levels support aud 7100 nzd 6650 cad 1 3300 resistance aud 7200 nzd 6800 cad 1 3400 bank of canada rate decision biggest event risk of the week better than expected economic reports from australia and canada failed to help the aud and cad whereas weakness in new zealand exacerbated the slide for the nzd all three of the commodity currencies lost value against the greenback with nzd falling to its lowest level in three months as softer cpi growth hardened the case for a rate cut by the rbnz there was also a big divergence with the performance of aud which hit a one month high last week australian labour market data was significantly better than expected with the economy adding rather than shedding full time jobs unfortunately even with this improvement the reserve bank feels that forward indicators of labour demand were mixed and a discussion of the scenarios where a rate cut may be appropriate was necessary the mere talk of rate cuts diminishes the impact of positive data aud and nzd also shrugged off strong data out of china last week their massive stimulus package is finally working with consumer spending and manufacturing activity rebounding strongly in march but it is far too early to declare a bottom especially when us china trade talks are not complete on a fundamental and technical basis aud and nzd are vulnerable to further weakness particularly since this week s australia cpi and new zealand trade numbers could miss expectations but us and china trade talks have reached a turning point and there s a good chance that a signing summit could be scheduled for may if that s true it would be wildly positive for aud and nzd the biggest event risk of the week will be wednesday s bank of canada monetary policy announcement in march the boc sent usdcad tumbling to two month lows by expressing concerns about growth pointing to increased uncertainty on the timing of future rate hikes at the time it was worried about consumer spending housing and inflation fast forward seven weeks and some of those concerns will be alleviated by the recovery in retail sales and uptick in cpi growth unfortunately that may not be enough to alter the central bank s dovish bias usdcad has been trading in a narrow 1 3290 to 1 3400 trading range since the beginning of the month and if the boc ignores all of the recent data improvements and reiterates their concerns about the economy we could see usdcad squeeze towards its march high of 1 3470 british pound data review rightmove house prices 1 1 vs 0 4 previous jobless claims 28 3k vs 26 7k previous average weekly earnings

considering the good employment and retail sales reports employment rose to a new record high as wage growth held steady at 3 5 the ilo unemployment remained at its lowest level in nearly 45 years providing the perfect backdrop for spending the latest retail sales report shows that uk consumers were unfazed by brexit uncertainty in march consumer spending rose 1 1 against a forecast for 0 3 economists were bracing for a contraction but strong online sales drove retail sales higher for the third month in a row these reports should have been positive for sterling but the currency drifted quietly lower softer inflation numbers could be a factor but the primary reason for the currency s weakness is that at the end of the day investors don t expect these latest reports to affect the bank of england s outlook it has no plans to raise interest rates until britain decides on the terms of leaving the european union the extension of article 50 prolongs this uncertainty and delays the timing for tightening there are no major uk economic reports scheduled for release this week so it should be a quiet week for gbp with that in mind gbpusd has strong support near 1 2650 euro data

negative territory even though the zew surveyed showed concerns about the region s outlook fading softer german industrial production leaves them worried about current conditions the ez flash pmi readings the absolute latest measure of conditions on the ground also came in at 47 8 versus 48 1 dropping further into contractionary territory according to markit backlogs of work dropped for the fourth time in the past five months and have not shown any growth since last november the reduction in backlogs was only fractionally smaller than in march which had seen the steepest decline since december 2014 the only saving grace from the report was rebound in german services pmi which helped offset some of the weakness in manufacturing still germany which is the core of the european economy remains highly vulnerable to manufacturing slowdown which itself is roiled not only by cyclical but secular factors a massive part of german economy and european manufacturing sector as well is dependent on car production which is going through wrenching changes and existential threat from electric vehicles but it s difficult to imagine that europe will see any rebound in manufacturing any time soon and the region s best hope for growth remains in services where the demand appears to be more stable and stronger the german ifo is scheduled for release this week and we are not looking for any material improvement in business confidence technically eurusd s rejection of 1 13 followed by lower highs and lower lows is a sign of weakness and the pair s failure to close above the 50 day sma signals a potential move below 1 12

china s belt and road forum kicks off arab nation attendance provides a strong confirmation to end of petrodollar china s belt and road confab with representatives from 17 arab countries confirmed to be participating in the new silk road project it all but validates that the long standing petrodollar system is at an end all in all representatives from 37 countries will be attending this forum between april 22 25 and what makes this trade project a real threat to the u s and dollar hegemony is that much of it will be done bilaterally and in currencies that are outside the global reserve while president trump continues to try to break apart global trade through the use of tariffs and economic sanctions china appears to be focusing on new markets where competitive advantages are being tied to the strength of each nation s own money and not within the restrictions formed on them through the petrodollar china s economic war against the united states has entered a new and deadlier phase after gutting u s manufacturing under the guise of free trade china is co opting america s high tech dominance by wooing tech giants like apple and google meanwhile china expands its reach by building out its belt and road initiative also known as one belt one road aimed at linking all of eurasia and africa together under chinese dominated trading routes as this has occurred beijing has taken aim at the very heart of america s global dominance the u s dollar herein lies the most significant threat to the american led world order since its inception following the end of world war ii and unlike previous threats to that order china s attempt to kill king dollar just might work should the u s dollar cease to be the world s reserve currency then washington not only would have to reform its absurd spending policies virtually overnight fat chance of that happening but america would be on the proverbial hook to quickly repay its vast international debt which is almost impossible with a debt to gdp ratio of 100 percent there is no realistic way for the united states to pay down its debt should those foreign powers demand it in essence it would lead to the end of the american world order and it would cause utter chaos in the u s socio economic and political system as america struggled to repay its onerous debt in 2018 china made an historic deal with saudi arabia that allowed for some oil to be traded in china s currency thus the petro yuan was born the move had significant backing in places like saudi arabia and france russia which has been squeezed hard by american sanctions since the illegal annexation of crimea in 2014 supported the move to allow for oil to be traded on the petro yuan as well other american rivals including iran and venezuela have long desired to trade oil in currencies other than the dollar so as to avoid u s sanctions china s bri project its economic development and its willingness to engage asia europe and africa has gotten the attention of the arab world deals are in the process of being done earlier this month saudi arabia threatened to ditch the petro dollar if the us passed certain legislation see saudi threatens to ditch petro dollar trade scheme what is the petrodollar essentially it is the fact that although the us dollar is no longer backed by gold since most oil is priced in us dollars that gives the us dollar a type of backing in a broadly needed commodity this insures that internationally the us dollar will have value so it is sometimes called a petrodollar here is more about that after the collapse of the bretton woods gold standard in the early 1970s the u s struck a deal with saudi arabia to standardize oil prices in dollar terms through this deal the petrodollar system was born along with a paradigm shift away from pegged exchanged rates and gold backed currencies to non backed floating rate regimes the petrodollar system elevated the u s dollar to the world s reserve currency and through this status the u s is able to enjoy persistent trade deficits and become a global economic hegemony the petrodollar system also provides the united states financial markets with a source of liquidity and foreign capital inflows through petrodollar recycling however before the effects of the petrodollars on the u s dollar can be examined a brief history lesson is in order since the most sought after commodity in the world oil is priced in u s dollars the petrodollar helped elevated the greenback as the world s dominant currency in fact according to the bank for international settlements bis triennial survey 87 percent of all foreign exchanges deals initiated in april 2013 involved the usd on one side with this status the u s dollar was able to enjoy what some have asserted to be an exorbitant privilege of perpetually financing its current account deficit by issuing dollar denominated assets at very low rates of interest as well as becoming a global economic hegemony for instance countries like china who hold vast quantities of u s debt have voiced their concerns in the past about the possible dilutive effects to their asset holdings should the dollar depreciate however the privileges associated with being able to run persistent current account deficits come at a price as the reserve currency the u s is obligated to run these deficits to fulfill reserve requirements in an ever in an ever expanding global economy if the united states were to stop running these deficits the resulting shortage of liquidity can pull the world into an economic contraction however if the persistent deficits continued ad infinitum eventually foreign countries will begin to doubt the valuation of the dollar and the greenback may lose its role as the reserve currency this is known as the triffin dilemma accessed 06 02 17 if enough oil producing nations stop pricing oil in us dollars the theory is that the us dollar will drop or even collapse someone said this could happen as early as 2015 market collapse then new world order in 2015 a long time financial adviser named harvey organ claims that claims that because of insufficient gold in the central banks of usa and uk that shanghai would bring about exposing this and that this would lead to a massive overnight rise in the price of gold and silver diminished value of their currencies he states a market collapse will occur before the end of 2014 that the petroyuan will replace the petrodollar and that a chinese led new world order will be in place for 2015 is this possible where does the leader of the new world order come from what does the bible teach this is a video although i did not believe such a collapse could have happened in 2015 nor do i believe such for 2019 the reality is that the bible tells of a time when the us will be taken over daniel 11 39 the massive debts of the usa will be a factor 6 will not all these take up a proverb against him and a taunting riddle against him and say woe to him who increases what is not his how long and to him who loads himself with many pledges 7 will not your creditors rise up suddenly will they not awaken who oppress you and you will become their booty 8 because you have plundered many nations all the remnant of the people shall plunder you because of men s blood and the violence of the land and the city and of all who dwell in it habakkuk 2 6 8 actually with an admitted debt of over 22 trillion dollars and plans to increase that much further the usa has increased pledges more than any nation in the history of the planet foreign creditors will rise up some like china are also taking steps to topple us dollar dominance yesterday the usa announced that it intends to impose sanctions against countries like china if they continue to purchase oil from iran see us won t renew sanctions waivers for importing iranian oil which china already does without us dollars because of us sanctions against iran the existence of the petrodollar seems to have helped the usa be in a position to increase its debt and that will not end well cf habakkuk 2 2 8 daniel 11 39 see also usa in prophecy the strongest fortresses as far as the arab world goes while many of the sunni muslim nations consider themselves to be us allies and many still feel the need for us military protection one day they are prophesied to break ties with the us and plot for its downfall cf psalm 83 2 8 see also is the future king of the south rising up in 1966 and 1979 the old radio worldwide church of god taught that the mainly arabic king of the south power would arise and make a deal with the european king of the north as shown in psalm 83 but who is the king of the south in verse 40 we skip to the time of the end the verse undoubtedly found partial fulfillment in the offensive of 1896 but mussolini did not finish the prophecy just as there is yet to be a final king of the north there may very well emerge in the same manner a final king of the south an overall leader of an arab moslem confederation possibly bearing the very title mahdi a prophetic psalm psalm 83 provides additional insight into the mideast picture germany assyria in bible prophecy and perhaps the rest of europe will be in league in the future with a union of arab nations but in the end this european arab alliance will prove short lived and the king of the north shall come against him daniel 11 40 41 the arab moslem confederation will of course be thrown into chaotic disarray in the fact of invasion stump k the arab world in prophecy plain truth december 1979 pp 11 12 they have said come and let us cut them off from being a nation that the name of israel may be no more in remembrance for they have consulted together with one consent they are confederate against thee the tabernacles of edom and the ishmaelites of moab and the hagarenes gebal and ammon and amalek the philistines with the inhabitants of tyre assur also is joined with them stump k the arab world in prophecy plain truth december 1979 turn to the astounding prophecy found in psalm 83 1 8 david inspired of god predicted the coming time when all of israel s enemies would join together in an effort to crush out even the name israel from the face of the earth verse 4 for they have consulted together with one consent they are confederate against thee verse 5 notice the nations making up this confederation edom and the ishmaelites moab and the hagarenes gebal lebanon and ammon and amalek the philistines with the inhabitants of tyre assur is joined with them they have helped the children of lot moab and ammon in modern jordan here we see that the arab nations mentioned are allied with germany assur which we know from other prophecies will be the military leader naturally so of a united states of europe egypt will provoke the prophesied united europe dan 11 40 this european power called the king of the north in daniel 11 shall invade and occupy the glorious land of palestine verse 41 and the land of egypt shall not escape boraker r syria raids israel where is it leading plain truth november 1966 in the 21st century former wcg member craig white had a slightly different identification of the nations in psalm 83 keep not thou silence o god for lo thine enemies make a tumult they have taken crafty counsel against thy people they have said come and let us cut them off from being a nation that the name of israel may be no more in remembrance they are confederate against thee the tabernacles of edom and the ishmaelites of moab and the hagarenes gebal and ammon and amalek the philistines with the inhabitants of tyre assur also is joined with them ps 83 1 8 white c rise of the king of the north email received september 12 2015 psalm 83 is very likely to involve terrorism taking crafty counsel sounds like plotting terrorism see also why terrorism is terrorism prophesied the europeans will make a destructive deal with those of the middle east and north africa it would seem that the king of the south will employ some type of warfare and terrorism against the descendants of israel the bible specifically warns about terror as a curse for the descendants of jacob leviticus 26 16 jeremiah 15 8 deuteronomy 32 25 and since terrorism has often been used by islamists this may be part of how they will contribute to the destruction of the nation of israel and the anglo descended peoples that psalm 83 and daniel 11 39 alludes to some muslims want a leader called the imam mahdi while others call for a caliph to lead them and create some type of islamic empire in the 21st century see also the prophesied islamic confederation this deal in the 83rd psalm will affect the usa canada uk and possibly australia and even new zealand the conference going on in china right now seems to be a step to further separate the arabs from the anglo americans but you will not hear much about it by most of the american media although secular sources do not realize it many events are aligning with properly understood biblical prophecies some items of possibly related interest may include the end of us dollar dominance is the usa losing its economic status what about the petro gold yuan a related video is also available us dollar being challenged by gold petro yuan is the future king of the south rising up some no longer believe there needs to be

past decade mining activity has had an important role in the peruvian economy because it generates added value higher foreign exchange and revenues for taxes the creation of direct and indirect jobs and improvement in potential growth of economic activity allowing the achievement of necessary and real social inclusion and promoting general welfare the peruvian government has always been committed to supporting mining activities and has adopted serious changes in legislation to avoid illegal mining last year the mines ministry approved a legis lative package to regulate a new formalisation process for informal miners that had not started their formalisation process under the previous legislation finally the mining industry has focused its efforts on being appreciated as an activity that

aforementioned code in order to report mineral reserves are probable mineral reserves and proved mineral reserves mining rights and title state control over mining rights to what extent does the state control mining rights in your jurisdiction can those rights be granted to private parties and to what extent will they have title to minerals in the ground are there large areas where the mining rights are held privately or which belong to the owner of the surface rights is there a separate legal regime or process for third parties to obtain mining rights in those areas the peruvian state is the owner of natural resources which include minerals therefore the peruvian state owns the mining rights exploration use and exploitation of mining rights can be granted to private parties through the regime of mining concessions mining concessions have the nature of immovable goods mining concessions constitute a different right from surface land over them owners of surface lands are not authorised to perform mining activities on them unless they have a valid mining concession title granted by the ingemmet publicly available information and data what information and data are publicly available to private parties that wish to engage in exploration and other mining activities is there an agency which collects mineral assessment reports from private parties must private parties file

the mineral concessions cadastre providing complete public information regarding mining concessions information held by ingemmet is public and available through its website title holders of mining concessions shall submit a consolidated annual declaration to minem providing information regarding the activities performed information submitted is used to create statistics on mining activities on peruvian territory acquisition of rights by private parties what mining rights may private parties acquire how are these acquired what obligations does the rights holder have if exploration or reconnaissance licences are granted does such tenure give the holder an automatic or preferential right to acquire a mining licence what are the requirements to convert to a mining licence persons or entities are entitled to request mining rights the general mining law establishes four different types of mining rights as follows a mining concession grants rights to execute mining activities of exploration and exploitation it has the nature of an immovable right a beneficiation concession grants the right to perform physical chemical and physical chemical processes to concentrate minerals or to purify smelt or refine metals a general labour concession grants the right to perform auxiliary mining services or activities such as ventilation drainage lifting or extraction to mining activities and a mineral transportation concession grants the right to provide massive and continuous transport of mineral products by unconventional methods title holders of mining concessions shall pay validity fees to ingemmet the amount of said fee depends on the condition of the titleholders small artisanal or general regime small title holders are entities or persons holding concessions in an area of less than 2 000 hectares with no more than 350 metric tonnes of production per day and must pay a validity fee of us 1 per hectare artisanal titleholders are entities or persons holding concessions in an area of less than 1 000 hectares with no more than 25 metric tonnes of production per day and must pay a validity fee of us 0 50 per hectare finally the general regime applicable to titleholders for entities or persons who do not qualify as small or artisanal and the fees are us 3 per hectare validity fees must be paid annually to maintain mining concessions in force the non compliance of validity fee payment for two consecutive years results in the extinction of the mining concession the mining law obliges mining concessions holders to move into production holders shall reach a minimum annual production map established by general mining law nowadays there are two regimes of map depending on the date of the mining concession title however in 2017 the peruvian government decided to regulate only one regime for all types of mining concessions in this context according to legislative decree no 1320 from 2019 holders of mining concessions will be required to reach a minimum annual production equivalent to one tax unit approximately us 1 250 per year per hectare if the holder of a mining concession cannot reach the minimum annual production in the first semester of the 11th year from the year in which the concession was granted the holder will be required to pay a penalty equivalent to 2 per cent of the applicable minimum production per year per hectare until the 15th year if the holder cannot reach the minimum annual production in the first semester of the 16th year from the grant year of the concession the holder will be required to pay a penalty equivalent to 5 per cent of the applicable minimum production per year per hectare until the 20th year if the holder cannot reach the minimum annual production in the first semester of the 20th year from the grant year of the concession the holder will be required to pay a penalty equivalent to 10 per cent of the applicable minimum production per year per hectare until the 30th year finally if the holder cannot reach the minimum annual production during this period the mining concessions will automatically expire holders of mining concessions that were granted before 2008 will be obliged to achieve the map from 2019 renewal and transfer of mineral licences what is the regime for the renewal and transfer of mineral licences the mining concession must be maintained by paying validity fees and complying with the corresponding minimum production when appropriate see question 10 transfer of mining concessions can be done by private civil agreements regulated by terms freely agreed the main principle that rules commercial transactions in peru is contractual freedom therefore there are no limitations to the transfer of mining concessions on the other hand regarding the transfer of authorisation to the environmental permits and commencement of mining operations exploration and exploitation it is considered as an inherent right to the mining concession therefore once the mining concession is transferred the permits and authorisation are transferred to the new titleholder the new holder must communicate the transfer to minem notwithstanding the aforementioned in order to simplify the permits transfer the peruvian government approved a law that regulates that in cases of a simple merger split or reorganisation all records certificates permits licences and authorisations obtained or in process will be automatically transferred to the new company that receives the patrimonial block this provision shall not apply to permits whose special regulations prohibit their transfer such as water permits and the registration of chemical inputs and taxable goods duration of mining rights what is the typical duration of mining rights according to the general mining law the mining concession is irrevocable as long as the titleholder fulfils the legal obligations required to maintain it in force however the titleholder shall comply with all the obligations in order to maintain the mining concession valid see question 10 the general mining law provides that mining concessions can be extinguished only by expiration as a consequence of a failure by a titleholder to pay the mining validity fee and or penalties for two years consecutive or not abandonment as a consequence of the breach of the mining procedure rules applicable to a mining claim nullity in case a mining concession was claimed by an individual or entities that have restrictions according to the mining law resignation in case the titleholder requests the extinction of the mining right and cancellation in case mining concession overlaps with priority rights or when the right is unassailable acquisition by domestic parties versus acquisition by foreign parties is there any distinction in law or practice between the mining rights that may be acquired by domestic parties and those that may be acquired by foreign parties according to the peruvian constitution foreigners have exactly the same rights as peruvians the only exception is in the case of foreigners intending to acquire mining rights or properties located within 50km of the peruvian border in such a case they will not be able to acquire properties or mining rights unless they previously receive express authorisation through a supreme decree protection of mining rights how are mining rights

independence of powers notwithstanding a party can freely elect to submit its controversies to local or international private arbitration the peruvian state is party to the new york convention the panama convention and montevideo convention all of which guarantee the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards in peru surface rights what types of surface rights may mining rights holders request and acquire how are these rights acquired can surface rights holders oppose these requests titleholders of mining concessions can freely acquire surface lands located over its mining concessions in the case of surface lands owned by native communities it will be necessary to obtain approval from the community through an agreement approving the transaction by a qualified majority

financial markets tend to undergo manic depressive cycles and this has been especially true in recent years during risk ons investors driven by animal spirits produce bull markets frothiness and sometimes outright bubbles eventually however they overreact to some negative shock by becoming too pessimistic shedding risk and forcing a correction or bear market whereas prices of us and global equities rose sharply throughout 2017 markets began to wobble in 2018 and became fully depressed in the last quarter of the year this risk off reflected concerns about a global recession sino american trade tensions and the federal reserve s signals that it would continue to raise interest rates and pursue quantitative tightening but since this past january markets have rallied so much so that some senior asset managers now foresee a market melt up the opposite of a meltdown with equities continuing to rise sharply above their current elevated levels one could argue that this latest risk on cycle will continue for the rest of the year for starters growth is stabilising in china owing to another round of macroeconomic stimulus there easing fears of a hard landing and the us and china may soon reach a deal to prevent the ongoing trade war from escalating further at the same time us and global growth are expected to strengthen somewhat in the second half of the year and the disruption of a hard brexit has been averted with the eu extending the deadline for the uk s departure to 31 october 2019 as for the eurozone s prospects much will depend on germany where growth could rebound as global headwinds fade moreover central banks particularly the fed have become super dovish again and this appears to have reversed the tightening of financial conditions that produced the risk off in late 2018 and on the political front the chances of impeachment proceedings in the us have fallen sharply with the release of the mueller report which clears donald trump of criminal conspiracy charges though it is not dispositive on the question of obstruction of justice now that the russia investigation is over trump may avoid issuing destabilising statements or tweets that could rattle the stock market given that it is a key benchmark by which he judges his own success finally in a positive feedback loop stronger markets boost economic growth which in turn can lead to even higher market values sign up to the daily business today email or follow guardian business on twitter at businessdesk these developments may or may not ensure clear sailing for the rest of the year while markets have already priced in the aforementioned positive potentialities other factors could trigger another risk off episode first the price to earnings ratio is high in many markets particularly for us equities which means that even a modest negative shock could trigger a correction in fact us corporate profit margins are so high that there could be an earnings recession this year if growth remains around 2 while production costs may increase with a tight labour market second there are heightened risks associated with the scale and composition of us corporate sector debt owing to the prevalence of leveraged loans high yield junk bonds and fallen angel firms whose bonds have been downgraded from investment grade to near junk status moreover the commercial real estate sector is burdened with overcapacity as developers overbuilt and e commerce sales have undercut demand for bricks and mortar retail space against this backdrop any sign of a growth slowdown could lead to a sudden increase in the cost of capital for highly leveraged firms not just in the us but also in emerging markets where a significant share of debt is denominated in dollars third assuming that us economic growth holds up market expectations of more fed dovishness will likely prove unfounded thus a fed decision not to cut rates could come as a surprise triggering an equity correction fourth hopes of a resolution to the sino american trade war may also be misplaced even with a deal the conflict could escalate again if either side suspects the other of not holding up its end and other simmering trade tensions could boil over if for example the us congress fails to ratify the trump administration s revised north american free trade agreement or if trump follows through with import tariffs on cars from europe fifth european growth is very fragile and could be hindered by any of a number of developments from a strong showing by populist parties in the upcoming european parliament elections to a political or economic crisis in italy this would come at a time when monetary and fiscal stimulus in the eurozone is constrained and eurozone integration is stalled sixth many emerging market economies are also heavily exposed to political and policy risks these include from least to most fragile mexico brazil argentina turkey iran and venezuela and china s latest round of stimulus has saddled its already indebted corporate sector with even more financial risk and may not even suffice in lifting its growth rate seventh trump may react to the mueller report with bluster not prudence with an eye to the 2020 presidential election he could double down on his fights with the democrats launch new salvos in the trade war stack the fed board with unqualified cronies bully the fed to cut rates or precipitate another government shutdown over the debt ceiling or immigration policy at the same time the trump administration s approach to iran and venezuela could put further upward pressure on oil prices which have rallied since last fall to the detriment of growth finally we are still in a world of low potential growth a new mediocre sustained by high private and public debt rising inequality and heightened geopolitical risk the widespread populist backlash against globalisation trade migration and technology will all but certainly have an eventual negative impact on growth and markets so while investors latest love affair with equity markets may continue this year it will remain a fickle and volatile relationship any number of disappointments could trigger another risk off and possibly a sharp market correction the question is not whether it will happen but when nouriel roubini a professor at nyu s stern school of business and ceo of roubini macro

free marketeers may sometimes win elections but they are not winning u s history in recent years the consensus regarding the american past has slipped leftward and then leftward again no longer is american history a story of opportunity or of military or domestic triumph ours has become rather a story of wrongs racial and social today any historical figure who failed at any time to support abolition or worse took the confederate side in the civil war must be expunged from history wrongs must be righted and equality of result enforced the equality campaign spills over into a less obvious field one that might otherwise provide a useful check upon the nonempirical claims of the humanities economics in a discipline that once showcased the power of markets an axiom is taking hold equal incomes lead to general prosperity and point toward utopia teachers book review editors and especially professors withhold any evidence to the contrary universities lead the shift and the population follows today millennials those born between 1981 and 2000 outnumber baby boomers by the millions and polls suggest that they support redistribution specifically and government action generally more than their predecessors do a 2014 reason rupe poll found 48 percent of millennials agreeing that government should do more to solve problems whereas 37 percent said that government was doing too many things a full 58 percent of the youngest of millennials those 18 24 when surveyed held a positive view of socialism in dramatic contrast with their parents only 23 percent of those aged 55 to 64 viewed socialism positively at least for now most progressives acknowledge that markets and economic growth are necessary but progressives in academia contend that growth has proved itself secondary to equality efforts something to be exploited rather than appreciated not just nationally but worldwide policymakers and the press regard the subordination of growth to equality to be a benign practice as in the recent line in the indian periodical mint a policy aimed at reducing inequality need not hurt growth the redistributionist impulse has brought to the fore metrics such as the gini coefficient named after the ur redistributor corrado gini an italian social scientist who developed an early statistical measure of income distribution a century ago a society where a single plutocrat earns all the income ranks a pure 1 on the gini scale one in which all earnings are perfectly equally distributed the old scandinavian ideal scores a 0 by the gini test the gini index has been renamed or updated numerous times but the principle remains the same income distribution and redistribution seem so crucial to progressives that french economist thomas piketty built an international bestseller around it the wildly lauded capital through gini s lens we now rank past eras decades in which policy endeavored or managed to even out and equalize earnings the 1930s under franklin roosevelt the 1960s under lyndon johnson score high decades where policymakers focused on growth before equality such as the 1920s fare poorly decades about which social justice advocates aren t sure what to say the 1970s say simply drop from the discussion in the same hierarchy federal debt moves down as a concern because austerity to reduce debt could hinder redistribution lately advocates of economically progressive history have made taking any position other than theirs a dangerous practice academic culture longs to topple the idols of markets just as it longs to topple statutes of robert e lee but progressives have their metrics wrong and their story backward the geeky gini metric fails to capture the american economic dynamic in our country innovative bursts lead to great wealth which then moves to the rest of the population equality campaigns don t lead automatically to prosperity instead prosperity leads to a higher standard of living and eventually in democracies to greater equality the late simon kuznets who posited that societies that grow economically eventually become more equal was right growth cannot be assumed prioritizing equality over markets and growth hurts markets and growth and most important the low earners for whom social justice advocates claim to fight government debt matters as well those who ring the equality theme so loudly deprive their own constituents whose goals are usually much more concrete educational opportunity homes better electronics and most of all jobs translated into policy the equality impulse takes our future hostage touring american history with an eye on growth not equality has become so unusual that doing so almost feels like driving on the wrong side of the road nonetheless a review trip through the decades is useful because the evidence for growth is right there in our own american past four decades especially warrant examination the 1920s the 1930s the 1960s and the 1970s republican president herbert hoover left and democratic president franklin d roosevelt pursued policies focusing on equality rather than economic growth and the american economy stagnated american stock getty images the modern american economic story starts with the 1920s a decade worth dwelling on at some length because of the stunning evidence that it offers of growth s power the winners of the 1920 election were two republicans warren g harding of ohio and his vice presidential candidate calvin coolidge of massachusetts confronting these men and indeed congress was the same pressure to prioritize redistribution that weighs on us today in the aftermath of world war i commodity prices had plummeted farmers could not pay the bills for equipment and land that they d purchased in better years the farmers demanded agricultural subsidies from washington veterans sought a federal pension an early version of social security harding and coolidge s 1920 opponent from the socialist party eugene victor debs won only 3 5 percent of the popular vote but the dignified debs in prison for noncompliance with the wartime draft was becoming a national martyr to progressivism an even greater force was the progressive wing within harding and coolidge s own party the republicans led by robert la follette senior senator from wisconsin la follette advocated massive redistribution including not only farm aid but also government seizure of national resources politically la follette was gaining in strength looking to a 1924 presidential run dramatic moves by woodrow wilson s administration during the war including the suspension of trading on the new york stock exchange and the nationalization of the chief means of transportation the railroad had strengthened the case for a big spending government perhaps what had worked in war would also work in peacetime meantime however business was slow the early 1920s experienced a significant recession at the end of world war i the top income tax rate stood at 77 percent business was accustomed to extraordinary burdens in war but in autumn 1920 two years after the armistice the top rate was still high at 73 percent the government s lack of clarity over the tax treatment of capital gains was also roiling markets an official capital gains tax rate had yet to be established it was unclear whether in the future gains from the sale of equities would be taxed as income or taxed at all if capital gains were taxed as income americans would be trapped in an economy where it was almost impossible to make money legally in response wall street and private companies mounted a capital strike dumping cash not into the most promising inventions but into humdrum municipal bonds bootlegging and any other illicit activity outside the purview of the treasury s bureau of internal revenue the ancestor to our internal revenue service grew abnormally attractive the high tax rates designed to corral the resources of the rich failed to achieve their purpose in 1916 206 families or individuals filed returns reporting income of 1 million or more the next year 1917 when wilson s higher rates applied only 141 families reported income of 1 million by 1921 just 21 families reported to the treasury that they had earned more than a million this was ironic for as the financial titan andrew mellon would comment the effect of tax progressivity was the idle man is relieved the producer is penalized the perverse situation contributed to public disillusionment the kind captured by f scott fitzgerald in the great gatsby published in 1925 not as commonly assumed today after the crash of 1929 against this tide harding and coolidge made their choice markets first harding tapped the toughest free marketeer on the public landscape mellon himself to head the treasury this was the 1920s equivalent of choosing a warren buffett a hedge fund star or peter thiel of paypal rather than a more standard figure from say goldman sachs from his railroad experience mellon had seen that high rail freight charges drove businesses to find other means to transport their goods to attract maximum business a railroad could charge mellon said only what the traffic will bear with a low enough freight rate the railroad could even become popular making up in volume what it lost when it lowered price mellon spoke of railroads because that was what he knew today we would use the walmart example the treasury secretary suggested applying the same theory to taxation a lower rate perhaps 25 percent might foster more business activity and so generate more revenue for federal coffers this figure drove progressives wild how could 25 percent for the rich be good for the country as a whole demanded james couzens a maverick senator from michigan couzens and others demanded that the amount of all taxpayers payments be posted on the walls of town halls or post offices the peeping tom provision as it came to be known harding and mellon got the top rate down to 58 percent when harding died suddenly in 1923 coolidge promised to bend all my energies to pushing taxes down further in a second round stewarded by coolidge a bitter deal was cut mellon and conservatives would get a somewhat lower tax rate of 46 percent and the peeping tom provision would become law gossip for a thousand headlines but coolidge was not satisfied after winning election in his own right in 1924 coolidge joined mellon and congress in yet another tax fight eventually prevailing and cutting the top rate to the target 25 percent earlier mellon had managed to establish his capital gains tax at a substantial but still reassuringly low 12 5 percent just in case there was any doubt about what he and mellon were doing by putting business first coolidge underscored it in a 1925 speech to the american society of newspaper editors the chief business of the american people is business coolidge said adding that the chief ideal of the american people is idealism several features of the 1920s events deserve note the first is the unapologetic tone of the pro markets campaign the leaders ignored their own pikettys and prevailed in the 1924 presidential campaign the progressive la follette did take a disruptive 16 6 percent of the vote but the icy pro business coolidge took an absolute majority beating la follette and the democratic candidate combined second the tax cutters did not back down though several rounds of legislation were necessary third and most important the tax cuts worked the government did draw more revenue than predicted as business relieved revived the rich earned more than the rest the gini coefficient rose but when it came to tax payments something interesting happened the statistics of income the treasury s database showed that the rich now paid a greater share of all taxes tax cuts for the rich made the rich pay taxes there were other positive outcomes today politicians speak of 4 percent growth but that s a frankly aspirational number 3 percent growth is the goal that most policymakers hope for in the 1920s though the united states did average 4 percent real growth what s more the quality of growth improved money flowed no longer to war or tax breaks but rather to products with the most economic potential the great signal of economic hope is the patent the investment by an individual or a team in the future profitability of an idea in the 1920s patent applications for inventions exploded reaching 89 752 in 1929 a level that they wouldn t see again until 1965 patent data can seem obscure to everyday americans but all that innovation resulted in productivity increases which meant that factory employees could work five days a week not six thus did americans receive something new to them saturday luxuries became cheaper to make as new equipment came on line and therefore more affordable homes got electricity most homes got indoor plumbing and people could afford automobiles mellon budgeted so well that he made wartime inflation a memory consumers found that their dollar went further finally the 1920s economy gave workers something far more important than notional wage equality a job unemployment averaged 5 percent or lower putting markets before equality had done much to improve the lives of regular americans this may be one reason that no one appeared to notice when congress in 1926 repealed the peeping tom provision in the tax code prosperity tastes better than envy breaking from his white house predecessor john f kennedy who emphasized pro growth tax cuts lyndon b johnson launched the great society which included major legislation redistributing income bettmann getty images the 1930s tell the opposite story when the market crashed in 1929 coolidge s successor herbert hoover was caught off guard so was everyone else including corrado gini who concluded that the worldwide slump that ensued was due to workaholic americans the american worker the new york times reported gini saying does not know when to stop resulting in the oversupply of goods and the ensuing slowdown we don t know what hoover made of gini himself but we do know that hoover responded differently from the way predecessors had responded to previous crashes he intervened the monetary nature of the initial collapse would have been hard for him to address though hoover did recognize it in every other area hoover changed policy to focus on social equality a chicken in every pot key was hoover s emphasis new for those times on raising the labor price rather than allow prices to find their own level in particular wages as presidents had in the past hoover hauled business leaders to washington and bullied them into sustaining high wages and he cajoled congress into passing laws that pushed up compensation as well the best known being the davis bacon act of 1931 which boosted pay for all employment under government contract the norris la guardia act likewise institutionalized higher wages by limiting recourse to the courts of employers who could not afford what unions demanded in addition hoover bullied a rueful mellon into undoing the tax cuts raising the top rate to 63 percent finally hoover thoroughly intimidated business and markets blaming them for hogging too much of the money when franklin roosevelt ran for president in 1932 the new york governor sent an even clearer signal that in his presidency equality would come first the philosophy of social justice through social action calls definitely plainly for the reduction of poverty said fdr in a campaign speech in detroit if poverty is to be prevented we require a broad program of social justice concluded fdr justice is the first law we seek roosevelt cited clergymen in support of the shift including a statement by the federal council of churches of christ that got in the requisite dig against wealth it is not denied that many persons of wealth are rendering a great service to society it is only suggested that the wealthy are overpaid in sharp contrast with the underpaid masses of the people roosevelt also quoted a rabbi who made the human justice priority even more bluntly we talk of the stabilization of business what we need is the stabilization of human justice and happiness in modern lingo we would call the new deal a social justice program the creation of the securities and exchange commission to put wall street in its place social security to bring equity to senior citizens and the wagner act a mid 1930s law so advantageous to unions that it drove wages yet higher taken overall the new deal s equality measures prolonged and deepened the depression the destructive role of high labor costs was made especially clear recently in the work of lee ohanian of ucla the obligation to pay higher wages when employers could not afford them forced employers to make their own bitter choice they simply hired fewer workers hence the refrain we have heard from our parents grandparents and great grandparents the depression was all right if you had a job those who didn t found themselves locked out for ten years joblessness stuck stubbornly in the double digits this mattered far more to families than any theoretical envy index with the coming of world war ii roosevelt pushed the top tax rate to 94 percent after the war neither citizens nor politicians forgot the disappointing results of envy populism congress pulled the teeth from the wagner act tiger with the taft hartley act and did so with such a majority that harry truman roosevelt s successor could only watch his veto be overridden for a decade or so the 1950s the united states confronted little competition worldwide and so seemed able to afford rooseveltian tax rates but as the 1960s neared lawmakers came to fear what they called growth recessions and the dominance of the few businesses able to skirt the worst penalties in the tax code even dwight eisenhower a general not an economist saw the dangers to u s enterprise and freedom and warned against a military industrial complex it fell to ike s successor john f kennedy to reverse the national course kennedy planned dramatic tax cuts that would take top rates down into the 50 percent range again the president s assassination in 1963 prevented all but kennedy s first step from being completed after jfk s death lyndon b johnson shepherded those initial cuts through congress and made them law the new 70 percent rate was still ultrahigh but the downward trend was enough to inspire markets keynes s newer theories were more congenial for politicians looking to reward voters with instant gifts still johnson differed from kennedy as hoover and roosevelt had from coolidge reversing priorities yet again lbj followed logic that started with a premise assume growth taking individual enterprise for granted johnson launched a second new deal the great society a roster of legislation whose hallmark was redistribution through medicare and medicaid johnson redistributed taxes to cover health care for senior citizens and the poor and then redistributed further with expansions of welfare finally johnson established public television and public radio institutions that would showcase all future social equality campaigns pupils today study johnson s enactment of the civil rights act of 1964 and the voting rights act of 1965 but they hear less about the impact of medicare medicaid and welfare it makes an intriguing thought experiment what if johnson had stuck to kennedy s original theme of equality of opportunity education and civil rights rather than stressing equality of result for a brief period in the 1960s it appeared that johnson had won his equality wager it seemed that america could pursue equality while enjoying growth and even balanced budgets in 1969 a year in which the budget was indeed balanced congress passed and richard nixon signed a levy on top earners that redistributed purely for the sake of redistribution or punishment for the sake of punishment what became known as the alternative minimum tax mellon s old rule of charging what the traffic will bear had been forgotten john maynard keynes s newer theories were more congenial for politicians who sought to reward their voters with instant gifts by the end of the 1960s keynesianism had become window dressing for social justice even though the great society arguably hurt low earners including many blacks the most the disparity between black and white unemployment widened from the late 1960s onward with blacks enduring an ever higher measure of joblessness coming to the oval office after a long period of high unemployment and crippling inflation ronald reagan launched a tax campaign that took rates to a coolidge esque 28 percent fueling a new expansion diana walker time life pictures getty images the 1970s and early 1980s brought to all americans black and white the bill for johnson s assumptions the gini coefficient remained low but unemployment approached 10 percent and inflation rose as well the 1970s proved a bumpy ride to constrain inflation the federal reserve raised interest rates and in 1980 the prime rate the rate that banks charge one another even crossed 20 percent that meant that the mortgage rate for the typical family buying a home stood for years over 10 percent which in turn meant that families could afford one or two fewer bedrooms than they otherwise might have was the paper equality worth it a high capital gains tax rate of effectively 50 percent dampened innovation as did a law that said that the patent for any invention made under the auspices of a government funded institution a university say belonged to the government not the inventor or even the university patent rates for inventions flattened out at about 100 000 a year not much higher than in the late 1920s when the population had been just over half the size growth it turned out could not always be assumed only when u s leaders turned to three areas that had been essential in the past income taxes the capital gains tax and patents did a turnaround become possible in 1978 congress led by representative william steiger of wisconsin cut the capital gains rate in half albeit with resistance from the redistributionist president jimmy carter who called the cut a huge tax windfall for millionaires in some cases the capital gains rate was even lower is a capital gains rate of 17 5 percent unfair asked the washington post yes thought the paper s editors nonetheless the country saw the opportunity in lower rates and elected ronald reagan reagan followed up with a series of tax cuts that brought the top rate on the income tax down to a coolidge esque 28 percent less known and also influential was a law that senators birch bayh and robert dole sponsored in 1980 to give scientists and inventors or their universities ownership of patents for their inventions bayh dole as the patent law is known caused patent applications to increase and venture capital to explode powering the silicon valley expansion as economist larry lindsey showed the results of the 1920s repeated themselves after the reagan tax cuts the government saw greater revenues than paper arithmetic had predicted as if american evidence of the price of envy weren t enough europe presents a corollary story in the 1950s 1960s and 1970s social democracies in europe established with the encouragement and support of washington boasted gini coefficients that u s redistributionists could only dream about but their spending nearly brought european nations down in the 1980s europe was equal but broke only a feisty pro growth rebellion in britain and quieter revolutions in scandinavia and germany made stronger growth and more general prosperity possible again what now the intellectual slide left in economics may eventually cease a casualty as other leftish economic theories in the past have been to the weight of evidence when inflation moves up as it will one day embarrassed economists will come around as they did in the 1970s waiting for a crisis to force the carters of the future to acknowledge reality is far from ideal though some evidence suggests that as they age millennials will come to appreciate markets but we can bring the day of recognition on sooner and avoid uncountable collateral damage by demanding better secondary school education the kind that makes patent and growth indexes as important as those for income distribution the fastest way to do that is to support competition in standard secondary school education so that our under informed youth have an option to attend schools that might afford them a glimpse of the whole economic picture a real push is also necessary in the economics trade itself members of the guild of ph d economists have little motive to do anything but build on or update keynesianism revise gini or gild piketty s lily the most important step to put markets where they belong in first place in the economic discussion is to establish incentives that would make economists want to report the whole truth about the past one example is the manhattan institute s hayek book prize a major award for economics authors whose works reflect the free market views of the great economist friedrich von hayek the greatest hope lies in the fostering of new institutions that will in turn nurture economics thinkers who dare to acknowledge the merits of markets that means think tanks and universities already george mason university stands out in this regard we need more george masons a teetering nation cannot right itself until it rights its history top photo president warren g harding left and his successor calvin coolidge

indications that the trump administration is considering nominating moore and cain to the board of governors of the federal reserve has stirred up an international controversy over the independence of central banks cain withdrew his name from consideration yesterday though the mere floating of his name had generated much consternation although president trump has appointed the majority of the board including choosing powell as chair and they have not been controversial he has used his bully pulpit to criticize the conduct of monetary policy repeatedly even the usually circumspect ecb president draghi felt it necessary to express his concern given the importance let s unpack this concept of central bank independence there seem to be four elements to consider personnel policy goal instruments and the policy decisions themselves critics of trump have broadly complained about the caliber of appointments but until now the fed had been an exception his appointments to the federal reserve have been well within the mainstream the policy goal was set by congress it is commonly talked about as if the fed has a dual mandate fed officials themselves use such language yet the same amendment to the federal reserve act clearly stated a third moderate long term interest rates how can the fed which targets short term interest rates be responsible for moderate long term interest rates this is the shadow of financial stability which the dodd frank act strengthened the federal reserve act nor the amendments required the central bank to have a formal inflation target it has great discretion in defining price stability and formally adopted a target of 2 for the headline deflator for personal consumption expenditures in 2012 almost 100 years after the central bank was founded the federal reserve enjoys broad discretion over the tools it did not need congressional approval to launch its asset purchase program but it did require authority to pay interest on reserves not just excess reserves which is often cited central banks have varying degrees of independence the bank of england for example was given an inflation target by the uk government and if it is outside of a specified range the governor is required to write a letter of explanation although it is one of the oldest and most revered central banks its independence is a relatively recent development operational independence did not come until 1997 under a labour government and gordon brown as chancellor of the exchequer the bank of japan is regarded as among the least independent of major central banks the european central bank is the newest central bank and it was designed to be the most independent the power of the central bank is great and in representative governments the power must be accountable it is common for the major central banks to hold press conferences after their meetings and starting this year the federal reserve has adopted this practice itself from time to time it is not unusual for the heads of central banks to speak to the legislative branch the federal reserve chair speaks to each house of congress twice a year intervention in the foreign exchange market is decided often by the government with the central bank executing the operation in the us the reserves are divided between the treasury and the federal reserve although the treasury secretary makes the intervention call custom dictates that the cost is borne evenly by the treasury department and the federal reserve trump is accused of encroaching upon the central bank s independence is two ways first although many candidates are being considered the indication that moore and cain were among them was seen as politicizing the fed by politicizing many mean that those candidates would simply do trump s bidding which is to ensure the 10 year old expansion keeps ticking but it is a time honored principle that the president can pick people to serve him of like mind moreover the power of appointment is one of the democratic elements of accountability second trump repeatedly violates an unwritten rule against the executive branch being critical of the central bank the power of appointment is checked by the approval of the senate while nominations are not rubber stamped the president is given wide berth presidents should be expected to pick candidates who share their vision it is not so much that both advocate easy monetary policy now that bothers so many economists and other observers instead it is that both men are not seen as qualified as noted this criticism has been levied against many of trump s nominations and appointments there is a subtext here too there is an assumption that economists should set monetary policy journalists along with others track how many economists are on the federal reserve and somehow more is thought to be better one does not need to be an economist to have a nuanced understanding of monetary policy and a grasp of the linkages to the broader economy a financial journalist and a businessman in theory could bring much to the table from a larger perspective the populist moment is a backlash against the elites who have failed to deliver the goods the rising living standards for us and our children crystallized in the distribution of the costs of the great financial crisis and its aftermath the yawning disparity of wealth and income has grave political consequences the federal reserve wields vast powers and it is not transparent remember the fed did not have press conferences after meetings until 2011 and then they were quarterly starting only this year a press conference will be held after every meeting as is customary for other major central banks including the european central bank and the bank of japan in this populist moment with the central bank more present some argue that monetary policy has done more for the markets than the real economy over the past decade it is true the stock market had rallied dramatically from the bottom in march 2009 but to say that monetary policy has done more for the markets than the real economy seems to be an exaggeration weekly jobless claims are at 50 year lows and although rules for access have changed the unemployment rate is also near half century lows jobs are the number one source of income that fuels consumption which around 2 3 of gdp the fact that wage growth is not stronger cannot be reasonably attributed to inadequate monetary policy the federal reserve wants to see higher wages after all it is difficult to achieve its inflation target without stronger wage increases the national labor relations board has weakened employee rights and the federal and state governments have often purposely sought to undermine the one institution whose raison d etre is to give labor a greater share of the pie the best thing for households is a strong economy and monetary policy is one engine fiscal policy is another some would argue that because the fiscal policy was inadequate monetary policy had to do more the fed has facilitated growth by having interest rates when adjusted for inflation below zero most of the past decade only last year did the nominal fed funds target move above inflation and now some argue that having positive real interest rates with sustained above trend growth is somehow intolerably high it also seems exaggerated to claim that for more than a generation the fed has floated above politics as a journalist does in the wall street journal it simply does not jive with the vignettes provided in memoirs and books of policymakers it ignores the push to audit the fed and begs the question of what finally propelled the fed to move out of the shadows and have press conferences there is also sometimes explicit sometimes implicit threat to alter the fed s mandate or encroach on its discretion by forcing a taylor like rule for example also the response to the great financial crisis was unprecedented cooperation between the treasury department and the federal reserve now the lack of their coordination for example the treasury s debt issuance is facilitating a flattening of the yield curve that the fed resists is notable conventional wisdom holds that large us budget deficits would cause inflation and higher interest rates neither had materialized modern monetary theory broadens the discussion of why this is possible and what it may mean for policy consider a parallel keynesian efforts to underwrite aggregate demand could focus on the construction of a social safety net or on defense and industries that feed into it voila military keynesianism similarly arguments that a green new deal would undermine the fed s independence and would necessarily be more inflationary than the tax cuts and spending increases seem to ring hollow conventional wisdom holds that if a central bank s independence is endangered inflation expectations will rise and the currency would come under pressure turkey is an obvious recent example there is no sign that investors have become concerned that the fed s independence has been compromised the us dollar is strong and interest rates are low the commentariat exaggerates the threat while draghi s comments were gratuitous he should have said that he was confident in america s institutional strength at the end of the day that more than geography is why the us is not turkey we argue the fed s independence is incomplete and it has been exaggerated in polemical zeal to show how far we have fallen ultimately one does not want easy or tight monetary policy but a monetary policy appropriate for the economic conditions and outlook all of the people appointed by trump voted for the december 2018 rate hike the power of appointment is not absolute there is precedent for rejecting a president s candidates if they were judged unqualified or sufficiently out of the mainstream we argue that despite the president s criticisms of the fed his call for a resumption of qe and his top economic advisor s call for 50 bp rate cut the fed s independence such as it is has not been violated over the past century the fed has established its institutional integrity it is stronger than some presidential tweets and public criticisms disclaimer
more than four billion people lack access to safe sanitation which has profound implications for public heath physical safety women s rights and human dignity health problems stemming from this lack of access cost the global economy over 200 billion each year panelists discuss the challenges and prospects for improving access to sanitation in the developing world gudwin ok great well welcome everybody i m ella gudwin and it is my pleasure to be here and to bring toilets to the council on foreign relations so i am joined by jeff goldberg who is on our monitors here in washington d c and you all have his bio but he heads up the office of water and oversees also the sanitation programming for usaid jason kass to my left is the founder of toilets for people and sangita vyas is a research fellow at r i c e institute for compassionate economics so before we get started just a couple of reminders we are on the record so anything you say will and can be used against you and we are going to start with a conversation and then we ll go to q a about halfway through an we ll end on time at 7 00 before we get started just wanted to get a sense for who works on water and sanitation is anyone actively in the wash sector anybody invested great ok anybody invested in wash everyone s just curious about our daily functions ok laughter so laughs ok great well then we have a wonderful a wonderful conversation in store so just to do a little bit of context setting in the world of international development water and sanitation always go together as wash but today we re just going to really focus on the sanitation side of things so that s not to ignore the giant need for clean water in the world a little bit of context setting the toilets toilets and sewers show up in the archeological record 5 000 years ago and there s evidence of some of the oldest toilets being in india and pakistan including in the indus valley circa 2800 b c and they were in toilets they were in home toilets and they were covered sewers as well with bricks there s evidence of toilets in scotland circa 3000 b c egypt circa 1800 b c and vietnam circa 1500 b c but today 68 percent of the world s population only 68 percent of the world s population uses improved sanitation facilities i had to look up what improved meant so it means flush or pour latrines that flow into piped sewer systems and septic tanks ventilated or improved pit latrines or pit latrines with a slap or a composing toilet so 68 percent of the world has access to that that leaves an estimated 2 4 billion people without sanitation meaning there is no hygienic separation between the human excreta and human contact so that means pit latrines with no slab hanging or bucket toilets and what we re going to spend quite a bit of time talking about today open defecation say it at the council on foreign relations twice open defecation laughter thirteen percent of the world s population relies on open defecation and i think some of the irony here is toilets were first in the archeological record in northern india and this is the area which has the greatest burden of this of this issue so we are going to start with jeff because we are at the council we re going to start with policy and then we ll get to toilets so jeff the u s government has elevated water and particularly sanitation into the category of being a big bet we re investing 435 million a year to create access can you talk to us about why this has become a priority for american bilateral assistance and really importantly what s changed over the last five years or so in terms of our approach to water and sanitation goldberg yeah absolutely more than happy to and just before i kick off just wanted to thank you all for hosting tonight s event having sanitation in particularly highlighted at the council on foreign relations is something that we are very very excited about as you mentioned relative to the larger stats sanitation does lag very very far behind water access in the kind of broader conceptualization of wash so it s something that we are very very excited to be talking about and just with respect to how the u s government approaches this issue i might you mentioned policy and just zoom out and provide a little bit of context about where sanitation in particular is situated so the u s government has the whole of government approach to water and sanitation it s articulated through the 2017 global water strategy and so this is co led by usaid and the department of state and it s something that we re very excited about it s the first time ever that we have had a whole of government strategy on water and sanitation and this is really rooted in strong bipartisan support for water and sanitation as a cornerstone of our both foreign policy and our foreign assistance so i m sure many people have heard about this piece of authorizing legislation but the water for the world act of 2014 specifically mandates that the u s government have this global water strategy in place at all times beginning in 2017 to be revised every five years through 2032 so from a government standpoint this is extremely exciting because this is the authorizing framework and sets the strategic framework against which we program the 435 million that you mentioned so that s a little bit about the policy context that this operates within and what we are excited and what s new and different about the global water strategy is a couple things first and foremost we are we have historically focused a lot on what we term hardware or infrastructure so focusing on the toilets themselves and on the water side water points piped water but we are making a concerted effort under this new strategic framework to call out governance and finance and the enabling environment as something that is critical for us to be investing in over the long term in tandem with any infrastructure and that s specifically because we know that there have been decades and decades of investment in infrastructure latrines water points but without corresponding assistance on governance and domestic financial flows we know that those assets can t be sustained over the longer term so that s something gudwin can i jump in and interrupt can you define governance in this context because i think some of us think about board governance we think about political governance what does governance look like in the context of sanitation goldberg so in the context of sanitation it is typically highly fragmented as an issue you can find sanitation managed depending on the country that you re in in the ministry of health as part of the ministry of public workers as part of the ministry of education sometimes for wash in schools and so part of our technical assistance is to try and bring overarching coherence to this as an issue with different line ministries that are managing it and in some cases where there are the structures in place to establish regulatory frameworks that can enable the participation of the private sector in particular so when we re talking about governance we re talking about enabling those structures to be in place that authorize and support the delivery of infrastructure in sanitation services over the long term gudwin great great goldberg and then just the other thing that i think is super important to call out about this new strategic framework is that we have intentionally disaggregated sanitation from water in our usaid plan and results framework and we think that this is really important as you mentioned typically in development we talk about water and sanitation through wash through that acronym and they certainly are technically interrelated but the approaches that we need to be taking in sanitation are often very different than the approaches that we need to be taking in water and you mentioned the term improved sanitation but importantly the global community has actually raised the bar even beyond improved sanitation talking now about something called safely managed sanitation and that gets beyond the initial access to a latrine and talks about the safe disposal and treatment of human fecal matter and that is something that we are absolutely prioritizing and does require a little bit of a different approach so because of that we ve elevated the importance of sanitation as a standalone result area that we ll be tracking moving forward gudwin great and we re going to come back to some of those bigger questions about financing and things through the conversation goldberg yes gudwin sangita let me let me turn to you so the sustainable development goals call for an end to open defecation by 2030 more than half of open defecation occurs in india can you describe why it s so prevalent in india and really specifically what is unique to india that s different from other low and low middle income countries particularly in other parts of asia and sub saharan africa why is india so different vyas well in a lot of other developing countries in the world many people in rural areas build and use simple latrines that don t cost very much money to construct and gudwin how much money are we talking about vyas less than 20 and you know the world health organization promotes the construction of these types of latrines because they re an improvement on open defecation and they limit the spread of disease and they have pits that are about three feet wide by three feet deep and every few years or so the latrine pit fills up and it has to be emptied manually in rural india manually emptying a latrine pit carries a very serious social stigma and it s so this social stigma is very rooted in india s history of caste caste has a lot to do with sanitation in india because historically lower caste people have been compelled to do manual scavenging which is manually cleaning the feces from a dry latrine every day and this work is actually it considered to be very ritually polluting in indian society and because lower caste people have been compelled to do this work they are considered to be ritually polluted in indian society unfortunately gudwin hence the name untouchable vyas exactly and so these are the groups of people that have been called untouchables unfortunately caste is still a very influential par of society in rural india and so what that means is that the higher caste people don t really want to come into contact with lower caste people or their work because they think that if they do they will also become ritually polluted so what this means for latrine use is that people don t want to build simple pit latrines that have be emptied manually and many rural indians would consider it basically inconceivable to empty a latrine pit manually at the same time and understandably lower caste indians are seeking to distance themselves from this work because it s a symbol of their social ostracization and oppression and for that reason many people would prefer to defecate in the open rather than building and using simple pit latrines now some rural indians do build and use latrines and those latrines have really large pits they have pits it s a common refrain to hear people in villages say that they want a latrine that has a pit that s ten feet by ten feet by ten feet it s essentially a very large room underground gudwin so just to put this into context as opposed to vyas a three foot by three foot latrine gudwin ok vyas and it costs a lot of money to build a latrine pit that is that large so it s not affordable for the average rural indian gudwin and they re creating it this big because they don t want to empty it vyas exactly gudwin yeah vyas so they re constructing a latrine pit that will last a generation or longer and so that these ideas of ritual impurity and untouchability are really a big part of the reason why open defecation is still so prevalent in rural india and is not as big of a problem and it s you know slowly being eliminated in most other developing countries in the world gudwin ok so we re going to come back to the issue of behavior change and differences in technology in a minute but let s just talk about let s go to jason for a moment and talk about there are many kinds of toilets so we were just talking about pit latrines there s flush there s squat there s urine diverting and you have developed a waterless self contained composting toilet can you tell us a little bit about what was your journey to creating this better composting toilet you re using it for the u s and higher income markets so just take us through that journey and a little bit about what you ve learned about bringing this new technology to market bringing it to market in the u s but also in the lower income settings where you re working kass yeah absolutely one thing i d like to say first off is there was a working draft of the title of the talk that had the word sanitation in the place where toilet is now and i m glad that the final version says toilet gudwin keep it straight to the point laughs kass when you say toilet everybody knows what you re talking about when you say sanitation it could be garbage collection you think of the department of sanitation it s kind of an opaque word but if since we re talking toilets we should use the word toilets so my journey into self contained composing toilets came from a very practical place i have a cabin in vermont i couldn t put in a septic system there i did a lot of research and i m environmental engineer so i just looked at all the different technologies that were available porta potties chemical toilets incineration toilets and composting toilets were one of the waterless technologies available that have the best customer reviews they re the most ecological the most sustainable and then in that in that realm the spinning drum compositing toilet that was actually originated in scandinavia because there they have permafrost so they can t have flush toilets there you can t have a septic system because it can t percolate so they were very advanced in developing these sustainable ecological composing toilets gudwin so a spinning drum as in using centrifugal force kass good point no spinning drum on its axis this way so basically it s think of it like as a backyard composter so if you put your veggie scraps into a backyard composter with leaves and you spin it every once in a while eventually that s going to be become soil and then you use that in your garden composting toilets act on the exact same principle except instead of veggie scraps your pooping into the drum and you re adding in wood shavings and then you re spinning it and it s becoming it s become a fertilizer and what you use it for is typically you plant ornamentals or fruit trees with it you don t use it for surface crops so that s the technology created in scandinavia i used it in my cabin in vermont back in 2005 i used it for many many years completely solved my toilet problem and i was volunteering with engineers without borders in 2010 and we had a project in a flood prone area of peru iquitos is the city belen is the informal settlement next to the city where all the town is underwater half the year so they can t have a pit latrine they can t have a flush toilet and i proposed the idea of bringing this technology down to peru and using local materials to replicate that very simple elegant technology of a spinning drum inside of a box and that s what i ve been doing initially through engineers without borders but then i created toilets for people to bring that worldwide so we re trying to take an innovation from the 1960s and 70s from scandinavia that has been tweaked and really perfected over time and bring that to a different environment a different geography with instead of permafrost problem they have a flooding problem gudwin so if a pit latrine s twenty bucks how much are you able to do the self composting toilets for and as you re looking at the lower income communities where do you see the most potential for replication and sort of that demand and uptake of this particular technology kass so if anyone s really interested in buying a spinning drum composting toilet and looks online they can run a thousand dollars to 2 000 our toilets cost between 50 100 depending on the local market basically if people are able to a lot of times we ll make the toilets out of wood so if they re able to cut their wood themselves using chainsaws and then they can get it you know for 50 which is very affordable and comparable to a lot of other technologies and we re vyas are you able to locally source the materials for these toilets kass exactly so what we do is we bring a template with us it s an open source technology and then we find local components that are either functional equivalents of the ones we have or the same ones if they have it and then we build it so it s always a little different and it s adaptable and it s able to be maintained and fixed if ever needed because all the supply chains are local gudwin and so when you re coming into a community and you re putting these kinds of toilets in where do you start are you starting in houses are you starting in schools like where do you where do you start kass a lot of times it s gudwin and how many do you have to do to normalize it kass right so yeah normalizing it is really the end goal what we are usually called in is for schools that s typically where there s money and interest in getting toilet facilities for kids in school especially if they re being built anew and a lot of time we ll put in urinals for boys and pee toilets for girls and a certain number of composting toilets that can treat both because a lot of times the kids just need a place to pee that s clean and hygienic and urine is generally speaking sterile so it can go right into the ground and pee toilets you can make that for about 10 very simple and sometimes the kids wait to go home to do number two so that s where we start and we feel like that s a great place for us to because then the kids see it they get to see a toilet for the first time in their lives often and then the parents come in for like pta meetings and they see it and then that s a way of getting interest and getting triggering the community to say oh i could have one of these in my house and then the next piece is we ll train local craftsmen how to make the toilets for the school and then the idea is that they would carry on and we work through partners on location to make more toilets and maybe make a business for themselves and ideally what we d like to see down the road are vocational training centers where they re taught how to make all kinds of toilets pit latrine toilets that are safe that aren t maybe enormous and difficult to engineer and even pour flush toilets that are going to a soak pit that isn t so deep that it s contaminating the groundwater and then composting toilets so gudwin so in the spirit of talking about building toilets india s building a hundred million of them so sangita talk to us a little bit about modi and the indian government so modi launched a campaign to build a hundred million toilets in rural areas by october of 2019 how are we doing and if we build it will people use it vyas yeah so four years ago in 2014 the indian government announced a very big sanitation policy the swachh bharat mission to eliminate open defecation not just build a hundred million toilets but eliminate open defecation in india gudwin which means there are police in the mornings going around stopping people from going in the fields ok yeah vyas that happens gudwin it happens vyas so in 2014 when this was announced about 65 to 70 percent of rural indians defecated in the open so that just gives you a sense of how big of a challenge this was and still is and so you know we re four years down the line and india s supposed to be odf open defecation free in october of this year but what has the what has been achieved well that was a big question for my colleagues and i at r i c e and recently we revisited households in rural north india we originally had visited these households in 2014 just before the swachh bharat mission the sanitation campaign started and a big question for us was ok what has the sbm done on the ground and so through this fieldwork we talked to about or we you know asked about the behaviors of about 10 000 people in the rural parts of four north indian states and so our sample our survey results are representative of about one fifth of india s rural population and what we found is that yeah well the government has managed to build a whole lot of toilets so latrine ownership increased it basically doubled gudwin and these are family latrines or they re community latrines or both vyas they re family latrines yeah so it s i mean in urban areas i think that they have been constructing community latrines but india is still primarily rural it s 70 percent rural and so most of the investment on the sbm has been in rural areas and those have been individual household latrines and so toilet ownership increased a lot to about 70 percent of the rural of rural households and because of that increase in latrine ownership there has been an acceleration in the reduction of open defecation and that s a good thing but still nevertheless about 50 percent of the rural indians in this area that we revisited defecate in the open so it is still a very big problem and many people gudwin so why why is that vyas because the government has been constructing latrines that are while they are much fancier than latrines that are commonly built and used in other developing countries in the world they are still considered to have subjectively small pits and people are worried about emptying these pits and so people don t want to use them gudwin so it all comes back so it doesn t come back to because there s a little bit of the morning ritual right of particularly for men going out into the field going for a walk but it s really tied so first of all just put this into context put it into the context of the morning rituals the family wakes up and how far are they walking to vyas people often walk about a kilometer or two away early in the morning and they it s very much a part of the rural indian lifestyle you wake up in the morning you go out into the fields to defecate you come back you take a bath you eat your breakfast gudwin so the convenience the convenience of having it right near your home is not enough to overcome the other psychological pending trauma of having of the emptying of the latrine pit vyas exactly yeah that s right and so that s a big part of the reason why so many people still defecate in the open despite the fact that they ve received a latrine from the government another important thing that we found in our survey was that threats and coercion were commonly used by local government officials in the process of getting households to accept these latrines so in our survey we asked people we asked respondents whether they were ever harassed while going to the open whether they were ever prevented from going in the open whether they were ever fined or threatened with a fine whether they were ever threatened with the denial of their government benefits like food rations or pensions for the elderly and what we found is that over half of our respondents were aware of some form of threat or coercion happening in their village and about 12 percent of our respondents personally experienced some threat or coercive activity gudwin so what you re saying is coercive tactics aren t working is what you re saying vyas coercive tactics aren t working and also the improvement that we have seen in open defecation the marginal improvement is may not be sustained because that improvement occurred through the use of threats and coercion so once that pressure is lifted who knows if people will continue to use these latrines gudwin got it ok let me we re going to open up for questions in just a minute but i want to come back to you jeff and pull back up to the global level for a second so in order to fund the water and sanitation gap or even just the sanitation gap the world needs 1 1 billion of no 114 billion of investment annually can you talk to us a little bit about the financing mechanisms that are being deployed and that you are working on and really importantly what it s like to try to spend tens and hundreds of millions of dollars at a time to get these to make a dent in this kind of a problem goldberg yeah it s a it s a great question and i think when you consider that figure of 114 billion per year through 2030 relative to the 435 million per year that we re spending it s a sobering organizing principle for us that you know we do have a sizeable appropriation and budget but relative to the need we really need to be thinking about how we can enable and catalyze other investment towards both water and in particular sanitation given how much it s lagging behind so the biggest thing that we talk a lot about is that there is actually more money available than projects and i think that that s that orientation is helpful in the sense that often when we talk about the funding gap we initially go to well what s the funding instrument and how can we structure those instruments to get more funding into the sector but the true problem in the sanitation sector right now is that there s a dearth of bankable projects the risk is perceived as too high and a lot of that gudwin and when you say bankable project like how big is a bankable project like what kind of volumes are we talking about goldberg i mean that could be so there s yeah sure so that can range anywhere from a small medium enterprise providing the latrines that we were just talking about before we have seen a huge uptake in private sector actors welling latrines and sanitation products particularly in south and southeast asia but then at a larger scale it also includes private operators and manual emptiers of latrines to safely transport and treat waste so those are larger scale financial transactions to support the business operations of those types of private operators and that gets into addressing some of those issues that we were talking about earlier that at an individual and community level it is very very taboo for community members to be conducting that emptying but there is a huge private sector opportunity to be had in professionalizing those services so when we re looking at financial transactions our primary role within usaid when we re looking at this particular space of financing is how we can help de risk whether it s a small medium enterprise or a larger private operator or even a public utility in an urban area that is providing sanitation services and making sure that they have a business plan in place so that they can approach a commercial bank or an impact investor to be able to secure more resources so our role as we see it relative to this large funding gap is to really serve as kind of an interlocutor between the private sanitation operators enterprises and larger utilities that need access to capital to be able to expand their services but it really is kind of starting with those core fundamentals of if you re serving x number of people and charging 20 a latrine how many what s the volume of sales that you need to be selling in a business plan such that if that small medium enterprises pitches that to a commercial bank that it s viewed as a bankable opportunity gudwin great thank you for that ok questions there are please wait for the mic and if you could stand state your name and affiliation sir q larry bridwell pace university i ve been told but i don t know if it s accurate or not that one of the great challenges facing india so this question is directed to sangita vyas is that thirteen fourteen year old girls don t want to go to school because they don t have proper sanitation facilities so i could you address that issue vyas yeah so sanitation in schools is an important issue i think now it is the case that most schools in india do have some kind of toilet but unfortunately having a toilet is different from that toilet being able to be used so many of those toilets in my own fieldwork in rural north india i ve seen many rural schools have toilets that are locked and i think a big issue with toilets in schools particularly in india again goes back to this issue of caste cleaning a toilet is something that caste indians would not want to themselves do and so when if a toilet in a school is used then there is a problem you know a few weeks later when the toilet needs to be cleaned and maintained and gudwin can we talk about the what you were talking about which is that there are some toilets that have two pits by design to try to how many of those schools are using double pit toilets and what s the opportunity there vyas i think a lot of the i m not sure but i believe that a lot of the school toilets are they probably have septic tanks so the issue is less about the cleaning of the pit and more about just maintaining the yeah maintaining the room where the toilet actually is so that that area stays clean and you know historically well not too long ago it was the case that maintaining you know cleaning the school cleaning the school room cleaning potentially a toilet if the school had a toilet was something was a task that was given to any lower caste students who were in the school and that is slowly changing and i would not want that i wouldn t want to go back in history and have that continue so there you know i think that again it goes back to this issue of people s beliefs in ritual purity and that s an important part of not just household sanitation but also toilets in schools and in other public places too gudwin and just while we re talking about schools it s probably worth mentioning that the standard is to deworm children every six months because of the high level of soil transmitted helminths so worms in the belly which is directly linked to the open defecation issue vyas right so when people defecate in the open then there s feces in the environment and because many people because you know even rural india is still so densely populated that even if you re going in the open flies go sit on the feces that s out in the open and then comes back and sits on people s food sits on their hands and sits on water et cetera that is supposed to be meant for drinking so there is just a high disease burden in this environment and that s really bad for children so open defecation has been has been linked to child development so children who grow up in places where there is a higher density of open defecation are shorter than children who grow up in areas where there s a lower density of open defecation and that s because the mechanism here is that you know when people are exposed to these harmful bacteria they get sick either through worms they get diarrhea they have diseases that don t necessarily manifest as either worms or diarrhea but prevent nutrients from being absorbed by the gut and so basically what that means is that the food that a child is eating is not going towards developing physically and developing cognitively it s being lost to disease and that prevents children from growing as tall as they you know as their genetic potential gudwin right so you get widespread stunting let me keep going with questions in the back of the room there was a question and then i ll and then i ll let you jump in jason q hi my name is gopal i grew up in india and i ve done a project in the urban area in india in mumbai i did like a year long project about sanitation in slums the same numbers you talked about so in urban areas it s more damaging than the rural because 60 percent of the urban population lives in slums you won t believe it and slums cannot afford to have a single toilet per home you have to have a community toilet and the government does build toilets but you know if you take the caste stigma and decouple that from caste so what we found was most of these toilets were not maintained the maintenance was a problem because one they could not be there won t be a water supply or the as you said the stigma around you know we ve been defecating in the open for so long i ll just keep continuing going to the it s mostly the railway tracks like mumbai has these trains train networks now that s where most people go and they don t have a lot of and it s a lot of population concentrated in a very few place very i mean a very highly dense area right but that s one of the things we found and one of the one of the concepts they kind of introduced i mean this was ten years back and i haven t been in touch but they kind of formed like a community kind of like an hoa so that s what i can relate it to it s kind of like an association for slums slum owners you know you maintain this toilet and you know it worked like to an extent of 50 percent but no i want to understand your thought behind how would you solve this in an urban area because with climate change i ve been seeing that most of the population have been moving to the urban areas and there s no a lot of there s not really any farming activity in india and most the farmers are in debt no it s eventually they have to move to urban areas you know that s it s kind of part of the an inevitable part of the climate migration right so what kind of strategies are you following and hearing about a waterless toilet might be a solution but i want to hear from you what are the solutions for gudwin jeff do you want to jump in there and then jason do you want goldberg yeah i m happy to jump in and it s actually so in talking about the swachh bharat campaign we ve talked a lot about the rural side of the equation but usaid has partnered with the government of india through the ministry of housing and urban affairs specifically to tackle the urban side of the open defecation problem and this very ambitious target and so to your question on different types of urban approaches you know toilet maintenance is absolutely part of the equation and it s something that we re looking at but i alluded to this in the beginning the larger problem that is happening is that as these latrines fill up in densely populated slums there is no system in place for fecal sludge management or septage management there s a complete absence of sewers there and there s been a lot of very interesting research that our partners at the gates foundation have undertaken costing out that over the longer term in densely populated slum areas it would be far more expensive to install sewers than to address what we call on site sanitation or management of the fecal sludge from the toilet through manual emptying and desludging so that is something that we have very very actively been in partnership with the gates foundation and the government of india pushing is different approaches for fecal sludge management or non sewered options to sanitation and really there is what i was alluding to is the private sector as a critical partner in that to be able to look at professionalized ways for desludging that are safe as well there s a lot of occupational safety issues involved with this so that s a particular area that we have been partnering with the government of india on and we re quite excited about gudwin and jason do you want to jump in also on the issue of private versus block latrines so in an urban area or in a refugee camp setting or in sort of like post earthquake haiti there was a lot conversation about do you build a community latrine do you build a block latrine and give it to a set of a families with a key you know what s been your experience kass yeah i just wanted to backtrack a little bit to talk about it s not in the india context necessarily but we do a lot of work in peru and haiti and girls in school not having a place to go to the bathroom there s some very simple interventions that i alluded to before like having a pee toilet a place where they just need to pee a place where they could change their pads a place that s pleasant that s private that has a mirror that has a door that has a lock on it and those having that available to them means that they re going to be more likely to drink water during the day because a lot of girls don t drink water because they know there s no place to pee so they become dehydrated which impacts their ability to pay attention it also increases urinary tract infections and with kidney damage so very simple interventions like that can really help girls feel more comfortable going to school and also drink water and take care of themselves in the way that they need to so that s one aspect of that in terms of informal settlements in the urban context we really advocate for family scale toilets in particular we have a dry composting toilet and we see that as being more advantageous than public toilets for obvious reasons that public toilets just usually fall into disrepair just like they do here if somebody s not taking care of a toilet whether it s at starbucks or at a gas station it becomes pretty foul pretty quickly and you could understand why somebody also might prefer to open defecate as opposed to use a facility like that because it s disgusting and so that s part of the problem and it s hard to upkeep those public toilets because you have to pay somebody to do it and it rapidly gets out of control it s like a tragedy of the commons kind of situation so whether it s an informal settlement or you were mentioning refugee camps a lot of times the stock approach is to have a toilet block in the corner of the camp where everybody goes but a lot of these camps people might be living in for many years seventeen years is an average that i ve heard in terms of how long they ll be there so as quickly as possible if you can get private family scale toilets to folks that are in these settings they re going to be better maintained because they re going to be maintained by the people that are using them and not be public toilets and also those areas of the camp end up being areas that become dangerous where it s just unsafe to go there especially for kids or for women so we want to try to see if there s a way we can shift that approach to have more of those close to home toilets that aren t so dangerous and scary gudwin great come down there and then go back q bonnie potter i manage a small family foundation with funds in east africa and west africa so i m just a little confused because we talked about all the different kinds of toilets there are and yet you seem to use the term interchangeably for a lot of different kinds of toilets so is there a particular kind of toilet we re talking about when you talk about toilets in schools or toilets in families or whatever or could you just clarify that kass yeah well i mean i think i think a big differentiator between toilets is you have toilets where they re water based and a lot of times if they have if they re going to like a septic take they ll break down anaerobically which makes the sewer smell and then the toilets we make are aerobic composing toilets so those are two different kinds but essentially if the standard toilet is a pit latrine which is a hole in the ground and a lot of people want to get flush toilets but a lot of times there s a no place for that toilet that water to go so that becomes more it might go right into the river it s not going to go to a wastewater treatment plant because those are too expensive so those are two of the more popular ones and then the composting toilets is another one goldberg yeah i might just is there another question q so when you all are talking about toilets you re mostly talking about latrines gudwin yeah we re mostly not we re mostly not talking flushable vyas well kass yeah but one way of coupling the composting toilets can be used in conjunction with pit latrines a lot of times the problem with pit latrines is they re open so a lot of trash goes in there and they fill up quickly unnecessarily a composting toilet is maybe situated above that pit latrine so this is where you can bring two technologies together it ll pre compost the waste so that it will fall into the pit and it ll instead of emptying it every five years you can maybe get ten years out of that pit or more so it might alleviate some of the trauma and fear about it filling up too early also you can t get garbage in there because you have this interface so there s ways of making pit latrines more effective and getting more longevity out of them so it s nuanced in terms of the technologies could come together and be combined gudwin and jeff do you want to jump in goldberg i might just yeah sure just from i thought it might be helpful from kind of a donor agency perspective when we look at this we are a little bit more technology agnostic and we go to what you referred to in your introduction ella about that definition what is either an improved or basic latrine so the standard setting internationally for toilets is conducted by unicef and the world health organization something called the joint monitoring program and they have something called the sanitation service ladder and that goes all the way from the bottom which is open defecation to open defecation free to an improved or basic latrine which is simply just defined as a latrine that hygienically separates human feces from exposure to the user and so what we have been talking about here is a range of technological options that fit within that category of improved and that on our side it absolutely does include flush latrines but it also can be a simple lined pit latrine with a slab that hygienically separates the excreta from human exposure so the way that we track our results across gudwin and jeff can i just ask goldberg sure gudwin can i jump in and ask one of the other important things that has been added to the pit latrine if i m not mistaken is somebody has come up with a lever that will actually close the latrine after it s been used so that the flies don t go in i think that s one of the important relatively recent changes to a standard pit latrine to prevent the flies goldberg yeah that certainly exists it certainly depends on the context too i mean depending on what country you re in but we are seeing more of that gudwin yeah great two over here let s do let s do a double q hi rachel robbins formerly with ifc of the world bank group so jeffrey your toilet sounds like a vast improvement not only over open defecation but even the pit latrines with all the improvements but 100 or even 50 is expensive for a lot of the developing world so my question to you and to jason is is there a prototype of financing because i agree that you absolutely need the private sector to close this funding gap s there is an example that you ve seen whether it s a blended finance model that brings in soft capital private sector international money to make these more affordable gudwin great and we ll just pick up a second question and then we ll answer both q thank you very much robert scott adelphi university it seems to me this is not an issue of toilets or technology but it s a matter of behavior influenced by cultural norms so what are the ways in which the government or other organizations are approaching the populations in discussion of an exchange of values these are the cultural values you have in this behavior and here are consequences a change in the behavior can result in in fact improved values having to do with education and growth et cetera so what are the cultural approaches being taken there s lots of technology and lots of toilets the issue is human behavior gudwin ok great so we ll start with financing and then we ll go to behavior jason do you want to start kass sure i would say in terms of yeah 50 is too expensive for a lot of the communities we work with where people are making a dollar or two dollars a day so what we ask is that the family come up with two weeks salary two weeks pay that they have a number of months to save for and so that if they make a dollar a day that might be you know 10 and then the partner that we work with will subsidize the difference in order to help them get a toilet and then we can also work with them in terms of if they have materials they can donate in the construction of the toilet we also ask them to build the structure that s going to house the toilet because they know how to do that and they have the resources to do that usually they built their own home so in those two ways we re able to make it affordable and accessible to pretty much anybody but what we don t want to do is make it free then by definition it has no value and they re not going to value it and also it s a good litmus test to see if they really want a toilet if somebody you know if i have something free everybody s hand goes up i want one i want one well if it s 10 then you get maybe half the hands going up and that s an important way of you know you were talking about the second question in terms of changing the culture sometimes it s getting those first adopters to get toilets and then people see other folks with toilets and then they say oh the new person on the block has a private toilet they don t have to go to the toilet block that can be a way of behavior change and then the other way i would say is with starting with women and girls and children in general men generally speaking might be completely comfortable with open defecation but in our experience at least in latin america a lot of the mothers really want a private toilet because it takes a lot of effort for them to bring the kids to the public latrine or to the fields and taking care of the elderly folks that are in the community so if you start with them they are the change makers and the men might lag behind and eventually catch up but i think that s another way of solving that issue gudwin jeff do you want to jump in on the financing question and then sangita let s come back to the values exchange goldberg yeah sure the financing question is a great one and you re absolutely right that you know anywhere from 20 to 50 to 100 depending where you re working can be prohibitive for households to actually purchase a latrine so we actually have experience deploying a range of different types of financing options we have had some of our implementing partners directly brokering relationships with microfinance institutions so at the point of sale of a latrine credit is offered on the spot as well and there s been a lot of strong lessons learned there about needing to work directly with the microfinance institution to have a dedicated loan product for water and sanitation we ve worked a lot with a partner water org on that in particular but in addition to microfinance we ve worked with village savings and loans groups it doesn t actually have to be through a formal financial institution so there s things like household revolving funds that can be used to allocate money towards sanitation and then lastly an important piece of new research that we have been tracking is looking at vouchers for poor households so in cambodia in particular there is a system in place where there s already a national identification program for households that are living below the poverty line that is idpoor 1 and idpoor 2 and we are working there through that private sector approach that i mentioned earlier where we are having small medium enterprises sell latrines but upon successful delivery of the latrine to a household that is idpoor 1 or idpoor 2 there s a voucher and renumeration that can happen to bring the cost of that down for the households that keeps the quality side for the private sector but does allow a targeted subsidy to households that need it most so those are just some innovations but it s an excellent question i did have one point on the behavior and cultural norms side of things because i think that that s a huge huge part of this and really can t be overlooked and so anytime that we are doing sanitation programming we are always doing baseline work on knowledge attitudes and practices at the community level and while this isn t true across the board you know some of the work that we ve done in southeast asia in particular has been very very eye opening in the sense that when we talk about sanitation from a development perspective we think of the health outcomes as being the most important part but we have found through those surveys that households do not really respond very well to health messaging it s more of sanitation being an aspirational product that is something that they want to aspire to due to social status it s kind of like the equivalent of how we would think of a nice car here in the u s so developing and tailoring that kind of messaging in tandem with promotion of latrine adoption has been hugely successful there and it s highly context dependent but just in terms of those behavior and cultural norms i think there are some core assumptions that we need to check ourselves as development professionals because the communities that we see to work with don t necessarily view it the same way gudwin great so we just have a couple minutes left i think there were some other questions yeah sir q charles henderson at aig regarding jason your toilets would they be adaptable to places like india or are we going to run into the same problem about the waste issue and if that s not adaptable how do you confront the waste issue it seems to me that the program that s being involved now only reduced it from 65 to 50 percent and you re still faced with that particular waste issue until you get that stigma that waste issue addressed you re still going to have that problem gudwin while you re talking about that can you also mention what s going on with the group soil yeah kass yeah absolutely so i think the in terms of adapting it to the india context one is that it s a squatting culture as opposed to a sitting culture so making it so that there s a place you can step up and having a place for the wash water because they clean with water as opposed to with toilet paper so there s some modifications technological modifications and those are some of the things that we do on the ground on location to make it appropriate in that context using local materials and local labor so that s one way of adapting the technology to the india context in terms of emptying one solution could be like we were saying before in terms of it s built above a pit that s otherwise being used because they re afraid it s going to fill up it could the waste could then just fall into the pit and it would fill up much slower so that s one way of addressing that issue the other is that the actual handling of the waste can be very dangerous if you re a pit latrine emptier and you have to get into the pit jeff was talking before about just health and safety issues are a real concern it s dangerous work whereas we try to make our emptying of the contain as hygienic and simple as possible it doesn t weight any more than twenty pounds when it s full there s a lid it s a plastic like a busboy container so it can be collected and like you were saying before one model of that is in haiti there s a great organization called soil where they do collection of waste in containers they bring it to a central processing facility where they can render compost that can become fertilizer and then be sold as a product and they re also doing that in kenya sanivation sangery are some other examples and that takes away the stigma there can be a company that s created to collect that waste and those entrepreneurs are doing that work as opposed to it s a way of getting around the cultural issues by making it into a business it s a business opportunity and you re not actually coming into contact with the waste because it s all in a container and with a lid on it so those are some of the ways that we are looking to try to address that gudwin all right i think we re going to sneak in one last question q i was raised in dutchess county and had a pit latrine in school until the fourth grade and i can tell bob scott that from a cultural point of view when indoor plumbing came it was a wonderful period of time in my education laughter so do not undervalue the cultural aspects and i must say i never thought that this issue would come up at the council laughter gudwin well sangita do you want to just close on any final thought about the particularly knowing that october is coming all of these latrines are being built what is the campaign message what works vyas well i think it s important to recognize that yes october 2019 is coming but india isn t going to be open defecation free then and so as we think about what india s future sanitation policy should look at we should really take heed of the cultural issues and i wish that i could sit here now and say that well i have a silver bullet to solve india s cultural issues relating to ritual purity and caste but i don t i think a lot more research and experimentation needs to happen and that s what we should be putting money into there are a number of projects that are currently underway as we are speaking that are experimenting with different behavioral messages around latrine pits around pit emptying around how it s not an impure thing to do and i am you know very excited to hear about the results of those and hopefully that takes us a step further in understanding what are the strategies the behavioral strategies that we can start implementing on the ground in rural india to try to convince rural indians that simple latrines are worth using and having gudwin great thank you kass just in the spirit of innovating and experimenting and talking about staying technology agnostic as jeff was talking about really having trying to find funding for vocational training centers where they teach all kinds of toilet technologies because in different situations different things are applicable and have incubators for these kinds of experimenting and innovations to take place is critical and we have those here i mean toilets for people grew out of makerspace and having those kinds of vocational training spaces where there are tools available and support are critical no matter what technology is going to be used gudwin great well thank you join me in thanking jeff goldberg jason kass and sangita vyas thank you very much applause thanks for coming end

country zambia s flagship copper project lumwana mine was commissioned in december 2008 and has been a successful project producing 125 000 metric tonnes in 2015 alone zambia also hosts small scale gold coal manganese and zinc deposits in recent years exploration has significantly expanded throughout zambia to include prospecting for non traditional minerals such as nickel and uranium with some exploration for diamonds the country s first nickel mine became operational in 2008 zambia is also renowned for its gemstones and ranks as one of the world s leading producers of high quality stones recent exploration work has also revealed the presence of significant deposits of coal bed methane having undergone a severe decline in the late 1980s and early 1990s the mining sector had begun to perform well when productivity was severely affected by the global economic downturn in 2008 which had a negative impact on the global mining industry in general the decline in commodity prices between 2015 and 2016 also had a negative impact on zambia s mining productivity the recent resurgence of copper prices however presents an opportunity for increased productivity in the next few years since independence in 1964 the mining industry has provided the traditional base for the country s foreign exchange earnings and continues to be the major contributor to export receipts accounting for more than 70 per cent of zambia s export earnings as at 2017 the mining sector and its support industries provide major employment and the infrastructure backbone to areas that would otherwise lack the impetus for sustained development target minerals what are the target minerals the target minerals are mainly base metals platinum group metals uranium and gold however the ministry of mines mining cadastre office has reported a recent increase in exploration applications for the mining of manganese lead and zinc as well as cobalt which are metals that are traditionally used for the development of battery technologies regions which regions are most active concentration of mining activity in zambia has recently diversified out of the copperbelt province into virtually all the other nine provinces but mainly the north western province largely viewed as the new copperbelt southern province luapula province central province and eastern province for a more detailed view of the spread of mining activity around zambia refer to the zambia mining cadastre portal at legal and regulatory structure basis of legal system is the legal system civil or common law based the zambian legal system is based on the common law tradition most of its private and public law has followed the english legal system or has been heavily influenced by it zambian civil procedure is influenced by english law and is reliant upon many of the english civil procedures and practices regulation how is the mining industry regulated zambia s mining industry is principally regulated by the government through the mines and minerals development act no 11 of 2015 the mines act and the regulations issued thereunder the mines act provides for the administration of the mining sector and includes the establishment of the offices of the director of mines who is the chief administrator and is responsible for supervising and regulating the proper and effectual development of mines and conduct of mining operations in accordance with the provisions of the mines act the office of the director of geological survey who is responsible for undertaking the geological mapping of zambia and the exploration operations on behalf of the republic advising the minister on geological matters and providing data concerning the geology and mineral resources of zambia assisting members of the public on information concerning geological matters and maintaining such laboratory and library and record facilities as may be necessary for the performance of the functions under the mines act the director of mines safety who supervises matters relating to the environment public health and safety in exploration mineral processing and mining operations and the director of mining cadastre who is responsible for the administration of mining rights and mineral processing licences the mines act also establishes a mining licensing committee which considers applications for mining and non mining rights and all matters related to the administration of mining and non mining rights eg suspension termination or amendment of the licences the committee also advises the minister on all matters related to its functions under the mines act what are the principal laws that regulate the mining industry what are the principal regulatory bodies that administer those laws were there any major amendments in the past year the principal law regulating the mining industry apart from the mines act is the environmental management act no 12 of 2011 the environmental act and the regulations issued thereunder the primary regulatory body for the mining sector is the ministry of mines and minerals development the ministry the ministry has several departments that supervise activities within the sector the environmental act is administered by the zambia environmental management agency zema there have been no amendments to the principal laws regulating the mining industry in the past year classification system what classification system does the mining industry use for reporting mineral resources and mineral reserves zambia does not have a national classification system for reporting mineral resources and mineral reserves ideally the department of mineral development should have in place a system for reporting mineral resources and mineral reserves such a national system is yet to be developed zambia has also not adopted any other classification systems used in other jurisdictions however zambia has developed a mineral production monitoring support project with funding from the european union the objective of this project is to help improve and strengthen the ministry s capacity to monitor mining and mineral activity in zambia zambia is also developing a database called the mineral output statistical evaluation system aimed at improving efficiency and transparency in the reporting of mineral production output by mines in zambia this is expected to be finalised in 2019 mining rights and title state control over mining rights to what extent does the state control mining rights in your jurisdiction can those rights be granted to private parties and to what extent will they have title to minerals in the ground are there large areas where the mining rights are held privately or which belong to the owner of the surface rights is there a separate legal regime or process for third parties to obtain mining rights in those areas following the completion of the privatisation of the mining sector in zambia in 2000 mining in zambia is predominantly private sector driven the state transformed the parastatal agency that owned virtually all the productive mines and tenements before 2000 into an investment company known as zambia consolidated copper mines investment holdings which retains minority interests in most large scale mining projects however all the large scale mines in zambia as well as most prospective tenements are in private hands with constitutionally protected title to minerals discovered or won the state deliberately promotes a policy of a private sector driven mining industry there is a clear distinction between mining rights and surface rights under zambian law with the former largely dominating the latter as a superior right although a fairly robust compensation mechanism exists for addressing surface rights that predate the mining right there is generally one regime for administering all mining rights the mines act and another regime for administering all surface rights in zambia the lands act chapter 184 of the laws of zambia publicly available information and data what information and data are publicly available to private parties that wish to engage in exploration and other mining activities is there an agency which collects mineral assessment reports from private parties must private parties file mineral assessment reports does the agency or the government conduct geoscience surveys which become part of the database is the database available online the intention under the mines act is to render all information in the sector publicly available to private parties although this is not the case in reality the ministry is both the repository and depository of information and data for the mining sector all mining and exploration activities are required to be collected and lodged by mining right holders with the ministry both the government and the private sector may conduct geosciences surveys although the latter is precluded from undertaking such surveys without the consent of the ministry or over areas where there are existing mining rights basic information and data on mining activities and mineralisation are available at this interface provides information such as details of mining licences that are active in zambia acquisition of rights by private parties what mining rights may private parties acquire how are these acquired what obligations does the rights holder have if exploration or reconnaissance licences are granted does such tenure give the holder an automatic or preferential right to acquire a mining licence what are the requirements to convert to a mining licence all mining rights are acquired in accordance with the provisions of the mines act mining rights under the mines act consist of a mining licence or an exploration licence a person may therefore only prospect for minerals or carry on mining operations under the authority of a mining right granted under the mines act all mining rights are acquired by application to the director of mines cadastre by submitting a prescribed form and paying the prescribed fee by either an individual or a company mining rights are granted on a first come first served basis by either the director of mines or the director of geological survey where the application meets the requirements of the mines act the following mining rights may be acquired an exploration licence and a mining licence the mines act also provides for non mining rights which are a mineral processing licence mineral trading permit mineral import permit mineral export permit and a gold panning certificate the mines act confers obligations on specific licence holders as follows exploration licence the area of land over which an application for an exploration licence is made should be represented by complete and specific cadastre units the minimum size of a small scale exploration area is three cadastre units approximately 0 1km2 and this cannot exceed 300 cadastre units approximately 10 2km2 for large scale exploration the minimum area of exploration is 300 cadastre units approximately 10 2km2 while the maximum area must not exceed 59 880 cadastre units approximately 1 999km2 a holder of an exploration licence ie a company and its subsidiaries may not hold a number of licences whose accumulated total area is more than 299 400 cadastre units approximately 9 999km2 a company that accumulates an exploration area in excess of 149 700 cadastre units approximately 4 999km2 must pay prescribed additional fees exploration licences are valid for a period of four years and can be renewed for two further periods of three years each the maximum period of an initial exploration licence is 10 years the holder of an exploration licence has the following obligations commence exploration operations only once a decision letter written approval in respect of the environmental project brief approved by the zema has been submitted to the mining cadastre office register a pegging certificate within 180 days of acquiring or being granted the exploration licence expend on exploration operations not less than the amount prescribed or required by the terms of the licence to be so expended carry on exploration operations in accordance with the programme of exploration operations notify the director of mining cadastre of the discovery of the mineral to which the exploration licence relates within a period of 30 days of such discovery backfill or otherwise make safe any excavation made during the course of the exploration operations as the director of mining cadastre may specify permanently preserve and safeguard any borehole in a manner directed by the director and to surrender to government without compensation the drill cores mineral samples the boreholes and any water rights in respect therefore on termination unless the director stipulates otherwise to remove within 60 days of the expiry of the exploration licence any camp temporary buildings or machinery installed or erected or make good any damage occasioned to the ground on account of such removal and maintain full and accurate records of the exploration operations and submit them quarterly to the ministry indicating the boreholes drilled the strata penetrated the minerals discovered the results of any seismic survey or geochemical geophysical and remote sensing data analysis the result of any analysis or identification of minerals removed from the exploration area the geological interpretations of records maintained on the above matters the number of persons employed any other exploration work the costs incurred such other matters as may be prescribed by the minister in a statutory instrument and furnish the directors at least every quarter with digital and hard copies of the records mining licence a mining licence applies to anyone intending to carry on any artisanal small or large scale mining an application for a mining licence is made to the director of mining cadastre in a prescribed manner and form and upon payment of a prescribed fee the period for which a mining licence is granted depends on the category or class of mining to be undertaken these are as follows two years for artisanal mining 10 years for small scale mining and 25 years for large scale mining artisanal mining may only be undertaken by zambian citizens or cooperatives wholly composed of zambian citizens small scale mining may only be undertaken by citizen owned citizen influenced or citizen empowered companies a citizen owned company coc is one where 50 1 per cent of its equity is owned by citizens and in which the citizens have control of the management of the company a citizen influenced company cic is one where 5 25 per cent of its equity is owned by citizens who also have significant control of the management of the company and a citizen empowered company cec is one where 25 50 per cent of its equity is owned by citizens the mines act confers the following obligations on holders of mining licences register a pegging certificate within 180 days of being granted the mining licence develop the mining area and carry on mining operations with due diligence and in compliance with the programme of mining operations and the environmental impact assessment eia take all measures on or under the surface to mine the mineral to which the licence refers with respect to large scale mining implement the local business undertaking attached to the mining licence as well as employ and train zambian citizens in accordance with the proposal attached to the licence comply with the proposed forecast of capital investment permit inspection of the books and records maintained by an authorised officer submit to the director of mining cadastre reports records and other information that may be required maintain accurate technical records of the mining area copies of all geological reports accurate and systemic financial records and books of accounts of the mining

specified maintain security of the licensee s tenements submit annual mine plans sections primary and secondary developments ore recovery and treatment and production costs to the demarcate of the mining area in the prescribed manner and maintain complete and accurate technical records of the operations in the mining area with copies of all maps and geological reports the holder of an exploration licence has a preferential but not an automatic right to acquire a subsequent mining right the mines act gives the holder of an exploration licence the opportunity to apply for a mining licence within the exploration area such application should be made to the director of mines in the prescribed form and upon payment of a prescribed fee it appears that the conversion of an exploration licence to a mining licence would be achieved through making an application for such a mining licence within six months before the expiry of the exploration licence an application for a mining licence must include the following to be accepted a statement of the period for which the licence is sought a statement of the minerals to be mined under the licence a comprehensive statement

under the income tax act a plan of the proposed mining area prepared in such manner and showing such particulars as the director of mines may require and such further information as the director of geological survey may require for the disposal of the application in addition to the above the mines act also requires an applicant to commission and produce for the director of mines an environmental impact study on the proposed mining operations approved by the zema further the holder of a small scale prospecting permit may at any time during the currency of the permit apply to the director for a small scale mining licence over any part of the prospecting area in the prescribed manner and upon payment of the prescribed fee an application for such licence would include the following an identification of the relevant prospecting permit a description and sketch of the area of land not exceeding 180 cadastre units over which the small scale mining licence is sought sufficient to enable identification of the area a description of the proposed programme of mining operations which shall include a forecast of investment the estimated recovery rate of ore and the applicant s proposal for

exceeding 10 years for which the small scale mining licence is sought a tax clearance certificate under the income tax act and such other information as the director may require for the disposal of the application non mining rights mineral processing licence the holder of a mineral processing licence is granted exclusive rights to carry on mineral processing in the mineral processing area specified in the licence the following obligations are attached to a mineral processing licence to commence mineral processing operations once approval has been granted by the zambia environmental agency in respect of the eia to carry on mineral processing operations in accordance with the approved programme of mineral processing operations to submit reports to the directors on sources of ore concentrates tailings slimes quantities and grade feed to provide the directors with reports on compliance with safety and environmental standards as well as labour and production returns and to submit any other records reports and other information that the directors may require concerning the operations of mineral processing gold panning certificate the holder of a gold panning certificate is granted exclusive rights to pan for gold over specified areas along water courses and bodies but is prohibited from excavating gold panning certificates are valid for a period of two years and confer the following obligations on a holder maintaining accurate and separate production and sales registers keeping daily records of production and sales indicating names of buyers permit numbers amount and value of gold sold submitting to the director of mines by the 15th day of each month true copies of all entries made in the production and sales in the preceding month making the records and minerals available within normal working hours for inspection by an authorised officer paying mineral royalties in accordance with the mines act and maintaining the panning area in accordance with the provisions of the environmental management act of 2011 mineral trading permit a mineral trading permit confers on the holder exclusive rights to trade in minerals a citizen citizen influenced company citizen empowered company or citizen owned company may apply for a mineral trading permit the permit is valid for a period of three years and is renewable a holder of a mineral trading permit has the following obligations maintaining accurate and separate mineral trading registers for the transactions for each mineral keeping daily records of buying selling or processing indicating the names of buyers and sellers their licence numbers and the amount and value of the minerals bought sold processed exported or imported submitting to the director of mines by the 15th of each month a true copy of all the entries made in the mineral trading register in the preceding month and making records and minerals available within normal working hours for inspection by an authorised officer mineral import and mineral export permits any person intending to import or export any mineral ore or mineral product is required to obtain a permit from the director of mines a holder of an import or export permit is required to submit to import or export returns in the prescribed form the permits are valid for a period of one year and are limited to the quantities specified on the permit renewal and transfer of mineral licences what is the regime for the renewal and transfer of mineral licences the renewal and transfer of rights relating to exploration and mining licences is governed by the provisions of the mines act and the mines regulations the mines regulations provide guidelines for the renewal of a mining right and mineral processing licence which is a non mining right under the mines act an application for renewal of a mining right or mineral processing licence is made as follows in the case of an exploration licence six months before expiry of the existing licence in the case of a mining licence three months for an artisanal licence six months before expiry for a small scale mining licence and one year before expiry in the case of a large scale mining licence and renewal of a mineral processing licence must be made one year before the expiry of the licence applications for a renewal of a mining right or mineral processing licence must be made in the prescribed form and submitted to the mining cadastre office the process for transferring or assigning a mining right or mineral processing licence is also provided for in the mines act and mine regulations the statute considers three means of transfer or assignment first the transfer or assignment of a share or shares in a company that holds a mining right or mineral processing licence second the transfer of control of a company that holds a mining right or mineral processing licence and third the transfer of a mining right or mineral processing licence an application for consent to transfer control in a company that holds a mining right or the transfer of the mining right ie the exploration or mining licence as the case may be is made in the prescribed form and submitted to the minister for consideration transfer of a mining right without first obtaining the consent of the minister as required by the mines act renders such transfer void an assignment or transfer can be made at any time during the tenure of the right but not less than 120 days before the expiry of the licence and must be accompanied by an application for a mining right or mineral processing licence for the prospective assignee or transferee duration of mining rights what is the typical duration of mining rights mining licences the period for which a mining licence is granted depends on the category or class of mining to be undertaken the mines act prescribes a period not exceeding 25 years for large scale mining a period not exceeding 10 years for small scale mining and a period not exceeding two years for artisanal mining these mining rights are all subject to renewal application for renewal must be made three months before expiry in the case of artisanal mining six months in the case of small scale mining and one year before expiry in the case of large scale mining exploration licences the mines act provides that an exploration licence shall be valid for an initial period of four years and can be renewed an additional two times for a period not exceeding three years each further the holder of an exploration licence must relinquish 50 per cent of the exploration area at each renewal the maximum duration of an exploration licence from initial grant is 10 years however an exploration licence for small scale exploration and gemstones other than diamonds is non renewable mining rights can be extended or renewed if following consideration of the extension or renewal application by the licensing committee the mining right holder has complied with the conditions attached to the licence and to the provisions of the mines act in general the mines act gives authority to the director of mines safety or director of mines to suspend production or close a mine and similarly to the licencing committee to suspend or revoke a mining licence the director of mines safety or director of mines may direct a mining licence older to suspend or curtail production or close the mine or a section of the mine for any of the following reasons contravention of a condition of the mining right that presents danger or imminent harm to persons within the exploration or mining area an unsafe working environment uncontrollable pollution of the area resulting from the mining operations force majeure a labour dispute that disrupts the mining operations if a licence holder obtained the mining right by fraud or submission of false information or statements if a licence holder contravenes a provision in the mines act any other written law relating to the mining right or any terms and conditions of the mining right if a licence holder fails to carry out mining in accordance with the approved plan of mining operations and the gross proceeds of sale of minerals from the mining area in any three successive years is less than half of the deemed turnover applicable to the mining licence in each of those years or fails to pay annual area charges or mineral royalty if false information is given on the recovery of ores and mineral products production costs or sale if a licence holder fails to execute the approved exploration programme in the case of a holder of an exploration licence if a licence holder has ceased to fulfil the eligibility requirements under the mines act or suspension of revocation is in the public interest the licencing committee may suspend or revoke a mining right if the holder does any of the following obtained the right by fraud or submission of false information or statements contravenes this act any other written law relating to the right or any terms and conditions of the right fails to carry out mining operations in accordance with the approved plan of mining operations and the gross proceeds of sale of minerals from the mining area in any three successive years is less than half of the deemed turnover applicable to the mining licence in each of those years give false information on the recovery of ores and mineral products production costs or sale fail to pay annual area charges fails to excuse the approved exploration programme in the case of a holder of an exploration licence has ceased to fulfil the eligibility requirements under the mines act or the suspension or revocation is in the public interest acquisition by domestic parties versus acquisition by foreign parties is there any distinction in law or practice between the mining rights that may be acquired by domestic parties and those that may be acquired by foreign parties as stated in question 10 artisanal mining is only permitted to be undertaken by a zambian citizen or a cooperative wholly composed of zambian citizens small scale mining may only be undertaken by a citizen owned citizen influenced or citizen empowered company gold panning certificates which are non mining rights are issued to citizens or cooperatives consisting only of zambian citizens there are however no such restrictions for large scale mining licences protection of mining rights how are mining rights protected are foreign arbitration awards in respect of domestic mining disputes freely enforceable in your jurisdiction the mines act protects mining rights by conferring on the holder exclusive rights to carry on exploration or mining or both a licence can only be cancelled or suspended by reasons of default or contravention of a condition of the mining right prior to cancellation or suspension the licence holder must have failed to remedy the default within the time allowed or where the default was not capable of remedy have failed to offer reasonable compensation further protection is provided by the zambian constitution which stipulates that property of any description can only be compulsorily acquired under the authority of an act of parliament that provides for payment of adequate compensation in addition foreign arbitration awards with respect to domestic disputes are freely enforceable in zambia subject only to a standard or universal list of public policy restrictions the arbitration act no 19 of 2000 provides that a foreign arbitration award is enforceable in zambia zambian courts will generally enforce an arbitral award rendered by a recognised arbitral institution as a legal valid and binding submission to the arbitration in accordance with the rules of such recognised arbitral institution arbitral awards will be enforced by the zambian courts if rendered by all arbitral institutions rendering an award under the auspices of the new york convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards of 10 june 1958 the new york convention including the london court of international arbitration the international chamber of commerce the arbitration association southern africa and the arbitration foundation of southern africa although zambian courts are able to enforce arbitral awards as stated above the said awards can be challenged on the basis of the following grounds if the party to the arbitration award was under some incapacity or the arbitration agreement is not valid if the party challenging the arbitration was not given proper notice of the appointment of the arbitrator if the arbitration deals with a dispute not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration if the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties if the award has not yet become binding on the parties if the subject matter of the dispute is not capable of settlement by arbitration under the law of zambia if the award is in conflict with public policy and if the making of the award was induced or effected by fraud corruption or misrepresentation surface rights what types of surface rights may mining rights holders request and acquire how are these rights acquired can surface rights holders oppose these requests surface rights are governed by the lands act chapter 184 of the laws of zambia the lands act there are two types of land tenure systems in zambia customary tenure and state tenure customary tenure comprises over 90 per cent of the total land mass the customary land is administered by traditional rulers in various parts of the country mining right holders can obtain the exclusive or other use of the whole or any portion of an exploration or mining area the process for acquisition of customary land begins with its conversion to leasehold tenure to obtain a conversion of customary area the following process is normally followed the preparation of a plan showing the exact extent of the land to be converted an application to the chief of the area for conversion of such area into a leasehold tenure and the approval of the chief upon the consent of the chief the chief shall refer the application to the local council where the land is situated the local council is required to consider if there is any conflict between the customary law of the area and the lands act and in the event that there is no conflict make a recommendation to the commissioner of lands and the commissioner of lands may accept or refuse to accept the recommendation and the applicant has a right of appeal in the event of a refusal to the lands tribunal title to land is allocated for a period of 99 years renewable if the covenants subject to which it was granted have not been breached the republican president may grant land title for a longer duration if this is considered to be in the interest of the nation any person who desires to sell transfer or assign land is required to obtain the president s consent before such land can be disposed of consent must be granted within 45 days and is deemed granted thereafter if not refused reasons for refusal must be given an aggrieved party has the right to appeal against the decision to refuse to grant consent to the lands tribunal established under the lands act in instances where private leasehold interests exist in an area covered by a mining right the holder of any licence or permit who requires the exclusive or other use of any portion of the exploration or mining area may acquire a lease over such area or the right of use thereof on terms to be agreed between the licence holder and the owner of such land there is an arbitration process to determine the matter largely in respect of compensation but the owner or occupier cannot prevent the mine from operating on such land if any portion of the land over which the tenement exists is under customary land there may be a requirement to obtain permission from the local chief in order to obtain surface rights that would require the chief to give his or her written consent to the local council for the conversion of that particular portion of customary tenure to statutory leasehold tenure if a mining right predates any surface right over the same location it is not technically possible for surface rights independent of the mining rights to be acquired subsequently the mines act provides that the surface rights holder has to give written consent to a holder of a mining right to exercise any rights over their land in instances when written consent is required it should not be unreasonably withheld a surface rights holder may opt not to give consent with good reason or request the director of mining cadastre to determine any dispute arising with the holder of the mining right in relation to the use of the land alternatively the director of mining cadastre may require the parties to submit to arbitration participation of government and state agencies does the government or do state agencies have the right to participate in mining projects is there a local listing requirement for the project company the mining industry is private sector driven since the privatisation of the mining sector and liberalisation of the zambian economy and therefore the government does not necessarily have a right to participate in a mining project however the law permits the government to identify an area that is not subject to existing mining rights in relation to which the director of geological survey may carry out exploration activities on behalf of the government the mines act provides that the government may acquire mining rights for government over identified areas the identified areas will not be subject to an application for a mining right by any person and furthermore the mining rights subject to identified areas shall be granted to a government investment company in accordance with the provisions of the mines act in addition the public private partnership act no 14 of 2009 the ppp act provides for the implementation of public private partnership agreements between contracting authorities and concessionaires although these are mainly related to infrastructure projects the ppp act enables the government and government agencies to partner with the private sector on projects that develop public infrastructure and contribute to effective delivery of social services this may be more visible particularly when it relates to projects dealing with sustainability there are no mandatory listing requirements with respect to the project company government expropriation of licences are there provisions in law dealing with government expropriation of licences what are the compensation provisions there are no specific legal provisions relating to expropriation of mining licences article 16 1 of the constitution of zambia and chapter 1 of the laws of zambia provides for the protection of fundamental rights which include the ownership and protection of property rights mining rights as defined under the mines act would qualify as rights to property protected by the constitution expropriation of property can only be by an act of parliament which provides for payment of adequate compensation for the property or interest or right to be taken possession of or acquired the constitution further provides that nothing contained in or done under the authority of any law shall be held to be inconsistent with or in contravention of the protection of the fundamental rights to the ownership and protection of property rights to the extent that it is shown that such law provides for the taking possession or acquisition of any property or interest therein or right thereof where the property consists of or includes any licence or permit any relevant act must provide that in default of agreement the amount of compensation shall be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction the only other provision that deals with acquisition of property in general terms is section 3 of the land acquisitions act chapter 189 which gives the president of zambia power to acquire property of any description where they consider it desirable or expedient in the interests of the republic to do so compulsorily section 10 of the same act further provides for the monetary compensation where any property is acquired by the president under the act there has however been much debate as to what would constitute property and whether the act ought to be applied strictly to land acquisition or property in any form protected areas are any areas designated as protected areas within your jurisdiction and which are off limits or specially regulated the mines act provides that the holder of a mining right or mineral processing licence requires written consent of the appropriate authority to commence activity upon any land dedicated as a place for burial a place being an ancient or national monument any land within 90 metres of any building or dam owned by the republic or any land forming part of the government aerodrome there are generally no protected areas in zambia specified as being off limits for mining purposes apart from those areas declared as heritage sites under the law duties royalties and taxes duties royalties and taxes payable by private parties what duties royalties and taxes are payable by private parties carrying on mining activities are these revenue based or profit based the following duties royalties and taxes are payable by private parties carrying on mining activities each of which with the exception of royalties and value added tax are profit based corporate income tax as detailed in the income tax act zambia has a source based system for the taxation of income income from a source deemed to be a zambian source is subject to income tax corporate income tax cit on mining companies is charged as follows income from mineral processing carried out under a mineral processing licence is taxed at the rate of 35 per cent income from mining operations at the rate of 30 per cent per annum exploration operations are not included under the definition of mining operations and therefore the above mentioned cit will not apply to a holder of a large scale exploration licence provided that they do not undertake any mining operations notwithstanding this however a holder of an exploration licence will be required to submit annual cit returns to date the rates of cit indicated are correct as a result of negotiations between mining companies and the government variable profit tax variable profit tax is payable on income earned from mining operations at 15 per cent when taxable income exceeds 8 per cent on the gross sales royalties mineral royalty payable copper 4 per cent when the norm price is less than us 4 500 per tonne 5 per cent when the norm price is us 4 500 per tonne or more but less than us 6 000 per tonne and 6 per cent when the norm price is us 6 000 per tonne or more base metals other than copper 5 per cent of the norm value precious metals 6 per cent of the norm value gemstones 6 per cent of the gross value energy minerals 5 per cent of the gross value industrial minerals 5 per cent of the gross value norm value is defined by the mines act as the monthly average london metal exchange cash price per tonne of the metal or recoverable metal sold the monthly average metal bulletin cash price per tonne of metal or recoverable metal sold to the extent that it is not quoted on the london metal exchange or the monthly average cash price per tonne at any exchange market approved by the commissioner general the commissioner general of the zambia revenue authority

customs and excise act in respect of all machinery and equipment including specialised motor vehicles required for any of the activities carried on or to be carried on in pursuance of the right or otherwise for the purposes of his or her investment in mining or prospecting or exploration royalty deferment this option is available under the mines act in that the commissioner general may on application by the holder of the mining right defer payment of royalty due from the holder if during any period for which a payment of royalty is due the cash operating margin of the holder in respect of mining operations in the mining area falls below zero tax stablisation does any legislation provide for tax stabilisation or are there tax stabilisation agreements in force there is currently no legislation providing for tax stabilisation agreements or clauses however the zambian government has been known to enter into concession agreements with individual mining companies in which stabilisation clauses have been included in the event that there is a tax dispute between mining entities and the government the mining entities can lobby the government who will then consider their concerns carried interest is the government entitled to a carried interest or a free carried interest in mining projects the government is not entitled to a carried interest or a free carried interest in mining projects the government plays more of a regulatory role but has no direct participation in terms of the direction of mining operations or shareholding in mining right holders transfer taxes and capital gains are there any transfer taxes or capital gains imposed regarding the transfer of licences property transfer tax ptt is payable on the transfer of any type of mining right from one party to another any mining right under the mines act is considered to be property and the property transfer tax amendment act no 16 of 2015 provides that ptt of 10 per cent of the realised value

by foreign parties there is no distinction between duties or royalties for domestic and foreign parties business structures principal business structures what are the principal business structures used by private parties carrying on mining activities the main business structures used by private parties are private limited companies incorporated under the companies act foreign entities may also utilise joint ventures subsidiaries or branches to conduct mining activities in zambia where joint ventures are used however the most appropriate structure is an incorporated rather than an unincorporated structure this is because an unincorporated entity cannot hold a mining right under zambian law local entity requirement is there a requirement that a local entity be a party to the transaction the law in zambia does not prescribe business structures requiring a local entity to be a party bilateral investment and tax treaties are there jurisdictions with favourable bilateral investment treaties or tax treaties with your jurisdiction through which foreign entities will commonly structure their operations in your jurisdiction zambia has tax treaties with the following

treaties contain favourable investor protection provisions such as provisions against expropriation however not all the bits are currently in force financing principal sources of financing what are the principal sources of financing available to private parties carrying on mining activities what role does the domestic public securities market play in financing the mining industry the principal sources of funding available to small scale mining parties are local banks macro finance agencies and the government large scale mining parties may principally source their funds from local and international commercial and development banks the public securities market plays a limited role in financing the zambian mining industry with only two mining companies currently listed on the stock exchange direct financing from government or major pension funds does the government its agencies or major pension funds provide direct financing to mining projects the government does not currently provide any direct financing to mining projects security regime describe the regime for taking security over mining interests under zambian law there is no fixed regime for taking security over mining rights security may be taken over any mining right by mortgage pledge or by any other means used to obtain security over property however there is a requirement that the approval of any encumbrance

activities standard conditions and agreements which standard conditions and agreements covering equipment supplies are used in your jurisdiction there are no specific standard conditions and agreements prescribed under the law in zambia it is upon the parties entering into equipment supplies contract to decide whether the agreement covering the equipment supply will be subject to any standard conditions the market therefore is equally friendly to both buyer and seller as their contract will determine their rights and obligations as agreed generally the parties to these agreements prescribe arbitration as a means of resolving their disputes although a notable number prefer court proceedings court actions are preferred for actions to recover the equipment supplied whilst arbitration is preferred for actions for the price in terms of standards for the actual equipment supplied the zambia bureau of standards zabs the statutory national standards body for zambia established under the standards act no 4 of 2017 and the recently created zambia compulsory standards agency under the compulsory standards no 3 of 2017 implement compulsory standards through import and export inspections zabs and the compulsory standards agency serve the country in the field of standardisation standards formulation quality control quality assurance import and export quality

fiscal rules in the euro area and lessons from other monetary unions prepared by nadine leiner killinger and carolin nerlich published as part of the ecb economic bulletin issue 3 2019 this article compares the fiscal rule framework in the euro area with the frameworks in the fiscally more integrated united states and switzerland with the aim of drawing lessons for ways in which fiscal rules could be reformed in european economic and monetary union emu both the united states and switzerland have a history of balanced budget rules that help stabilise government debt in individual states cantons at moderate and broadly comparable levels the recent shift towards balanced budget rules in the euro area is an important achievement in this direction and has contributed to better average underlying budgetary positions still the fiscal rule framework needs to be rendered more effective in reducing high levels of government debt and their dispersion across the euro area reducing the heterogeneity of government debt positions is also an important prerequisite for setting up a well governed common macroeconomic stabilisation function at the centre of emu in case of deep economic crises this in turn would help to contain the procyclicality of fiscal rules at the country level 1 introduction in european economic and monetary union emu the single monetary policy is complemented by fiscal policies that are under the responsibility of national governments these budgetary policies are subject to a common set of fiscal rules and country specific arrangements after the recent financial and economic crisis which followed a period of good economic times that were not used sufficiently to build up fiscal buffers the eu s common fiscal framework was strengthened among other things the measures introduced placed a stronger focus on reducing government debt ratios to sound levels they also included a fiscal compact which contains a close to balance provision for countries medium term budgetary objectives mtos countries must transpose this into national law preferably at constitutional level while work to further improve the functioning of emu continues progress towards more fiscal integration has so far been limited the statement issued following the euro summit of october 2014 said that closer coordination of economic policies is essential to ensure the smooth functioning of the economic and monetary union and pointed to the importance of preparing next steps on better economic governance in the euro area subsequently the five presidents report issued in 2015 laid out proposals for completing emu it stressed that progress must happen towards a fiscal union that delivers both fiscal sustainability and fiscal stabilisation this reflects the fact that unlike other monetary unions emu is not equipped with a sizeable federal budget there is thus no separate and centralised budget in place that could be used to support fiscal stabilisation of the euro area economy in deep economic downturns the euro summit of december 2018 mandated the eurogroup to work on the design modalities of implementation and timing of a budgetary instrument for convergence and competitiveness but did not ask for work on a central capacity for stabilisation this article aims to draw lessons for the design of fiscal rules in the euro area from the fiscal rule frameworks that are in place in other fiscally more integrated monetary unions specifically it looks into the fiscal rules that are in place in the united states and switzerland which are examples of monetary unions with a federal structure fiscal rules at the federal and sub federal levels and a sizeable budget at the centre importantly these monetary unions differ from the euro area in that they are also political unions in the sense of being a single nation or federal state the findings show that the increased emphasis in the euro area countries on balanced budget rules has brought emu closer to the set up in the united states and switzerland these countries have a long history of balanced budget rules at the sub federal levels which has led to overall lower and less diverse government debt ratios than in the euro area to achieve a comparable outcome the eu s fiscal framework still needs to be rendered more effective in reducing high national government debt burdens this would make the countries in question less vulnerable to economic downturns and the euro area as a whole more resilient however balanced budget rules may make it more difficult for governments to use fiscal policy in a sufficiently countercyclical manner particularly in deep economic downturns in other monetary unions such rules at the sub federal levels are accompanied by the possibility to stabilise the economy from the centre or to a lesser extent through rainy day funds at the sub federal level this article is structured as follows section 2 takes stock of the main fiscal rules governing fiscal policies in the euro area it concentrates on the fiscal rules established at the country level and how they are linked with the common eu governance framework section 3 describes major fiscal developments since the crisis with a view to identifying whether the strengthening of the fiscal governance framework has had a perceptible impact section 4 captures major features of the fiscal rule frameworks that govern budgetary policies in the united states and switzerland on the basis of this analysis section 5 aims to inform the discussions on how to deepen emu and how to rectify the shortcomings of the existing fiscal framework section 6 concludes 2 fiscal rules in the euro area fiscal rules are an essential part of the fiscal frameworks needed to achieve sound public finances sustainable fiscal positions are particularly important in a monetary union as individual countries cannot use monetary and exchange rate policies to respond to country specific shocks furthermore as the recent european sovereign debt crisis has demonstrated unsound fiscal positions in one country can lead to spillover effects on others thereby affecting the monetary union as a whole numerical fiscal rules are widely accepted as supporting the achievement of sound fiscal policies and are therefore essential to ensure sustainable public finances moreover their positive impact on public finances can be further strengthened through market discipline see box 1 as the experience with the sovereign debt crisis has shown insufficient compliance with fiscal rules in favourable times may come at a high cost if fiscal rules allow too little flexibility in recessions however they may constrain countries ability to stabilise their economies during an economic downturn this is likely to be the case especially for countries that have not built up sufficient fiscal buffers it is therefore important that fiscal rules ensure that fiscal policies are sufficiently countercyclical over the business cycle this calls for structural fiscal rules that correct for the impact of cyclical developments beyond this however some form of effective risk sharing for example through a fiscal capacity at the centre of a monetary union appears necessary to combat deep economic recessions the rationale for fiscal rules is well established in the literature their main objective is to constrain the use of policy discretion in order to promote sound budgetary policy making and to overcome the tendency of governments to allow deficit and debt levels to increase over time known as the deficit bias numerical fiscal rules are defined for the purposes of this article as providing a permanent constraint on fiscal policy as expressed in terms of a summary indicator of fiscal performance such as the government budget deficit debt or a major budgetary component fiscal policies in the euro area countries are governed by supranational as well as national fiscal rules for example at the supranational level the euro area countries are subject to nominal fiscal rules under the eu s stability and growth pact i e the maastricht treaty s 3 deficit to gdp and 60 government debt to gdp limits they are also required to achieve and maintain their country specific mtos which are defined in terms of the structural balance the structural balance is a key indicator for the governance framework in the euro area and reflects a country s underlying budgetary position which filters out the impact of the business cycle and one off factors on the headline budget balance adherence to these supranational fiscal rules is governed by the preventive and corrective arms of the stability and growth pact unlike in other monetary unions such as the united states and switzerland see section 4 the supranational rules apply to national fiscal policies and not to a federal budget at national level today s fiscal rules in the euro area are to a large extent determined by the fiscal compact which entered into force in 2013 the fiscal compact requires countries to have a rule in place to ensure a balanced general government budget in structural terms over the medium term and a correction mechanism to be automatically triggered in the event of significant deviations from the fiscal target this rule is to be transposed into national legislation preferably at constitutional level in addition several countries have also their own specific rules framework in place over the past 20 years the number of national fiscal rules in place has approximately tripled in the euro area countries reflecting in particular an increase in balanced budget rules whereas at the beginning of the century there were only around 20 national fiscal rules altogether in the euro area countries the number has now increased to 62 according to the european commission s fiscal rules database see chart 1 countries have deployed different types of numerical fiscal rules balanced budget rules have gained particular prominence among the euro area countries increasing from ten in 2000 to 35 by 2017 and accounting for now almost 60 of all rules debt rules which existed in only three euro area countries in 2000 have also become more established over the last two decades and now account for roughly one quarter of all rules by contrast expenditure rules and revenue rules play a relatively limited role in most euro area countries chart 1 national fiscal rules in the euro area number of rules sources european commission and ecb calculations notes the chart is based on the latest available update 2017 of the european commission s fiscal governance database it includes all national fiscal rules including those that restrict only part of the general government sector such as the regional or municipal level the framework of fiscal rules has improved considerably more in qualitative terms than suggested by the increase in the number of rules alone in many countries the fiscal rules that were in place in the earlier years of emu have been exchanged for more sophisticated fiscal rules in this sense the fiscal rules have improved in at least five dimensions i e in terms of coverage strictness plausibility monitoring and inherent correction mechanisms first regarding coverage all euro area countries now have at least one fiscal rule in place that puts a restriction on public finances at the general government level this compares with the early years of the euro area when a large majority of rules constrained only a small fraction of the general government sector and were sometimes linked only to regional or municipal levels second rules have been strengthened in recent years by setting them at constitutional or equivalent level this in principle helps to reduce the risk of short sighted discretionary fiscal policies which are often seen as responsible for the accumulation of high public debt third all euro area countries have at least one fiscal rule in place that is defined in structural terms and thus takes account of the impact of cyclical developments in earlier years countries were often constrained only by ceilings in nominal terms fourth the monitoring of compliance with fiscal targets has been strengthened considerably with independent fiscal authorities equipped with a relatively broad mandate for surveillance now established in all euro area countries fifth although practical experience is still scarce fiscal rules are increasingly supported by more credible enforcement mechanisms which in some cases would be triggered automatically for deviations from fiscal targets most of these improvements in national fiscal rules have taken place during the current decade as a result of important institutional changes at the supranational level most important in this respect has been the requirement to fully transpose the fiscal compact into national legislation with the aim of increasing national ownership of the eu governance framework this can be considered a regime shift compared with the beginning of emu when countries national fiscal rules were designed independently of each other the budgetary frameworks directive as part of the six pack legislation of 2011 also required country specific numerical fiscal rules moreover in 2013 the two pack regulations specified that independent fiscal institutions should take on a more prominent role in monitoring fiscal rule compliance at national level as a result national fiscal rules have become more similar across countries and are better aligned with the eu governance framework at supranational level all euro area countries now have a balanced budget rule in place restricting the general government budget following the institutional changes mentioned above moreover the provisions in several euro area countries include an explicit reference to the stability and growth pact some countries have de jure even stricter features than foreseen in the pact mostly because of a stronger automaticity of their enforcement mechanisms at the same time fiscal rule frameworks continue to differ across countries mainly reflecting national preferences and different federal structures differences also relate to the national ownership of the fiscal rules and their effectiveness in terms of compliance box 1 rules markets and fiscal discipline in a monetary union prepared by maximilian freier and sarah ciaglia there are in principle two mechanisms for curbing unsound fiscal policies a rule based fiscal governance framework and market discipline the respective roles of fiscal rules and market discipline are part of the ongoing discussion on the reform of the emu governance framework drawing on the academic literature this box discusses the two mechanisms and also their potential interaction a rule based governance framework requires in principle two components namely rules for fiscal policy and a means for their implementation fiscal rules typically take the form of numerical limits on budgetary aggregates see section 2 government fiscal policies have to be assessed and their compliance with the fiscal rules ensured the effectiveness of this process depends critically on the independence of policy assessment and powers of enforcement in emu the european commission and the ecofin council conduct surveillance of member states budgets with the aim of preventing deficit biases additionally independent fiscal institutions at the national level fiscal councils assess compliance with national fiscal provisions see table a left hand column the rule based fiscal framework in emu has drawn criticism primarily for its lack of enforceability and complexity first where governments retain sovereignty over their fiscal policies it can be difficult to ensure that they abide by previously agreed rules some of the academic literature refers to the stability and growth pact as a failure given the significant number of violations of its numerical fiscal rules that have gone unsanctioned second the success of a rule based framework critically depends on simplicity particularly when its enforcement depends on public scrutiny and political pressure in emu the stability and growth pact started with simple numerical limits for deficit and debt the framework was then reformed and a degree of flexibility was included in the implementation of the rules in order to better account for cyclical developments the cost of structural reforms and crisis related exceptional fiscal burdens this has come at the cost of less transparency and tractability however empirical analyses find that rule based fiscal governance frameworks do have a noticeable constraining effect on fiscal policies in the absence of robust enforcement mechanisms fiscal rules rely on broad political and public support accordingly ownership of fiscal rules is often identified as an important determinant of their effectiveness while there have been many violations of the numerical fiscal rules of the stability and growth pact in emu average deficits have declined considerably compared with the pre emu period the convergence towards agreed mtos in many countries or the clustering of public deficits just below the 3 threshold in others provides some indication that member states have internalised at least part of the eu s rule based fiscal governance framework in their fiscal policymaking systems recommendations for consolidation under the excessive deficit procedure are translated into government fiscal plans almost in full and are implemented to a substantial extent turning to market discipline this is defined as a mechanism by which governments are steered by market price signals towards sound fiscal policies thus reducing the risk of future debt restructuring this mechanism relies on financial markets taking into account fundamentals current and expected fiscal policies when determining the credit risk premia included in governments financing costs governments tend to adjust their budgets to changes in the risk premium paid on their debt it is widely accepted that for this mechanism to work there has to be among other conditions such as open markets and transparency of policies some likelihood that the debt of governments pursuing unsound fiscal policies will not be repaid see table a right hand column in emu this is embedded in the no bailout clause article 125 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union the market discipline mechanism has been characterised as being too slow and weak or too sudden and disruptive first in a monetary union where close economic integration implies greater spillover effects in a crisis there could be considerable incentives for the union to come to the aid of a member state at risk of losing market access if a commitment not to bail out a member state is not fully credible this could compress risk premia for governments second the literature finds that market interest rates do not necessarily reflect news on fiscal developments in a reliable and consistent manner and prices can overreact particularly in times of economic crisis it is argued that in emu this may have contributed on the one hand to excessively loose fiscal policies before the sovereign debt crisis and on the other to overly severe austerity measures during the crisis at the same time however the literature in general does find that market discipline effectively reduces the deficit bias of governments research on market discipline in emu shows that market prices reflect fiscal developments thereby providing an indication that the no bailout clause remains credible studies also provide evidence that european governments effectively adjust their policies to changes in market prices while rule based fiscal governance and market discipline are often portrayed as two separate mechanisms they do in fact affect each other typically the literature finds that the two mechanisms reinforce each other for example fiscal rules can help governments to credibly commit to fiscal targets and thus reduce market interest rates on public debt moreover the assessment of fiscal developments in the context of the fiscal governance mechanism may provide useful information to market participants for the pricing of sovereign risks vice versa higher market interest rates as a result of higher credit risk would all else being equal lead to a deterioration of a fiscal position this may make it more difficult for countries to comply with the provisions of the governance framework in conclusion both rule based fiscal governance frameworks and market discipline appear to contribute to the constraints on fiscal policies in emu however both mechanisms have limitations and vulnerabilities against this background institutional changes to emu should be carefully assessed with regard to their impact on the governance framework and the market disciplining mechanism table a mechanisms for fiscal discipline in emu 3 fiscal developments in the euro area since the peak of the financial crisis in 2009 the euro area as a whole has made significant progress towards restoring sound fiscal positions which has coincided with the steps taken to strengthen the framework of fiscal rules from its peak in 2009 at 4 5 of gdp the euro area aggregate structural deficit declined to 0 7 of gdp in 2018 see chart 2 the euro area as a whole has thus moved to an underlying budgetary deficit that comes very close to the floor of 0 5 of gdp set by the fiscal compact this has been an important contribution to bringing government debt in the euro area onto a downward trajectory indeed the euro area aggregate debt to gdp ratio gradually declined from its peak of 94 2 of gdp in 2014 to 86 9 of gdp in 2018 it remains however far above its pre crisis level 65 of gdp in 2007 chart 2 dispersion of structural budget balances and government debt in the euro area percentages of gdp sources european commission economic forecast autumn 2018 and ecb calculations these favourable trends for the euro area as a whole mask very heterogeneous fiscal developments at the country level on the one hand an increasing number of countries are assessed as recording broadly sound fiscal positions in 2018 on the basis of the european commission s 2018 autumn economic forecast 11 countries are expected to have achieved structural balance positions that are in line with the lower bound set by the fiscal compact see chart 3 this compares with only three countries prior to the crisis in 2007 this favourable trend may be taken as an indication that the increasing focus on balanced budget rules at the country level is having a first perceptible impact on the other hand as shown in chart 2 a number of euro area countries continue to record large structural budget deficits these countries remain far from their country specific mtos and the floor enshrined in the fiscal compact which makes it more difficult to bring their high government debt ratios down to lower levels chart 3 structural balances vis à vis the floor enshrined in the fiscal compact structural balance percentages of gdp sources european commission economic forecast autumn 2018 and ecb calculations notes the chart shows the number of countries whose structural balance would be in compliance with the floor set in the fiscal compact the blue bars show the number of countries with either a government debt to gdp ratio above 60 and a structural balance above a floor of 0 5 of gdp or with a government debt to gdp ratio below 60 of gdp and a structural balance above a floor of 1 the yellow bars depict the number of countries satisfying neither of these conditions the number of countries complying with their country specific mtos may be different however as these can be set at levels that are more demanding than the provisions of the fiscal compact as can be seen from chart 4 in some countries with high government debt i e belgium france and italy structural deficits still remain far from their mtos because during the period from 2011 to 2018 they declined on average by less than the 0 5 of gdp benchmark adjustment foreseen in the stability and growth pact while in 2011 13 all the countries shown in chart 4 apart from belgium achieved an adjustment which was amid financial market pressure greater than the benchmark requirement in more recent years none of the countries shown achieved the required adjustment consequently these countries were not building the buffers that would allow them to avoid fiscal tightening in the next downturn this can have an impact on the resilience of the euro area as a whole chart 4 structural budget balances in countries not at their mto and with government debt to gdp ratios above 90 percentage points sources european commission economic forecast autumn 2018 and ecb calculations heterogeneity in euro area countries fiscal positions is also visible in the dispersion of government debt to gdp ratios this has increased to levels markedly above those seen ahead of the crisis see chart 2 in fact since 2009 an increasing number of euro area countries have posted government debt to gdp ratios of above the maastricht treaty s 60 reference value while by 2018 some countries debt ratios had declined to below 60 of gdp again a number continue to record high government debt ratios of above 90 of gdp see chart 5 ensuring convergence towards sound fiscal positions across countries and thus reducing vulnerabilities to shocks is a prerequisite for resilience in the euro area and thus an important factor to support a fiscally more integrated emu chart 5 developments in government debt left hand scale percentage points of gdp right hand scale percentages of gdp sources european commission economic forecast autumn 2018 and ecb calculations 4 fiscal frameworks in other monetary unions comparing the public finances and fiscal frameworks of the euro area the united states and switzerland reveals some similarities but also important differences as in the euro area countries balanced budget rules at the sub federal level are well established in both the us states and the swiss cantons although they have been in place for a much longer period than in the euro area however the size and role of the central budget differs substantially between the euro area on the one hand and switzerland and the united states on the other this includes the stabilisation function of the central budget which can limit the procyclicality of fiscal rules at the lower level a better understanding of the institutional settings in these two monetary unions and how they compare with the situation in the euro area may therefore provide insights particularly in view of the ongoing discussions on how to deepen fiscal integration in emu this section therefore takes a closer look at how public finances are governed in the united states and switzerland with a particular focus on the design strictness and enforcement mechanisms of fiscal rules at sub federal level public finances in the united states and switzerland differ from those in the euro area in the united states most of the overall general government debt which has continuously increased over the past decades has been generated at the federal level see chart 6 in switzerland the federal level is responsible for roughly half of total public debt which peaked in 2005 see chart 7 in the euro area there is no equivalent at the central level besides the eu budget which is very limited in size and also has a very limited borrowing capacity moreover neither in the united states nor in switzerland is public debt at the sub federal level as heterogeneous as across countries in the euro area see chart 8 and chart 5 chart 6 decomposition of general government debt in the united states 1980 2018 percentages of gdp sources haver analytics and ecb calculations chart 7 decomposition of general government debt in switzerland 1990 2017 left hand scale chf billions right hand scale percentages of gdp sources swiss federal statistical office and ecb calculations notes the data on the general government debt to gdp ratio include the debt accumulated by the social security systems three institutional aspects seem to play a particular role in explaining the differences in public finances across the monetary unions first differences relate to fiscal federalism its main purpose and how strongly it is established in the respective monetary unions in the united states fiscal federalism mainly takes the form of countercyclical stabilisation policies from the centre to the state level the us states can rely on some public risk sharing in the form of temporary transfers from the federal budget in the event of idiosyncratic shocks complemented by rainy day funds established at state level see also box 2 in switzerland fiscal federalism is well established in the form of a permanent transfer system between the centre and economically less strong cantons in the euro area however fiscal federalism is very limited the eu budget has very limited resources of around 1 of total gdp which are mainly used for redistribution purposes in the form of eu cohesion funds to foster economic convergence in poorer regions public risk sharing is still limited to very specific situations under strict conditionality while there are no funds available at central level to provide a countercyclical stabilisation function for the member states in the event of severe common or asymmetric shocks second in the us states and the swiss cantons public finances are also strongly influenced by an effective no bailout clause third differences relate to the fiscal rule framework for the various layers and how effectively it works as a disciplinary device while these three aspects are largely interrelated and therefore all affect the cyclicality of fiscal policies the focus in the following will be on the fiscal rules chart 8 dispersion of public debt in us states and swiss cantons 2016 percentages of gdp sources haver analytics swiss federal statistical office and ecb calculations notes the charts show the 2016 government debt to gdp ratio of the 50 us states excluding debt at local level and the 26 cantons excluding debt of municipalities the fiscal rules in the us states are not imposed by the centre and are therefore relatively heterogeneous the us states have full discretion in the way they set their fiscal rules although balanced budget rules are in place in almost all 50 states they differ in terms of stringency a few states have very stringent balanced budget rules which prohibit deficits being carried over into the next budget year other states allow more leeway during the budgetary process for example in form of escape clauses and compliance with rules is enforced rather loosely in some us states the balanced budget rules just need to be complied with ex ante while in others investment expenditure can be deducted from nominal targets thereby providing accounting leeway fiscal targets are set in either annual or biennial terms public finances in the us states are also disciplined by a no bailout clause while fiscal stabilisation from the centre to the states and rainy day funds help as countercyclical devices at the federal level the government s borrowing capacity is restricted by a nominal debt limit which can however be lifted upon parliamentary approval in switzerland the fiscal rules which are autonomously set by the cantons are relatively diverse most of the 26 cantons have balanced budget rules in place some of which are established at constitutional level only a few cantons target their total cantonal budgets while in several cantons public investment is explicitly excluded some cantons strictly enforce compliance with their fiscal targets for example if the budget deficit exceeds a certain threshold they are obliged to either increase taxes e g in st gallen or to specify future expenditure cuts ex ante rule compliance is partly also promoted through direct democratic instruments of budget control such as referendums other cantons however have fiscal rules that are less stringent for example with broadly defined escape clauses at the federal level fiscal discipline is ensured through a strict debt brake established in 2003 at constitutional level which applies to the general government sector as a whole the differences in the fiscal rule frameworks of the euro area the united states and switzerland can be captured by a rule stringency index as shown in chart 9 this is a simple composite index based on publicly available indices for the three monetary unions these are for switzerland the index developed by kirchgässner and feld for the us states the index developed by hou and smith and further by mahdavi and westerlund and for the euro area countries the index of the european commission as these studies use their own categorisation it is necessary to translate them into a single scoring system for reasons of simplicity and also owing to a lack of publicly available information at the same granular level across regions the composite index shown here is closest to the index developed by kirchgässner and feld thus the composite index is derived from three criteria i whether a balanced budget rule is in place ii whether there is clear intra year monitoring of the budget and iii whether there is a stringent and credible enforcement mechanism each criterion is given a score of one indicating that the feature is present or zero if not the overall score is then found which can be strong medium weak or not existent the higher the score the more stringent the rule overall countries fiscal rules in the euro area seem to be more stringent than the sub federal rules in the other two monetary unions on the basis of the composite index 40 of the fiscal rules in the euro area countries are very stringent which is a considerably higher score than for the us states or the swiss cantons chart 9 in the us states more than half of the fiscal rules in place have a medium stringency level while those in the swiss cantons seem to be less binding however the results need to be interpreted with caution as the various indices are not necessarily fully comparable since they use different criteria and considerable judgement chart 9 comparison of fiscal rule stringency index percentages of total number of rules source ecb calculations notes the index is based on for the euro area the european commission s fiscal rules database 2017 for the united states the fiscal rules index by hou and smith 2010 as well as mahdavi and westerlund 2011 and for switzerland the index by feld and kirchgässner 2008 it covers rules at sub federal levels in the united states and switzerland and at national level in the euro area at first sight the above finding that fiscal rules in the euro area are more stringent than those in other monetary unions might be surprising public debt in the euro area countries is on average higher and more heterogeneous than the sub federal debt to gdp ratios in the united states and switzerland however in contrast to the euro area countries public finances in the us states and the swiss cantons are able to benefit from a sizeable fiscal budget at the centre and in the united states rainy day funds that facilitate more countercyclical fiscal policies moreover the results for the euro area can be seen as a first indication that the considerable institutional changes implemented in recent years are bearing fruit even though their positive impact on public finances has not yet become fully visible furthermore as the no bailout clause is seen as being effective at the sub federal levels in the united states and switzerland this may also explain why both federations allow themselves to have less stringent rules box 2 rainy day funds evidence from us states prepared by sebastian hauptmeier nadine leiner killinger and carolin nerlich fiscal rules are often criticised for being procyclical and for not providing sufficient incentives to build up fiscal buffers during a recession rules may provide insufficient fiscal room for manoeuvre to stabilise the economy one possibility for smoothing the impact of the business cycle on fiscal positions is to create a rainy day fund this is a fund dedicated to stabilising the budget by saving funds in economic good times and depleting them in economic weak times this box looks at the experience in the united states with rainy day funds and a possible way forward for the euro area in the united states almost all states are equipped with some form of rainy day fund as a countercyclical tool to complement the balanced budget requirements the availability of such budget stabilisation funds is seen as important given that state governments when faced with an economic downturn and related shortfalls on the revenue side of their budgets have limited options for stabilising the economy as their ability to borrow is constrained indeed increasing taxes or cutting spending in a procyclical manner would risk worsening a downturn the rainy day funds constitute an institutional feature of the budgetary procedures at state level their average size is relatively small over the period 2000 17 the funds accumulated in rainy day funds averaged only around 0 2 of us gdp and peaked in 2017 at close to 0 3 of gdp chart a shows the evolution of aggregate us state rainy day fund balances over 2000 17 against developments in the output gap as a proxy for national cyclical conditions indeed as expected the aggregated rainy day funds balance follows a roughly countercyclical pattern in the sense that dissaving occurs when the output gap is worsening and vice versa it is noteworthy that available funds were used almost in full during the 2001 recession and built up again thereafter while aggregate funds dropped much less significantly during the great recession given the relatively small size of the funds they are typically only sufficient to smooth normal cyclical fluctuations more severe recessions require additional support from the federal budget during the great recession significant funds derived from the american recovery and reinvestment act at the federal level were used to further compensate state budget shortfalls chart a us state rainy day fund balances percentages of gdp sources national association of state budget officers european commission ameco database and ecb calculations while the governance structure of rainy day funds differs widely among us states some common patterns can be observed as indicated in table a all rainy day funds are subject to specific conditions regarding the build up and withdrawal of funds 44 states have rules in place that make the deposit of funds in the rainy day funds dependent on a number of specified conditions 20 states base them on measures of volatility e g revenue volatility deriving from cyclical developments related to oil or housing nine states make the withdrawal of funds dependent on economic conditions six on revenue volatility and two on both eleven states foresee a fixed period for repayment table a rainy day funds in us states main characteristics number of us states source see bailey s et al when to use state rainy day funds pew charitable trusts 2017 in the euro area only one country has so far decided to introduce a rainy day fund ireland set up a rainy day fund in 2018 the intention is to place around 500 million per annum i e 0 2 of projected 2019 gdp over the period 2019 21 in the fund while germany does not operate a rainy day fund the german debt brake is conceptually comparable the imf has suggested setting up a rainy day fund for the euro area as a whole to help to smooth business cycles in the event of both country specific and common economic shocks 5 lessons for the reform of fiscal rules in the euro area with the increase in balanced budget rules the fiscal rule framework in the euro area has come closer to that in the united states and switzerland but important differences remain the increased reliance in the euro area countries on balanced budget rules will eventually help to bring government debt ratios to lower and less divergent levels though the reflection of the fiscal compact in national rules is still recent it is thus a major achievement that should ultimately help to increase the resilience of the euro area at the same time an important lesson from the united states and switzerland is that their on average much lower debt ratios at sub federal level and lesser dispersion are the result not only of a much longer history of balanced budget rules but also of a degree of risk sharing and a fiscal stabilisation function at the central level the lessons for emu are thus twofold first the fiscal framework needs to be rendered more effective in ensuring sound fiscal positions and reducing high levels and dispersion of government debt ratios across the euro area as shown in section 3 while the euro area as a whole can be considered to have achieved an underlying budgetary position of almost close to balance some countries with high debt remain distant from such an outcome this needs to be addressed second reducing the heterogeneity of public debt positions across euro area countries would also be an important prerequisite for setting up a common macroeconomic stabilisation function at the centre in case of deep economic crises this in turn would help to contain the procyclicality of fiscal rules at the country level against this background the review of the six pack legislation scheduled for this year will provide an opportunity to consider adjustments to the framework that could be conducive to further fiscal integration in the euro area looking at the first lesson shortcomings in the current application of the fiscal rules as set by the stability and growth pact need to be remedied as shown in section 3 some countries are not building up the buffers that would allow them to avoid fiscal tightening in a downturn this can have an impact on the resilience of the euro area as a whole notably in the light of the absence of a central fiscal capacity first under the stability and growth pact s corrective arm underlying budgetary positions need to improve faster than is currently the case the six pack legislation introduced annual nominal headline deficit targets under the excessive deficit procedure if a country s economic growth outpaces that foreseen in the excessive deficit procedure recommendation it can achieve the nominal headline deficit targets with a smaller or even without the prescribed structural effort these nominal strategies help to explain why for example spain and france delivered a structural effort below the 0 5 of gdp benchmark requirement in the period following the 2012 13 recession see chart 4 such developments harbour a risk that countries will leave an excessive deficit procedure with elevated structural deficit and debt ratios that reduce their potential to support the economy during the next downturn this would suggest reducing the emphasis on the nominal headline deficit targets under the stability and growth pact s corrective arm second the stability and growth pact s debt rule should be reviewed to ensure a reduction of high government debt the debt rule rightly takes account of low nominal growth and inflation as relevant factors as these render compliance with it procyclical in a downturn however the current application of the rule needs to be addressed where it treats countries compliance with the preventive arm of the stability and growth pact as the core mitigating factor specifically countries that do not and or are not expected to deliver the full structural effort towards the mto under the preventive arm are currently still considered as being broadly compliant with the preventive arm and therefore compliant with the debt criterion such broad instead of full compliance with the stability and growth pact delays the needed progress towards the mto third under the stability and growth pact s preventive arm the application of flexibility needs to be reviewed to avoid an excessive slowdown in progress towards mtos according to the common position on flexibility which was endorsed by the ecofin council in early 2016 budgetary adjustment requirements can be reduced in exchange for additional structural reforms and government investment among other things however it should be ensured that the additional leeway granted is reduced if structural reforms are reversed or government investment is more limited than initially planned turning to the second lesson the experience in the united states and switzerland suggests that rules at the level of individual euro area countries should be supported by some central stabilisation over the past 15 years the fiscal rule framework in the euro area has been reformed with overall a shift away from nominal targets and towards a stronger recognition of the impact of the business cycle on budgetary outcomes provided the good economic times are used effectively to build up buffers this helps to provide stabilisation in downturns in this respect countries could benefit from enhancing their institutional toolbox by for example creating rainy day funds that could limit procyclical fiscal policies over the longer horizon however setting up a well governed central stabilisation facility would support adherence to the strengthened fiscal framework in the euro area in deep downturns as the overall moderate and broadly comparable government debt ratios at the state canton level in the united states and switzerland show reducing high levels and the heterogeneity of government debt positions across the euro area countries appears to be an important prerequisite in this respect generally as the experiences in the united states and switzerland have shown once government debt ratios are relatively low and less divergent countries might be able to afford to set their fiscal rules more autonomously experience in other monetary unions suggests that market discipline can reinforce the ownership of sub federal fiscal rules moreover sub federal entities have found effective and credible fiscal rules to be in their long term interest because unsound fiscal policies resulting in excessively high debt levels place a burden on future generations by increasing financing costs in the economy and undermining growth and employment this has also led sub federal entities to take strong ownership of their self imposed fiscal rules overall experiences with fiscal rule frameworks in other fiscally more integrated monetary unions provide insights for reforms in emu but differences will and should remain as also the high and rising government debt ratio at the us federal level shows what is generally important is that fiscal rules ensure that debt ratios are sound at all levels constituting a monetary union 6 conclusions this article s main findings can be summarised as follows a comparison of the fiscal rule framework applicable in euro area countries with that in the fiscally more integrated united states and switzerland can provide guideposts for completing emu both the united states and switzerland have a history of balanced budget rules that help stabilise government debt in states and cantons at moderate and not overly divergent levels the increased emphasis in the euro area on balanced budget rules is an important achievement the fact that the majority of euro area countries are currently recording underlying budgetary positions that are in line with a balanced budget over the medium term is also a first indication that balanced budget rules have become more effective still a number of countries notably those with high government debt need to progress further towards their mtos the fiscal rule framework can be rendered more effective in this regard generally if euro area countries build up buffers to avoid fiscal tightening in a downturn national budgets can fulfil their function as stabilisation tools reducing the heterogeneity of debt positions across euro area countries would also be an important prerequisite for setting up a common macroeconomic stabilisation function for deep crises as in other monetary unions thereby also supporting the single monetary policy

we ve suffered at other times of crisis in our country there are no official statistics available on how many argentines have moved to europe argentina s immigration directorate said it is nearly impossible to keep track of the number because argentines leaving the country don t have to provide information on their destination or how long they ll stay but academics research groups and consulting firms agree there has been a rise in the number of people leaving especially among young educated argentines just as there was during the nation s worst crisis 17 years ago back then millions were plunged into poverty more than 20 percent of the population became unemployed and many reportedly went hungry in a country that is one world s biggest producers of beef soy and wheat when argentina goes through these profound crises people search for options and just like it happened in 2001 2002 when nearly 800 000 argentines went abroad today we re living through perhaps the

suffering because these budget cuts ordered by macri endanger the continuity of scientific activity said alberto kornblihtt a molecular biologist this is undoubtedly contributing to a brain drain that we ve suffered at other times of crisis in our country there are no official statistics available on how many argentines have moved to europe argentina s immigration directorate said it is nearly impossible to keep track of the number because argentines leaving the country don t have to provide information on their destination or how long they ll stay but academics research groups and consulting firms agree there has been a rise in the number of people leaving especially among young educated argentines just as there was during the nation s worst crisis 17 years ago back then millions were plunged into poverty more than 20 per cent of the population became unemployed and many reportedly went hungry in a country that is one world s biggest producers of beef soy and wheat when argentina goes through these profound crises people search for options and just like it happened in 2001 2002 when nearly 800 000 argentines went abroad today we re living through perhaps the initial phase said ariel gonzalez executive secretary of the center for international studies at the catholic university of argentina that means that there s a sector of society the middle and high class professionals who are eyeing a plan b which is that if the crisis deepens one of the options would be to go abroad servide said randstad argentina carries out about 160 daily interviews for

tomas ruiz embraced his father one last time at the buenos aires airport before he boarded a plane in search of a new life in ireland his sister recently did the same when she moved to spain like many other young argentines the siblings hold european passports by descent and they are returning to the home countries of their grandparents far from argentina s sizzling inflation high unemployment and sharp currency depreciation my country s situation prompted me to take this decision ruiz said as he finished packing his bags for his trip to dublin surrounded by photos of his family and friends on the wall it was a constant frustration to live constantly on the edge barely making it to the end of the month ruiz studied gastronomy and was employed as a cafe manager in argentina s capital but even when he worked extra shifts he couldn t manage to save money and for months he had been living with his mother to save on rent outside his room family members left him and his sister farewell messages on a chalkboard i love you and i ll miss you his mother wrote others said the best is yet to come and carpe diem latin for seize the day economic crisis it s not the first time argentines have sought shelter in europe in times of economic uncertainty hundreds of thousands emigrated to the old continent to escape hyperinflation in the early 1990s and an economic meltdown in 2001 and 2002 now argentines are losing purchasing power to a nearly 50 annual inflation rate one of the world s worst many have also protested president mauricio macri s decision to cut subsidies leading to a spike in the costs of utilities and public transportation last year the argentine peso lost more than half its value to the u s dollar following a run on the local currency causing the government to seek a record 56 billion bailout loan with the international monetary fund to try to come out of the recession as a result of the economic crisis and the devaluation more young professionals are

use the lexology getting the deal through tool to compare the answers in this article with those from other jurisdictions mining industry standing what is the nature and importance of the mining industry in your country kazakhstan possesses substantial and diverse mineral resources the mining and metals industries in kazakhstan play an important role in the country s economy and national plans for development the industry features a number of large mineral enterprises with significant direct and indirect domestic and state investment in addition to foreign participation the national atomic company kazatomprom plays a central role in the uranium sector for other sectors the government has established the national mining company tau ken samruk exploration works are within the scope of activities of the national exploration company kazgeology target minerals what are the target minerals in addition to being one of the world s largest uranium producers kazakhstan is a substantial producer of coal iron ore chromium manganese lead zinc copper gold nickel cobalt bauxite and rare earth among others kazakhstan s geographical location and relative isolation make transport logistics a key consideration in project development kazakhstan is also trying to develop the renewable energy industry among other things for this purpose kazakhstan adopted the law on support of use of renewable energy sources therefore it can be expected that interest in minerals used in renewable energy will grow regions which regions are most active almost all regions are involved in mining production for example southern and central regions are the centre of uranium production central kazakhstan is famous for its coal production complex ores are primarily mined in central and eastern regions of the country and iron ore is produced in northern regions legal and regulatory structure basis of legal system is the legal system civil or common law based kazakhstan s legal system is civil law based built on the traditions of the continental roman germanic family of laws as in other commonwealth of independent states cis countries the legal system and administrative apparatus carry certain legacies from the soviet era regulation how is the mining industry regulated kazakhstan is a unitary state the mining industry is regulated by national laws and regulations adopted by various executive authorities depending on their powers mining rights are granted by the national government represented by the ministry of energy for uranium and coal and ministry of investments and development for other minerals on the basis of subsoil use contracts awarded generally through tenders with limited exceptions where a subsoil use contract can be granted on the basis of direct negotiations unlike many countries kazakhstan has a single system of law and regulation for both the oil and gas and mining industries although there are specific provisions applicable only to the mining industry the general legal and regulatory framework for the oil and gas and mining industries is the same accordingly mining law in kazakhstan includes features that are common in oil and gas regimes internationally but uncommon in mining regimes eg subscription and commercial discovery bonuses and a tender procedure for acquisition of mining rights from the state mining law and regulation in kazakhstan is characterised by a high level of state control over the activity of mining companies at the same time the government tries to reflect the main trends in international practice in national legislation for example at the end of 2014 the subsoil law was amended in order to increase the investment attraction of the mining sector among other things the amendments introduced a simplified procedure for granting exploration rights with respect to certain unexplored areas on the basis of the first come first served principle further at the end of 2017 kazakhstan adopted a new code on subsoil and subsoil use the subsoil code which will replace the current law on subsoil and subsoil use dated 24 june 2010 and will enter into force in late june 2018 the subsoil code provides for more differentiated regimes in regulation of oil and gas uranium and other minerals the subsoil code will also introduce a number of changes into certain other matters changes in procedures for granting mining rights reinstatement of the licence as the main title document for mining activity except for uranium mining which will remain subject to the contractual system the same as the oil and gas industry potential changes in allocation of powers between industry regulators changes in procedures for transfer of mining rights and certain other matters what are the principal laws that regulate the mining industry what are the principal regulatory bodies that administer those laws were there any major amendments in the past year the primary law regulating the mining industry is the law on subsoil and subsoil use dated 24 june 2010 the subsoil law as noted above the subsoil law will be replaced by the subsoil code in june 2018 the industry is also regulated by other laws such as the tax code the land code the labour code the environmental code and others as well as by multiple subordinate legal acts adopted by various executive authorities the principal state authorities regulating the mining sector are the ministry of energy me for uranium and coal and the ministry of investments and development mid for other minerals the me and mid are vested with the functions of the regulatory body in the mining industry the regulatory body in conjunction with other state agencies establishes the terms of and conducts tenders for the granting of subsoil use rights and represents the state in negotiations execution monitoring of implementation and compliance of and termination of subsoil use contracts it is expected that after enactment of the subsoil code there are likely to be certain changes in allocation of powers between the industry regulators other ministries authorised to administer laws regulating some aspects of the mining industry include the ministry of justice the ministry of healthcare and social development the ministry of finance and the ministry of internal affairs classification system what classification system does the mining industry use for reporting mineral resources and mineral reserves kazakhstan s mineral resource and reserve reporting system is notably different both in principle and in practice from generally recognised international systems such as canada s cim standards australia s jorc code and south africa s samrec code kazakhstan along with other cis countries still uses the former soviet system for classification of mineral resources and reserves which categorises mineral reserves according to the extent to which they have been explored and substantiated specifically mineral reserves are divided into categories a b c1 and c2 depending on the extent to which they have been explored and substantiated potential resources are categorised into p1 p2 and p3 groups depending on the extent to which they have been substantiated mineral reserves on an economic value basis are also classified into balance reserves commercial reserves and off balance reserves reserves currently lacking commercial potential at the same time the subsoil code envisages a transfer to the kazakhstan code for public reporting of exploration results mineral resources and ore reserves it is expected that this code will be closer to the jorc code than the currently used system mining rights and title state control over mining rights to what extent does the state control mining rights in your jurisdiction can those rights be granted to private parties and to what extent will they have title to minerals in the ground are there large areas where the mining rights are held privately or which belong to the owner of the surface rights is there a separate legal regime or process for third parties to obtain mining rights in those areas under kazakhstan s constitution all subsoil resources in situ including metallic minerals are owned by the state private parties can obtain a subsoil use right ie the right to explore and extract minerals title to minerals passes from the state to the subsoil user on extraction from the ground pursuant to the terms of the subsoil use mining contract publicly available information and data what information and data are publicly available to private parties that wish to engage in exploration and other mining activities is there an agency which collects mineral assessment reports from private parties must private parties file mineral assessment reports does the agency or the government conduct geoscience surveys which become part of the database is the database available online kazakhstan s government makes three types or levels of information relevant to possible exploration and mining activity available to private parties as follows general information on areas free from subsoil use rights basic geological and other information regarding a deposit or area this is made available by the mid and me in the course of conducting tenders or direct negotiations for the right to develop a particular deposit or exploration area this information may be purchased by private parties for purposes of preparation of tender bids or in the course of direct negotiations the geological information regarding the relevant deposit or area is prepared by the me and mid and contains the information deemed necessary for applicants to prepare their bids this information is provided on the basis that the prospective applicant may not transfer this information to third parties and a more complete package of geological information regarding a certain deposit or subsoil area which is made available and sold to a subsoil user after execution of a subsoil use contract at the same time the subsoil code envisages that publicly available information in the subsoil use area will be expanded among other things publicly available information will include such data as contents of a subsoil use contract or licence entities controlling a subsoil user expenses made by a subsoil user etc acquisition of rights by private parties what mining rights may private parties acquire how are these acquired what obligations does the rights holder have if exploration or reconnaissance licences are granted does such tenure give the holder an automatic or preferential right to acquire a mining licence what are the requirements to convert to a mining licence private parties may acquire subsoil use rights comprising rights to conduct exploration or mining or in certain limited cases both exploration and mining subsoil use rights are currently granted on the basis of a subsoil use contract entered into by the subsoil user and the mid or me representing the state such contracts are with certain exceptions granted following competitive tenders pursuant to negotiations with the tender winners unlike many countries subsoil laws in kazakhstan envisage that mineral deposits to be put out to tender are determined by the government accordingly a potential investor cannot choose a particular deposit that he or she wishes to explore since tenders are announced with respect to deposits from the list approved by the government that being said there are certain exceptions to this general rule in particular subsoil use contracts are granted without conducting a competitive tender in the following cases i contracts for production mining with an entity that has an exclusive entitlement to obtain the rights to subsoil use in connection with a commercial discovery on the basis of an exploration contract ii contracts for operation or construction of underground facilities not related to exploration or production of minerals iii contracts for exploration or mining with a national company iv contracts for exploration and or production with entities involved in industrial and innovation activity as defined in the entrepreneurship code a manufacturing process of which is connected with subsoil use v contracts for exploration or production in cases where a repeated competitive tender on award of a contract has been failed in view of participation of only one qualified participant in such tender vi contracts for extraction of underground waters in volumes of more than 2 000 cubic metres per day for drinking or commercial needs with the owner or user of a land plot provided that such owner has a special water use right vii contracts for exploration within areas granted on the basis of simplified procedures and viii contracts for production of state owned anthropogenic minerals it is worth noting that the ground for the direct award mentioned in vii was adopted recently at the end of 2014 this provision envisages that exploration rights with regard to certain unexplored areas the list of which is approved by the mid and me are provided by the state on a first come first served basis any interested party is entitled to apply with an application for grant of exploration right with regard to such area if within five business days after publication of the application there are no applications from other entities for the same area the exploration rights should be granted on the basis of direct negotiations at the same time it should be noted that the subsoil code will reinstate the licensing regime for granting mining rights by way of background prior to august 1999 subsoil use rights in kazakhstan were granted on the basis of both licences and subsoil use contracts in august 1999 the previous subsoil use legislation was amended and the licensing regime was eliminated since then the only documents that formalised the grant of subsoil use rights were subsoil use contracts the subsoil code will now reinstate the licensing regime for the mining industry only it will reintroduces subsoil use licences as the main title documents confirming mining rights except for uranium mining rights which still will be granted on the basis of subsoil use contracts in addition the subsoil law will bring certain changes to procedures for granting mining rights the subsoil code envisages that mining rights except for uranium will be issued on a first come first served basis subject to the applicant s compliance with the requirements set forth in the subsoil code and with certain limited exceptions the primary obligations of the mineral rights holder include the following use of contract area only for the purposes stipulated in the contract ensuring the safety of human life health and natural environment selecting the most effective methods and technologies to conduct subsoil use operations conducting subsoil use operations in compliance with applicable legislation complying with approved project and technological documents for the exploration and development of deposits not impeding other persons from freely moving within the area using common facilities and carrying out any types of work including the exploration and mining of other natural resources unless special safety considerations require otherwise unreservedly providing necessary documents and information and giving access to work sites to monitoring agencies fulfilling their official functions and promptly remedying any breaches that they identify and restoring land plots and other natural features that have been disturbed as a result of subsoil use operations to a condition suitable for further use in accordance with legislation a subsoil user s obligations may be further detailed in a subsoil use contract compliance with contractual obligations is important because a breach may ultimately result in unilateral termination of a subsoil use contract by the state a holder of exploration rights who has made a commercial discovery has the exclusive right to proceed to the production stage for these purposes the subsoil user and the mid and me should negotiate terms of the production contract including the percentage of local content in purchased works and services and the volume of expenses for the social and economic development of the region and its infrastructure if the contract is not executed for 24 months at the fault of a subsoil user such subsoil user will lose its exclusive right to proceed to the production stage the mid and me should award the relevant territory to another entity with a condition that such new subsoil user will compensate to the previous subsoil user its expenses for exploration renewal and transfer of mineral licences what is the regime for the renewal and transfer of mineral licences exploration rights are granted for six years in the event of a commercial discovery this term can be further extended for a period necessary for assessment of the commercial discovery extension is formalised by amendments to a subsoil use contract production rights are granted for 25 years and for deposits with unique or large reserves 45 years the production term can be extended provided that there are no breaches of contractual terms by a subsoil user transfer of subsoil use rights requires consent of the competent authority ie the mid and me in addition with respect to deposits included in a special list of strategic deposits approved by the government a transfer of subsoil use rights requires waiver of the state s pre emptive purchase right these consent and waiver requirements apply to both direct transfer of subsoil use rights and indirect transfer ie by way of transfer of shares in a subsoil user or its ultimate parent company the subsoil law provides for certain limited exceptions to these consent and waiver requirements eg transactions at organised stock exchanges failure to obtain a consent and waiver where required may result in invalidation of the transfer or termination of subsoil use rights or both the subsoil code will introduce a number of changes to the above provisions among other things changes will be introduced to the term of mining rights and renewal term list of strategic deposits will be further limited exemptions from the consent and waiver requirements will be expanded etc duration of mining rights what is the typical duration of mining rights as noted above exploration rights are granted for a period of six years in the event of commercial discovery this period can be extended for the period necessary for the assessment of the discovered minerals production rights are granted for 25 years and for deposits with unique or large reserves 45 years the production term can be extended provided that there are no breaches of contractual terms by a subsoil user as noted above the subsoil code will introduce changes to duration of mining rights in particular uranium mining rights will be granted for the period of 25 years with the possibility of extension for up to 25 years for other minerals exploration rights can be granted for up to six years with the possibility of extension for up to five years mining rights can be granted for 25 years with the possibility of extension for a period not exceeding the initial term the number of extensions is not limited subsoil use rights can be revoked or terminated by the state in a number of cases envisaged by the subsoil law in particular a subsoil use contract can be unilaterally terminated by the state if a subsoil user has not rectified more than two breaches of the subsoil use contract within the deadline indicated by the regulator if subsoil use rights or shares in a subsoil user or its parent company are transferred with breach of applicable consent requirements or if subsoil user s performance of its financial obligations is less than 30 per cent within two subsequent years in addition with respect to strategic deposits the competent body has the right to terminate the contract or demand that a subsoil use contract be amended in cases where the subsoil user s actions result in changes to the balance of economic interests of the parties and such changes may affect national security in the event that the competent body requests the subsoil user to amend the contract the competent body may terminate the contract if within two months after receiving the notification the subsoil user does not confirm its consent to amend the contract or refuses to do so within four months of receiving the subsoil user s consent to negotiate the amendments the parties do not agree on the contents of the amendments or within six months of agreeing on the contents of the amendments the parties do not execute the amendments in addition the subsoil law provides for additional termination grounds for contracts executed under simplified award proceedings such contracts can be terminated if the subsoil user does not timely pay expenses for social and economic development of the region and its infrastructure if the subsoil user breaches requirements on the minimum amount of expenses and types of works prescribed by the contract or if the subsoil user uses the contractual territory with a breach of its designation as prescribed by the contract the subsoil code will introduce a number of changes to the grounds for termination of mining rights by the state the grounds will also vary depending on the type of mineral uranium other minerals acquisition by domestic parties versus acquisition by foreign parties is there any distinction in law or practice between the mining rights that may be acquired by domestic parties and those that may be acquired by foreign parties currently there is no distinction between the mining rights that may be acquired by domestic as distinct from foreign parties kazakhstan s laws allow foreign individuals or legal entities to directly own mining rights in kazakhstan at the same time the subsoil code will provide certain changes to regulation applicable to entities that can obtain mining rights among others uranium mining rights will be granted only to the national atomic company subsequent transfers are possible to companies where the national uranium company holds directly or indirectly more than 50 per cent of the shares protection of mining rights how are mining rights protected are foreign arbitration awards in respect of domestic mining disputes freely enforceable in your jurisdiction kazakhstan s legal system provides a framework and mechanisms for the protection of a subsoil user s contractual and other legal rights article 30 of the subsoil use law provides that a subsoil user shall be guaranteed protection of its rights in accordance with legislation it should be noted however that kazakhstan is a country still in transition from the soviet era to a modern market economy with a rule of law independent judiciary and full protection for rights of private property and contract although these concepts are all recognised in practice there can be some unpredictability and inconsistency in court processes and decision making under the subsoil law disputes arising out of or in connection with the performance or termination of mining rights shall be settled by negotiation or by kazakhstan s courts in accordance with the laws and regulations of the state or by international arbitration in accordance with treaties ratified by kazakhstan kazakhstan is a party to the 1958 new york convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards accordingly foreign arbitration awards should be enforceable in kazakhstan surface rights what types of surface rights may mining rights holders request and acquire how are these rights acquired can surface rights holders oppose these requests the subsoil law provides that on execution of a subsoil use contract ie acquisition of mining rights the contract holder should apply to the local executive authority akimat for provision of a land plot for the purposes of mining operations the local executive authority must make the land plot available to the subsoil user for the duration of the subsoil use contract if the land plot is state owned the akimat will lease the same to the subsoil user if the land is privately owned the akimat may requisition the same for leasing to the subsoil user if the owner of the land plot does not agree to the buyout such buyout will be conducted by the court the owner of the land plot is entitled to obtain a compensation of the land plot s value the right to use of the land plot is linked to the mining rights such that any changes in the title of the mining rights transfer or termination will lead to corresponding changes in the rights to use the land plot participation of government and state agencies does the government or do state agencies have the right to participate in mining projects is there a local listing requirement for the project company while the government itself or state bodies do not directly participate in mining projects as subsoil users indirect participation of the state in such projects is not unusual such indirect participation is typically conducted through participation in the projects of state owned companies and their joint ventures also there is a special list of deposits in development of which participation of a state owned national company is mandatory there is no mandatory local listing requirement for a project company however if a project company wishes to make placement at a foreign stock exchange in certain circumstances it may be subject to the requirement to make placement at a local exchange as well eg if its main assets are in kazakhstan such placement will be subject to consents by the state government expropriation of licences are there provisions in law dealing with government expropriation of licences what are the compensation provisions generally in the event of expropriation an investor is entitled to obtain compensation of the mining rights such compensation should be made at the market terms value that being said it is also worth noting that under the subsoil law in certain cases eg breach of contractual terms by a subsoil user the state is entitled to unilaterally terminate a subsoil use contract generally it is understood that in such cases an investor is not entitled to receive the compensation however if the investor is able to prove that its rights and other guarantees have been breached by the termination it should be eligible for compensation protected areas are any areas designated as protected areas within your jurisdiction and which are off limits or specially regulated in general there are currently no specific areas where mining operations are prohibited however the government may by a special resolution prohibit or limit mining operations in certain areas if it is necessary owing to national security the safety of the population and environmental protection considerations in addition mining operations may be limited or be subject to stricter regulation in specially protected environmental areas eg the caspian sea at the same time the subsoil code will introduce a specific list of areas where subsoil operations are prohibited eg lands designated for the needs of defence and national security lands of water sources lands occupied by roads railways and airports etc lands in populated areas etc in addition there will be certain exceptions to these prohibitions duties royalties and taxes duties royalties and taxes payable by private parties what duties royalties and taxes are payable by private parties carrying on mining activities are these revenue based or profit based kazakhstan s tax code specifies several special taxes that apply to mining companies in addition to general taxes such as corporate income tax vat excise and customs duty payroll tax tax on transport environmental pollution fees etc these special taxes include the following signature bonus a signature bonus is a one time payment to the state for the right to use the subsoil the amount of this tax is determined for each separate subsoil use contract on the basis of a formula established by the tax code which takes into account the market value of aggregate approved reserves the preliminarily assessed reserves and the category of mineral resources the market value of the mineral resources is generally determined using the average exchange price at the london metal exchange or the london precious metal exchange as quoted by specified publications the final amount of the signature bonus which may not be less than the minimum amount prescribed in the tax code must be determined by the tender committee in case of a tender or the competent authority in case of direct negotiations and must be set out in the subsoil use contract commercial discovery bonus a commercial discovery bonus is a fixed payment that is payable by subsoil users when a commercial discovery is made in the contract territory including discovery made in the course of additional exploration that increases the previously approved reserves the rate of the commercial discovery bonus is 0 1 per cent of the market value of proven extractable reserves the market value of the mineral resources is generally determined using the average exchange price at the london metal exchange or the london precious metal exchange as quoted by specified publications the commercial discovery bonus will cease to apply with effect from 1 january 2019 mineral extraction tax a mineral extraction tax is payable on the value of the mineral resources produced minus normative losses and is payable on a quarterly basis the value of the mineral resources for purposes of mineral extraction tax is generally determined using the average exchange price of extracted minerals at the london metal exchange or the london precious metal exchange as quoted by specified publications if there is no official exchange price for a mineral it will be determined as the actual average sales price there are fixed approved percentage rates of mineral extraction tax that range from zero to 18 5 per cent depending on the type of minerals subsoil rental payments subsoil users need to pay subsoil rental payments ranging from 15 to 60 monthly calculation indices approximately 6 075 24 300 tenge per one exploration block during the exploration stage and 450 monthly calculation indices 1 082 250 tenge per one square kilometre during the production stage tax advantages and incentives what tax advantages and incentives are available to private parties carrying on mining activities no special tax advantages or incentives are available to companies carrying on mining activities in kazakhstan tax stablisation does any legislation provide for tax stabilisation or are there tax stabilisation agreements in force only the following contracts are stabilised for tax purposes production sharing agreements psas entered into prior to 1 january 2009 and contracts that received presidential approval in the past or will receive it in the future such contracts however have been entered into only in the oil and gas area and there are no contracts of this nature in the mining industry therefore subsoil users in the mining industry do not enjoy tax stability carried interest is the government entitled to a carried interest or a free carried interest in mining projects a carried interest was previously provided in psas however it is currently not possible to enter into a new psa and all existing psas relate to the oil and gas industry therefore carried interest is not required or even possible in mining contracts transfer taxes and capital gains are there any transfer taxes or capital gains imposed regarding the transfer of licences the sale of mining licences is generally subject to corporate income tax 20 per cent on the difference between the sale price and the expenses incurred after commercial discovery but prior to production including expenses related to geological exploration preparatory works fixed and intangible assets in addition sale of mineral licences is generally subject to vat at 12 per cent distinction between domestic parties and foreign parties is there any distinction between the duties royalties and taxes payable by domestic parties and those payable by foreign parties as a general matter there are no distinctions in the application of taxes relating to mining activities between domestic and foreign companies conducting their activities through a permanent establishment eg a branch however a non resident company acting through a permanent establishment must additionally pay a tax on net income from its activity in kazakhstan at the rate of 15 per cent the rate of this tax may be reduced under relevant double tax treaties domestic parties are not subject to this tax although they must generally withhold 15 per cent tax from dividends distributed to their foreign shareholders the rate of dividends withholding tax may also be reduced under relevant double tax treaties business structures principal business structures what are the principal business structures used by private parties carrying on mining activities the subsoil law contains no stipulations or restrictions with respect to the business structures that may be used for the purpose of conducting mining activities in kazakhstan the law allows any form of legal entity whether local or foreign to acquire mining rights in kazakhstan the two most commonly used business forms in kazakhstan mining activity are limited liability partnerships llps and joint stock companies jscs jscs are favoured by those who prefer detailed corporate governance rules and the possibility of having shares registered with specialised independent registrars llps are favoured by those who prefer less statutory prescription with respect to corporate governance matters jscs and llps can each be used for either joint ventures or 100 per cent foreign owned subsidiaries local entity requirement is there a requirement that a local entity be a party to the transaction there is no mandatory requirement that a local entity be a party to the transaction bilateral investment and tax treaties are there jurisdictions with favourable bilateral investment treaties or tax treaties with your jurisdiction through which foreign entities will commonly structure their operations in your jurisdiction kazakhstan has bilateral investment treaties and double tax treaties with more than 40 countries the most popular jurisdiction for structuring direct mining operations in kazakhstan ie without setting up a local subsidiary is the netherlands financing principal sources of financing what are the principal sources of financing available to private parties carrying on mining activities what role does the domestic public securities market play in financing the mining industry generally mining companies are free to choose their funding sources in practice kazakhstan based mining companies commonly use the following financing techniques loans from shareholders loans from kazakhstan and foreign banks including loans from the european bank for reconstruction and development and the international finance corporation issuance of domestic and foreign securities and public offering of equity securities more substantial companies may have access to the domestic debt securities market by issuing domestic bonds smaller producers may also tap the debt market by issuance of promissory notes a few subsoil users have issued eurobonds on the international capital markets direct financing from government or major pension funds does the government its agencies or major pension funds provide direct financing to mining projects while government and state owned companies are generally able to directly finance mining projects in practice the government tries to attract as much private investment to the mining sector as possible security regime describe the regime for taking security over mining interests kazakhstan has fairly flexible foreign exchange and currency control rules and kazakh legislation provides for various options to secure mining companies borrowings including by way of pledging the underlying subsoil use rights at the same time from a practical perspective security over mining rights may be very difficult to enforce the reason for this is that pledging mining rights and shares in a mining company requires a number of statutory clearances consent for execution of a pledge agreement consent for participation in a tender on enforcement of a pledge and for strategic deposits waiver of the state s pre emptive purchase right for the transfer to the winner of the tender therefore it is typical to obtain other types of security eg guarantee in addition to a pledge of mining assets at the same time under the subsoil code there will be certain changes to simplify the relevant procedures among other things pledge of mining rights will not require consent of the competent body restrictions importation restrictions what restrictions are imposed on the importation of machinery and equipment or services required in connection with exploration and extraction there are no direct limitations or restrictions imposed on the import of machinery and equipment or services in connection with mining activities although certain types of machinery and equipment may fall under limited restrictions eg equipment with integrated radio frequency devices and dual use equipment in certain cases import operations may also be subject to kazakhstan exchange control requirements certain equipment is subject to mandatory certification requirements to confirm compliance with kazakhstan s technical standards limitations however certain indirect limitations are imposed on the import of machinery equipment or services under local content requirements stipulated in several laws including the subsoil law under the current rules on the purchase of goods works and services for subsoil operations the price proposed by a local manufacturer at tender shall be reduced by 20 per cent if the relevant goods works and services satisfy conditions of the tender and legal requirements this has been amended in view of kazakhstan s accession to the world trade organization in particular this notional discount will be applicable to purchases of goods until expiry of the relevant subsoil use contracts under which mining companies operate or until 1 january 2021 whichever occurs earlier for works and services the notional discount will be kept but the percentage of local content in services and works with which mining companies must comply should not exceed 50 per cent standard conditions and agreements which standard conditions and agreements covering equipment supplies are used in your jurisdiction there is no unified approach in using standard conditions and agreements various buyers may use their own standard forms of agreements fidic forms are sometimes used especially in major projects where foreign investors are involved use of orgalime standard agreements is less usual generally mining companies in their procurement of goods works and services are subject to special procurement rules under such procurement rules in most cases a subsoil user should purchase goods works and services by conducting an open tender other procurement methods can be used in cases stipulated by the procurement rules in major projects the parties choose international arbitration as dispute resolution forum in smaller projects local courts are also chosen as a dispute resolution forum mineral restrictions what restrictions are imposed on the processing export or sale of minerals are there any export quotas licensing or other mechanisms that prevent producers from freely exporting their production there are no general requirements that some or all minerals produced must be processed or sold domestically however a specific subsoil use contract may provide for a mining company s obligation to process certain amount of minerals in kazakhstan also the subsoil use law provides for the pre emptive right of kazakhstan to buy mineral resources produced by the subsoil user on a priority basis at prices not higher than prices on international markets details of such purchase entitlement are to be set out in the subsoil use contract further the export of certain minerals requires export licences import of funds restrictions what restrictions are imposed on the import of funds for exploration and extraction or the use of the proceeds from the export or sale of minerals there are no requirements to repatriate or use the proceeds of mineral sales domestically however there are some restrictions under foreign currency regulation according to whether the subject is resident or non resident branches and representative offices of foreign entities established in kazakhstan do not fall within the definition of residents for foreign currency control purposes in general resident legal entities are required to do the following notify the national bank of kazakhstan in the event of opening an account abroad pay other residents in kazakh currency and deposit their foreign currency received as the result of export operations at authorised banks and other financial institutions in kazakhstan the foreign exchange regulations for non residents are considerably less restrictive they may open offshore bank accounts without restriction and deposit their funds offshore non resident legal entities may purchase foreign currency on the domestic foreign currency market for routine currency operations and in other cases stipulated by legislative acts kazakhstan does not have a system of mandatory conversion into local currency

provides that subsoil users must finance activity aimed at social and economic development of the relevant region and its infrastructure the amount and terms of such financing should be detailed in subsoil use contracts compliance with this obligation is monitored by the mid and me depending on the type of minerals extracted the subsoil code will provide specific thresholds for expenses in connection with social and economic development for uranium operations 1 per cent of investment in mining activities for the preceding year the subsoil code does not envisage such a threshold for companies producing other minerals we interpret this to mean that new mining licences will not provide for such financing obligations rights of aboriginal indigenous or disadvantaged peoples how do the rights of aboriginal indigenous or currently or previously disadvantaged peoples affect the acquisition or exercise of mining rights kazakhstan s laws do not provide recognition and special rights for aboriginal or indigenous people as distinct from others international law what international treaties conventions or protocols relating to csr issues are applicable in your jurisdiction there is

buenos aires argentina tomás ruiz embraced his father one last time at the buenos aires airport before he boarded a plane in search of a new life in ireland his sister recently did the same when she moved to spain like many other young argentines the siblings hold european passports by descent and they are returning to the home countries of their grandparents far from argentina s sizzling inflation high unemployment and sharp currency depreciation my country s situation prompted me to take this decision ruiz said as he finished packing his bags for his trip to dublin surrounded by photos of his family and friends on the wall it was a constant frustration to live constantly on the edge barely making it to the end of the month ruiz studied gastronomy and was employed as a cafe manager in argentina s capital but even when he worked extra shifts he couldn t manage to save money and for months he had been living with his mother to save on rent outside his room family members left him and his sister farewell messages on a chalkboard i love you and i ll miss you his mother wrote others said the best is yet to come and carpe diem latin for seize the day it s not the first time argentines have sought shelter in europe in times of economic uncertainty hundreds of thousands emigrated to the old continent to escape hyperinflation in the early 1990s and an economic meltdown in 2001 and 2002 now argentines are losing purchasing power to a nearly 50 annual inflation rate one of the world s worst many have also protests president mauricio macri s decision to cut subsidies leading to a spike in the costs of utilities and public transportation last year the argentine peso lost more than half its value to the u s dollar following a run on the local currency causing the government to seek a record 56 billion bailout loan with the international monetary fund to try to come out of the recession as a result of the economic crisis and the devaluation more young professionals are thinking about a future in europe said alejandro servide director of professionals and recruitment process outsourcing at argentina s branch of randstad the world s second largest staffing company as part of the austerity measures aimed at balancing the budget macri s administration has laid off thousands of government workers and slashed funding for dance science and other programs hundreds recently protested outside the headquarters of the national scientific and technical research council argentina s main agency for science and technology the science sector is suffering because these budget cuts ordered by macri endanger the continuity of scientific activity said alberto kornblihtt a molecular biologist this is undoubtedly contributing to a brain drain that we ve suffered at other times of crisis in our country there are no official statistics available on how many argentines have moved to europe argentina s immigration directorate said it is nearly impossible to keep track of the number because argentines leaving the country don t have to provide information on their destination or how long they ll stay but academics research groups and consulting firms agree there has been a rise in the number of people leaving especially among young educated argentines just as there was during the nation s worst crisis 17 years ago back then millions were plunged into poverty more than 20 percent of the population became unemployed and many reportedly went hungry in a country that is one world s biggest producers of beef soy and wheat when argentina goes through these profound crises people search for options and just like it happened in 2001 2002 when nearly 800 000 argentines went abroad today we re living through perhaps the initial phase said ariel gonzalez executive secretary of the center for international studies at the catholic university of argentina that means that there s a sector of society the middle and high class professionals who are eyeing a plan b which is that if the crisis deepens one of the options would be to go abroad servide said randstad argentina carries out about 160 daily interviews for surveys one of the questions they ask is whether if given the chance they would be interested in living abroad about 80 percent tell you yes he said manuel miglioranza a 26 year old lawyer is moving next month to toulouse france although he doesn t have dual argentine french nationality he s going to take french lessons and find a job through a temporary work permit allowed through a treaty between the two nations the economic situation in argentina is not helping you can t progress unless you work for the state or you have dollars he said i know many people who are leaving millions of europeans flooded into argentina in the 19th century to escape war and poverty back home which has been a source of pride for the country argentina gave peace to those who were escaping war freedom to those escaping religious persecution and bread and work to those escaping hunger said horacio garcia director of argentina s national migration directorate of the last six presidents four of them were first generation sons of immigrants garcia noted their fathers came to argentina with a cardboard suitcase and they saw that their children in a short amount of time became presidents of the nation that hardly happens anywhere else in the world by the 20th century a strong workforce along with export earnings from agricultural products and beef had helped turn argentina into one of the wealthiest countries in the world argentines were also among the most europeanized and educated people in latin america gabriela nouzeilles and graciela montaldo write in their anthology the argentina reader history culture and politics their literacy rate about 90 percent was the highest by far until 1945 the country boasted the highest per capita income on the continent the most extensive urbanization the largest middle class as well as the best newspapers universities and publishing houses but political mismanagement and lower prices for agricultural products that form the country s economic backbone have for decades led to cyclical booms and busts the spanish government recently launched an initiative that allows a limited number of descendants of spaniards living in argentina without a spanish passport to seek a special three month work visa once they find a job they can request spanish nationality and bring their families there were 76 328 argentines officially registered by mid 2018 in spain there are many many argentines living here we re like pigeons everywhere quipped paz pucheu an argentine now living in spain the 25 year old radio and television announcer went to

use the lexology getting the deal through tool to compare the answers in this article with those from other jurisdictions mining industry standing what is the nature and importance of the mining industry in your country the mining industry in chile is historically the most significant economic activity in the country up to 2013 the mining sector constituted 11 1 per cent of the chilean gdp which makes this sector the most important part of the national economy also up to 2013 this industry accounted for 3 1 per cent of all occupations in the country when considering only the direct contracts of the mining companies and not the wide ranging industries related to mining finally considering the income from royalties and other general taxes and duties this sector made a 10 1 per cent contribution to national revenues taking into account the above mentioned data it is possible to state that this industry is without doubt crucial to the country this fact is highly considered in the relevant legislation driving chilean mining law to focus on stimulating and protecting investments and projects geographically and geologically chile has favourable conditions for mining activities combining attractive mineral resources with the advantage of short distances between the extraction sites and the exporting facilities which in addition to the intense government investment in transportation infrastructure during the past 15 years makes transit through the country fast easy and safe target minerals what are the target minerals the main metallic target mineral is copper however there are several important projects concerning other minerals such as molybdenum gold silver zinc lead and iron regarding non metallic minerals the most significant are lithium and nitrate regions which regions are most active the mining industry is located mainly in the northern area of the country and spread along the andes mountain chain the province with the highest income provided by mining is antofagasta other relevant political districts in the industry are the regions of tarapacá atacama valparaíso and the libertador general bernardo o higgins legal and regulatory structure basis of legal system is the legal system civil or common law based the legal system is civil law based regulation how is the mining industry regulated chile is a unitary country consisting of one state with a central government politically it is divided into 15 regions each region divided into provinces within the provinces the minimal administrative structures are the municipalities the law has effect over the whole territory of the country and any special or territorially limited effects are the exception to the rule according to the constitution of the republic of chile the state has the exclusive ownership of all mines including guano deposits metal bearing sands salt deposits coal and hydrocarbon deposits and fossil substances except for surface clays sands rocks and other materials directly used for construction the exploration and exploitation of such substances may be granted through a judicial procedure to any person or company by means of a mining concession moreover liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons lithium or deposits of any kind in maritime waters under national jurisdiction or deposits of any kind located in whole or in part in areas that by law have been classified as important to national security with mining activities shall be excluded from mining concessions the mining code sets the framework regarding the activity as such whereas there are several special regulations that deal with special aspects eg the foreign investment statute environmental protection statutes and mine closure procedures regional governments provinces and municipalities and other administration entities have little or no authority over the mining sector and they are restricted mostly to grant extraction permits over surface clays sands rocks and other materials directly used for construction which are located within national property under their administration what are the principal laws that regulate the mining industry what are the principal regulatory bodies that administer those laws were there any major amendments in the past year the most relevant laws regarding mining are the following the constitution of chile setting the cornerstone of property over every economic activity the mining code law no 18 248 which is the main legal body regarding mining activities and sets the framework for decree no 1 1986 establishing the regulation of mining the law of mining concessions law no 18 097 which focuses on the mechanism of concession of the deposit the law of foreign investment law no 20 848 which replaces decree law no 600 and creates the new legal framework for foreign investment and the special tax for the mining industry law no 20 026 which is a special regulation concerning taxation over mining activities the main government entity related to mining activities is the mining and geology national service sernageomin which approves the technical features of a project regarding the new law of foreign investment it is important to mention that it replaces decree law no 600 maintaining however some of its benefits decree law no 600 was one of the mechanisms established for the entry of capital into chile under this optional mechanism foreign investors were authorised to bring capital physical goods or other authorised forms of investment into chile through the execution of a foreign investment contract with the state of chile on the contrary under law no 20 848 foreign investment contracts shall not be entered into with the chilean state investors rights shall be evidenced through a certificate granted by the foreign investment promotion agency classification system what classification system does the mining industry use for reporting mineral resources and mineral reserves a commission created by law no 20 235 established a code for the reporting of mineral resources and reserves the commission was formed by mining experts and members of the public sector and its report is based on the australian joint ore reserves committee it is also recognised by the committee for mineral reserves international reporting standards the code mentioned above defines mineral resources as a concentration or occurrence of a natural solid organic or non organic fossilised material in such form quality and quantity that there is a rational prospect of its technical or economic potential moreover for this code the concept of mineral reserve also includes the diluted materials surrounding the site of the resource that can also be contaminated as an effect of the mining mining rights and title state control over mining rights to what extent does the state control mining rights in your jurisdiction can those rights be granted to private parties and to what extent will they have title to minerals in the ground are there large areas where the mining rights are held privately or which belong to the owner of the surface rights is there a separate legal regime or process for third parties to obtain mining rights in those areas as mentioned in question 5 the chilean state has the exclusive ownership over all mines excluding surface clays within the territory of chile the exploration and exploitation of such substances may be granted through a judicial procedure to any person or company by means of a mining concession both kinds of concession are given the same status as a real estate property right and any encumbrance or appropriation by third parties is susceptible to be challenged at the courts also the said concession only grants rights on the mineral substances but not on the surface land in which they are located in order to obtain the necessary rights to execute the exploration or exploitation over the surface land the chilean mining code sets forth a system of mining easements which are granted through a judicial procedure contemplating the necessary compensation to the surface land owner also as mentioned in question 5 liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons lithium or deposits of any kind in maritime waters under national jurisdiction and deposits of any kind located in whole or in part in areas that by law have been classified as important to national security with mining effects shall be excluded from mining concessions regarding the latter substances not subject to a mining concession they may be explored or exploited directly by the state or by one of its companies by means of an administrative concession or by special operation contracts under the requisites and conditions set by the president of chile specifically for each case by a supreme decree finally regarding surface clays sands rocks and other materials directly used for construction they belong to the owner of the surface land however if the surface land is under public administration such as a municipality the municipality shall be entitled to grant extraction permits over these materials publicly available information and data what information and data are publicly available to private parties that wish to engage in exploration and other mining activities is there an agency which collects mineral assessment reports from private parties must private parties file mineral assessment reports does the agency or the government conduct geoscience surveys which become part of the database is the database available online there are several agencies holding information related to geographic economic or commercial facts about the mining industry generally this information is public and any private actor may request it from the relevant authority among the most important information holders are the undersecretary of mining sernageomin and the chilean copper commission cochilco acquisition of rights by private parties what mining rights may private parties acquire how are these acquired what obligations does the rights holder have if exploration or reconnaissance licences are granted does such tenure give the holder an automatic or preferential right to acquire a mining licence what are the requirements to convert to a mining licence under chilean legislation private parties may acquire several mining rights these are mining claims mining exploitation concessions under constitution process mining petitions mining exploration concessions under constitution process mining exploration concessions reconnaissance licences and mining exploitation concessions mining licence all of these different kinds of mining rights are acquired on a first come first served basis mining concessions are considered as real immovable rights having the same legal status of a property but only regarding the mineral substances also mining concessions entitle its holder to request the necessary access over the surface land through the constitution of mining easements for both exploration and exploitation concessions with the obligation of adequately compensating any damage to the land owner to this rule however some exceptions may apply additionally the exploration licence grants preferential rights for requesting an exploitation licence concerning the main obligations of the rights holder they are obliged to pay the necessary annual fee for either exploration or exploitation licences the avoidance of complying with this obligation to obtain and comply with all the pertinent administrative authorisation such as environmental approvals health and safety procedures labour taxation and municipal regulation may cause the loss of the concession renewal and transfer of mineral licences what is the regime for the renewal and transfer of mineral licences an exploration mining concession is given for a period of two years renewable for another two years holding this type of concession gives priority to apply for an exploiting mining concession which is granted to the requesting party without a limit of time both kinds of concession are granted after a judicial writ submitted to the competent court in chilean law a concession is equivalent to a real estate property right but differing as to the dominion over the land where it is constituted concessions can be transferred to any private or public entity fulfilling the formal requirements which are similar to any sale of property in the related regulation this kind of right is also susceptible to be given as collateral to any kind of commercial operation duration of mining rights what is the typical duration of mining rights regarding the duration of mining rights see question 11 mining concessions cannot be revoked or cancelled by the government due to the property right that its holder has over such concessions which is guaranteed by article 19 no 24 of the chilean constitution acquisition by domestic parties versus acquisition by foreign parties is there any distinction in law or practice between the mining rights that may be acquired by domestic parties and those that may be acquired by foreign parties there are neither special requirements nor distinctions between nationals of foreign countries or chilean parties as such there is no necessity or desirability of having a domestic partner for the activity protection of mining rights how are mining rights protected are foreign arbitration awards in respect of domestic mining disputes freely enforceable in your jurisdiction mining rights are protected in the same way as property rights and others of similar characteristics there are no special courts concerning mining as it is considered part of the general jurisdiction of the civil courts of each district the judiciary system in chile is independent and respectful of the rule of law and due process chilean law follows the rules of the new york convention of recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards which makes international arbitration awards fully valid and enforceable in the country surface rights what types of surface rights may mining rights holders request and acquire how are these rights acquired can surface rights holders oppose these requests the holder of a mining concession may acquire any kind of rights contained in the chilean legislation over the surface property therefore the interested party can constitute dominion settle easements or pact leases over it nevertheless the proprietor of the surface land is entitled to ask the mining licensee to remedy any damage caused by the operation of the mine however he or she cannot oppose the request for mining easements the mining code also considers the possibility for a series of easements the licence holder can impose on the landowner of the surface land examples are the permit to transit and to construct pipelines ports and railways among others participation of government and state agencies does the government or do state agencies have the right to participate in mining projects is there a local listing requirement for the project company there is no special right for the chilean government and its agencies to engage in mining activities moreover the relevant regulation forces the state to act through state owned companies which require a special law to exist and are treated commercially as if they were private companies there is no local listing requirement needed for mining projects government expropriation of licences are there provisions in law dealing with government expropriation of licences what are the compensation provisions the constitution of chile establishes that only in cases where there is a public need is it possible to proceed on expropriation of any right of particulars in the case of a mining licence the legislation establishes a procedure to protect and to justly determine the price of the dispossessed the procedure is both administrative and judicial and it is designed to reduce the eventual involvement of the government in the final decision the relevant legislation is the organic law of expropriation procedures decree no 2 186 of 1978 this piece of legislation follows the international standard for prompt adequate and effective compensation in the case of expropriation protected areas are any areas designated as protected areas within your jurisdiction and which are off limits or specially regulated there is no cohesive body of legislation containing regulations regarding protected areas therefore there are several classifications of areas that are restricted to economic exploitation or human activities this structure is made considering the location s importance either environmentally or culturally these areas are well delineated by the relevant authorities and the level of human activities they can be subject to is variable with consideration of their characteristics some of the protected areas allow economic activities yet there are still specific restrictions or requirements that must be fulfilled beforehand eg in protected indigenous or cultural areas another relevant regulation is set out in article 17 of the mining code which lists several authorities from which the mining company must request permits before proceeding to extraction activities generally speaking most of the environmentally restricted areas are located in the southern provinces of the country away from the populated centres which considering that the more active mining provinces are in the northern part of the country make them of limited interest from the mining perspective duties royalties and taxes duties royalties and taxes payable by private parties what duties royalties and taxes are payable by private parties carrying on mining activities are these revenue based or profit based the general tax regime applicable to mining activity is dependent on the size of the operation small mining operations with a maximum of five employees are subject to an overall income tax with a fixed rate calculated according to a formula that takes into account the average price of copper and the company s sales larger companies for instance stock corporations or limited responsibility partnerships whose annual sales do not exceed 36 000 tonnes of metallic non ferrous minerals or 2 000 annual tax units regardless of the type of mineral are considered to be medium sized medium sized mining operations are subject to a presumptive tax regime under which the taxable income of the period is presumed to be a certain percentage of their net sales being subject to the general tax rates explained below this percentage ranges from 4 to 20 per cent according to the average copper price during the tax period companies exceeding the previous criteria are considered large mining operations these entities will be subject to the general income tax regime as such they are subject to income tax which from 2016 will be 24 per cent and a global complementary or additional tax depending on whether the contributor is a chilean or foreign national there is a royalty or specific mining tax over mining activities that covers any concessionaire who extracts and commercialises minerals in any type of production the rate of this tax is progressive and follows the volume of the company s production the rule is the following companies whose annual sales exceed the equivalent of 50 000 tonnes of fine copper pay a progressive rate of between 5 and 14 per cent companies whose annual sales are between the equivalent of 12 000 and 50 000 tonnes of fine copper pay a progressive rate of between 0 5 and 4 5 per cent and companies whose annual sales are equal to or less than 12 000 tonnes of fine copper are exempt from the royalty the value upon the tonnes of fine copper is calculated as according to the average value of grade a copper registered at the london metal exchange finally other duties and fees applying to any business are also applicable to mining activities as such these companies are subject to municipal and stamp duties and vat tax advantages and incentives what tax advantages and incentives are available to private parties carrying on mining activities there is no cohesive body of legislation for the incentives to the mining activities to be found the most relevant investment incentive is the one contained in law no 20 848 described in question 20 there is a special tax regime and other minor benefits granted for mining and industrial activities operating in isolated provinces of the northern and southern regions of the country other incentives contained in the general tax regulation include accelerated depreciation of assets vat refunds in qualified cases and deferred payment of custom duties over the importation of certain goods among others tax stablisation does any legislation provide for tax stabilisation or are there tax stabilisation agreements in force since 1974 most foreign investors in the country choose the rights granted by decree law no 600 under these rights investors bringing capital physical goods or any other kind of investment from abroad could choose to sign a foreign investment contract with chile according to the statistics issued by the foreign investment committee by 2011 at least 56 5 per cent of the capital brought in from abroad used this mechanism one of the features of this scheme was the existence of a stabilisation clause under this special tax regime investors could choose either to be subject to the standard tax regime or to choose a special regime that sets an invariable rate of additional tax on profit remittances at 42 per cent unmodified for a period of 10 years the investor could exit from this regime at any time in favour of the standard regime but could not subsequently return to the special regime this latter structure was replaced by law no 20 848 this new legislation is applicable to foreign direct investment which is defined as the transference to the country of foreign capital or assets owned by a foreign investor or controlled by it for a total amount equivalent to or higher than us 5 million or its equivalent in another currency implemented through convertible foreign currency physical assets in any state or form earning reinvestments credit capitalisation technologies in its diverse forms capable of being capitalised or credits associated to foreign investment coming from related companies foreign investors shall be protected by the applicable chilean law and no new stabilisation clauses shall apply however the ones already executed by the chilean state shall remain in force law no 20 848 mandates that the president issue a fostering and promotion strategy for foreign investment this strategy seeks to spur and streamline foreign investment in chile positioning the country as an international hub for business and investment this strategy will consist of a diagnosis of chile s international competitiveness including an evaluation of the capacity of the chilean economy to add value in the production of goods and services through the promotion of foreign investment along with the definition of long and mid term recommendations in order to promote and simplify foreign investment in chile the new legal regime sets up the creation of the foreign investment promotion agency which will be charged with promoting and attracting foreign investment and implementing the fostering and promotion strategy for foreign investment this agency will be the legal successor of the current foreign investment committee carried interest is the government entitled to a carried interest or a free carried interest in mining projects there is no governmental entitlement to a carried interest or free carried interest in mining projects transfer taxes and capital gains are there any transfer taxes or capital gains imposed regarding the transfer of licences there is no specific tax regarding the transfer of licences however there must be considerations regarding the rules about capital gains contained in the income tax law as licences have regulations similar to the transfer of real state property rights distinction between domestic parties and foreign parties is there any distinction between the duties royalties and taxes payable by domestic parties and those payable by foreign parties there is no distinction between chilean nationals and foreign nationals concerning the taxes they must pay business structures principal business structures what are the principal business structures used by private parties carrying on mining activities the usual mechanisms used by foreign investors are stock companies limited liability partnerships and agency or branch offices the most flexible of them is the stock company whereas the one that provides relatively better taxation conditions is the limited liability partnership as any mechanism presents benefits and deficiencies it is the investor who is entitled to choose between them local entity requirement is there a requirement that a local entity be a party to the transaction there is no specific requirement for a local partner to be part of the transaction bilateral investment and tax treaties are there jurisdictions with favourable bilateral investment treaties or tax treaties with your jurisdiction through which foreign entities will commonly structure their operations in your jurisdiction see question 46 financing principal sources of financing what are the principal sources of financing available to private parties carrying on mining activities what role does the domestic public securities market play in financing the mining industry traditionally project finance has been the most used mechanism for large investments in the mining industry concerning medium sized projects local or syndicated banking loans tend to be the favoured option another available option is the bond market although this has not yet been exploited by many mining companies additionally the stock market has not been significant in financing mining projects direct financing from government or major pension funds does the government its agencies or major pension funds provide direct financing to mining projects neither the government nor its agencies are involved in direct financing for mining projects however there are some programmes for fostering investment and technology focused on mining funded by the national treasury pension funds are allowed to invest in both domestic and foreign financial markets therefore they are free to invest in mining companies at their will however no specific legislation targets these investments on mining projects security regime describe the regime for taking security over mining interests under the rules of the mining code the mining licence is considered as a real estate property right as such it is possible for the proprietor to mortgage it as collateral for obtaining credit in similar conditions to that of real estate for this purpose the applicable regime is the same as the general rules regarding real estate and contracts of mortgages restrictions importation restrictions what restrictions are imposed on the importation of machinery and equipment or services required in connection with exploration and extraction there is no specific limitation or restriction upon mining machinery or equipment the general rule being that all kinds of goods can be imported into the country standard conditions and agreements which standard conditions and agreements covering equipment supplies are used in your jurisdiction in general terms be spoken contracts are used in chile as opposed to standard conditions such as fidic although large international companies have prepared its own templates for procurement and other services or works contracts generally these types of contracts are owner friendly although it heavily depends on current market conditions and bargaining powers of each party in relation to disputes there is an increase in the use of technical experts to solve technical disputes although still cannot be labelled as a trend these types of alternative dispute mechanisms are more common in large international projects mineral restrictions what restrictions are imposed on the processing export or sale of minerals are there any export quotas licensing or other mechanisms that prevent producers from freely exporting their production the general principle in the international commerce regulation is that there are no export quotas or a mechanism that prohibits or prevents the marketing of goods abroad however there is one restriction contained in law no 16 624 this regulation imposes on all copper producers generating over 75 000 tonnes per year that they reserve a percentage of their production for the national industry cochilco is the entity in charge of the determination of such percentage import of funds restrictions what restrictions are imposed on the import of funds for exploration and extraction or the use of the proceeds from the export or sale of minerals the governing principle of the international currency exchange in chile is the free flow of capital this guiding principle has been progressively implemented since 1990 and has changed the role of the central bank of chile from a comptroller and restrictive agency to a supervisor and an information holder accordingly regulation is lenient and mainly establishes that funds must be brought to the country via the formal capital market consisting of banks certain exchange bureaux stockbrokers and some entities approved by the central bank the central bank requests a series of procedures and requirements with the aim of maintaining updated information about the amount and origin of the capital the relevant regulation for these purposes is contained in the compendium of foreign exchange regulations this regulation establishes that investments and profits must be transferred outbound from and inbound to the country via the rules of chapter xiv of the compendium environment principal applicable environmental laws what are the principal environmental laws applicable to the mining industry what are the principal regulatory bodies that administer those laws the main environmental laws in the country are law no 19 300 the environmental framework law law no 20 417 which created the ministry for the environment the service of environmental assessment and the superintendency of the environment and law no 20 551 regulating mines and installations closure this regulatory structure is set on a nationwide basis with few exceptions to the procedure and forces all provinces to follow the same process once they have received environmental approval applications the exceptions are limited and the process is designed to incorporate any local or special features of the location where the project is located additionally the information regarding these special features is generally public and the relevant agencies are holders of such information the main agencies overseeing environmental issues are the ministry of the environment the superintendency of the environment and the environment assessment service also regarding mining sernageomin plays a relevant part in every aspect of the project and in the planning and approval of the mine closure procedure environmental review and permitting process what is the environmental review and permitting process for a mining project how long does it normally take to obtain the necessary permits mining projects are expressly mentioned as one of the activities subject to the environmental impact assessment service this service requires the project to submit either an environmental impact declaration or an environmental impact study the difference between the necessity of the submission of either of these documents is reliant on the environmental concerns of the project and the specific criteria to determinate it and therefore the relevant law and regulation generally speaking the declaration is needed for minor projects where the potential harm to the environment is limited whereas the study focuses on major and more environmentally perilous activities in consideration of the process the authorities once receiving the documentation required have 120 days to deliver a decision on the application if after this period there is no official response there is a legal presumption that the project is authorised however there are several deferrals to this term and usually the final authorisation takes between four and 12 months once the operations are authorised the environmental assessment service will produce a global environmental permit certifying that the project complies with the environmental requirements closure and remediation process what is the closure and remediation process for a mining project what performance bonds guarantees and other financial assurances are required law no 20 551 sets the procedure and measures the mining companies must perform regarding mine closure the core idea behind this legislation is that the mine closure is an integral part of the operation of the project and it must be considered and implemented progressively through its exploitation it also implements the polluter pays principle as such the mining company must establish a guarantee up to the value of the implementation of all the closure and post closure measures previewed in the closure plan the amount of this guarantee is determined considering the cost of remediation and closure and post closure measures the specific time for the submission of this guarantee is set following the rules regarding the assumed life of the deposit taking into consideration the estimated life of the extraction operation the relevant authority for this procedure is sernageomin restrictions on building tailings or waste dams what are the restrictions for building tailings or waste dams supreme decree no 248 from 2007 for the approval design con struction operation and closure of tailings dams establishes technical requirements and safeguards for those facilities all the specific measures regarding environmental impacts and safety mechanisms for communities are determined case by case by the environmental authority and the national service of mining and geology depending on the exact location of the dam and the level of risks that its construction presents health safety and labour issues principal health and safety and labour laws what are the principal health and safety and labour laws applicable to the mining industry what are the principal regulatory bodies that administer those laws decree no 132 2004 is the relevant regulation in relation to mining health and safety the main objective of this decree is to establish a general framework to protect the life and integrity of the workers of the mining industry and of the activities closely related to it and to protect the installations infrastructure machinery buildings and premises that make mining operations possible the government agencies overseeing this purpose are sernageomin and the regional office of the ministry of health the labour code sets a general employment framework being the main legislation concerning the conditions and characteristics of the jobs that can be offered and the employees that any company can hire the principal governmental agencies are the ministry of employment and the employment inspection management and recycling of mining waste what are the rules related to management and recycling of mining waste products who has title and the right to explore and exploit mining waste products in tailings ponds and waste piles decree no 248 2007 of the ministry of mining regulates the management of mining waste it states that any mining company may deliver a management project to sernageomin applying for its authorisation to start building tailings ponds or waste piles after its approval the mining operator must send quarterly reports to sernageomin with the conditions of such tailing ponds and waste piles and its maintenance additionally the owner of the mine concession from which the waste is extracted is the only entity permitted to explore and exploit such waste notwithstanding if the mine concession is expired or the wastes are abandoned the owner of the mine concession where the waste is located will be entitled to explore or exploit them use of domestic and foreign employees what restrictions and limitations are imposed on the use of domestic and foreign employees in connection with mining activities there are no special restrictions and limitations regarding the nationality of employees in the mining industry however there is an extensive regulation concerning the general conditions a foreign national must have to be allowed to work in the country and the responsibilities that the employer must fulfil concerning this the main condition the legislation imposes on the employer is that a maximum of 85 per cent of the total direct work force can be foreign employees nevertheless there are some exceptions to this rule which are dependent on the size of the company and the technical level of the employee another relevant item regarding foreign employees is the fulfilment of general migratory conditions and the surveillance of the corresponding visa social and community issues community engagement and csr what are the principal community engagement or csr laws applicable to the mining industry what are the principal regulatory bodies that administer those laws there is no legislation regarding csr in chile however it is recommended that a mining company undertakes its own policies rights of aboriginal indigenous or disadvantaged peoples how do the rights of aboriginal indigenous or currently or previously disadvantaged peoples affect the acquisition or exercise of mining rights there is a special status for indigenous lands and natural resources within the national territory this status is set by law no 19 253 the indigenous law and convention 169 of the international labour organization ilo according to this legislation indigenous people cannot be detached from their land by any means without the approval of the indigenous development national corporation as a result of the former rule the exploitation of a mining project might be hindered and the mining company must be aware of any indigenous land affected by its operations international law what international treaties conventions or protocols relating to csr issues are applicable in your jurisdiction there is no specific legislation concerning csr however there is some regulation of the rights of indigenous people derived from chile s membership of convention 169 of the ilo anti bribery and corrupt practices local legislation describe any local legislation governing anti bribery and corrupt practices chile has no specific anti bribery legislation as regulation is spread over several acts and decrees however the rules in this regard are tight and government agencies are strict on its execution outstanding legislation on this matter includes international treaties on the context of chile as a member of the oecd 1997 convention on bribery of public servants on international transactions decree no 1 879 1998 inter american convention against bribery law no 20 414 on transparency and modernisation of the state law no 20 285 of 2008 on access to public information granting access to individuals to any kind of information held by governmental agencies law no 20 393 on criminal liability of corporations covering matters related to financing terrorism money laundering and bribery this legislation was one of the bills the chilean government was compelled to approve as the application of chile to the oecd was enacted and law no 19 880 on the basis of administration of the state setting the framework on which the government its agencies and public servants must conduct and operate one of the most important features of this act is the principle of integrity of public servants stating they must perform their activities on the highest legal and moral levels foreign legislation do companies in your country pay particular attention to any foreign legislation governing anti bribery and foreign corrupt practices in your jurisdiction there is no binding legislation related to adopting any foreign anti bribery regulations however chilean companies are free to subject themselves in this issue to any higher standard they choose as chile is a member of the oecd there are two laws that national companies take into consideration these are the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act disclosure of payments by resource companies has your jurisdiction enacted legislation or adopted international best practices regarding disclosure of payments by resource companies to government entities in accordance with the extractive industries transparency initiative eiti standard chile is not a member of eiti additionally individuals or companies income tax payments are not public information however there are detailed statistics of the incomes received by the treasury from the mining industry foreign investment foreign ownership restrictions are there any foreign ownership restrictions in your jurisdiction relevant to the mining industry there are no restrictions in chile related to the ownership of a mining project by foreign nationals international treaties applicable international treaties what international treaties apply to the mining industry or an investment in the mining industry in the past 30 years the chilean economy has progressively become more open to the world under this policy chile has signed free trade agreements with more than 60 countries the two most important being those with the us and the eu to date chile is also a relevant participant in the elaboration of the trans pacific partnership treaty as such for most products custom duties are minimal and restrictions to either imports or exports tend to be few in the mining field in particular the country has three main treaties that are worth mentioning the mining treaty with argentina the mining treaty with the asia pacific economic cooperation apec and membership of the international copper study group icsg the mining treaty with argentina created a permanent body whose mission is to review and propose legislation and solutions to binational controversies and difficulties that any mining project may have one of the main examples of the execution of this treaty is the pascua lama project regarding the apec and the icsg memberships chile is an active participant in identifying modern solutions to mining problems and delegates of the ministry of mining concern themselves regarding the most recent situations in the international forum finally chile is a member of the kyoto protocol and the stockholm convention also it has signed several double taxation treaties with argentina canada mexico and south korea among others
use the lexology getting the deal through tool to compare the answers in this article with those from other jurisdictions mining industry standing what is the nature and importance of the mining industry in your country finland is one of the leading mining countries in europe and the mining industry plays a very important role in finland along with its future growth potential finland has the right geology and a long mining tradition mining activity in finland is currently concentrated around gold platinum group metals base metals diamonds and industrial minerals finland offers an attractive investment and operating environment for the exploration and mining industry there is potential for new discoveries because there are commodities that are currently explored on a small scale or not at all in contrast to many other countries finland also has many high class geological databases available on the internet the infrastructure is good even in rural areas and there are skilled subcontractors available also the public sector provides many services for the mining industry that would in other countries incur large costs finland s mining production has doubled over the past decade and the growth has been especially fast in recent years albeit the downturn in commodity prices has had its impacts on the finnish mining and exploration industry in 2017 the total amount extracted from finnish mines grew to 120 4 million tonnes of which 48 4 million tonnes constituted ore or usable minerals as it appears from the report of the mining authority the finnish safety and chemicals agency tukes the number of mine workers in the whole mining sector including construction minerals in finland has also increased and the total workforce including subcontractors currently numbers around 4 500 people out of the 44 mines in finland 22 mines reported to have quarried in 2017 twelve mines in finland quarried metallic minerals three of the biggest mines in finland account for 86 per cent of all quarried minerals all in all the whole finnish mineral cluster including the technology and service providers provides employment for some 30 000 people target minerals what are the target minerals the target minerals are as follows metal mineral mining production in finland discovery potential in finland aluminium no deposits low discovery potential antimony deposits moderate discovery potential barite no deposits moderate discovery potential bentonite no deposits low discovery potential beryllium no deposits moderate discovery potential boron no deposits low discovery potential chromium mining production good discovery potential clay minerals deposits moderate discovery potential cobalt mining production good discovery potential copper mining production

discovery potential titanium mining projects good discovery potential tungsten deposits moderate discovery potential uranium and thorium exploration unknown vanadium mining projects good discovery potential zinc mining production good discovery potential lately there has been increased interest in minerals used in battery technology and renewable energy in finland regions which regions are most active northern and eastern finland are the most active regions although ore bodies are also discovered in other parts of the country legal and regulatory structure basis of legal system is the legal system civil or common law based finland s legal system is civil law based regulation how is the mining industry regulated in finland national and eu laws regulate the entire country although the åland islands are exempt in some aspects given their right of self government there are mining and other laws in force that regulate the mining industry what are the principal laws that regulate the mining industry what are the principal regulatory bodies that administer those laws were there any major amendments in the past year there is a special mining law in force namely the new mining act which entered into force on 1 july 2011 the mining act takes account of other key legislation applicable to exploration and mining activity including the nature conservation act environmental protection act the act on the protection of wilderness reserves the land use and building act water act reindeer husbandry act radiation act nuclear energy act antiquities act off road traffic act dam safety act and the occupational safety and health act several government decrees have been issued based on the mining act such as the mining decree the government decree on mine safety and the decree of the ministry of employment and the economy on hosting equipment in mines all laws operate at the national level the most important government body for the mining industry is tukes which acts as the mining authority tukes is responsible for granting permits and supervising and enforcing compliance with the mining act decisions of tukes can be appealed to the administrative courts the ministry of employment and the economy is responsible for the general guidance monitoring and development of activities under the mining act on the environmental side the environmental permit required for mining is granted by the competent regional state administrative agency avi whereas the centres for economic development transport and the environment ely centres manage the regional implementation and development tasks of the state administration the ely centres supervise decisions with respect to environmental and water permits issued by the avis and protect the public interest in environmental and water issues activities that require an environmental permit such as mining projects are supervised throughout their lifetime ely centres also act as contact authorities in environmental impact assessment procedures local municipalities are responsible for their own detailed planning and are also the authorities granting building permits finally in any matters that relate to radioactive substances the radiation and nuclear safety authority of finland stuk is the key authority that is involved the stuk belongs to the administration of the ministry of social affairs and health effective as of 1 january 2016 the mining act was amended so that the right to appeal the mining authority s decisions all the way through to the supreme administrative court is restricted the possibility to appeal against decisions rendered by the mining authority first to the administrative court and then to the supreme administrative court was until the end of the year 2015 unrestricted the amendment alters the current appeal procedure so that appealing the decisions of the administrative courts to the supreme administrative court will in most cases only be possible if a retrial permit is granted the amendment is related to a broader legislative reform aimed at enhancing and accelerating the handling of administrative decisions made by the finnish authorities the retrial permit procedure is applied only to such decisions of the mining authority that are rendered on or after 1 january 2016 the revision of the environmental protection act is currently subject to its third and last phase of amendments the third phase of amendments concerns streamlining environmental permitting the mining act was subject to reforms on 1 june 2017 relating among other things to the following the mining act required that an applicant must when necessary complete a natura 2000 assessment and an environmental impact assessment eia when submitting a mining permit application and not when the permit is being decided making the applicant prepare these assessments years before submitting the mining permit application and hence mineral reserve estimates etc might not be up to date the mining act was revised so that the priority of an exploration permit gold panning permit or mining permit would be obtained even if the permit application do not include the said assessments so long as these are provided prior to the permit decision the removal of the one kilometre exclusion zone competing permits applied to reservation notifications shortening the waiting period probation period relating to previous exploration or mining permit areas that have being relinquished or lapsed from three years to two the relinquishment of exploration permits which was deregulated so that the obligation to pay exploration fees ceased to exist as soon as tukes is notified in writing of the permit holder s intention to relinquish the exploration permit furthermore landowners would no longer be able to appeal from the relinquishment decisions initiated by the permit holder when an operating mine is extended with a new mining area or auxiliary area the mining safety permit procedures are simplified or updates may not be required at all classification system what classification system does the mining industry use for reporting mineral resources and mineral reserves mainly the canadian cim and australian jorc systems mining rights and title state control over mining rights to what extent does the state control mining rights in your jurisdiction can those rights be granted to private parties and to what extent will they have title to minerals in the ground are there large areas where the mining rights are held privately or which belong to the owner of the surface rights is there a separate legal regime or process for third parties to obtain mining rights in those areas finland has a system according to which the discoverer basically can acquire the rights to the minerals in the ground even if the surface rights are held by the state or a third party tukes registers reservations for areas on which exploration permits can be filed and issues exploration and mining permits subject to the legal requirements being met currently less than 2 per cent of the total area of finland is subject to exploration or mining permits or applications of the foregoing exploration it is possible for private parties to engage in exploration in the form of prospecting work without any permit on areas where the surface rights are held by someone else private or state this right is comparable with rights of public access it is also possible to carry out exploration without an exploration permit but with a landowner s permit but this does not give any priority to acquiring the exploration or mining permit for the target area an exploration permit granted by tukes is always required if the activity poses any risk to people s health general safety or other industrial and commercial activity or any deterioration of the landscape or nature conservation without exception an exploration permit is required if the prospecting is targeted for locating or exploring a deposit containing uranium or thorium the exploration and mining rights can be acquired by private parties a reservation followed by an exploration or mining permit or both gives the priority and title to the minerals in the target area there are increasing numbers of reservations exploration permit areas and mining permit areas but there are still large areas with good or moderate discovery potential available for interested parties mining a mining permit gives the right to develop a mine and to carry out mining activities the holder of a mining permit has the right to exploit mining minerals found in the mining area organic and inorganic surface materials waste rock and tailings generated as by products of mining activities in addition the holder may exploit other materials belonging to the bedrock and soil of the mining area to the extent that their use is necessary for the purposes of mining operations in the mining area the mining permit also entitles its holder to exploration within the mining area the procedures for establishing a mining area involve the claiming of rights to land use and of other special rights to the areas required for the mining area and auxiliary area of a mine the determination of compensation and the conducting of required measures of land subdivision the decision to grant a mining permit is based on a comprehensive approach on the one hand taking account of the needs of prospecting and mining and on the other hand considering factors such as the status of landowners and private parties sustaining damage moreover impacts of activities on the environment landscape land use and safety the economic use of natural resources and nature conservation radiation safety and the reconciliation of user needs in different areas need to be taken into account very often the mining company acquires the title surface rights to the land through voluntary acquisitions should this not be the case the government may grant a permit to utilise an area for mining even though the surface rights are held by someone else redemption permit for a mining area the formal prerequisite for this is that the mining project is in the public interest publicly available information and data what information and data are publicly available to private parties that wish to engage in exploration and other mining activities is there an agency which collects mineral assessment reports from private parties must private parties file mineral assessment reports does the agency or the government conduct geoscience surveys which become part of the database is the database available online the geological survey of finland gtk is the national geological organisation as well as the national geoscience centre responsible for collecting and maintaining geoscientific data in finland the gtk s key activities are the mapping and evaluation of natural resources and research and development in addition to national mapping and geosciences information related to bedrock geology geophysics geochemistry and mineral occurrences the gtk evaluates the ore potential of geological formations to encourage further evaluation by the private sector all discoveries are tendered to the private sector through the ministry of employment and the economy and the government has no role in the downstream development of the mineral deposits the gtk s databases cover the entire country with exceptional quality and include high resolution low altitude airborne geophysical surveys to a 40 metre altitude with 200 metre line spacing regional till geochemical sampling one sample per 4km2 in bedrock mapping at a 1 100 000 scale and quaternary geology mapping at a 1 20 000 scale data sets are available in digital geographic information systems

deposits mineral indications data and bedrock age data in finland the holder of an exploration permit must submit an annual report to tukes on the exploration activities that have been carried out and their main results the report must be submitted in electronic format on the template provided by tukes the annual report is divided into two parts of which part 1 costs and investments must be delivered to tukes during february or march and part 2 geological surveys by june once an exploration permit has expired or been cancelled the exploration permit holder must within six months submit to tukes an exploration work report the material information pertaining to the exploration and a representative set of drill core samples the drill core samples are ultimately archived at the drill core archive of the gtk acquisition of rights by private parties what mining rights may private parties acquire how are these acquired what obligations does the rights holder have if exploration or reconnaissance licences are granted does such tenure give the holder an automatic or preferential right to acquire a mining licence what are the requirements to convert to a mining licence right to carry out prospecting work in finland based on the principle of public access everyone has the right even on another s land to conduct geological measurements and make observations and take minor samples in order to find mining minerals provided that this does not cause any damage or more than minor inconvenience or disturbance prospecting work there are however some limitations related to restricted areas prior to commencement of sampling the person or company has to submit a notification to the owner of a real estate in the prospecting area which contains contact details of the prospecting area methods used and targeted mining minerals as well as other information set out in the mining act a private party may make a reservation notification and acquire an exploration or mining permit on a first come first served basis exploration or mining permits are granted if the applicant proves that the conditions set out in the mining act are met and there is no impediment stipulated in the mining act to the granting of the permit however regardless of an impediment specified in the mining act a permit may be granted if it is possible to remove said impediment through permit conditions or by decreasing the size of the area reservation the reservation notification is filed in written form with tukes the notification must include information on the notifier the target area reservation area and a compilation of an exploration plan and other measures in preparation for the exploration permit application the reservation notification may not concern an area that forms part of an exploration area mining area or gold panning area belonging to a party other than the applicant on the basis of a permit referred to in the mining act in addition the reservation notification cannot concern an area that has previously been a reservation area until one year has passed since the expiry or cancellation of the reservation decision the reservation gives priority to get an exploration permit and is valid for a maximum period of 24 months within which time an exploration permit application must be filed or the reservation will expire should the reservation permit holder carry out small scale prospecting work the holder has to give prior notice of prospecting to the landowner of the prospecting area as mentioned above a reservation does not entitle to exploration unless the landowner in question gives his or her permit a reservation cannot be assigned to another party exploration permit exploration permits are granted on a first to file basis by tukes taking into account that a reservation gives priority mining permits for uranium and thorium are granted by the finnish government basically if exploration cannot be carried out as per the above mentioned prospecting work and the property owner does not consent to exploration a permit granted by tukes exploration permit is needed an exploration permit is also always required if the exploration could cause harm to people s health or general safety damage to other industrial and commercial activity or any deterioration in value related to the landscape or nature protection values further an exploration permit is required if the targeted minerals are uranium or thorium the application for a permit must include reliable information on the applicant meeting the prerequisites for carrying out operations commensurate with the following the permit sought the area and parties concerned a preliminary assessment of the mining minerals in the area and the basis for such an assessment plans concerning the activities the environmental and other impacts of activities and aftercare measures the exploration permit also includes provisions on the following among others the times and methods of exploration surveys and the equipment and constructions used measures to diminish harm caused to reindeer herding in a special reindeer herding area obligation to report about exploration activities and their results post exploration measures the waste management plan for extractive waste and collateral securing the post exploration measures the holder of an exploration permit has an obligation to carry out prospecting or a survey tukes can decide that an exploration permit will expire if operations have been interrupted continuously for a minimum of one year for a reason given by the permit holder the person who in connection with exploration intends to damage or cut down trees has to inform the landowner in advance damage and harm arising from exploration has to be compensated in full the exploration permit holder must pay an exploration fee see also question 19 and compensate landowners or owners of the water areas for all damage and harm caused to them the holder of the exploration permit must deliver to the mining authority a detailed annual report on the exploration work carried out in the permit area after the termination or expiry of the exploration permit the permit holder must immediately restore the exploration area to the condition required by public safety remove temporary constructions and equipment attend to rehabilitation and tidying of the area and restore the area to its natural status as far as possible the permit holder must also submit to the mining authority within six months an exploration work report the information material pertaining to the exploration and a representative set of core samples accompanied by the drill logs mining permit mining permits are as exploration permits also granted on a first to file basis by tukes however an exploration permit holder has priority to the mining permit in respect of the same area mining permits for uranium and thorium are granted by the finnish government the establishment of a mine and undertaking of mining activity are subject to a mining permit granted by tukes even when the mining permit application relates to an area for which an exploration permit has been granted the mining permit is a new permit and subject to new scrutiny of the project on its merits the prerequisites for getting a mining permit are that the deposit is exploitable in terms of size ore content and technical characteristics a mining permit entitles the holder to exploit the mining minerals found in the mining area the organic and inorganic surface materials excess rock and tailings generated as a by product of mining activities and other materials belonging to the bedrock and soil of the mining area to the extent that the use of these is necessary for the purposes of mining operations the mining permit also entitles the holder to carry out exploration within the mining area the mining permit holder is obliged to ensure the following that the mining activities do not cause damage to people s health or danger to public safety that mining activities do not cause significant harm to public or private interests that they reasonably avoid the infringement of public or private interests in relation to the overall costs of the mining operations that excavation and exploitation do not entail obvious wasting of mining minerals and that potential future use and excavation work at the mine and deposit are not endangered or encumbered the mining permit holder is obliged to submit an annual report to the mining authority on the extent and results of the exploitation of the deposit and to inform of any essential changes in the information on mineral resources in the mining permit tukes sets a time limit during which the permit holder has to start the mining activity or such preparatory work that indicates that the permit holder is seriously aiming at actual mining operations if the time limit is forfeited tukes may decide that the mining permit should expire finally when the mining activities have ended the mining permit holder has two years to bring the mine and any auxiliary areas up to the standards required by public safety and to make the necessary rehabilitation cleaning and landscaping measures this includes the measures that have been set out in the mining and mine safety permits redemption permit for a mining area in most cases the mining company acquires the title to the surface rights through a voluntary purchase however should the applicant of the mining permit not hold the surface rights the applicant has to obtain from the government the right to utilise the area for mining a redemption permit for a mining area the granting of such permit is subject to the mining project being based on public need and the mining area meeting the requirements set forth in the mining act see question 15 the holder of the mining permit must also pay an excavation fee to the holders of the surface rights as well as compensate in full for damages or harm to the landowners see question 19 renewal and transfer of mineral licences what is the regime for the renewal and transfer of mineral licences renewal of an exploration permit an exploration permit is granted for a fixed term of up to four years the permit can be extended for up to three years at a time for a total period of 15 years the extension is subject to the following requirements the exploration must have been effective and systematic the determination of the exploitability of the deposit requires follow up research the permit holder has complied with the terms of the permit and extending the permit does not cause unreasonable harm to private or public interest mining permit a mining permit is as a rule granted until further notice a permit can be granted for a fixed term only where there are compelling reasons that relate to for example the size and qualities of the deposit and the ability of the applicant to start the mining operation the term may not exceed 10 years from the date on which the permit gained legal force the mining act requires tukes to review the terms of the mining permit every 10 years even for those permits that are valid until further notice however the revision of the terms may not materially lower the profit that is derived from the mine transfer of permits a reservation for an exploration permit cannot be transferred an exploration permit and a mining permit are transferable moreover an exploration permit application and a mining permit application can be transferred the transferee has to meet the same legal requirements that are detailed in the mining act for a permit holder for the production of uranium or thorium a permit pursuant to the nuclear energy act is also required the transfer is subject to the approval of tukes which generally has to approve the transfer if the formal requirements have been met however tukes may decline to approve the transfer if for example the transferee has earlier failed to comply with requirements of the mining act change of control situations a change of control in the permit holder eg the shareholder of a permit holder company sells its shares to another does not have to be approved by tukes in order for the permit to continue to be valid however as the exploration permit has a limited term and also because the terms of a mining permit are revised every 10 years the change of control may lead to changes in the terms of the permit this could be the case if for instance the ability of the permit holder to fulfil the requirements of the permit changed owing to the change of control duration of mining rights what is the typical duration of mining rights see question 11 in respect of duration and extension of mining rights tukes may cancel an exploration permit mining permit or gold panning permit if in the permit application incorrect or incomplete information has been given that essentially affected the conditions under which the permit was given or the permit consideration in other ways the permit holder no longer meets the requirements for granting of a permit or the permit holder has materially neglected or violated the obligations restrictions or permit regulations laid down in the mining act if the deficiencies violations or neglect can be corrected or are insignificant the mining authority shall before making a decision meant above set a time limit for the permit holder in question to rectify the defect violation or neglect acquisition by domestic parties versus acquisition by foreign parties is there any distinction in law or practice between the mining rights that may be acquired by domestic parties and those that may be acquired by foreign parties parties eligible to apply for an exploration or mining permit are the parties entitled to operate a business in finland such as any natural person domiciled within the european economic area eea any finnish corporation or foundation and any foreign corporation or foundation that has been established in accordance with the laws of a state belonging to the eea and that has its registered office central administration or principal place of business in a state belonging to the eea and has registered a branch office in finland the national board of patents and registrations may grant a permit to conduct business operations governed by the mining act to another natural person as well as to a foreign corporation or foundation such a permit is also required for a general or limited partnership unless at least one of the partners in the general partnership or one of the liable partners in the limited partnership is a natural person or corporation that fulfils the above requirements in addition a governmental agency may apply for such permits in practice exploration and mining companies usually set up a finnish subsidiary in the form of a limited liability company through which the activities are carried out protection of mining rights how are mining rights protected are foreign arbitration awards in respect of domestic mining disputes freely enforceable in your jurisdiction the supervision of the granting of mining rights their validity and the compliance with the mining act by the holders of the mining rights is carried out by tukes whose decisions can be appealed to the administrative courts and given that a retrial permit is granted further to the supreme administrative court damage compensation claims and injunctions or other temporary procedural remedies are handled by the local district courts as the first instance punishments under the penal code relating to obligations set forth in the mining act are also handled by the district courts in the first instance finland is a party to the un convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards new york 1958 the new york convention and hence foreign arbitration awards with respect to countries belonging to the new york convention as a rule are enforceable in finland surface rights what types of surface rights may mining rights holders request and acquire how are these rights acquired can surface rights holders oppose these requests surface rights available for private parties are ownership of land tenancy or usufruct rights to the surface ownership of land is acquired by purchasing the property by executing a written purchase agreement that must be executed in a specified form the landowner of a mining area are however not under an obligation to sell their property to the mining right holder tenancy is agreed with the landowner in a tenancy agreement which has to be made in writing and signed by both parties it is also possible to agree with the landowner on the right to take extractable land resources from a property the right to utilise extractable land resources from a property can also be carried out by including in the mining permit such areas where there are land resources that are suitable for filling in during mining operations or other material that is required as supplementary material in the processing of the mined products should the mining company not purchase the surface rights it can obtain usufruct rights to the area needed for mining activity this takes place either through contractual means or by applying to the government for a redemption permit for a mining area a redemption permit must be based on a public need and therefore these are not automatically granted this public need is assessed on the basis of the impact of the mining project on the local and regional economy and employment and society s need for the raw material in this case the title to the land does not transfer to the mining company however if the mining area or its auxiliary area causes major inconvenience for the utilisation of the area the owner of the surface rights may demand that the whole property or a part thereof is redeemed by the holder of the mining permit the principle of full compensation to the landowner is the rule there are also some other situations when the owner of the surface rights may demand redemption usually if possible on reasonable terms the mining companies purchase the surface rights from the landowner through voluntary acquisitions the general rule in finland is that the owner of a property has to use that property in a way that does not cause inconvenience to neighbours the mining act obliges the holder of the mining rights to compensate the landowners tenants and other parties for damage and inconvenience whether temporary or permanent caused by mining or exploration operations in determining the compensation payable to the holders of the surface rights the principles applicable to compensation in the event of expropriation of property for general needs are used which generally require full compensation to be paid participation of government and state agencies does the government or do state agencies have the right to participate in mining projects is there a local listing requirement for the project company the government can participate in mining projects for example through voluntary investments in mining companies the government cannot demand a stake in a mining project if the stakeholders of the project do not agree to this mining companies do not have to be listed in finland many companies are listed abroad such as in toronto or london and may or may not have a dual listing at the omx nasdaq helsinki exchange government expropriation of licences are there provisions in law dealing with government expropriation of licences what are the compensation provisions there are no provisions on government expropriation of licences protected areas are any areas designated as protected areas within your jurisdiction and which are off limits or specially regulated prospecting work and the granting of an exploration permit or gold panning permit is prohibited in the following areas on the ground of a cemetery or within 50 metres of such an area in an area used by the finnish defence forces or any area controlled by the border guard where movement is restricted or prohibited or within 100 metres of such an area in an area where movement is restricted or access denied to outsiders on a traffic route or passage in public use within 150 metres of a building intended for residential or work use or comparable space in an area in horticultural use within 50 metres of a public building or utility or either a power line with a voltage of over 35 000 volts or an electricity substation and in any other similar area designated for special use however prospecting work as well as exploration may be carried out in an area referred to above except for cemeteries with the consent of the authority or institution competent in the matter or that of the relevant holder of rights moreover there are limitations with regard to certain traffic areas which in certain cases require the consent of the authority or institution competent in the matter or that of the holder of the rights for exploration whenever the area in question is a street area or market place a road area of a highway an airport or another area in aviation use a railway area a canal used for public traffic or another such traffic area or an area within 30 metres of any of the above mentioned traffic areas there are also certain limitations with regard to areas that have previously been covered by an exploration permit or mining permit the mining area and the auxiliary area to a mine should in principle not be located in an area for which an exploration permit or a gold panning permit cannot be granted based on the above limitations however a mining permit may be granted regardless of an impediment referred to above if the mining area cannot be otherwise implemented as a continuous area of a size and shape that facilitates compliance with requirements concerning safety location of mining activities and mining technology and the area in question is not cemetery or an area of the finnish defence forces or any of the special traffic areas referred to above finally exploration activities in a natura 2000 area are subject to particular scrutiny tukes may not grant a permit for an exploration project if the exploration to be carried out indicates that the project would have a significant adverse impact on the particular ecological value for which the site has been included in or is intended for inclusion in the natura 2000 network duties royalties and taxes duties royalties and taxes payable by private parties what duties royalties and taxes are payable by private parties carrying on mining activities are these revenue based or profit based private parties carrying out mining activities in finland are subject to income taxes value added tax and exploration and excavation fees payable to the landowners also private parties have to pay possible transfer tax and real estate tax in the event that such party acquires real estate in finland income taxes income tax is payable on the party s taxable income calculated in accordance with the relevant tax regulations currently the corporate income tax rate is 20 per cent value added tax vat vat is payable on sold goods and services unless such goods and services fall under a specific exception the general vat rate for goods and services is currently 24 per cent but there are some exceptions relating to certain products and services vat is payable by the seller however the seller may deduct the input vat of purchases of goods and services for business purposes if another vat taxpayer has supplied them should the amount of vat paid by the vat taxpayer for the goods and services purchased for the business operation exceed the amount of vat payable for the sales of goods and services the vat taxpayer will be refunded the excess provided that the purchased goods and services relate to business activities from the sales of which vat is payable exploration fees the holder of an exploration permit shall pay annual compensation exploration fee to the owners of land included in the exploration area the annual amount of the exploration fee per property is 20 per hectare for each of the first four years of validity of the exploration permit 30 per hectare per year for the fifth sixth and seventh year of validity of the exploration permit 40 per hectare per year for the eighth ninth and 10th year of validity of the exploration permit and 50 per hectare per year for further years of validity of the exploration permit the exploration fee for the first year has to be paid within 30 days of the date the exploration permit gains legal force the fee for the following years is paid at the anniversary of the first payment in addition to the exploration fees the exploration permit holder has to compensate the landowners and owners of the water areas for all damages caused by the exploration work carried out by the exploration permit holder within the exploration permit area the exploration permit holder has to deposit a collateral for the purpose of offsetting potential damage and inconvenience and performing after care measures unless this is deemed unnecessary in view of the quality and extent of the operations the special characteristics of the operating area the permit regulations issued for the operations and the applicant s solvency the collateral is issued separately for each exploration permit based on tukes decisions the amount of the collateral tends to be set as follows 10 000 if the total of all exploration areas is less than 1 000 hectares 20 000 if the total area is between 1 001 and 10 000 hectares and 30 000 if the total area is between 10 001 and 50 000 hectares and so on should test mining or other similar exploration activities using heavier machinery already be planned in the exploration phase the collateral is likely to be higher than what has been mentioned above under the previous mining act if the owner of land requested the claim holder had to provide to the landowner in question a collateral before the commencement of the exploration work many landowners however did not require a collateral so in real terms the new mining act has meant increased obligations to exploration companies concession and mining fees if the mining permit holder does not own the surface rights to the mining area as sometimes is the case the mining permit holder has to pay an annual compensation excavation fee to the landowners the amount of the excavation fee per property is 50 per hectare per year in addition to that the excavation fee has a variable part of 0 15 per cent of the calculated value of mining minerals included in the metal ores that are excavated and exploited in the course of the year the calculation is based on the average price of the exploited metals included in the ore during the year and the average value of other products exploited from the ore during the year if the permit authority postpones the expiry of the mining permit before mining activities have started or if they have been suspended the excavation fee is doubled to 100 per hectare until mining activities commence or resume the obligation to pay an excavation fee starts when the mining permit becomes legally valid the obligation to pay elevated compensation starts when the decision on the new date for commencing mining activity or continuing activities becomes legally valid for the purpose of the verification of the excavation fee the mining permit holder has to submit the relevant information to the mining authority no later than on 15 march in the year following the year for which the fee is to be paid the mining authority confirms the amount of the excavation fee annually the excavation fee must be paid no later than 30 days from the date tukes decision on the fee enters into force the government decree on mining contains more specific provisions on the grounds for determining the excavation fee as well as on the information to be submitted to tukes for the purpose of confirming the fee tax advantages and incentives what tax advantages and incentives are available to private parties carrying on mining activities there are certain government subsidies available for development areas in finland tax stablisation does any legislation provide for tax stabilisation or are there tax stabilisation agreements in force finland is a country of low political risk so no stabilisation agreements are available the permitted range of vat is subject to eu laws carried interest is the government entitled to a carried interest or a free carried interest in mining projects no transfer taxes and capital gains are there any transfer taxes or capital gains imposed regarding the transfer of licences when only permits licences are transferred the transaction can be subject to vat which the purchaser of the permits can in many cases deduct see question 19 further the profit made in connection with the selling of the licences is subject to capital gains tax which for companies other than corporations is currently 30 per cent for a capital gain not exceeding 30 000 and 34 per cent thereafter capital gains for corporations are usually taxed in connection with their normal corporate taxation the corporate tax rate is currently 20 per cent when for instance a junior company is acquired by a mining company through a share transaction the transaction is usually subject to a 1 6 per cent transfer tax and can result in capital gains taxation on the profit that the sellers of the shares make however if the junior company whose shares are being sold is owned by a foreign parent company and neither the junior s parent company nor the purchaser have permanent establishment in finland the share transaction is exempt from transfer tax distinction between domestic parties and foreign parties is there any distinction between the duties royalties and taxes payable by domestic parties and those payable by foreign parties there is no such distinction however see question 13 business structures principal business structures what are the principal business structures used by private parties carrying on mining activities the most common business structure used to carry on mining activities in finland is a limited liability company foreign companies may also operate through branch offices joint ventures usually in the form of a limited liability company are also used for cooperation between companies in exploration activities local entity requirement is there a requirement that a local entity be a party to the transaction the party holding the mining rights under the mining act needs to be either a natural or a legal person corporation with permanent residence within the eea or a branch of an association or foundation established in a member country of the eea for any other person or foreign corporation or foundation see question 13 bilateral investment and tax treaties are there jurisdictions with favourable bilateral investment treaties or tax treaties with your jurisdiction through which foreign entities will commonly structure their operations in your jurisdiction finland has entered into a number of tax treaties which may affect the structuring of foreign entities operations in finland there does not however seem to be one preferred way to structure the operations and companies have used a variety of structures financing principal sources of financing what are the principal sources of financing available to private parties carrying on mining activities what role does the domestic public securities market play in financing the mining industry most of the parties operating in the mining business in finland are finnish subsidiaries of foreign companies the activities of which are funded through their parent companies by the capital markets in australia canada sweden or the uk or subsidiaries of international mining companies for which the funding comes from the income from the mining company s own production it has been very difficult to collect private funding for mining operations from the capital markets in finland as the mining financing sector is not as developed as in many other countries lately however finnish investors and banks have been more interested in the possibilities of investing in or financing mining operations the government owned investment company finnish industry investment has invested in exploration and mining companies whose projects are in finland and finnish banks have recently shown an interest in mining activity with some investing in it also some finnish pension funds have invested in mining companies certain public funding such as investment grants or development grants for small and medium sized companies may be granted by the ely centres for exploration and mining operations business finland and the state owned financing company finnvera may also provide funding or guarantees or both for exploration and mining companies operating in finland such funding is subject to applicable preconditions and in addition the authority can based on the law use its discretion when deciding on the grants loans or other public funding certain grants for employment may also be available through the employment administration direct financing from government or major pension funds does the government its agencies or major pension funds provide direct financing to mining projects yes see question 28 security regime describe the regime for taking security over mining interests the holder of an exploration permit may pledge its preferential right to a mining permit and the holder of a mining licence may pledge the right to exploit the minerals the pledge becomes effective when tukes has received a written notification of said pledge naturally a mining company may also pledge other assets restrictions importation restrictions what restrictions are imposed on the importation of machinery and equipment or services required in connection with exploration and extraction generally there are no special restrictions for the importation of mining machinery and equipment there are certain specific laws that may affect the importation of machinery and equipment or services required in connection with mining activities such as the importation of explosives for which a separate permit is needed standard conditions and agreements which standard conditions and agreements covering equipment supplies are used in your jurisdiction orgalime is widely recognised and used in finland additionally engineering companies use the nordic standard terms of agreement nl01 for business between nordic countries while the orgalime s2000 and s2012 terms are used for wider international business additionally the finnish general terms it2015 elt special terms and conditions for deliveries of equipment used together with the it2015 yse general terms and conditions are used widely for it related agreements in business between finnish companies and sometimes also in inter national business arbitration clauses are very common in equipment supply agreements arbitration under the arbitration rules of the finland chamber of commerce is the most common form of dispute resolution when the parties are from different countries and the finnish party can choose the dispute resolution forum should equipment or mining minerals need to be transported the road transport contract act the railway transport act and sea act are applicable the road transport contract act is based on the international crm convention 1956 the sea act takes into account the hague 1924 hague visby 1968 and hamburg 1978 conventions the said domestic legislation is to some extent carrier friendly mineral restrictions what restrictions are imposed on the processing export or sale of minerals are there any export quotas licensing or other mechanisms that prevent producers from freely exporting their production commodity minerals are generally not subject to export restrictions there are certain specific regulations such as regulations regarding precious metals which have to be followed in order to bring such metals to the market export of uranium and thorium is more specifically regulated and subject to a number of permits import of funds restrictions what restrictions are imposed on the import of funds for exploration and extraction or the use of the proceeds from the export or sale of minerals there are no specific restrictions or limitations in the mining laws of finland concerning the import of funds for mining activities or the use of the proceeds environment principal applicable environmental laws what are the principal environmental laws applicable to the mining industry what are the principal regulatory bodies that administer those laws environmental laws the ministry of environment together with subordinated regional ely centres administer the laws relating to the environment the revised environmental protection legislation came into force on 1 september 2014 and some of its provisions during 2015 the revised environmental protection act will eventually be implemented in three phases the new law will implement among other things the eu directive on industrial emissions on a national level in addition to streamlining the environmental permit granting process and its supervision the water act controls the use of water resources and structures built along waterways the waste act prevents the generation of waste and reduces its hazardous or harmful features promotes waste recovery and other organisation of waste management prevention of littering and cleaning of sites that have become littered the chemicals act prevents health and environmental harm and danger of fire and explosions caused by chemicals health and safety laws the ministry of labour the ministry of social affairs and health and the units for safety at work administer the health and safety laws the safety at work act sets out many standards according to which an employer shall monitor and take care of the health of every employee an employer shall also assess the health risks of an employee that are caused by conditions at any particular workplace and remove or minimise those risks there are many statutes concerning safe conditions in the workplace and how to handle explosives and various hazardous tools such as laser equipment according to standards as set out by such statutes environmental review and permitting process what is the environmental review and permitting process for a mining project how long does it normally take to obtain the necessary permits the nature and scope of the environmental permitting and review process is dependent on the nature of the project and the environmental effects thereof a mining project requires an environmental permit before applying for an environmental permit the applicant may need to carry out an assessment of environmental impacts that is handled by the competent ely centre a process that usually takes about one to two years the environmental permit is granted by the competent avi based on a written application that includes a large number of statements descriptions and other related material on the project the permits required by the water act are often applied for and handled simultaneously with the environmental permit in addition to the actual review of the permit application during the application process many parties such as the local municipality the owners of real estates and the reindeer owners if the project is within a reindeer management area are heard according to the environmental authorities obtaining an environmental permit for a new project should take about 10 months the actual length of the granting process depends on the size of the project tempering and releases objections to the project and further clarification possibly required by the authorities during the exploration phase it may be necessary for the holder of the exploration permit to make a notification of the exploration work to the environment authorities in case the exploration work planned to be carried out may have a negative impact on the environment such notification is handled by the relevant regional environmental permit authority or the local supervising authority depending on the nature of the actions to be carried out that may set certain limitations and obligations that need to be followed by the exploration permit holder in connection with the exploration work to be carried out otherwise the exploration work may be prohibited closure and remediation process what is the closure and remediation process for a mining project what performance bonds guarantees and other financial assurances are required when the holder of a mining permit relinquishes or loses the mining right the area covered by the mining permit will be returned to the holder of the surface rights without compensation assuming that the mining company has not purchased the surface rights the holder of the mining permit may however keep the products of the mine the buildings built on the surface and equipment in the area for two years unless removed within that time period they become without compensation the property of the holder of the surface rights in connection with the granting of the mining permit the permit holder will have to deposit a collateral to the mining authority for the purpose of termination and aftercare measures of mining operations that is sufficient in view of the nature and extent of mining activity the permit regulations issued for the activity and collateral demanded by virtue of other legislation after relinquishing or losing the mining permit the holder has to without delay secure the area in such a way that it fulfils the requirements for safety in general the mine closure and remediation questions are handled before the commencement of any mining actions as a part of the environmental permit process the environmental permit includes terms regarding the closure of a mine such as restoration of the environment and prevention of tampering such terms generally will provide for obligations for removal of buildings equipment and infrastructure handling of the waste materials and restoration of the landscape including the revegetation the environmental permit includes the terms for closure and restoration based on which the costs for such operations can be estimated to a general level the final closure and restoration activities are confirmed in a closure plan which has to be delivered for approval to the environmental permit authority prior to closure of the mine in connection with the granting of the environmental permit the mining company is required to provide a security for the fulfilment of the closure and restoration obligations the amount is set by the authorities and the security is generally required in the form of a bank guarantee or bank deposit restrictions on building tailings or waste dams what are the restrictions for building tailings or waste dams the tailing and waste dam safety requirement are defined in the dam safety act 494 2009 and the government decree on dam safety 319 2010 the act and the decree require that a person planning the construction of the dam as well as the person in charge of the use of dam surveillance and inspections has the requisite experience taking into account the quality of the dam and danger of disaster before a dam is taken into use it needs to receive a risk classification and the construction plans of dams and ponds a risk assessment report and surveillance programme all need to be approved by the environmental permit authority for dams that may cause substantial danger to life or health of individuals class 1 a more detailed risk assessment report is required these are preconditions for obtaining an environmental permit the receipt of which is required to carry out mining activities see question 36 a dam owner has a general obligation to design and construct a dam in such a way that its use does not constitute any safety hazard this obligation includes repair and alteration works to the dam the designer of the dam needs be professionally qualified and the persons in charge of the operation and management of the dam need to have the necessary knowledge no specific mine safety permit is required for the dam however compliance with the mine safety legislation is required as it is a prerequisite for getting the environmental and other permits for

practices by the target company or its group companies it is also important to note that finnish anti corruption and anti bribery legislation may be applied extraterritorially and hence the practices of the target company s potential foreign group companies or agents should also be reviewed eu directive 2013 34 eu on annual financial statements consolidated financial statements and related reports

new york new york a boost in the price of energy stocks failed to ignite a flat market on wall street on easter monday with many investors still on vacation enjoying an extended easter break many markets globally were closed including australia and ireland which marked its annual bank holiday on monday hikes in oil prices drove a 2 1 increase in the s p energy index following the u s decision to end waivers to countries buying oil from iran these customers account for a large sector of the world s population including the powerhouse economies of india and china as well as japan egypt and south korea otherwise there was little enthusiasm for stocks despite many companies reporting better than expected earnings it s important at this point to sit back and reflect on what the prospects are that will take us forward it s appropriate to see what we re seeing today ryan larson head of u s equity trading at rbc global asset management in chicago told reuters thomson at the end of the day monday the dow jones industrial average was off 48 49 points or 0 18 at 26 511 05 the standard and poor s 500 rose 2 94 points or 0 10 to 2 907 97 the nasdaq composite did best of all rising 17 21 points or 0 22 to 8 015 27 the u s dollar went nowhere monday although it softened a touch against the euro which rose to 1 1260 the british pound was unchanged at 1 2981 as was the swiss franc at 1 0153 and the japanese yen at 111 93 the commodity currencies were little changed holding to their weak close last week the australian dollar was last quoted at 0 7138 the canadian dollar at 1 3345 and the new zealand dollar at 0 6682
this month volatility in the currency market fell to its lowest level in five years in times like this many analysts argue that big moves are on the horizon but it could be upwards of a year before that happens the last time fx volatility was this low was in june 2014 and at that time there were about 10 months of consolidation before a major breakout in 2007 the low volatility environment persisted for about a year and prior to that the most pronounced period of low volatility was in 1996 and the consolidation also lasted about a year we re currently three months into this market environment which means it could be another six to nine months before volatility explodes this makes sense because most if not all major central banks have no plans to change monetary policy again in 2019 and the lack of potential policy surprises minimizes the impact of incoming data and the general moves in currencies also the steady gains in stocks keep investors complacent volatility will return when stocks crash because a sharp sell off would be a tipping point that triggers widespread profit taking and broad based risk aversion we got a taste of that in december and january the only question is what could cause this turn in sentiment we know that central bankers are worried about global growth but the moves in equities fail to recognize these concerns stocks could peak if us china trade talks turn south or the eu us trade war heats up if earnings are weak or data stabilizes enough for central banks to reconsider tightening rate hike talk could also drive stocks lower sometimes stocks correct for no reason at all they sell off sharply one day and the fear of further losses drives them even lower regardless it may be some time before the selling begins so for now it is best to focus on strategies that thrive in low volatility markets this means fading tops and bottoms being nimble with profit targets and taking your cue from stocks and yields also don t expect

that 112 is an important level for the pair hovered a few pips underneath this level all of last week in the narrowest trading range that we ve seen in years usd jpy should be trading much higher given that the ended the week at its strongest level since october us data was also better than expected with rising by its strongest level since september 2017 and falling to a 50 year low with wages on the rise and stocks performing well us consumers returned with a vengeance after the government shutdown the low level of jobless claims reflects a tight labor market that should support consumer spending going forward however usd jpy barely budged because investors do not believe that one month of strong data will sway the central bank s outlook most policymakers have recognized the robustness of the labor market and the potential recovery in spending their main concerns are growth abroad and trade two issues that continue to pose serious risks to the us and global economy usd jpy is not always the best barometer for the market s appetite for us dollars the actually traded higher against all of the other major currencies last week and with stocks rising the move was not driven by risk aversion the worst performing currency was the which fell hard after weaker the most resilient was the which benefited from strong and numbers looking ahead while usd jpy is prime for a

weakness in new zealand exacerbated the slide for the all three of the commodity currencies lost value against the greenback with nzd falling to its lowest level in three months as softer growth hardened the case for a by the rbnz there was also a big divergence with the performance of aud which hit a one month high last week australian data was significantly better than expected with the economy adding rather than shedding full time jobs unfortunately even with this improvement the reserve bank feels that forward indicators of labor demand were mixed and a discussion of the scenarios where a rate cut may be appropriate was necessary the mere talk of rate cuts diminishes the impact of positive data aud and nzd also shrugged off strong data out of china last week their massive stimulus package is finally working with consumer spending and manufacturing activity rebounding strongly in march but it is far too early to declare a bottom especially when us china trade talks are not complete on a fundamental and technical basis aud and nzd are vulnerable to further weakness particularly since this week s and new zealand could miss expectations but us and china trade talks have reached a turning point and there s a good chance that a signing summit could be scheduled for may if that s true it would be wildly positive for aud and nzd the biggest event risk of the week

off in sterling last week was surprising considering the good employment and retail sales reports employment rose to a new record high as wage growth held steady at 3 5 the ilo remained at its lowest level in nearly 45 years providing the perfect backdrop for spending the latest report shows that uk consumers were unfazed by brexit uncertainty in march consumer spending rose 1 1 against a forecast for 0 3 economists were bracing for a contraction but strong online sales drove retail sales higher for the third month in a row these reports should have been positive for sterling but the currency drifted quietly lower softer inflation numbers could be a factor but the primary reason for the currency s weakness is that at the end of the day investors don t expect these latest reports to affect the bank of england s outlook it has no plans to raise until britain decides on the terms of leaving the european union the extension of article 50 prolongs this uncertainty and delays the timing for tightening there are no major uk economic reports scheduled for release this week so it should be a quiet week for gbp with that in mind gbp usd has strong support near 1 2650 data review german zew

on a fundamental basis there is very little reason to be bullish about euros the economy is weakening earlier this month german bundesbank president jens weidmann warned that growth in the eurozone s largest economy could slow materially in 2019 the us is threatening the eu with hefty tariffs and the 10 year yield spread is falling deeper into negative territory even though the zew surveyed showed concerns about the region s outlook fading softer german leaves them worried about current conditions the ez flash pmi readings the absolute latest measure of conditions on the ground also came in at 47 8 versus 48 1 dropping further into contractionary territory according to markit backlogs of work dropped for the fourth time in the past five months and have not shown any growth since last november the reduction in backlogs was only fractionally smaller than in march which had seen the steepest decline since december 2014 the only saving grace from the report was rebound in german which helped offset some of the weakness in manufacturing still germany which is the core of the european economy remains highly vulnerable to manufacturing slowdown which itself is roiled not only by cyclical but secular factors a massive part of german economy and european manufacturing sector as well is dependent on car production which is going through wrenching changes and existential threat from electric vehicles but it s difficult to imagine that europe will see any rebound in manufacturing any time soon and the region s best hope for growth remains in services where the demand appears to be more stable and stronger the german is scheduled for release this week and we are not looking for any material improvement in business confidence technically eur usd s rejection of 1 13 followed by lower highs and lower lows is a sign of weakness and the pair s failure to close above the 50 day sma signals a potential move below 1 12

i ve excerpted some quotes from economist john williams most recent economic commentary no 983 b shadowstats com which is of interest to every american it predicts financial authorities will make a formal admission that the economy is in a state of collapse and in recession on or around september 2019 williams made this prediction in 2004 the announcement would be an admission of a financial collapse that has been ongoing since 2008 and has been hidden from public view many quarterly reports are assumptions that are later corrected when the real numbers come in september 2019 these numbers typically don t grab the news headlines as they should says williams williams notes the federal reserve a cabal of 12 private banks has centered on the needs and health of the banking system very much at the cost of domestic business activity and the economic health and prosperity of main street u s a williams reveals the primary numbers on the health of the american economy unemployment and gross domestic product are fabricated the u s government reports day to day financial data that doesn t include future obligations medicare social security it s as if the government doesn t actually have to meet those obligations but of course it does and to imagine various politicians are calling for medicare for all end the fed ron paul best price 2 18 buy new 5 68 as of 09 55 utc details williams goes on to say a banking holiday in 2008 might have left the u s economy in a better long term circumstance than it is today given that the federal reserve has now failed at achieving its dual mandate that of promoting the goals of maximum employment stable prices and moderate long term interest rates williams suggests a radical change maybe it is time for the congress to realign control of the u s currency monetary policy and targeting economic activity back to the elected officials who control the u s treasury with oversight in congress as opposed to the federal reserve which is owned by the banks it oversees go to shadowstats com to learn more bill sardi special commentary number 983 b excerpts from economic and financial market review april 22 2019 john williams shadowstats com the federal reserve is not doing so well with its dual mandate despite happy formal proclamations to the contrary since 1977 the federal reserve has operated under a mandate from congress to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment stable prices and moderate long term interest rates what is now commonly referred to as the fed s dual mandate the federal open market committee fomc policies of 2008 and 2018 2019 and the years intervening have centered on the needs and health of the banking system very much at the cost of domestic business activity and the economic health and prosperity of main street u s a from a practical standpoint the dual mandate has not been met within the intent of the u s congress and that should be reviewed in the congressional oversight of the federal reserve system fed s current statutory mandate of attaining maximum employment and price stability has been made a great deal easier to attain in recent decades from a headline standpoint thanks to the federal government redefining how it measures headline inflation and unemployment always with fed input and encouragement discussed in public commentary on inflation measurement and public commentary on unemployment measurement the redefined series have had the policy and politically friendly effects of reducing both headline inflation and headline broad unemployment as the fomc moved recently to constrain consumer liquidity weakening the 74 of the u s gross domestic product gdp directly driven by the consumer defending the rate hikes the fed argued that the broad economy was booming overheating in fact which raised the risk of rising inflation that was nonsense even so despite a booming headline gdp major sectors of the u s economy never expanded post banking crisis never saw a full business recovery from the 2007 recession and economic collapse into 2009 economic expansion generally is recognized and measured from when depressed levels of business activity recover to and then expand beyond the pre recession peak in activity now the fed is triggering a renewed and intensified economic downturn as it tries to extricate itself from its policies of ten years ago from a peak of annualized inflation adjusted real quarterly growth of 4 16 in second quarter 2018 activity slowed to 3 36 in third quarter activity then to 2 17 in the final fourth quarter reading both first and second quarter 2019 gdp likely will show outright quarterly contractions in real inflation adjusted activity reflecting the onset of what should become a formal new recession accordingly the effects of fomc s tightening of the last year or so are depressing current and future business activity as would be expected with the traditional lead time which is 9 months says williams as a result fed actions to raise interest rates to what historically and normally would be higher levels backfired as the foreseeable current negative economic impact now has forced the fomc into a neutral tightening stance the present circumstance should be recognized measured and timed as a new recession off an economic peak level of activity in fourth quarter 2018 as of its march 2019 meeting the federal reserve s federal open market committee indicated it had put planned interest rate hikes for 2019 on hold along with reducing ceasing its balance sheet liquidations that were being used to unwind the qe programs the bureau of economic analysis bea can bring in the headline gdp at any level it desires and often targets the consensus outlook beware july 26th when a formal recession likely will have gained popular recognition the annual benchmarking on july 26th will revise recent gdp history including fourth quarter 2018 and first quarter 2019 both likely to the downside with a headline first quarter contraction in hand by then yet a banking holiday with fomc guarantees on all deposits actually put in place with the 2008 crisis and with a reorganization of the banking system and federal reserve or restructured u s treasury systemic oversight might have left the u s economy in a better long term circumstance than it is today again though with systemic failure not viewed as an option whatever money had to be created spent or loaned whatever liabilities had to be guaranteed whatever bad assets had to be absorbed whatever entities inefficient crooked or otherwise had to be bailed out whatever markets had to be manipulated whatever had to be done as a stop gap measure was done to preserve the system what was not done was to address most of the underlying fundamental issues that led to the crisis including the long term sovereign solvency issues of the united states government those issues still need to be addressed along with a long overdue congressional overhaul of the politically independent u s central bank and its federal reserve system which otherwise is owned by the banks that it also regulates the central bank s primary concern remains the banking system not the economy and not main street u s a the fed still has not succeeded in fully reestablishing banking system health and normal commercial functionality having taken little but stopgap measures in 2008 which pushed much of the banking solvency crisis into the future the federal reserve and the u s treasury again face continuing systemic insolvency or instability issues as that future closes in maybe it is time for the congress to realign control of the u s currency monetary policy and targeting economic activity back to the elected officials who control the u s treasury with oversight in congress as opposed to the federal reserve which is owned by the banks it oversees no other major economic indicator or employment measure has shown anything close to the purported headline real gdp expansion of 19 1 almost all government reporting has to incorporate underlying assumptions and the tendency usually is to make overly positive assumptions allowing for later downside corrections in the benchmarking understating economic activity is a political embarrassment while overstating activity has no such political stigma attached to it with unsustainable fiscal policies the united states government faces long range insolvency or hyperinflation the u s government must move now to bring its fiscal operations into balance to restore long term stability and solvency to the system otherwise current conditions easily could evolve into a hyperinflationary great depression much sooner than commonly expected forcing significant overhauls to the domestic and global economic and financial market systems these crises no longer are too far into the future to worry about as some in the u s government and fed have argued in recent decades and the fed is complicit in this circumstance along with the congress and president based on generally accepted accounting principles gaap the headline net obligations of the federal government including the unfunded liabilities valued in today s dollars have reached an order of magnitude of well over 100 trillion including 22 0 trillion in existing u s treasury debt the largest amount of sovereign debt in the world that 100 plus trillion needed in hand to cover existing u s obligations not only is five times greater than the headline nominal u s gdp but also tops current estimates of the aggregate global gdp of about 85 trillion indeed that circumstance is unsustainable and uncontainable yet those controlling the u s government consistently refuse to address the nation s long term solvency issues although they talk about it the gaap statements include not only concepts such as accounts receivable and payable assets and depreciation but also projections of the net present value npv of unfunded liabilities tied to programs such as social security and medicare as global markets look to escape their looming losses in u s dollar holdings that day of ultimate reckoning for the u s currency likely remains near a flight from the dollar and hyperinflation fears could break over a very short period as quickly as the banking panic of 2008 for example or it could evolve over longer periods and intermittent crises i have published the shadow government statistics newsletter since 2004 early on i began discussing the long term insolvency of the united states government leading to a domestic hyperinflation likely around 2018 or 2019 the creature from jeky g edward griffin best price 10 58 buy new 19 49 as of 05 45 utc details in the current circumstance unless the u s government meaningfully overhauls its planned expenses a significant reduction in spending and or increases its revenues a significant increase in tax revenues going into the future including overhauling social security medicare and medicaid it has no chance of covering its net obligations going forward other than by just printing the dollars needed generating dollar debasement and eventual hyperinflation the potential hyperinflation here is every bit the same as seen in the german weimar republic post world war i zimbabwe in the 1990s and 2000s and venezuela with inflation hitting 80 000 in 2018 like gold u s dollars have value only to the extent that they are strictly limited in supply but the u s government has a technology called a printing press or today its electronic equivalent that allows it to produce as many u s dollars as it wishes at essentially no cost by increasing the number of u s dollars in circulation or even by credibly threatening to do so the u s government can also reduce the value of a dollar in terms of goods and services which is equivalent to raising the prices in dollars of those goods and services we conclude that under a paper money system a determined government can always generate higher spending and hence positive inflation bernanke 2002 deflation speech yet the quantitative easing created by the fed in response to the 2008 financial panic was designed primarily as a covert bailout for the still shaky banking system the fed pumped trillions of dollars of new liquidity into the banking system but not into the money supply had banks increased lending into the regular flow of commerce with the new liquidity money supply would have soared and the economy and inflation would have picked up instead the banking system was directed to place the funds back with the fed as excess reserves earning interest on the cash investors have no recourse other than common sense such as investing in assets such as gold and silver which will preserve the purchasing power of their assets against currency debasement more recently williams says following an interview on a major cable news network not cnbc i was advised off air by the producer that they were operating under a corporate mandate to give the economic news a positive spin irrespective of how bad it was

saudi arabia and the united arab emirates announced on sunday 3 billion of financial support in the form of 500 million in central bank deposits and a promised 2 5 billion in humanitarian support including oil and gas transfers in the delicate context of transition from 30 years of dictatorship under omar al bashir some of those protesting for a full transfer of authority to a civilian government did not respond with gratitude to the announcement reportedly chanting keep your money their fear is that the influence of saudi arabia and the united arab emirates will entrench support for the military at a moment that democratic politics are opening but there are few countries in the developing world or elsewhere that can turn away such a substantial offer of direct support with so few strings attached the phenomenon of gulf arab state support to a widening sphere of influence in the horn of africa middle east and pakistan is only growing in intensity and since 2011 the exercise of economic statecraft whether through direct commitments of financial support promises of foreign direct investment or in kind oil and gas transfers have been plentiful and from sources on both sides of the gcc political divide in the last 12 months saudi arabia and the united arab emirates have committed 6 billion each to pakistan 3 billion to ethiopia 10 billion to bahrain 2 5 billion to jordan 830 million to tunisia 1 billion to iraq while the focus here is on the uae and saudi arabia kuwait is a frequent donor and provider of cash deposits and qatar provided ample support to egypt between 2011 and 2013 made inroads to financially support sudan and somalia and has made commitments to buy lebanese debt just this year sometimes these promises remain just that words the leverage that commitments create can be as useful as actual delivery of support but what is certain is that there is a shift in sources of direct financial support to emerging markets as balance of payments support or cash deposits to central banks to shore up currency value favorable loans or extensions of credit through debt purchases the shift is away from international financial institutions like the imf and world bank and from aid from the united states and the european union as i argued here the new masters of development finance are china and the gulf arab states in the middle east horn of africa and south asia these two forces are often working in synergy and as i have written this trifecta of aid investment and direct financial intervention is a form of economic statecraft its rationale is the security and prosperity of the donor investor because the gulf arab states have recognized a vital nexus between development and security in their surrounding geography the logic of supporting friendly neighboring governments to secure political allies combined with investing for their own food security real estate ventures and state linked energy projects is strategic their methods are often highly personalistic and can create ripple effects and instability in domestic politics of the recipient state especially in states in the midst of political transition it can also be wasteful when one relationship fails or the recipient leader interlocutor is out of power the process begins again why is the delivery and source of development assistance shifting now the logic of development assistance after world war ii has been based on a consensus that open markets are best able to deliver growth and that leverage from international financial institutions to encourage liberalization and rule of law can nudge or force governments to make better economic choices that advice has been largely successful as the world bank reports at creating remarkable and unprecedented progress in reducing extreme poverty over the past quarter century in 2015 more than a billion fewer people were living in extreme poverty than in 1990 the progress has been driven by strong global growth and the rising wealth of many developing countries particularly in the world s most populous regions of east asia and paciﬁc and south asia the opening of china and the ignition of economies in south asia driven by a global consensus on the power of liberalization and access to finance has changed the world in fact china s access to world bank loans and more broadly the advice of institutions of a global liberal economic order have facilitated its growth that advice has served the united states well over the last 70 years american financial institutions have been providers of capital facilitated foreign direct investment and created new markets for their own products and culture and now that consensus is experiencing a profound disruption most visible in the middle east and africa the united states has failed to provide a leadership role advocating in defense of liberal economic institutions and rule of law as a basis for economic development and political order since the beginning of the arab uprisings in 2011 and in the eight years since not only is the perception of american disengagement becoming a reality on the ground in the gulf there is a real vacuum of financial resources and the ideals to stand behind them in transitions across the arab world multilateral lenders and aid providers are simply outclassed and out bargained whereas international financial institutions have used their leverage in providing access to finance to encourage prudent fiscal policy transparency and rule of law to support a liberal economic order gulf arab aid investment and financial support has only one string attached access and not even loyalty development aid and finance as we have known it since the bretton woods system formed is now in danger in a panel discussion i participated in last week at the brookings institution alex rondos the eu special representative to the horn of africa gave an interesting analogy we provide nutrition they give cocaine to describe how gulf states offer a quick and easy fix to financial vulnerability this is compared to official development assistance by traditional donors like the eu and united states the problem is that the bretton woods institutions the united states and the european union are in no position to compete with the amount of financial support or the speed of its delivery that the gulf arab states can offer the best scenario is partnership and engagement and a strong advocacy for institutional support rather than head of state relationships what has enabled the gulf arab states to project this financial power and influence four key changes in the regional political economy have allowed this policy shift the enormous growth of resources in a magic decade of high oil prices from 2003 to 2014 and accumulated savings and sovereign wealth which can now be deployed a new generation of leadership in the uae under mohammed bin zayed that is security and expansion minded with a vision for uae leadership in the region and which has been accompanied by a stronger security state and consolidation of federal power at the center of the government saudi arabia s generational shift came in 2015 with king salman s rocket empowerment of mohamed bin salman and even in qatar with the 2013 shift from emir hamad to emir tamim consolidated the qatari penchant for regional foreign policy aid and interventionism post 2011 politics which have justified this interventionist and expansionist vision as a counter to the arab spring s direct threat to regime stability paired with a sense of shifting geopolitical alliances in which america is less present less reliable and less understanding of the demands of gulf leaders the war in yemen which began in late 2014 with the uae and saudi arabia engaging in march 2015 changed the calculus of independent defensive and offensive behavior the war has only exacerbated a saudi and emirati perception of us disengagement from the region heightened the threat from iran and justified shifts in both domestic and foreign security posture what do gulf arab states expect in return there is absolutely an expectation of return on investment from state projects in energy infrastructure including massive investment in ports development and real estate but there are also less expectations of policy shifts in recipient states because patterns of delivery tend to be rapid negotiated on behalf of heads of state and without institutional follow up there is a vulnerability in the sustainability of financial support there is also a willingness on the part of gulf arab states to take a loss take for example in april 2018 when the uae abruptly canceled a training agreement with the somali military and closed a humanitarian operation in the country removing staff and shutting a hospital with little notice the decision was based on a dispute over aid delivery at the mogadishu airport and the treatment of emirati military personnel the sensitivity to slights and the general lack of bureaucratic integration between donor and recipient is a vulnerability for this new style of development and humanitarian assistance why does it matter developing countries from africa to the middle east to asia now have some interesting choices in development finance partners where the money comes from matters first sources of development finance create institutional consequences in the recipient state second the deal making of development finance creates political alliances that transcend the development transaction and in many cases can reinforce patronage networks and personalistic politics third the efficacy of project delivery and its long term viability whether infrastructure investment in utilities or social infrastructure in health and education depends on governance competition and the mutual benefits of rule based markets sudan s windfall today will be tomorrow s institutional challenge to build open and rule based markets that create jobs and provide food for its citizens
use the lexology getting the deal through tool to compare the answers in this article with those from other jurisdictions mining industry standing what is the nature and importance of the mining industry in your country the quality and quantity of ecuadorian mineral resources is very similar to that of its neighbours such as chile and peru who have managed to develop their mining potential however most of ecuadorian territory is still unexplored in fact according to the financial times ecuador has some of the most attractive gold silver and copper deposits in latin america nevertheless production has been almost non existent there are many reasons for the delay in developing this industry but if we have to choose the main reason we would point to erred public policy regarding the mining industry and the absence of legal security owing to legislation largely inspired by the oil industry in terms of the mining industry s importance in ecuador considering current oil prices and given the fact that traditionally ecuador is an oil dependent country we do not see any industry other than mining capable of attracting investments to develop the country target minerals what are the target minerals currently the target minerals in ecuador are gold silver and copper however there is a huge potential in other minerals such as lithium rare earth potash iron uranium and coal ecuador has a much wider geological potential but to an extent the minerals targeted depend on global trends and the interest of individual companies there is no material development on renewables so far but experts predict that the current industry is moving towards more efficient ways of generating energy in the next five to 10 years regions which regions are most active the most important gold and copper deposits discovered to date are located in the south east of ecuador principally in zamora chinchipe morona santiago azuay and el oro provinces however it is also important to consider imbabura province in the north of ecuador since there is also considerable mining potential in this area legal and regulatory structure basis of legal system is the legal system civil or common law based the ecuadorian legal system is civil law based regulation how is the mining industry regulated according to the constitution the state owns all minerals and non renewable natural resources within the national territory these minerals and resources are considered as strategic sectors which are managed regulated controlled and governed by the state the state can on an exceptional basis delegate the development of extractive sectors to individuals or entities by granting mining concessions for a term of 25 years thus the concessionaire will have the exclusive right to explore exploit process and sell any metallic minerals within the concession when a project is considered in the range of large scale mining prior to the commencement of the exploitation phase the concessionaire must first sign an exploitation contract with the ecuadorian state this contract is not needed when a project is in the range of artisanal small or medium scale mining the mining act defines artisanal mining as that which is carried out for the subsistence of family units through the use of manual equipment or portable devices the daily production ranges for artisanal mining are for metallic minerals up to 10 tonnes in underground mining and up to 120 cubic metres in alluvial mining for non metallic minerals up to 50 tonnes and for construction materials up to 100 cubic metres in alluvial deposits and 50 tonnes for hard rock open pit mining the daily production ranges for small scale mining are for metallic minerals up to 300 tonnes in underground mining up to 1 000 tonnes in open pit mining and up to 1 500 cubic metres in alluvial mining for non metallic minerals up to 1 000 tonnes and for construction materials up to 800 cubic metres for alluvial terrace mining and up to 500 tonnes for open pit mining the daily production ranges for medium scale mining are as follows for metallic minerals 301 1 000 tonnes in underground mining 1 001 2 000 tonnes in open pit mining and 1 501 3 000 cubic metres in alluvial mining for non metallic minerals 1 001 3 000 tonnes and for construction materials 801 2 000 cubic metres for alluvial terrace mining and 501 1 000 tonnes for hard rock open pit mining quarries any range that exceeds those established for medium scale mining is considered as large scale mining what are the principal laws that regulate the mining industry what are the principal regulatory bodies that administer those laws were there any major amendments in the past year there are several legal provisions regarding the mining industry within the constitution added to that there is the mining act that was enacted on 29 january 2009 further modified by the amendment passed on 16 july 2013 as well as the general mining regulations and the small scale and artisanal mining regulations that were promulgated on 4 november 2009 there is also the mining environmental regulations for mining activities promulgated on 27 march 2014 the principal regulatory body that regulates and controls the industry is the mining ministry created in february 2015 which replaced the former ministry of non renewable natural resources mnrnr the other relevant bodies are the ministry of the environment the mining regulation and control agency arcom and the national geological mining investigation institute inigemm in addition with the mining act the national mining company enami ep was created which is responsible for developing state mining projects by itself or in association with private or public companies or both in this regard there is no doubt that the government of ecuador has redoubled its efforts to recover lost time and draft a more appropriate legal framework in order to attract local and foreign investment in the mining sector undoubtedly these changes were accelerated with the creation of the mining ministry in february 2015 which further indicates the importance this industry has for the government the work done by the new mining ministry has certainly been significant and positive the closing of the mining cadastre in december 2017 the mining cadastre was temporarily closed owing to state internal planning activities the government expects to reopen the cadastre in june 2018 on 1 march 2016 the mining ministry issued ministerial agreement no 2016 002 which contains the guidelines for granting metallic mining concessions this was good news for the mining industry because the mining cadastre was then reopened after eight years of being closed following the devastating effects of the mining mandate enacted in april 2008 the process being carried out by the mining ministry received overwhelming acceptance on the market it can be summarised as follows 275 mining concessions granted to date us 4 600 million investment commitments until 2021 25 000 new jobs until 2021 more confidence in the ecuadorian market and the country recognised as a mining hotspot classification system what classification system does the mining industry use for reporting mineral resources and mineral reserves on 17 march 2016 the mining regulation and control agency arcom enacted the mineral resources and reserves regulations which are based on the australian joint ore reserves committee the canadian national instrument ni 43 101 the uk reporting code and the south african code for reporting of mineral resources and mineral reserves mining rights and title state control over mining rights to what extent does the state control mining rights in your jurisdiction can those rights be granted to private parties and to what extent will they have title to minerals in the ground are there large areas where the mining rights are held privately or which belong to the owner of the surface rights is there a separate legal regime or process for third parties to obtain mining rights in those areas the state owns the non renewable natural resources within the national territory the state can on an exceptional basis delegate the development of extractive sectors to individuals or entities by granting mining concessions for a term of 25 years where the concessionaire will have the exclusive right to explore exploit process and sell any metallic minerals within the concession see question 5 once the mining concession has been granted in large and medium scale mining the concessionaire is subject to the following phases and terms up to four years of initial exploration up to four years of advanced exploration and up to two years of economic evaluation of the deposit which can be extended for an additional two year period during the final phase the concessionaire must apply for the commencement of the exploitation phase of the project within six months of beginning the exploitation phase the concessionaire in the large scale mining category must sign a mining exploitation contract with the ecuadorian government although negotiations may begin during the economic evaluation phase as indicated artisanal small and medium scale mining operations do not need to sign a mining exploitation contract with the ecuadorian government it should be noted that ownership of mining concessions is distinct from ownership of the surface land according to the mining act in order to obtain a new mining concession applicants must participate in a public tender process in accordance to the guidelines for granting metallic mining concessions if a concessionaire wishes to transfer an existing concession to a third party authorisation from the mining authorities must first be obtained however it is important to consider that a new mining concession cannot be transfer at least for two years from granting date enami and state owned companies of the international community have the right to access new mining concessions in any free area of the country without participating in a public tender process as noted in question 6 the mining cadastre is temporarily closed owing to state internal planning activities and it was announced by the government it expects to reopen it in june 2018 therefore at the time of writing it is not possible to apply reserve or grant new concessions for mining companies some amendments to the current regulations in the concessions granting process have been announced by the authorities publicly available information and data what information and data are publicly available to private parties that wish to engage in exploration and other mining activities is there an agency which collects mineral assessment reports from private parties must private parties file mineral assessment reports does the agency or the government conduct geoscience surveys which become part of the database is the database available online arcom keeps a register of all the concessions that exist in the country mining cadastre to this end a reference map of the location of mining concessions can be accessed online at according to the mining act all mining concessionaires should submit annually exploration reports and investment plans in order to have their concessions in good standing arcom and the national geological mining investigation institute are the government agencies responsible for carrying out geoscience surveys and technical analyses of national geological information and collecting information for the national database this information is public but unfortunately not all is available online acquisition of rights by private parties what mining rights may private parties acquire how are these acquired what obligations does the rights holder have if exploration or reconnaissance licences are granted does such tenure give the holder an automatic or preferential right to acquire a mining licence what are the requirements to convert to a mining licence individuals or corporations may acquire mining concessions which are granted by the mining ministry following a public tender process the mining act recognises four mining categories artisanal small scale medium scale and large scale production ranges for each category were noted in question 5 existing mining concessions can be transferred provided that prior authorisation from the mining authorities has been obtained the main obligations of mining rights holders are to pay annual mining conservation patent fees to present annual exploration reports and investment plans to present biannual production reports to pay mining royalties to the state when in the exploitation phase to obtain an environmental licence prior to commencing activities to obtain administrative authorisations prior to commencing activities to ensure at least 80 per cent of its workforce are ecuadorian to comply with the environmental management plan to comply with the regulatory and the mining title duties and obligations to train their personnel and to maintain information regarding their operations etc renewal and transfer of mineral licences what is the regime for the renewal and transfer of mineral licences according to article 36 of the mining act a mining concession is granted for up to 25 years and may be renewed for an equal period upon a written application by the mining concessionaire to the mining ministry it is possible to transfer the mining rights prior authorisation from the mining ministry this authorisation is based on a technical report prepared by arcom and an environmental report prepared by the ministry of the environment as noted above a new mining concession cannot be transferred for at least for two years from the granting date see question 8 duration of mining rights what is the typical duration of mining rights a mining concession is granted for up to 25 years subject to renewal for an equal period upon a written application by the mining concessionaire to the mining ministry see question 11 there is no specific condition that needs to be meet in order to renew the mining concession it is important to bear in mind that the mining ministry may exercise its legal authority and consequently declare the mining rights terminated in cases where the concessionaires have rendered themselves liable to such termination for the reasons laid down in articles 69 79 81 93 and 125 of the mining act throughout any termination procedure the right to due process shall be guaranteed this includes the basic guarantees enshrined in article 76 of the constitution the process of declaring termination may be officially instigated by the mining ministry or be initiated in response to a complaint by a third party that has been duly investigated by the mining ministry or be initiated at the request of other ministries with a connection to mining activity the administrative procedure shall be subject to the terms of the mining act and its general regulations acquisition by domestic parties versus acquisition by foreign parties is there any distinction in law or practice between the mining rights that may be acquired by domestic parties and those that may be acquired by foreign parties domestic and foreign parties are equally entitled to acquire mining rights in ecuador protection of mining rights how are mining rights protected are foreign arbitration awards in respect of domestic mining disputes freely enforceable in your jurisdiction according to ecuadorian legislation mining is considered to be of public interest which means it is in a special category and is granted more protection than other private interests including land ownership if a concessionaire suffers any form of disruption as a result of a third party s actions concessionaires can file an administrative relief action in arcom which can take either direct or indirect preventive measures the mining act specifically states that in the event of a dispute arising out of an exploitation contract made between the ecuadorian state and a mining concessionaire such a dispute can either be resolved by the local courts or may be submitted to international arbitration however the dispute can only be submitted to international arbitration if arbitration provisions are included in the contract the seat of arbitration must be a latin american country as required by the constitution foreign international awards are fully enforceable in ecuador surface rights what types of surface rights may mining rights holders request and acquire how are these rights acquired can surface rights holders oppose these requests private parties may acquire any form of surface rights from ownership of the surface area to leases usufructs easements etc if a mining concessionaire wishes to acquire an easement over a surface area in order to develop its mining operations it can either enter into an agreement with the surface owner or request that arcom impose an easement it should be noted however that foreigners individuals or corporations cannot acquire any surface rights within border zones considered to be an area within 20 kilometres of the national border see question 48 surface rights holders cannot oppose these requests since as said above mining rights are considered of public interest participation of government and state agencies does the government or do state agencies have the right to participate in mining projects is there a local listing requirement for the project company according to article 315 of the constitution the state may participate in the development and management of natural resources through public companies such as enami ep or through mixed public private companies in which the state should be the majority shareholder enami ep may also participate in partnership or in association with other entities public or private see question 22 government expropriation of licences are there provisions in law dealing with government expropriation of licences what are the compensation provisions the constitution guarantees the right to private property and prohibits any kind of confiscation on an exceptional basis the constitution declares that the expropriation of property including mining concessions for reasons of public benefit or social interest may be declared at a fair value restitution and payment however there are no specific rules for valuation and compensation to determine how much a private individual could receive due to the expropriation of a mining concession protected areas are any areas designated as protected areas within your jurisdiction and which are off limits or specially regulated in ecuador there are various areas that are considered protected mainly for environmental conservation the referendum held in february 2018 amends the constitution and establishes that the extraction of non renewable resources including logging in protected areas and urban areas is prohibited under any circumstance notwithstanding the above it is important to clarify that within protected forests mining activities can be carried out once an environmental authorisation has been obtained the specific environmental authorisation will depend on the mining phase of the concession duties royalties and taxes duties royalties and taxes payable by private parties what duties royalties and taxes are payable by private parties carrying on mining activities are these revenue based or profit based the constitution provides that the state is entitled to receive a share of the benefits resulting from the exploitation of non renewable natural resources which is not to be less than that received by the concessionaire carrying out the exploitation the mining act more specifically establishes that the state s share consists of various duties taxes and royalties including annual patent fees income tax vat 15 per cent of the concessionaire s profits this is distributed to the concessionaire s employees windfall profit tax in the case of large scale mining and royalties depending of the category of the mining title added to the items mentioned above the guideline for granting mineral mining concessions establishes that in order to file a request for a new mining concession it is necessary to pay a fee equivalent to five times the current minimum wage per application this amount is not subject to reimbursement if the interested party is not awarded the mining concession after going through the tender process established in the mining act and the guideline if a party is awarded a mining concession it needs to pay a fee equivalent to twice the current minimum wage in order to register the minute award and the amount of one current minimum wage to register the mining title with arcom duties more specifically mining concessionaires have a number of financial obligations under the mining act including the requirement to pay annual conservation patent fees except in the artisanal mining category the conservation patent fees payable for concessions are calculated as follows for small scale mining a sum equivalent to 2 per cent of the current minimum wage multiplied by the number of hectares in the concession for medium scale mining a sum equivalent to 2 5 per cent of the current minimum wage multiplied by the number of hectares in the concession and regardless of the mining phase and for large scale mining initial exploration phase a sum equivalent to 2 5 per cent of the current minimum wage multiplied by the number of hectares in the concession advanced exploration phase a sum equivalent to 5 per cent of the current minimum wage multiplied by the number of hectares in the concession and exploitation phase a sum equivalent to 10 per cent of the current minimum wage multiplied by the number of hectares the minimum wage for 2018 is us 386 00 in addition mining concessionaires are required to pay additional fees for the use of water these fees are set out in the water act and the authorisation for the use of water resolution granted by the national water secretariat the ministry of the environment also sets fees with regard to the environmental licence taxes mining concessionaires are also required to pay various taxes both direct and indirect direct taxes include income tax which is currently 22 per cent and payable on income less expenses in large scale mining the mining concessionaire must pay 3 per cent of their profits to their employees and 12 per cent of their profits to the state as part of the benefits share system whereas in medium scale mining is 5 per cent to the employees and 10 per cent to the state and in small scale mining is 10 per cent for employees and 5 per cent to the state finally if mining concessionaires send money abroad a 5 per cent currency exit tax is payable as for indirect taxes vat at a rate of 12 per cent is payable on goods purchased and services rendered the amendments introduced in december 2015 allow mineral exporters to recover vat as of 1 january 2018 finally the same amendment permits all gold acquisitions by individuals or holders of mining concessions to also have a zero per cent vat rate as of 1 january 2018 customs duties and other charges imposed by customs are payable when importing goods to ecuador in addition a windfall profit tax of 70 per cent is payable only after 48 months after pre production investments in the mining project have been recuperated to calculate the windfall profit tax metal prices are equal to their 10 year rolling average plus one standard deviation for reference the average price of gold over the past 10 years plus one standard deviation was us 1 435 per ounce and the current price of gold is us 1 231 per ounce as mentioned this tax only applies in the large scale mining category further with regard to municipal taxes liability for the following taxes should be borne in mind municipal patent the maximum annual tax that can be paid calculated according to a concessionaire s assets is us 5 000 municipal tax equivalent to 0 15 per cent of the concessionaire s assets and rural land tax concessionaires are also required to pay a contribution to the superintendency of companies which is currently set at 0 1 per cent of the concessionaire s real assets capital gains tax is also a variable on this section see question 23 royalties finally with regard to royalties the mining act states that during the exploitation stage mining concessionaires must pay a royalty depending on the mining category artisanal miners do not have to pay any royalty at all small scale mining is required to pay a royalty equivalent to 3 per cent of the sales of the principal and secondary minerals medium scale mining is required to pay a royalty equivalent to 4 per cent of the sales of the principal and secondary minerals and large scale mining is required to pay a royalty not less than 5 per cent and not higher than 8 per cent of the sales of the principal and secondary minerals the general mining regulations provide more detail stating that the royalty is calculated on the gross income less refining and transport costs on the other hand the percentage of royalties payable by concessionaires carrying out non metallic mining activities is calculated according to production costs tax advantages and incentives what tax advantages and incentives are available to private parties carrying on mining activities companies that reinvest their profits in the country are entitled to a 10 per cent reduction in the income tax payable on the amount reinvested in production assets provided the assets are to be used to purchase new machinery or equipment that are used as part of their production activities such as the purchase of goods related to investigations or technology to improve their productivity generate production diversity and to increase employment further deductions can be made when activities are carried out in economically depressed areas or frontier zones and citizens resident in such areas are employed tax stablisation does any legislation provide for tax stabilisation or are there tax stabilisation agreements in force overall article 82 of the constitution guarantees the principle of legal certainty recognising clear ex ante legal rules that shall be respected by all the state authorities further after the promulgation of the organic code of production the state allows the possibility of signing investment protection agreements with both domestic and foreign investors in order to provide tax stability and other related incentives on 29 december 2014 the government enacted an amendment to the law which opens up the possibility to investors investing over us 100 million to negotiate and execute a legal and tax stability agreement thereby allowing investors to stabilise the regulations during the term of the agreement carried interest is the government entitled to a carried interest or a free carried interest in mining projects according to article 315 of the constitution and article 16 of the ecuadorian mining act the state may participate in mining projects through public or mixed public private companies in which the state should be the majority shareholder with the enactment of the current mining act the national mining company enami ep was created in order to manage mining activity for the sustainable use of mining resources the company may carry out its duties independently or in partnership or association with other entities public or private in accordance with the legal provisions transfer taxes and capital gains are there any transfer taxes or capital gains imposed regarding the transfer of licences the national assembly of ecuador enacted under the organic law for production incentives and prevention of tax fraud various amendments to ecuador s income tax code including the introduction of the taxation of capital gains effective as of 29 december 2014 this law includes provisions for a capital gains tax on the profits derived from the direct or indirect sale of shares by companies either domiciled or with permanent establishments in ecuador further amendments to the law were enacted under decree no 580 which came into force on 13 february 2015 which amended or clarified the previous law decree no 580 established a threshold whereby the indirect taxation does not apply to holders of shares of a non resident company if the real value of the rights representing the capital of the company resident in or with a permanent establishment in ecuador is less than 10 per cent of the real value of the company that is not a resident of ecuador decree no 580 also established a threshold whereby the indirect taxation does not apply if the cumulative annual sale of shares for an individual is less than us 3 4 million distinction between domestic parties and foreign parties is there any distinction between the duties royalties and taxes payable by domestic parties and those payable by foreign parties domestic and foreign parties are required to pay the same duties royalties and taxes see question 19 business structures principal business structures what are the principal business structures used by private parties carrying on mining activities while foreign companies could open a branch in ecuador this idea is not often used as not only is there a risk that the foreign parent company may be held accountable for any of the branch s liabilities but also it is more expensive and takes longer to set up a branch than to incorporate a local company in addition local companies can have broader corporate objects whereas the corporate object of a branch must be exactly the same as that of the parent company as for joint ventures and trusts although these structures are permitted in accordance with ecuadorian legislation they are not often used as such the most common business structure is to incorporate an ecuadorian company there are many forms of company the most common being corporations and limited liability companies in many ways the forms of company are very similar for example they must have at least two shareholders however the principal differences between the two are that in the case of limited liability companies the maximum number of shareholders is 15 and a shareholder may only transfer shares if the prior consent of all the other shareholders is obtained although it depends on the needs of each interested party as such restrictions do not apply to corporations this is the most common form of business structure used in the event of a joint venture this structure can be reflected in the share ownership of the local company local entity requirement is there a requirement that a local entity be a party to the transaction any foreign entity is required by law to be domiciled in ecuador in addition for tax planning reasons it is quite often advantageous to incorporate a local company bilateral investment and tax treaties are there jurisdictions with favourable bilateral investment treaties or tax treaties with your jurisdiction through which foreign entities will commonly structure their operations in your jurisdiction ecuador has signed agreements for the promotion and protection of investments with argentina bolivia canada chile china cuba el salvador finland france germany honduras italy the netherlands nicaragua paraguay peru romania spain sweden switzerland the uk the us and venezuela additionally ecuador has entered into double taxation treaties with argentina belgium brazil canada chile china france germany italy mexico romania singapore south korea spain switzerland andean countries and uruguay if foreign entities wish to use jurisdictions that are considered to be tax havens it should be noted that ecuador imposes punitive taxes it is important to bear in mind that the national assembly approved the denunciation of foreign investment protection treaties consequently the government of ecuador has terminated these treaties note that all investments and commitments to invest made by canadian investors prior to the termination of the canada ecuador foreign investment protection agreement fipa are protected for a period of 15 years from the date of termination financing principal sources of financing what are the principal sources of financing available to private parties carrying on mining activities what role does the domestic public securities market play in financing the mining industry financing for mining operations generally comes from abroad as direct investment as there are very limited local financial sources since financial entities such as banks consider mining activities to be high yield investments in addition there are no government financing sources for mining activities the mining industry therefore relies heavily on direct foreign investment either by entrepreneurs international investment banks private equity funds or trusts direct financing from government or major pension funds does the government its agencies or major pension funds provide direct financing to mining projects although government agencies and pension funds are permitted to provide direct financing to mining projects historically this has not occurred currently in ecuador financing for mining projects is entirely private and due to the lack of experience in mining government agencies do not have any interest in providing funds for this type of project security regime describe the regime for taking security over mining interests the personal nature of mining rights contradicts several norms of the mining act which treat the said rights as if they were property rights however because they are personal rights suitable guarantees can be set up for lenders to a mining project although whether it is possible to pledge the mining rights arising from a mining concession is open to question it is feasible to establish an industrial pledge over a mining concessionaire s assets a mining concessionaire could therefore grant a number of distinct and independent security interests one over the mining rights arising out of the mining concession and the other over the buildings machinery tools etc located in the mining concession in accordance with the terms of article 576 and onwards of the ecuadorian commercial code both the mining rights arising from a mining concession and the contractual rights stemming from the exploitation contract can be pledged as guarantee assignments to parties lending to a project pursuant to the civil code any right can be waived or assigned and thus property personal litigation and inheritance rights among others can be assigned the following conditions must be met to ensure that a guarantee assignment is an effective guarantee for parties lending to a mining project first a financial entity not domiciled in the country or qualified as a subject entitled to mining rights must be allowed to be an assignee of mining rights and second the authorisation for the guarantee assignment and any other requirement needed for the formalisation thereof should be in place at the time said assignment is granted so that if the mining concessionaire defaults the financial entity can automatically step into the project without needing any other kind of procedure or authorisation in addition to the above mentioned guarantees a pledge over the shares held by the holding company in the company operating the mining project would be another option the holding company could also place its shares in a guarantee trust in favour of the lenders to the projects finally the guarantee system also allows for an industrial pledge on the minerals obtained from the deposit as well as on the current and future cash flows from the sale of said minerals restrictions importation restrictions what restrictions are imposed on the importation of machinery and equipment or services required in connection with exploration and extraction there are no restrictions regarding such importation but there are different alternatives for these procedures which will depend on the business structure budget and needs of a particular party standard conditions and agreements which standard conditions and agreements covering equipment supplies are used in your jurisdiction there are no specific standards used in the ecuadorian jurisdiction to cover equipment supplies but the ecuadorian market is absolutely friendly with the supplier and buyer of industrial equipment used for the mining sector in terms of dispute resolutions usually the parties prefer to include international arbitration clauses in the equipment supply agreements rather than litigate in domestic courts mineral restrictions what restrictions are imposed on the processing export or sale of minerals are there any export quotas licensing or other mechanisms that prevent producers from freely exporting their production there are no restrictions regarding the processing export or sale of minerals obtained from mining operations the principle of free trade is enshrined in current legislation and minerals can be freely exported provided all of the relevant taxes have been paid see question 19 import of funds restrictions what restrictions are imposed on the import of funds for exploration and extraction or the use of the proceeds from the export or sale of minerals ecuador does not impose any form of restriction regarding the importation of funds to be used for mining operations nor on the use of proceeds resulting from the sale or exportation of minerals environment principal applicable environmental laws what are the principal environmental laws applicable to the mining industry what are the principal regulatory bodies that administer those laws the principal environmental laws that apply to the mining industry are the constitution the mining environmental regulations the unified text of secondary environmental legislation the water act and the environmental act which entered into force in april 2018 and encompasses all the environmental legislation in one single body of law the regulation and control bodies are the ministry of the environment and its regional environmental offices and with regard to water resources the national secretariat of water environmental review and permitting process what is the environmental review and permitting process for a mining project how long does it normally take to obtain the necessary permits through amendments to the mining law introduced on 16 july 2013 the process for obtaining the environmental permits was simplified with the new regulations environmental permits can be summarised as follows for artisanal mining environmental factsheets must be approved for small scale mining environmental licences allow concessionaires to carry out exploration and exploitation activities simultaneously and for medium and large scale mining environmental factsheets must be approved for the initial exploration stage which is a different and much simpler process than the environmental impact assessments required in the past an environmental declaration will need to be approved for the advanced exploration stage instead of the more complicated environmental impact assessment and an environmental licence will need to be approved for the exploitation on the basis of an environmental impact assessment when the concessionaires have completed all the requirements for the approval of the environmental licence this must be granted within six months of the presentation of the required documentation should the competent authority fail to respond within this time frame this shall be taken as tacit agreement to the commencement of mining activities in other words the law establishes positive administrative silence for the approval of environmental licences closure and remediation process what is the closure and remediation process for a mining project what performance bonds guarantees and other financial assurances are required all environmental impact studies must contain an environmental management plan which in turn must contain a plan for the partial or total closure of the mining operations among other details the plan must contain details regarding the dismantling of facilities remediation and rehabilitation of affected areas etc the concessionaire must provide an annual budget for these closure activities approved by the environmental authorities with regard to guarantees the concessionaire is required to provide a bank guarantee or take out an insurance policy which must remain in force until the total closure of mining operations in order to guarantee compliance with the environmental management plan restrictions on building tailings or waste dams what are the restrictions for building tailings or waste dams there are no restrictions for building tailings or waste dams nevertheless according to the environmental act it is necessary to have an environmental licence prior benefiting from tailing ponds and waste piles added to that the mining concessionaire must comply with the regulations and technical specifications contained in the mining act and the unified text of secondary environmental legislation see question 40 the company in charge of the operation and management of dam waste must demonstrate technical evidence and credentials to support its experience in this kind of infrastructure inspections of mining projects by local authorities are really common especially since 2016 an alarm system is not mandatory but according to the legal framework it is advisable to prevent environmental disasters it is a common practice within private mining companies operating in ecuador in terms of responsibilities for a dam failure the immediate action is to prevent any human infrastructure loss thus the government will use all their resources in that line there is a specific government entity that deals with any kind of natural disaster as a common practice companies must also provide all the necessary support to the above mentioned end health safety and labour issues principal health and safety and labour laws what are the principal health and safety and labour laws applicable to the mining industry what are the principal regulatory bodies that administer those laws the principal legal provisions regarding health and safety as well as labour laws are set out in international agreements to which ecuador is a party including the international labour organization ilo the constitution and various ecuadorian laws and regulations including the labour code and the general labour risks insurance regulations among others labour law in ecuador is complex and biased in favour of employees the rights granted to employees by legislation cannot be waived or challenged the labour code regulates the forms of labour contracts holidays minimum wages bonuses and other benefits maternity leave unions and collective contracts strikes and compensation among other matters the social security act governs social security benefits and all companies must affiliate their employees to the ecuadorian social security institute iess the iess and the ministry of labour together with its labour inspectors are responsible for ensuring compliance with labour and social security legislation management and recycling of mining waste what are the rules related to management and recycling of mining waste products who has title and the right to explore and exploit mining waste products in tailings ponds and waste piles according to article 43 of the mining act mining waste products in tailing ponds and waste piles are part of the mining concession therefore the mining concessionaire has the right to freely exploit and benefit from them however according to the mining act and the environmental act regulations it is necessary to acquire an environmental licence prior to exploiting and benefiting from mining waste products in tailing ponds and waste piles the mining concessionaire must follow the regulations contained in the mining act environmental management act regulations and the unified text of secondary environmental legislation use of domestic and foreign employees what restrictions and limitations are imposed on the use of domestic and foreign employees in connection with mining activities the mining act states that no more than 20 per cent of a mining company s employees can be foreign further preference should always be given to ecuadorian specialised technical personnel and only if there are none should foreign personnel be contracted any foreign employees must have a work visa and comply with all applicable labour and immigration requirements including the obligation to train ecuadorian personnel in their field of expertise in addition when hiring mining companies must favour workers living in the area of influence of the project and have policies regarding the integration of employees families in place social and community issues community engagement and csr what are the principal community engagement or csr laws applicable to the mining industry what are the principal regulatory bodies that administer those laws all mining activities must respect the principle of sumak kawsay an indigenous principle enshrined in the constitution in order to ensure that everyone live in a healthy and economically sustainable environment therefore ecuadorian legislation contains many provisions regarding these matters there are a series of legal provisions regarding csr in various pieces of legislation including the constitution the mining act the environmental act and the citizen participation act among others additionally international csr principles such as the ilo 169 convention the un global compact and other un guidelines are applied within mining operations in ecuador rights of aboriginal indigenous or disadvantaged peoples how do the rights of aboriginal indigenous or currently or previously disadvantaged peoples affect the acquisition or exercise of mining rights in ecuador the collective rights of indigenous communities nationalities and peoples are recognised in the constitution and the various international human rights agreements protocols declarations and other principles see question 42 indigenous communities nationalities and peoples must be consulted freely and with sufficient information regarding any plans or programmes to explore exploit or sell non renewable natural resources located within their land and which could affect them either environmentally or culturally or affect their property rights further they have the right to receive a share of the benefits generated by these projects and to receive compensation for any social cultural or environmental damage caused as a result the consultation referred to above is mandatory and must be carried out by the competent authorities on a timely basis it is important to point out that according to international standards and conventions the result of the consultation process is not legally binding it is prohibited to carry out extractives activities in lands belonging to aboriginal people who voluntarily choose to remain isolated international law what international treaties conventions or protocols relating to csr issues are applicable in your jurisdiction ecuador is party to a number of international treaties the principal ones being the universal declaration of human rights the international convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination the un covenant on civil and political rights the international covenant on economic social and cultural rights the additional protocol to the american convention on human rights in the area of economic social and cultural rights the ilo 169 convention on indigenous and tribal people in independent countries and the un declaration on the rights of indigenous people according to the current constitution these international agreements are binding and within them the provisions of the human rights agreements prevail over the constitution itself in addition the government has developed laws and regulations to protect the right to prior consultation of indigenous communities it is also important to note that in the light of a 2012 decision of the inter american court of human rights ecuador should adopt legislative measures in order to fully facilitate the right of indigenous peoples to prior consultation and should also modify those laws that may restrict its free and informed exercise anti bribery and corrupt practices local legislation describe any local legislation governing anti bribery and corrupt practices with regards to the ecuadorian legislation on anti bribery and corrupt practices it is important to consider the principles enshrined in the constitution as well as in the criminal code the organic law on transparency and social control and the organic law on transparency and access to public information the constitution along with the aforementioned legislation develops a very strict legal framework to regulate control and sanction anti bribery and corrupt practices foreign legislation do companies in your country pay particular attention to any foreign legislation governing anti bribery and foreign corrupt practices in your jurisdiction considering that there is a strict legal framework regarding anti bribery and corrupt practices in ecuador companies have strict rules on compliance and disclosure to this regard article 417 of the constitution ratifies that all international instruments and treaties endorsed by ecuador are part of the domestic legal system commonly companies follow the regulations contained in the inter american conventions against corruption and the un convention against corruption among others for instance us and canadian companies include in their contracts the reference of the foreign corrupt practices act and convention on combating bribery of foreign public officials in international business transactions of the organisation for economic co operation and development disclosure of payments by resource companies has your jurisdiction enacted legislation or adopted international best practices regarding disclosure of payments by resource companies to government entities in accordance with the extractive industries transparency initiative eiti standard in 2009 the inter american development bank and the faro group signed an agreement to develop the transparency in the extractive industry in ecuador project focused on achieving the active participation of public and private companies linked to extractive industries particularly in the oil sector idbdocs iadb org wsdocs getdocument aspx docnum 35400790 the initiative s main objective is the application of the minimum level of the agreed upon standards which allow for the transparent handling of information within the sector added to that the ecuadorian government joined the extractive industries transparency initiative in 2018 that seeks good governance and public disclosure of information within oil gas and mining industries in accordance with both initiatives the constitution allows for the civil society to participate throughout different levels of government decision making processes the right to transparent information is recognised within the constitution as per local legislation the organic law on transparency and access to public information allows citizens to access public information and that is closely related to the aforementioned initiatives foreign investment foreign ownership restrictions are there any foreign ownership restrictions in your jurisdiction relevant to the mining industry the constitution incorporated the prohibition of land surface rights acquisition by foreigners in border areas which extends to 20 kilometres from the border this prohibition does not apply to mining concessions however if an area is located within the border zone it is necessary to obtain a prior authorisation from the ministry of defence in accordance with article 41 of the homeland security law international treaties applicable international treaties what international treaties apply to the mining industry or an investment in the mining industry ecuador had double tax treaties with argentina belgium brazil canada chile china france germany italy mexico romania singapore south korea spain switzerland the andean countries and uruguay however as mentioned in question 27 the national assembly approved the denunciation of foreign investment protection treaties including the fipa entered into by ecuador and canada relevance of the canada ecuador fipa the canada ecuador fipa expressly provides for the right of a party to terminate the treaty by giving one year s advance notice once termination becomes effective that is one year after the termination notice is delivered the effective termination date all of the articles of the treaty except for article xviii which sets out the termination provision remain in full force and effect for a period of 15 years for investments or commitments to invest made prior to the effective termination date investments or commitments to invest made after the effective termination date will not be eligible for fipa protection and will have to rely on domestic legislation for protection ecuadorian legislation provides for investment agreements a form of protection discussed at the end of this question the termination provisions can be found in article xviii 2 of the canada ecuador fipa as follows this agreement shall remain in force unless either contracting party notifies the other contracting part in writing of its intention to terminate it the termination of this agreement shall become effective one year after notice of termination has been received by the other contracting party in respect of investments or commitments to invest made prior to the date when the termination of this agreement becomes effective the provisions of articles i to xvii inclusive of this agreement shall remain in force for a period of fifteen years based on the express wording found in the canada ecuador fipa the interpretation rules found in the vienna convention on law of treaties and relevant international law authorities and jurisprudence article xviii 2 of the canada ecuador fipa will allow the investor the right to assert claims under the treaty for a period of 15 years following the termination of the treaty so long as these claims arise out of investments or commitments to invest made prior to the date on which the termination of the treaty becomes effective the effective termination date furthermore in our view the unconditional consent provided by ecuador to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this article xiii of the canada ecuador fipa will permit a canadian investor who has made investments or commitments to invest within the requisite period the right to invoke the arbitration mechanism for a period of 15 years following the termination of the treaty notwithstanding any statement or notice by ecuador withdrawing such consent in other words the investor s submission of a dispute to arbitration including the concurrent consent for arbitration required from the investor need not be provided in advance of the effective termination of the canada ecuador fipa or prior to the date of the giving of notice by ecuador to the government of canada seeking to terminate the treaty in order to exercise its right to seek arbitration the investor would be able to initiate the proceeding pursuant to article xiii at any time within the 15 year survival period provided it meets the requirements for submitting the dispute to arbitration and providing its consent update and trends update and trends what were the biggest mining news events over the past year in your jurisdiction and what were the implications what are the current trends and developments in 2017 in your jurisdiction s mining industry legislation major cases significant transactions the international awards that ecuador received in the past year confirm the success of the mining industry in ecuador the mines money americas outstanding achievement awards 2017 handed out awards for the best country of the year to ecuador best explorer in latin america to solgold and ceo of the year to nick mather ceo of solgold additionally mines money gave an award to ecuador as the most innovative country in london in december 2017 on top of that the mining journal included the name of the former minister of mining javier cordova as one of the most influential people in mining around the world these awards are not a coincidence they are the combination of adequate government decisions and the extraordinary results of mining companies which has placed ecuador in the sights of investors as of the creation of the mining ministry in december 2016 the ecuadorian government has spearheaded various initiatives including the signing of an exploitation contract with lundin for the development of the fruta del norte project the opening of the mining cadastre and the start of the construction of the mirador and the rio blanco projects according to the mining ministry from the opening of the mining cadastre on 1 march 2016 to december 2017 275 mining concessions were granted equivalent to 3 72 per cent of the national territory with committed exploration investments during the first four years of approximately us 1 3 billion these figures are impressive for a country that during the past 10 years was not on the radar of the international investment community additionally there is the arrival in some cases and the return in others of various experienced companies such as bhp billiton anglo american newcrest and fortescue among others however the most important mining news is without a doubt the extraordinary results of the cascabel project of australian company solgold which indicate the existence of a world class porphyry copper gold deposit that according to experts is only discovered once every 10 years around the world according to solgold the investment required to develop the cascabel project is projected using a conceptual economic model with a processing capacity of 40mtpa using the block cave mining method at us 3 billion capital expenditure comprising one third equity and two thirds debt an investment of this magnitude would surely affect the gdp of ecuador creating new jobs and fostering economic growth especially in the provinces of imbabura and carchi where the project is located and in the province of esmeraldas home to the port used for exporting the mineral ecuador has worked hard to regain the trust of the international community after the disastrous mining mandate of 2008 trust is built daily but it can also be lost very easily nevertheless there are some worrying signs for the industry although president moreno has publicly expressed his support for mining as long as it is environmentally responsible the inclusion of a specific question in the recent referendum resulted in anti mining groups demanding that the government issue additional prohibitions to impede the development of projects in areas that are currently subject to exploration including those where concessions have been granted to companies by means of public tender processes additionally while companies understand that the mining cadastre should be closed to allow for new mining planning authorities were unable to inform the public with regards to the reasons behind closing the mining cadastre which in turn was interpreted as a measure taken owing to pressure from indigenous and anti mining groups that supported president moreno during the referendum however the most concerning news for the industry is the decision by the mining ministry to eliminate areas reserved by mining companies from the cadastre which is a blow to the trust that had been rebuilt recently between mining authorities and private industry likewise understanding that the mining ministry is responsible for defining the areas subject to tenders the sensitive information about areas that companies have identified as being of prospective interest is now public knowledge it can be imagined that when the cadastre is reopened in the future there will be a fight to apply for such areas with reserves knowing ahead of time the interest of the most well known exploration companies it is to be hoped that this cloud of uncertainty passes soon and that there is no damage to the credibility and seriousness of the country as mining is the only industry capable of attracting large amounts of investment in upcoming years which without a doubt would be good for the ecuadorian economy

via lewrockwell i ve excerpted some quotes from economist john williams most recent economic commentary no 983 b shadowstats com which is of interest to every american it predicts financial authorities will make a formal admission that the economy is in a state of collapse and in recession on or around september 2019 williams made this prediction in 2004 the announcement would be an admission of a financial collapse that has been ongoing since 2008 and has been hidden from public view many quarterly reports are assumptions that are later corrected when the real numbers come in september 2019 these numbers typically don t grab the news headlines as they should says williams williams notes the federal reserve a cabal of 12 private banks has centered on the needs and health of the banking system very much at the cost of domestic business activity and the economic health and prosperity of main street u s a williams reveals the primary numbers on the health of the american economy unemployment and gross domestic product are fabricated the u s government reports day to day financial data that doesn t include future obligations medicare social security it s as if the government doesn t actually have to meet those obligations but of course it does and to imagine various politicians are calling for medicare for all williams goes on to say a banking holiday in 2008 might have left the u s economy in a better long term circumstance than it is today given that the federal reserve has now failed at achieving its dual mandate that of promoting the goals of maximum employment stable prices and moderate long term interest rates williams suggests a radical change maybe it is time for the congress to realign control of the u s currency monetary policy and targeting economic activity back to the elected officials who control the u s treasury with oversight in congress as opposed to the federal reserve which is owned by the banks it oversees go to shadowstats com to learn more bill sardi special commentary number 983 b excerpts from economic and financial market review april 22 2019 john williams shadowstats com the federal reserve is not doing so well with its dual mandate despite happy formal proclamations to the contrary since 1977 the federal reserve has operated under a mandate from congress to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment stable prices and moderate long term interest rates what is now commonly referred to as the fed s dual mandate the federal open market committee fomc policies of 2008 and 2018 2019 and the years intervening have centered on the needs and health of the banking system very much at the cost of domestic business activity and the economic health and prosperity of main street u s a from a practical standpoint the dual mandate has not been met within the intent of the u s congress and that should be reviewed in the congressional oversight of the federal reserve system fed s current statutory mandate of attaining maximum employment and price stability has been made a great deal easier to attain in recent decades from a headline standpoint thanks to the federal government redefining how it measures headline inflation and unemployment always with fed input and encouragement discussed in public commentary on inflation measurement and public commentary on unemployment measurement the redefined series have had the policy and politically friendly effects of reducing both headline inflation and headline broad unemployment as the fomc moved recently to constrain consumer liquidity weakening the 74 of the u s gross domestic product gdp directly driven by the consumer defending the rate hikes the fed argued that the broad economy was booming overheating in fact which raised the risk of rising inflation that was nonsense even so despite a booming headline gdp major sectors of the u s economy never expanded post banking crisis never saw a full business recovery from the 2007 recession and economic collapse into 2009 economic expansion generally is recognized and measured from when depressed levels of business activity recover to and then expand beyond the pre recession peak in activity now the fed is triggering a renewed and intensified economic downturn as it tries to extricate itself from its policies of ten years ago from a peak of annualized inflation adjusted real quarterly growth of 4 16 in second quarter 2018 activity slowed to 3 36 in third quarter activity then to 2 17 in the final fourth quarter reading both first and second quarter 2019 gdp likely will show outright quarterly contractions in real inflation adjusted activity reflecting the onset of what should become a formal new recession accordingly the effects of fomc s tightening of the last year or so are depressing current and future business activity as would be expected with the traditional lead time which is 9 months says williams as a result fed actions to raise interest rates to what historically and normally would be higher levels backfired as the foreseeable current negative economic impact now has forced the fomc into a neutral tightening stance we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us the present circumstance should be recognized measured and timed as a new recession off an economic peak level of activity in fourth quarter 2018 as of its march 2019 meeting the federal reserve s federal open market committee indicated it had put planned interest rate hikes for 2019 on hold along with reducing ceasing its balance sheet liquidations that were being used to unwind the qe programs the bureau of economic analysis bea can bring in the headline gdp at any level it desires and often targets the consensus outlook beware july 26th when a formal recession likely will have gained popular recognition the annual benchmarking on july 26th will revise recent gdp history including fourth quarter 2018 and first quarter 2019 both likely to the downside with a headline first quarter contraction in hand by then yet a banking holiday with fomc guarantees on all deposits actually put in place with the 2008 crisis and with a reorganization of the banking system and federal reserve or restructured u s treasury systemic oversight might have left the u s economy in a better long term circumstance than it is today again though with systemic failure not viewed as an option whatever money had to be created spent or loaned whatever liabilities had to be guaranteed whatever bad assets had to be absorbed whatever entities inefficient crooked or otherwise had to be bailed out whatever markets had to be manipulated whatever had to be done as a stop gap measure was done to preserve the system what was not done was to address most of the underlying fundamental issues that led to the crisis including the long term sovereign solvency issues of the united states government those issues still need to be addressed along with a long overdue congressional overhaul of the politically independent u s central bank and its federal reserve system which otherwise is owned by the banks that it also regulates the central bank s primary concern remains the banking system not the economy and not main street u s a the fed still has not succeeded in fully reestablishing banking system health and normal commercial functionality having taken little but stopgap measures in 2008 which pushed much of the banking solvency crisis into the future the federal reserve and the u s treasury again face continuing systemic insolvency or instability issues as that future closes in maybe it is time for the congress to realign control of the u s currency monetary policy and targeting economic activity back to the elected officials who control the u s treasury with oversight in congress as opposed to the federal reserve which is owned by the banks it oversees no other major economic indicator or employment measure has shown anything close to the purported headline real gdp expansion of 19 1 almost all government reporting has to incorporate underlying assumptions and the tendency usually is to make overly positive assumptions allowing for later downside corrections in the benchmarking understating economic activity is a political embarrassment while overstating activity has no such political stigma attached to it with unsustainable fiscal policies the united states government faces long range insolvency or hyperinflation the u s government must move now to bring its fiscal operations into balance to restore long term stability and solvency to the system otherwise current conditions easily could evolve into a hyperinflationary great depression much sooner than commonly expected forcing significant overhauls to the domestic and global economic and financial market systems these crises no longer are too far into the future to worry about as some in the u s government and fed have argued in recent decades and the fed is complicit in this circumstance along with the congress and president based on generally accepted accounting principles gaap the headline net obligations of the federal government including the unfunded liabilities valued in today s dollars have reached an order of magnitude of well over 100 trillion including 22 0 trillion in existing u s treasury debt the largest amount of sovereign debt in the world that 100 plus trillion needed in hand to cover existing u s obligations not only is five times greater than the headline nominal u s gdp but also tops current estimates of the aggregate global gdp of about 85 trillion indeed that circumstance is unsustainable and uncontainable yet those controlling the u s government consistently refuse to address the nation s long term solvency issues although they talk about it the gaap statements include not only concepts such as accounts receivable and payable assets and depreciation but also projections of the net present value npv of unfunded liabilities tied to programs such as social security and medicare as global markets look to escape their looming losses in u s dollar holdings that day of ultimate reckoning for the u s currency likely remains near a flight from the dollar and hyperinflation fears could break over a very short period as quickly as the banking panic of 2008 for example or it could evolve over longer periods and intermittent crises i have published the shadow government statistics newsletter since 2004 early on i began discussing the long term insolvency of the united states government leading to a domestic hyperinflation likely around 2018 or 2019 in the current circumstance unless the u s government meaningfully overhauls its planned expenses a significant reduction in spending and or increases its revenues a significant increase in tax revenues going into the future including overhauling social security medicare and medicaid it has no chance of covering its net obligations going forward other than by just printing the dollars needed generating dollar debasement and eventual hyperinflation the potential hyperinflation here is every bit the same as seen in the german weimar republic post world war i zimbabwe in the 1990s and 2000s and venezuela with inflation hitting 80 000 in 2018 like gold u s dollars have value only to the extent that they are strictly limited in supply but the u s government has a technology called a printing press or today its electronic equivalent that allows it to produce as many u s dollars as it wishes at essentially no cost by increasing the number of u s dollars in circulation or even by credibly threatening to do so the u s government can also reduce the value of a dollar in terms of goods and services which is equivalent to raising the prices in dollars of those goods and services we conclude that under a paper money system a determined government can always generate higher spending and hence positive inflation bernanke 2002 deflation speech yet the quantitative easing created by the fed in response to the 2008 financial panic was designed primarily as a covert bailout for the still shaky banking system the fed pumped trillions of dollars of new liquidity into the banking system but not into the money supply had banks increased lending into the regular flow of commerce with the new liquidity money supply would have soared and the economy and inflation would have picked up instead the banking system was directed to place the funds back with the fed as excess reserves earning interest on the cash investors have no recourse other than common sense such as investing in assets such as gold and silver which will preserve the purchasing power of their assets against currency debasement more recently williams says following an interview on a major cable news network not cnbc i was advised off air by the producer that they were operating under a corporate mandate to give the economic news a positive spin irrespective of how bad it was

interview with frankfurter allgemeine zeitung interview with benoît cœuré member of the executive board of the ecb conducted by johannes pennekamp and philip plickert on 17 april 2019 and published on 23 april 2019 mr cœuré the fire at notre dame was a catastrophe for france and europe my sincere condolences we hope that the cathedral can be rebuilt as quickly and as beautifully as possible i found it all very moving i lived in paris for twenty years but what also moved me greatly and impressed me was the great sympathy and solidarity from the whole of europe notre dame is the most visited historic building in europe it embodies many of europe s values it is good to see that there was such a strong sense of commonality after the disaster let s turn to monetary policy complaints about the ecb s negative interest rate on deposits have increased significantly each year europe s banks are paying around eur 7 5 billion in penalty interest mario draghi has indicated that a tiering of the negative interest rate could be considered in order to relieve the burden on them would you be in favour of that i find the intensity of the discussion surprising because it focuses on a narrow aspect of our monetary policy the debate about interest rates being low for long should be broader we understand the concerns of those affected by the harmful side effects of very low interest rates these are increasing with time there are possible concerns about financial stability asset prices are rising bank profitability is also a concern however the negative deposit rates are really not the biggest problem their contribution to low bank profits is limited banks should think more about their costs does that mean that you are not in favour of a softer tiered negative interest rate no it doesn t it is a useful relevant discussion that we have had before and should revisit regularly japan and switzerland have tiered systems but the negative deposit rate is not the most important reason why interest rates are so low if we change something there has to be a monetary policy reason for doing so at the current juncture i do not see the monetary policy argument for tiering however we must keep a close eye on developments those who would profit from tiering are above all banks with high excess liquidity of which many are located in france and germany where bank lending is already running high thus there is no evidence so far that the negative deposit rate is bad for lending on the contrary the governing council of the ecb says that key interest rates will remain as low as now until at least the end of 2019 however some bank analysts do not expect the first interest rate rise until late 2020 we are not tied to such market expectations they are an important input but we are not led by them are those who do not expect an interest rate rise until later completely wrong well that reflects an assessment of the downside risks which is different to that of the governing council there has been a lot of bad news on the economy recently sentiment indexes and industrial new orders have fallen how bad is the economic situation in the euro area i have mixed feelings on one hand the slowdown in growth is probably only temporary we expect growth to return in the second half of the year there are no grounds for overly gloomy thoughts on the other hand it is very uncertain how long and how strong the downturn will be the reasons for the uncertainty are political the trade tensions stemming from the united states and also brexit to some extent growth will only return in the second half of the year if there are signs of a resolution to the trade dispute the ecb s growth forecast for this year in the euro area is 1 1 and next year 1 6 yes that is the current staff forecast which will be revised in june germany is very dependent on exports it is particularly hard hit by the weakness in trade is a recession at least according to the technical definition of two negative quarters thinkable no we do not expect a recession but it is true that the economic slowdown in germany is stronger than we had expected there were temporary factors such as the problems with emission tests in the car industry now things depend mainly on growth in emerging economies above all china the german export oriented growth model also entails risks it was very advantageous during the upturn of the global economy now things are not so good would you advise the german government to increase domestic demand the ecb does not lecture the german government in its european semester reports the european commission made it clear that germany should balance its growth and increase domestic demand that could be done above all through more investment which would be good for the germany economy in europe there is much discussion about the level of budget deficits of course the amount of the deficit is important for keeping debt under control but it would be at least as important to talk more about the composition of expenditure most countries including my home country france and also italy have no fiscal room for manoeuvre for more spending however through reallocation the expenditure could become more growth friendly to return to the more technical side of the ecb s policy you gave banks four year loans in the order of hundreds of billions of euro so called tltros which will soon expire for this there will be follow on loans again with such favourable conditions even in part a negative interest rate the tltro loans are not a subsidy for the banks they are a monetary policy instrument aimed at ensuring adequate lending the governing council will presumably decide on the conditions including the interest rate in june the remarkable progress in lending to the real economy will have to be taken into account the situation today is very different to 2016 when we issued the last tltros to actively support lending however we want to protect this achievement so the conditions no longer need to be so generous the governing council will decide on that based on economic data the key measure of the success of the ecb s policy is price stability contrary to what the ecb repeatedly forecasts the rate of inflation remains below the target the curve is not upward sloping but is flat inflation could still remain very low for a long time and that is in spite of the fact that wages are rising significantly consumer prices are not following is that a puzzle it is half a puzzle at least wages are now rising following the fall in unemployment as we had expected but what is missing is the transmission from wage costs to product and consumer prices that is a bit puzzling businesses are apparently accepting narrower profit margins rather than raising prices that may be because they do not think demand is strong enough yet and because of strong global competition but that cannot go on forever at some point they will raise prices however the most recent slowdown in the economy is a setback this autumn ecb president mario draghi will step down after eight years in office so far the ecb has had a dutchman a frenchman and an italian at its helm but so far no president from germany can you understand why many germans want the next president of the ecb to come from here i understand that but it s the wrong way of looking at things the choice of ecb president should not be based on nationality but on competence but we should not pretend to be so naïve as to think that political and national considerations do not play a role yes of course i understand the political process but the selection should be based on competence and if you ask me i would also be happy to see a woman at the helm of the ecb ultimately there are various criteria and it is a political decision so what must an ecb president have in terms of qualities abilities and knowledge you will have to ask the european heads of state or government they decide that what i would say as a central banker is that you have to be a good central bank manager you must have a strong background in and knowledge of economics and you must understand the capital markets without being a hostage to market expectations and you should uphold the independence of the ecb and you need to have the ability to lead and to make compromises you have ambitions yourself some say you have a 10 percent chance of becoming ecb president however you are on the executive board and it is crystal clear in the eu treaty that a re appointment of executive board members is prohibited i won t give any legal interpretations that is up to the eu heads of state or government i have worked for europe for the last seven years i also want to continue to serve europe the central bank is a place where i can be useful but of course i can also be useful elsewhere the ecb leadership has apparently already obtained legal advice which played out the case of you briefly stepping down and then being re appointed as president would that not be a blatant ploy a breach of the spirit of the rules i am not a lawyer but you would like to do it who wouldn t but it is not a position that you apply for we must respectfully wait to see what the politicians decide the next president of the ecb will have no easy task he he or she he or she must drive forward the normalisation of monetary policy what is that actually what is normal an interesting question a lot of thought is given to that at the international monetary fund imf the federal open market committee of the us central bank the federal reserve system asks its members explicitly for their estimate of the longer term development of interest rates we don t do that we in europe are also lagging far behind the us economic cycle i don t know what the long term aim for interest rates in europe should be but for me normalisation means that the key interest rates are again the main instrument of monetary policy as they were before the crisis we are not there yet the bond purchase programme quantitative easing is not yet over because we are reinvesting the proceeds from the maturing bonds each month we reinvest a substantial sum second the forward guidance is now our main instrument steering the market through words not through interest rate changes we are not abandoning the prospect of normalisation but it has been delayed by the economic downturn in the medium term should the ecb reduce its balance sheet again yes like the federal reserve system the federal reserve kept its bond holdings for a considerable time after the end of the net purchases and then started winding down its holdings but in europe we have not got that far yet with all due respect for your optimism regarding the economy what will happen if there is a really strong downturn perhaps even another full blown recession what could the ecb actually still do the best answer is that we have managed in the past every time there has been a major challenge we have found a solution i am confident that in the event of a shock we will find a solution in our toolkit that is within our mandate monetary financing is prohibited but i would caution against the view that only the ecb should have to react to a crisis we do not know what the next crisis will look like every crisis is different there will be another crisis there will always be more crises it would be very unwise to think that the next crisis will be managed by the ecb without any measures having to be taken by governments the burden of tackling crises must not rest on the shoulders of the ecb alone however you have already used up most of your ammunition key interest rates are at zero the bond purchases have almost reached the limits you set yourselves what more could you do we do not answer this question because it all depends on the type of crisis that we are facing at the time we have not had a discussion about this in the governing council either experience has shown however that we have a broad range of instruments do the possible instruments also include a devaluation of cash to make even lower negative interest rates possible after all there are already working papers on this subject in the imf and the ecb what would citizens make of that simple answer it is up to the citizens to decide whether they want to use cash for instance sweden is moving in the direction of a cashless society in the euro area countries demand for cash is still growing the central banks are working on digital central bank money as an alternative to cash we are investigating that but we do not want to abolish cash the question was a different one the academic working papers of the imf and the ecb are not about the abolition of cash but a devaluation through negative interest rates a kind of penalty interest on banknotes that is not a new idea silvio gesell came up with it 100 years ago but it is not a practical discussion for us in the forthcoming european elections anti eu anti euro and populist parties will probably gain seats are you worried that the eu and eu institutions will be weakened by that there will probably be a more fragmented parliament the legislative decision making process will be more difficult politics as a whole will be more difficult and more complex we hope nonetheless that european economic and monetary union will be completed a push towards a capital markets union is needed what is that exactly a capital markets union means greater integration of the capital markets a better cross border allocation of savings by way of a specific example a german company investing in french or spanish companies and vice versa we don t see enough of that yet capital should go where it is most productive a few years ago wolfgang schäuble as finance minister once complained that the ecb s low interest rate policy was 50 responsible for the rise of the alternative for germany afd party in germany perhaps he wasn t being entirely serious but the fact is that many citizens are frustrated about the low interest rates which for example make retirement provision more difficult has the ecb played a part in the success of populist parties when the ecb is given the blame for political outcomes that says more about politics than it does about the ecb we clearly have a political framework in europe that has not delivered what the people expect not the growth the employment nor the income that people in many countries want the ecb is an easy scapegoat our tower here in frankfurt is highly visible many eyes are on us yes we must take into consideration the side effects of our policy the effects on savers on house prices etc we take that very seriously but the bottom line is that our low interest rate policy has benefited savers more than it has harmed them since savers are also workers and borrowers and in the housing market the low interest rate has also helped encourage more construction the criticism is often too simplistic

board and chief executive officer during the year investors became increasingly conservative as the chinese government s focus on deleveraging at the expense of economic growth and the expanding us china trade conflict contributed to an uncertain economic outlook in addition china s wealth management industry continued to experience a difficult transition period due to tightened regulations amid this unfavorable environment the aggregate value of wealth management products distributed by jupai decreased by 44 3 year over year to rmb30 3 billion in 2018 and total net revenue for 2018 declined by 22 5 year over year to rmb1 3 billion we were however able to achieve an average one time commission rate of 2 4 in 2018 compared to 1 9 in 2017 due to our enhanced bargaining power as real estate companies continued to face rising cost of capital based on our observation of the overall credit market since the beginning of 2019 we are confident in maintaining our average one time commission rate at a healthy level in the next few quarters looking into 2019 we remain cautiously optimistic about china s overall economic outlook as the government has introduced various stimulus policies to support private enterprises especially smes to enhance economic growth the domestic equity market has also shown signs of recovery since the beginning of the year which we believe will help restore investor confidence and gradually increase the appetite for wealth management products during this time of industry transition jupai will focus on developing new product categories including real estate equity products and overseas products to better meet investors evolving needs selecting high quality project counterparties to control risk and streamlining internal management to optimize costs we are confident that we will be well positioned to seize opportunities as the market recovers and we look forward to building jupai into a leading wealth and asset management brand in china ms

the organization for economic co operation and development oecd released an annual report under pressure the squeezed middle class on april 10 the 178 page report paints a glaring picture of the social polarization that has occurred over the past three decades among all oecd countries the oecd defines the middle class as households earning between 75 percent and 200 percent of the national median income in each country in the united states the middle income threshold for a single person household ranges from 23 416 to 62 442 per year in contrast the poverty threshold for a single person in the us is 12 490 in reality the vast majority of those households in the middle income strata would be defined as working class not middle class those working for a wage or salary and whose labor is exploited for profit the findings of the report further underscore this point the report shows that among oecd countries a growing number of middle income earners perceive that the current socioeconomic system is unfair this is attributed to the fact that in many oecd countries working households have faced dismal income growth or stagnation and in some cases decline middle incomes increased at a rate of one third less than the top 10 percent over the past 30 years broken down by decade income growth for middle income households was 1 0 percent from the mid 1980s to the mid 1990s 1 6 percent from the mid 1990s to the mid 2000s and 0 3 percent from 2007 to 2016 the alarming rate of social polarization and growth of income inequality is a main feature of the report it found that the top 10 percent of households across all oecd countries own nearly half of all wealth while the bottom forty percent own only three percent in the us the wealth held by the top one percent of households surged from 11 percent to 20 percent nearly doubling over the past three decades at the same time the share of middle income earners in the total population fell from 64 percent to 61 percent and the proportion of low income households in oecd has expanded the oecd refers to this decline in the middle income category and expansion of high income and low income categories as a shift in center of gravity of economy in the us earnings have increased faster at the top than in the middle since the 1980s among all oecd countries while the high income population increased from 11 percent to 14 percent its share of wealth increased disproportionately from 26 percent to 35 percent no longer does a two income household guarantee middle income status the report found also the number of families with children in the middle income category has fallen over the past three decades which it attributes to the exorbitant costs of education healthcare and housing needed to raise a family in most oecd countries for middle income households the report found that the slide into lower income status is a real threat and especially pronounced in the us latvia estonia portugal spain and greece where middle income households are at the greatest risk of falling into the lower income category over a four year period the immediate reasons for this are varied for middle income earners one in six jobs are at risk for automation this number is one in five for low income earners and one in ten for high income earners housing prices have grown three times faster than the median income over the past two decades and the cost of education and healthcare have also increased well above the rate of inflation in oecd countries this has caused over indebtedness to be a major problem for middle income households with one in five finding that they have to spend more than they earn to make ends meet in european countries half of middle income households say they have difficulty making ends meet the report also found that 60 percent of oecd parents surveyed believe that future generations will not reach the same income level as their parents and grandparents younger generations of workers have less stable jobs than baby boomers or those born from 1943 1964 the sharpest decline in the middle income population was among 18 44 year olds with the greatest decline over 30 years being those aged 30 44 in the us the share of adults in the middle income range either fell or remained the same over 30 years in all oecd countries an increasing number of elderly people fall into the middle income elderly in large part due to the growth in those working past retirement age in order to afford necessities middle income households do not receive as much in social benefits as they pay in taxes meanwhile since 1981 corporate and personal income tax for top earners has been cut with corporate taxes down from 47 percent to 25 percent and personal income tax on the wealthy down from 66 percent to 43 percent the supposed lack of money for social benefits is exacerbated by the fact the wealthy are more likely to hoard income in offshore accounts jobs requiring a high skill level make up one fifth of high income earners today as opposed to one fourth in the mid 1990s jobs requiring a medium skill level are mostly found in the middle income households but the likelihood that they are now lower income has increased in 14 countries medium skilled occupations according to the oecd are those in such positions as clerks craft workers plant and machine operators and assemblers an increasing number of higher skilled and professional occupations are now found in middle income households as opposed to high income households these positions include managerial professional and technical occupations such as teachers lawyers health professionals engineers and social workers this points to the proletarianization of large sections of the labor force more workers than ever in the middle income bracket are engaged in non standard work increasing the perception of instability insecurity and anxiety non standard work is defined as temporary part time and self employed work arrangements these jobs have fewer job protections social rights and job training opportunities the oecd report expresses the nervousness within the ruling class over the consequences of these transformations it states that a rising sense of vulnerability uncertainty and anxiety has translated into increasing distrust towards global integration and public institutions and attributes social inequality to the rise of politicians who promote nationalism isolationism populism and protectionism such political tendencies however do not actually express the genuine sentiments of the working class whose strivings are toward social equality and international cooperation they represent sections of the ruling class that aim to suppress any movement of the working class towards socialism and internationalism through the use of national chauvinism and demagogy the report offers desperate proposals for limited reforms to address the crisis among these reforms are relaxation on regulations on construction and introduction of rent controls publicly subsidized childcare or cash reimbursement for parents universal healthcare coverage or means tested assistance vocational training programs and adult education and tuition fee loans and school to work programs but why have these limited reforms not been enacted already as the world economic system faces its next great financial crisis the oecd report fails to address the fundamental cause of the crisis the capitalist system itself money abounds in the banks and stock markets as the report itself details the massive transfer of wealth from the working class to the ruling class over the past three decades has created the conditions of social crisis and yet this same ruling class offers no answers
in the united states the ratio of corporate debt to gdp is at record high levels in several european countries banks are overloaded with government bonds in china bank profitability is declining and capital levels remain low at small and medium sized lenders vulnerabilities like these are on the rise across advanced and emerging market economies according to the imf s latest global financial stability report they aren t all setting off alarm bells just yet but if they continue to build especially with still easy financial conditions they could amplify shocks to the global economy raising the odds of a severe economic downturn a few years down the road this poses a dilemma for policymakers seeking to counter a slowing global economy as discussed in the world economic outlook by taking a patient approach to monetary policy central banks can accommodate growing downside risks to the economy but if financial conditions remain easy for too long vulnerabilities will continue to build and the odds of a sharp drop in economic growth at some later point will be higher image imf blog the good news short term risks to global financial stability are still low by historical standards though they are slightly higher than we found in our october 2018 global financial stability report in the medium term however risks remain elevated but with the right mix of policies countries can sustain growth while keeping vulnerabilities in check why do we worry about financial vulnerabilities because they can amplify the impact of sudden shocks such as a sharper than anticipated economic slowdown an unexpected shift in monetary policy or an escalation of trade tensions higher vulnerabilities give rise to greater financial stability risks image imf blog the latest global financial stability report introduces a way to quantify vulnerabilities in the financial system so policymakers can monitor them in real time and take preventive steps if needed to mitigate risks the framework encompasses six sectors corporates households governments banks insurance companies and other financial institutions some of which are what we call shadow banks the framework tracks both the level and the pace of change along a variety of vulnerabilities including leverage and mismatches in the maturity and liquidity of assets and liabilities as well as currency exposures these vulnerabilities are tracked at regional and global levels aggregating across 29 systemically important countries image imf blog here are some of the most serious vulnerabilities advanced economies corporate debt and financial risk taking have increased and the creditworthiness of borrowers has deteriorated the stock of bonds with bbb ratings has quadrupled and the stock of speculative grade credits has almost doubled in the united states and the euro area since the crisis a sharp tightening of financial conditions or a severe downturn could make it harder for indebted firms to repay their loans and force them to cut back on investment or employment so called leveraged loans to highly indebted borrowers are an area of particular concern as we explained in an earlier blog and discuss further in the current gfsr image imf blog euro area fiscal challenges in some countries could drive bond yields sharply higher resulting in significant losses for banks with large holdings of government debt insurance companies could also face losses this dynamic known as the sovereign financial sector nexus was at the heart of the euro crisis in 2011 still banks have higher capital ratios today and policymakers have taken steps to address nonperforming loans on banks balance sheets china a decline in profits and low levels of capital at small and medium sized banks is restraining credit to smaller private firms further monetary and credit support may increase financial stability risks as continued credit growth makes it harder for smaller banks to clean up their balance sheets emerging markets increasingly overseas portfolio investments in emerging markets are run by managers who seek to match the returns of popular indexes the value of fixed income benchmark driven investments has quadrupled in the past ten years to 800 billion while index driven funds expand the universe of investors for emerging market economies they also leave them more vulnerable to sudden reversals of capital flows in response global trends image imf blog have you read fortunately there are ways to address such vulnerabilities so called macroprudential tools can cool credit growth and make the financial system more resilient one example countercyclical capital buffers which require banks to increase capital when credit is growing countries with high corporate debt could develop tools to limit the riskiness of credit to firms especially credit provided by nonbank lenders in the euro zone lowering the debt to gdp ratio among highly indebted governments is a priority to curb risks so is further repairing banks balance sheets including by reducing non performing loans china needs to continue reducing leverage in the financial sector especially in shadow banking and ensure that lenders build capital buffers authorities should also promptly carry out announced reforms to address risks in investment products emerging market economies coping with volatile capital flows could limit reliance on short term overseas debt and ensure adequate foreign currency reserves and fiscal buffers countries can also use flexible exchange rates to absorb shocks

by shaun richards as easter ends and one which was simply glorious in london those of us reacquainting ourselves with financial markets will see one particular change that is the price of crude oil as the financial times explains crude rose to a five month high on tuesday as washington s decision to end sanctions waivers on iranian oil imports buoyed oil markets for a second day brent the international oil benchmark rose 0 8 per cent to 74 64 in early european trading adding to gains on monday to reach its highest level since early november west texas intermediate the us marker increased 0 9 per cent to 66 13 if we look for some more detail on the likely causes we see this the moves came after the trump administration announced the end of waivers from us sanctions granted to india china japan south korea and turkey oil prices jumped despite the white house insisting that it had worked with saudi arabia and the united arab emirates to ensure sufficient supply to offset the loss of iranian exports goldman sachs said the timing of the sanctions tightening was much more sudden than expected but it played down the longer term impact on the market so we see that president trump has been involved and that seems to be something of a volte face from the time when the donald told us this on the 25th of february oil prices getting too high opec please relax and take it easy world cannot take a price hike fragile realdonaldtrunp after that tweet the oil price was around ten dollars lower than now if we look back to november 7th last year then the donald was playing a very different tune to now i gave some countries a break on the oil trump said during a lengthy wide ranging press conference the day after republicans lost control of the house of representatives in the midterm elections i did it a little bit because they really asked for some help but i really did it because i don t want to drive oil prices up to 100 a barrel or 150 a barrel because i m driving them down if you look at oil prices they ve come down very substantially over the last couple of months trump said that s because of me because you have a monopoly called opec and i don t like that monopoly cnbc if we stay with this issue we see that he has seemingly switched quite quickly from exerting a downwards influence on the oil price to an upwards one as he is bothered about the us economy right now sooner or later it will occur to him that higher oil prices help some of it but hinder more shale oil back on february 19th reuters summarised the parts of the us economy which benefit from a higher oil price u s oil output from seven major shale formations is expected to rise 84 000 barrels per day bpd in march to a record of about 8 4 million bpd the u s energy information administration said in a monthly report on tuesday a shale revolution has helped boost the united states to the position of world s biggest crude oil producer ahead of saudi arabia and russia overall crude production has climbed to a weekly record of 11 9 million bpd thus the us is a major producer and the old era has moved on to some extent as the old era producers as i suppose shown by the dallas tv series in the past has been reduced in importance by the shale oil wildcatters they operate differently as i have pointed out before that they are financed with cheap money provided by the qe era and have something of a cash flow model and can operate with a base around us 50 so right now they will be doing rather well also it is not only oil these days meanwhile u s natural gas output was projected to increase to a record 77 9 billion cubic feet per day bcfd in march that would be up more than 0 8 bcfd over the february forecast and mark the 14th consecutive monthly increase gas production was about 65 5 bcfd in march last year reinforcing my view that this area has a different business model to the ordinary was this from reuters earlier this month spot prices at the waha hub fell to minus 3 38 per million british thermal units for wednesday from minus 2 cents for tuesday according to data from the intercontinental exchange ice that easily beat the prior all time next day low of minus 1 99 for march 29 prices have been negative in the real time or next day market since march 22 meaning drillers have had to pay those with pipeline capacity to take the gas so we have negative gas prices to go with negative interest rates bond yields and profits for companies listing on the stock exchange as we mull what will go negative next economic impact on texas we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us back in 2015 dr ray perlman looked at the impact of a lower oil price below us 50 would have on texas to put the situation in perspective based on the current situation i am projecting that oil prices will likely lead to a loss of 150 000 175 000 texas jobs next year when all factors and multiplier effects are considered overall job growth in the state would be diminished but not eliminated texas gained over 400 000 jobs last year and i am estimating that the rate of growth will slow to something in the 200 000 225 000 per year range moving wider a higher oil price benefits us gdp directly via next exports and economic output or gdp and the reverse from a lower one we do get something if a j curve style effect as the adverse impact on consumers via real wages and business budgets will come in with a lag the world the situation here is covered to some extent by this from the financial times in currency markets the norwegian krone and canadian dollar both rose against the us dollar as currencies of oil exporting countries gained there is a deeper impact in the middle east as for example there has been a lot of doubt about the finances of saudi arabia for example this led to the recent aramco bond issue us 12 billion which can be seen as finance for the country although ironically dollars are now flowing into saudi as fast as it pumps its oil out the stereotype these days for the other side of the coin is india and the economic times pretty much explained why a week ago a late surge in oil prices is expected to increase india s oil import bill to its five year high as per estimates india could close 2018 19 with crude import bill shooting to 115 billion a growth of 30 per cent over 2017 18 s 88 billion this adds to india s import bill and reduces gdp although it also adds to inflationary pressure and also perhaps pressure on the reserve bank of india which has cut interest rates twice this year already the european example is france which according to the eia imports some 55 million tonnes of oil and net around 43 billion cubic meters of natural gas it does offset this to some extent by exporting electricity from its heavy investment in nuclear power and that is around 64 terawatt hours the nuclear link is clear for energy importers as i note plans in the news for india to build another 12 comment there are many ways of looking at this so let s start with central banks as i have hinted at with india they used to respond to a higher oil price with higher interest rates to combat inflation but now mostly respond to expected lower aggregate demand and gdp with interest rate cuts they rarely get challenged on this u turn as we listen to kylie i m spinning around move outta my way i know you re feeling me cause you like it like this i m breaking it down i m not the same i know you re feeling me cause you like it like this next comes the way we have become less oil energy dependent one way that has happened has been through higher efficiency such as led light bulbs replacing incandescent ones another has been the growth of alternative sources for electricity production as right now in my home country the uk it is solar 10 wind 15 biomass 8 and nukes 18 helping out i do not know what the wind will do but solar will of course rise although its problems are highlighted by the fact it falls back to zero at night as we continue to lack any real storage capacity also such moves have driven prices higher as to what s next well i think that there is some hope on two counts firstly president trump will want the oil price lower for the us economy and the 2020 election so he may grow tired of pressurising iran and on the other side of the coin the military industrial complex may be able to persuade saudi arabia to up its output also we know what the headlines below usually mean gm all we have hit the 100 oil headlines this looks familiar pic twitter com 2rlmssxjjj 𝕮𝖍𝖎 chigrl april 16 2019 podcast
by john rubino after raising interest rates and getting slapped around by the markets last year the fed now appears to accept that future monetary policy can only be easy even at the cost of ever larger and more destabilizing financial bubbles on one hand this is a truly epochal change on the other hand it s just a recognition of the new normal in which central banks have already lost control from bloomberg some federal reserve policy makers seem resigned to running a heightened risk of asset bubbles and other financial excesses as they seek to keep the economic expansion going that s one of the messages tucked inside the minutes of the federal open market committee s march 19 20 policy making meeting a few participants observed that the appropriate path for policy insofar as it implied lower interest rates for longer periods of time could lead to greater financial stability risks according to the minutes published april 10 chairman jerome powell could be one of those officials he s publicly pointed out that the last two expansions ended not in a burst of inflation but in financial froth first a dot com stock market boom then a housing bubble a willingness by the fed to court such perils by holding rates down should be good for the economy for a while after all the aim of such a policy would be to sustain growth at a healthy enough clip to meet the fed s twin goals of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation but that monetary stance could store up trouble down the road should the financial threats materialize easy financial conditions today are good news for downside risks in the short term but they re bad news in the medium term senior international monetary fund official tobias adrian told a boston fed conference last year in economists parlance here s the fed s dilemma r star the neutral interest rate that stabilizes the economy when it s meeting the fed s goals may be so low that it also prompts super risky behavior by investors behind the fall in r star an aging population and slower productivity growth that has boosted savings and depressed investment in an article last august bloomberg coined the term fast star for the interest rate that s consistent with ensuring financial stability a rate too far below that level leads to excesses in the financial system a setting much above it stifles risk taking and obliterates the animal spirits that drive economic growth the trouble is that fast star may be higher than r star as suggested by the minutes the fed has put policy on hold this year after lifting short term rates to 2 25 percent to 2 5 percent in december within the range it considers neutral for the economy the dovish shift helped ignite a huge rally in the stock market with the s p 500 index up 16 percent in 2019 but it failed to satisfy president donald trump who s vociferously complained that the fed s rate increases have held back the economy and the stock market and who s urged the central bank to open up the monetary spigots to boost both a couple of policy makers at last month s fomc meeting said that any financial stability risks arising from low rates could be addressed by counter cyclical macro prudential policy tools and other regulatory and supervisory measures according to the minutes the problem is that the u s has a limited set of such tools as fed vice chairman for supervision randal quarles acknowledged in a march 29 speech in new york at times last year fed policy makers sounded open to using higher interest rates to lean against potentially over exuberant financial markets said jonathan wright a professor at johns hopkins university and a former fed economist case in point new york fed president john williams said in october that the central bank s rate increases would help reduce risk taking in financial markets though he added that was not their principal purpose backed off such talk has since faded there doesn t seem to be the same idea of having tighter monetary policy so as to lessen the risk of asset bubbles developing wright said
historically speaking a normal fed tightening cycles consist of raising the fed funds rate ffr by 350 425bps it is at that point that the yield curve usually inverts thus disincentivizing future lending and closing down the credit conduit at that point the fed backs off from future rate hikes then about a year later a stock market meltdown begins and six months after that a recession ensues during this current cycle the fed open market committee fomc has raised rates by just 250bps before turning dovish therefore wall street takes solace in the view that this time around the fed stopped in time before it killed the business cycle however that 250bps of hiking is before you factor in the end of quantitative easing qe and the current quantitative tightening program qt which is still an ongoing process and won t end until september when you factor in the tightening that occurred when the fed ended qe in october of 2014 which amounted to 85b per month of newly printed money at its peak and added a total of 3 7 trillion to the fed s balance sheet the actual amount of tightening from ending qe is probably close to 300bps and the qt from the fed will end up draining nearly 1 trillion from its balance sheet and reached 40 50 billion per month at its peak a reduction in the fed s balance sheet of anything close to 1 trillion is completely unprecedented and amounted to a tremendous drain on liquidity nobody knows exactly the amount of rate hikes this equates to but it most likely added another 75bps of monetary tightening société générale calculates that the shadow fed s fund rate dropped to three percent and therefore the amount of rate hikes to date have been 525 550bps 300bps more than the stated ffr of 2 25 2 5 percent but that is before you add in the fed s qt program therefore when you add it all up you get the equivalent of 600 625bps of rate hikes in this current tightening cycle well above the high end of the historical range where the business cycle turns towards recession my friend and director of the national economic council larry kudlow recently stated that interest rates might not rise again in his lifetime he is 71 years old and i hope he lives for a very long time but you get the point larry believes interest rates won t rise for decades to come vice president mike pence said in an interview with cnbc that the fed should cut interest rates by 50bps and agrees with president trump about ending the qt program immediately pence also said this there s no evidence of inflation in this economy ok mr vp you don t have to be sherlock holmes to discover the evidence home prices have jumped 48 percent in the past six years all forms of insurance coverage have skyrocketed and college tuition has been rising 8x faster than wages but even if he took the time to view the manipulated government data on cpi and ppi he d see consumer prices are up 1 9 percent year year and producer prices have risen 2 2 percent year year related is a gold breakout near nevertheless president trump is pushing for a return to qe and he may find out that he has more friends on the fed than he currently believes chicago fed president charles evans had this pithy bit of wisdom regarding how he views his responsibility to protect the purchasing power of the dollar inflation is weaker than i would like he said recently on a tv interview as to why more inflation would help grow the economy these lovers of counterfeiting can never clearly articulate with the ffr hovering at less than half its historical level and the fed s balance sheet at 4 trillion one would hope the government would think the last thing this economy needs is to cast more doubt on the faith in the us dollar s purchasing power inflation pushes the middle class further and faster along its inexorable path towards extinction to add to this distorted view our president recently tweeted that the dow would be 5 10k points higher if the fed had not engaged in qt one also has to wonder how much more unhinged the president wants the stock market to become in relation to the underlying economy after all the total market cap of equities now stands at an incredible and dangerous 1 5 times gdp the danger to the entire economy emanating from the inevitable crash from such lofty heights is growing exponentially meanwhile the debt dung pile in chinese debt just got a whole lot deeper again i don t blame the great people of china but rather its government for this the march total debt number was 80 percent higher than the year ago figure and the ytd debt increase was 40 percent higher than the year ago period aggregate financing in the first quarter amounted to 8 18 trillion yuan us 1 2 trillion which was an increase of 2 34 trillion yuan year year as to how wall street believes adding to china s debt at this point can be a viable and sustainable plan is inconceivable after all china s debt has already quadrupled in the past seven years so it is not as if beijing has not tried this stimulus trick before the government has indeed levered up many times before in a big way and has produced a more unstable and unhealthy economy with each iteration turning to the us our march fiscal year to date deficit came in at 691 billion that is for just the 1st half or the fiscal year so governments around the world have unbelievably and inconceivably taken fiscal and monetary madness a giant leap further and deeper into the depths of inescapable insolvency is it any wonder why stock prices are rallying there has been an absolute deluge of promises from global governments since the market collapse of q4 2018 that there will be more free money on offer even though they are fully aware that taking on more debt at this point guarantees the future will be beyond bleak for now the economy walks a very thin line along the cliff s edge unless you believe central banks can stay at the 0 bound interest rate range forever and never cause a reduction in a currency s purchasing power intractable inflation is inevitable once achieved it will produce an interest rate surge from all time lows that will engender an equally disastrous plunge in asset prices any fixed income instrument and equity that the government is not actively purchasing will crash in price this is exactly what occurred in october of 1987 where the dow lost 23 percent of its value in one day but unfortunately the carnage should be much worse than 1987 given the relative level of debt and overvaluation of equities that exists today the number and dollar amount of business defaults occurring as a result of such a meltdown should be unprecedented there is a real danger the economy will contract into a depression given the record level of debt it is lugging along the us carries total debt that is worth 350 percent of gdp which is the same pre great recession level this figure was 160 percent of gdp in 1980 and just over 200 percent in 1987 but this time around central banks have little to no room left to reduce borrowing costs and spur on new lending on the other hand a recession could begin even before inflation runs intractable the global economy is already slowing and earnings growth has slowed to a negative level if the amount of fed tightening i estimated earlier is anywhere near correct the business cycle should soon turn south following a stock market peak and crash that is only a few quarters away the massive re leveraging in china has served to hold off the carnage a bit longer but beijing now risks a crash in the yuan if you are investing in this market it is necessary to try and eke out any gains left and do so using a data and math driven model that is built to identify when to head for the nearest emergency exit well ahead of time to ensure you

washington s decision not to extend sanctions waivers to countries importing iranian oil puts new delhi in a tough spot the move forces india to either cut its oil imports from iran or risk exposure to us sanctions the united states on monday said it will not extend sanctions exemptions to countries importing oil from iran when they expire in early may it means countries and companies trading with iran without washington s consent risk us sanctions and getting cut off from the american financial system washington had reimposed sanctions on iran in november last year after president donald trump pulled the us out of the landmark nuclear deal struck between iran and six global powers but the us had granted waivers known as significant reduction exceptions sre which allowed india and seven other countries to continue importing a reduced quantity of iranian oil for six months ending may 1 read more india tests us sanctions with purchase of russian arms iranian oil at the time the us said it would temporarily allow eight importers to keep buying iranian oil and that it would expect them to keep cutting iranian imports in the months ahead us secretary of state mike pompeo said then that the temporary waiver was because the countries have demonstrated significant reductions in their crude oil and cooperation on many other fronts and have made important moves towards getting to zero crude oil importation from iran the us move now to scrap waivers is intended to bring iran s oil exports to zero and deny tehran its main source of foreign revenue iran s exports of crude in march totaled about 1 3 million barrels a day data compiled by bloomberg show shipments already came down from as high as 2 5 million barrels daily in april last year high reliance india is one of the countries likely to be the hardest hit by the us decision india is the world s third biggest oil consumer but its energy needs are primarily met through imports the south asian nation imports almost 80 of its oil requirements and iran is its third largest supplier contributing over 11 of its crude oil demand in the fiscal year 2018 19 india imported about 23 5 million tons of iranian oil still refiners in india iran s top oil client after china had almost halved their iranian oil purchases since november when petroleum sanctions came into force while it s not impossible to find other sources of oil observers say it would raise costs and potentially strain india s partnership with iran india s imports of iranian oil come with attractive terms including 60 day credit and low freight and insurance costs say analysts and new delhi might find it tough to find an alternative supplier at such competitive terms also the trump administration s move prompted a spike in global oil prices which hit their highest since november on tuesday after washington s announcement on iran waivers an increase in oil prices is likely to put pressure on india s fiscal and current account as well as drive up inflation india is the world s third biggest oil consumer but its energy needs are primarily met through imports image getty images newsmakers c hondros robust plan although indian foreign minister sushma swaraj last year said india follows only un sanctions and not unilateral sanctions by any country local media reports suggest that india will stop importing crude oil from iran and will try to find alternative sources to make up for the lost volumes until the waivers are not restored back i don t think india can buy oil from iran we will stop importing oil from iran a top official was quoted by indian business daily livemint as saying india s petroleum ministry also issued a statement assuring of a robust oil import plan starting from may the government of india has put in place a robust plan to ensure that there is adequate supply of crude oil to indian oil refineries from may 2019 onwards there will be additional supplies from other major oil producing countries from different parts of the world the ministry said in a statement on tuesday the indian refineries are fully prepared without any problem to meet the national demand for petrol diesel and other petroleum products in the country the ministry added india s petroleum and natural gas minister dharmendra pradhan tweeted on tuesday saying that the country will get additional supplies from other major oil producing countries to compensate for the loss of iranian oil following the us decision india may try to increase its supplies of oil from countries like saudi arabia and the united arab emirates reuters last week reported that indian refiners are increasing their planned purchases from the nations of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec mexico and the united states to hedge against loss of iranian oil close strategic ties but despite the threat of sanctions india is unlikely to put a total stop to iranian oil imports say energy analysts new delhi will cut imports substantially but probably maintain approximately 100 000 bpd of iranian imports paid for using a rupee payment system this is less an energy security decision than a political one cnbc quoted analysts at eurasia group as saying the last time sanctions were in place india used a rupee payment mechanism for importing iranian oil part of the rupee payment was used by tehran for purchasing food drugs and chemicals from india but most of it was transferred to the islamic republic after the sanctions were lifted read more can india challenge china with new iranian chabahar port the trump administration s move also poses a strategic challenge for new delhi as iran and india share close political and cultural relations ties between the two sides encompass a wide range of sectors including energy infrastructure and regional connectivity projects among others there is a strategic imperative that drives india iran relations said smruti pattanaik a research fellow at idsa in new delhi new delhi is strategically tied to tehran with its investment in iran s chabahar port which gives india a sea land access not only to landlocked afghanistan but also to other central asian states

the rising oil price the us had already imposed sanctions on iran but until this week it had granted waivers to allow certain countries to continue to import iranian oil without fear of american disapproval that s no longer the case the waivers will be removed at the end of the month after that countries who continue to import oil from iran could also face us sanctions what kind of effect might that have on the market well during the past five months notes the ft iran has managed to export anything between one million and 1 9 million barrels of oil a day according to various expert analyses it s not saudi levels but it is significant most of that oil has gone to india china south korea japan and turkey china is likely to tell the us to sling its hook and carry on importing and some or all of the others may well think about doing the same but there s no doubt that this will make it harder for iran to produce and export its oil the us says that it has already got this covered saudi arabia and the united arab emirates are going to pump more to cover the gap given that saudi arabia has been holding back on production with the aim of propping up prices the spare capacity is certainly there on the other hand iran isn t the only country where supply is under threat venezuela is being hit both by sanctions and by economic collapse the latter predates the former by the way regardless of what regime shills try to tell you and you ve got nigeria and libya both of which are vulnerable to conflict equally there s no guarantee that saudi arabia will step up on the one hand it will relish the chance to poach its arch rival s customers on the other hand keeping oil prices high is very tempting too why donald trump won t be happy about rising oil prices now we can see why the us might be keen to keep oil prices down the average price of petrol in the us is now at its highest since october last year and as the financial times points out it only needs to rise by another few cents to hit a five year high that is not something that trump will be happy about voters care about the economy the good news is that as long as their personal situation seems broadly stable ie they have jobs and somewhere to live they won t worry too much about the big picture anxieties like the national debt however there are a couple of key measures which vary from country to country that as a rule of thumb will worry them and the bad news as a politician is that you have little direct control over them in the uk the two prices that people care about are house prices and petrol prices one is a measure of personal wealth and the other is a measure of how much pressure is on your income for the us the wealth measure is different voters care about the level of the s p 500 rather than house prices that s because more americans have money in the stockmarket or aspire to incidentally this is why the central bank and government in the us act to prop up the stockmarket whereas in the uk the central bank and the government act to prop up the housing market but as far as income goes the measure in the us is the same people care about how much it costs to fill up their cars and in the us it s a much bigger deal when the oil price rises that s because tax on petrol in the us is relatively low so any rise in the oil price results in a much bigger move in the price at the pump given that there s an election coming up in 2020 trump won t want record high oil prices and therefore high petrol prices rattling the voters it doesn t help that voters in pro trump states tend to spend more of their income on petrol trump can t suppress the oil price and nor can anyone else but can he do much to prevent this absolutely not beyond the occasional strategic release from america s oil emergency reserves there s not a lot any president can do to manipulate the oil price that said the ability of oil cartel opec to fiddle with oil prices is also over exaggerated the reality is as i ve pointed out before that moves in oil prices are often as much a function of the market s risk appetite as a result of moves in the balance of supply and demand put simply when the market is in risk on mode which it clearly is now what with larry fink at blackrock talking about a pending stockmarket melt up the oil price tends to go up and given that the melt up probably won t end until it reaches a point where the exuberance exhausts itself or fear of inflation and rising federal reserve interest rates returns i suspect that the path of least resistance for oil will be higher i wouldn t bet on the oil price directly too many ups and downs too much hassle but if you re hanging on to oil producers in the face of all this sustainable investment talk keep hanging in there they have a

increase of 65 18 3 million from q4 2018 oil royalty revenue of 28 0 million on oil volumes of 9 163 bbls per day the slightly lower oil royalty production volumes were a result of the impact of curtailments a measured approach by producers in both bringing back shut in volumes and putting new wells on stream and lower industry capital spending both crude oil royalty production and realized pricing increased from q1 2018 crude oil volumes of 8 731 bbls per day and revenue of 44 3 million natural gas royalty revenue of 11 1 million was up 26 from 8 8 million in q4 2018 and up 5 from q1 2018 royalty revenue of 10 6 million as improved aeco pricing more than offset natural gas production volumes that were 10 lower than q4 2018 and 15 lower compared to q1 2018 natural gas royalty production volumes of 63 1 mmcf per day were negatively impacted by the extended extreme cold in february and march which caused freeze offs and other weather related downtime as well as limited natural gas drilling activity in 2018 ngl royalty production volumes of 2 586 bbls per day in q1 2019 were in line with q4 2018 royalty volumes of 2 676 bbls per day and contributed 9 1 million of royalty revenue an increase of 63 over q4 2018 ngl royalty revenues of 5 6 million ngl royalty production increased 8 from q1 2018 ngl royalty volumes of 2 388 bbls per day while ngl royalty revenue remained relatively flat with q1 2018 ngl royalty revenue of 9 2 million other revenue in the quarter totaled 6 7 million an increase of 76 from q1 2018 and included 2 3 million of lease rentals 2 4 million in other income and 2 0 million in bonus consideration from entering 27 new leases with 24 different counterparties leasing was focused on crude oil targets across a number of plays in both alberta and saskatchewan there were 209 wells 93 oil spud on prairiesky lands during the quarter which was slightly ahead of q1 2018 when 198 wells 93 oil were spud there were 70 wells spud on fee lands q1 2018 79 wells 73 wells spud on gorr lands q1 2018 91 wells and 66 wells spud on unitized lands q1 2018 28 wells the average royalty rate of wells spud in the quarter was approximately 5 8 down from q1 2018 when the average net royalty rate was 7 1 this is primarily due to increased drilling on numerous oil units where prairiesky has a royalty interest wells spud included 110 viking wells in alberta and saskatchewan 15 clearwater wells and 12 east shale duvernay wells other heavy and light oil activity targeted a number of different plays including the mannville and mississippian

document is expressly qualified by this cautionary statement conversions of natural gas to boe to provide a single unit of production for analytical purposes natural gas production and reserves volumes are converted mathematically to equivalent barrels of oil boe prairiesky uses the industry accepted standard conversion of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil 6 mcf 1 bbl the 6 1 boe ratio is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip it does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead and is not based on either energy content or current prices while the boe ratio is useful for comparative measures and observing trends it does not accurately reflect individual product values and might be misleading particularly if used in isolation as well given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil to natural gas is significantly different from the 6 1 energy equivalency ratio using a 6 1 conversion ratio may be misleading as an indication of value non gaap measures certain measures in this document do not have any standardized meaning as prescribed by international financial reporting standards ifrs and therefore are considered non gaap measures these measures may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers these measures are commonly used in the crude oil and natural gas industry and by prairiesky to provide potential investors with additional information regarding the company s liquidity and its ability to generate funds to conduct its business non gaap

pundits and politicians repeatedly warn us that the country cannot afford costly social services they caution about the perils of a rising national debt the supposed near bankruptcy of medicare and social security and the need to sell public services to the highest bidder in order to save them we must tighten our belts sooner or later they tell us rather than spend on social goods like universal health care free higher education and badly needed infrastructure to many americans this sounds all too true because they are having an incredibly tough time making ends meet according to the federal reserve four in 10 adults in 2017 would either borrow sell something or not be able pay if faced with a 400 emergency expense to those who are so highly stressed financially the idea of paying for a costly program like medicare for all sounds impossible we are the richest country in the history of the world however and certainly could afford vastly expanded and improved vital public services if we had the will what stands in the way is runaway inequality our nation s wealth has been hijacked by the super rich with plenty of aid from their paid for politicians over the past 40 years the top fraction of the top one percent have systematically denied working people the fruits of their enormous productivity the results of this wage theft can be seen clearly in the chart below which tracks productivity output per hour of labor and average weekly wages after accounting for inflation of non supervisory and production workers about 85 percent of the workforce the red line shows the rise of american productivity since wwii while not a perfect measurement of the power of our economy it does capture our overall level of knowledge technical skills worker effort management systems and technology ever rising productivity is the key to the wealth of nations as we can see clearly the productivity trend has been ever upward today the average worker is nearly three times as productive per hour of labor as he or she was at the end of wwii and the workforce is more than three times as large that means we are a colossal economic powerhouse but unless you are an economic elite it doesn t feel that way to understand why we need to look at the blue line average real worker wages from wwii to the late 1970s or so as productivity rose so did the average real wage of nearly all american workers year by year most working people saw their standard of living rise for every one percent increase in productivity about two thirds went to labor and the remaining one third went to capital investment and profits after the late 1970s however the story changes dramatically real wages stall for more than 40 years while productivity continues to climb had wages and productivity continued to rise in tandem the average weekly earnings of the american worker would be almost double what it is today rising from today s average of 746 per week to 1 377 per week what happened where did all the money go that once went to working people the fatalistic story sold to us by elite funded think tanks is that the rise of international competition and the introduction of advanced technology crushed the wages of those without the highest skill levels the typical worker it is claimed is now competing with cheap labor from around the world and hence sees his or her wages stall and even decline and since there really isn t much anyone can do about globalization or automation there s nothing we can do about the stalling wages such a convenient story to justify runaway inequality the real story is far more complex and troubling yes globalization and automation contribute to stagnant wages but as the international labor organization shows in their remarkable 2012 study only about 30 percent of this wage stagnation can be attributed to technology and globalization the main cause is the neo liberal policy agenda of deregulation of finance cuts in social spending and attacks on labor unions and within that mix the biggest driver of wage stagnation can be attributed to financialization the deregulation of wall street which permitted for the first time since the great depression the rapacious financial strip mining of workers students families and communities put simply the neo liberal model ushered in by thatcher and reagan and then intensified by clinton and blair moved the wealth that once flowed to working people to financial and corporate elites for a more thorough account see professor william lazonick s profits without prosperity how much money are we losing more than we can imagine here s a back of the envelope estimate for just the most recent year on the chart 2017 the gap between the productivity wage and the current average wage is 631 per week that is if the average weekly wage continued to rise with productivity it would be 631 higher than the current average wage in 2017 there are 103 million of these workers so the total amount of lost wages that flowed to economic elites is a whopping 3 4 trillion 103 million x 631 x 52 weeks and that s just for one year here s how to pay for medicare for all current estimates for a single payer system come in at about 3 trillion per year americans already are paying 1 9 trillion in payroll and income taxes that go to medicare medicaid and other government health programs so we would need to raise another 1 1 trillion to provide universal healthcare and prescription drugs with no co pays no deductibles and no premiums in the name of fairness that additional 1 1 trillion to pay for medicare for all should be raised by taxing back a portion of the 3 4 trillion in wealth that has flowed to the super rich instead of to working people after all working people have not had a real wage increase in more than forty years as economic elites have siphoned away tens of trillions of dollars of income that once went to working people the gap between the two lines wouldn t it be more than fair to ask the superrich to pay the 1 1 trillion needed for medicare for all there are numerous ways for these economic elites pay their fair share financial transaction tax on stock bond and derivative transactions wealth tax on those with over 50 million in wealth minimum corporate tax of 35 percent on all corporations with over 100 million in profits who now pay little or nothing like amazon did this past year raise the marginal tax bracket to 70 on all income over 10 million per year increase the inheritance tax on the super rich to prevent the creation of a permanent oligarchy and so on the point is to give americans what they have been long denied high quality universal healthcare and a real wage increase by providing medicare for all with no co pays no deductibles and no premiums think about how much your income would go up if you didn t have to pay for healthcare at all that would begin to close the gap between productivity and wages for the first time in a generation wait shouldn t working people pay something for health care coverage we already are we pay payroll taxes for medicare and a portion of our regular taxes go to fund medicaid and other public health programs for veterans native americans and public health related research and regulation so next time you hear someone say we can t afford a public good that we need to tighten our belts and get used to austerity think about all that wealth that has flowed to the very top think about that big fat gap between productivity and real wages think about how runaway inequality has allowed the wealth of the richest nation in history to be hijacked by the super rich it s time the american people got a real wage increase and medicare for all would deliver just that

consistent actuarial methodology to estimate centene s ultimate liability any reduction in the incurred related to prior period amount may be offset as centene actuarially determines incurred related to current period as such only in the absence of a consistent reserving methodology would favorable development of prior period claims liability estimates reduce medical costs centene believes it has consistently applied its claims reserving methodology additionally approximately 46 million was recorded as a decrease to premium revenues resulting from development within incurred related to prior period due to minimum hbr and other return of premium programs the amount of the incurred related to prior period above represents favorable development and includes the effects of reserving under

question everyone has a chart of the german dax postwar i have never seen a chart of the german stock market before the war do you have any hvs answer yes however you must understand that because the world was on a gold standard the arbitrage volatility was reflected in the bond and share markets when the currency was fixed this is why the german share market closed in august 1914 along with just about everyone else here is a chart that show the performance of the german share market during the hyperinflation period we have the dax also extended back in time but don t forget the dax is a total return index if we plot just price you will see that the german share market looks very much like france the primary stock exchange in germany was in berlin however there were 21 exchanges in total the origins of the frankfurt stock exchange date back to medieval trade fairs during the 11th century by the 16th century frankfurt developed into a wealthy and busy city with an economy based on trade and financial services annuities in particular were the hot items back then it was in 1585 when the bourse was established to trade in fixed currency exchange rates currencies actually led to exchanges rather than shares eventually frankfurt developed into an early share market competing with london and paris mayer amschel rothschild and max warburg became very influential in the financial trade of frankfurt the frankfurt stock exchange had been a major international center it was completely wiped out by world war i and its consequences back then foreign shares and bonds traded on cross exchanges since money was fixed german investors at the start of world war i dumped foreign bonds and shares fearing that their capital would be restricted or confiscated this is also why all the exchanges simply closed in europe any capital they managed to free up from the sale of foreign investments was reinvested mostly in german government bonds they were patriotic and believed in their government however by the end of the war the frankfurt stock exchange lost all foreign securities listings for bonds or shares frankfurt lost its standing as an international stock exchange entirely and that would only begin to resurface in 1949 in europe the fear of catastrophic declines in stock prices was met with controls at first overall stocks and bonds were not allowed to trade below the price they had been trading at on july 31 1914 restrictions were also placed on capital money movement was highly restricted to preventing any large outflows of capital forcing many into black markets one means was to buy collector stamps and coins they would then export especially rare stamps and then sell them in america after two world wars most of the rare stamps happened to be in america and gradually returned to europe during the late 1960s with these restrictions in place markets reopened in europe the london times began printing stock prices for london and bordeaux on september 19th and for paris on december 8 1914 in january 1915 all shares were allowed to trade on the london stock exchange though with price restrictions the st petersburg exchange reopened in 1917 only to close two months later due to the russian revolution the berlin stock exchange did not reopen until december 1917 the loss of the war meant those who had invested in german bonds suffered the same fate as those americans who invested in confederate bonds indeed to fund world war i germany relied more on raising money by selling bonds than imposing taxes this had the net effect of wiping out the savings of the middle class and upper class during the hyperinflation going into 1923 the losses in bonds were devastating but in contrast equities became a prized object among speculative investors the frankfurt stock exchange saw unprecedented losses in the bond markets and shares became the speculation objects that rose sharply going into 1923 the german war costs covered by taxation including state and federal combined was only 13 9 which was lower than 18 2 taxation imposed in great britain for the war effort german debt exploded after 1916 that is when the federal government s short term floating debt grew relentlessly and by the end of the war it accounted for nearly one third of the german national debt the seriousness of the german debt crisis which led to the postwar hyperinflation was the fact that after 1916 german banks began to purchase more of the government s floating debt government debt dominated the market and banks took on more public debt than private when the public debt was marginalized by hyperinflation it also wiped out the banking system by the end of the war the international contacts of the frankfurt stock exchange had been lost inflation set in and reached its first peak in 1923 in october 1929 the germany stock exchange prices crashed dramatically on the 25th the world economic crisis ruled the following years the economy only began to stabilize in 1932 the following year the nazis took over and centralized the nation s economic policy the frankfurt stock exchange was merged with the mannheim stock exchange and the number of exchanges nationwide was reduced from 21 to nine under the stringent nazi economic regime free trade was suffocated as hitler defaulted on external debt the majority of capital assets was directed to benefit the war economy he even issued conversion fund certificates that were exchanged one for one with german marks if you sought to leave the country this was part of the currency controls but they were worthless once you left the country
central bank independence is increasingly at risk around the world in the us president donald trump said he may nominate two close political allies to the federal reserve following months of criticism over the bank s interest rate policy in italy the government proposed seizing control of banca italia s approximately us 100 billion in gold reserves which it reportedly would use to fund spending plans and has threatened the central bank s independence in other ways they re not alone governments and lawmakers in turkey the uk india and elsewhere have been steadily eroding the bedrock idea that a central bank should be left alone to manage the economy based on evidence and data not political goals this is motivating numerous commentators to write farewell notes for the concept of central bank independence i agree with their concern and find government interference deeply troubling that s because a large body of economic research makes it quite clear placing monetary policy into the hands of an independent central banker who bases decisions on evidence and data instead of populist ideals leads to lower inflation and greater economic stability key ingredients of a strong economy and as i know from research i ve done with a variety of colleagues political meddling comes with a hefty price tag while it is incredibly hard to build a sound central bank that is trusted by investors and citizens it is even harder to do so after its credibility has been corroded the promise of easy credit there s a reason politicians like to gain control over a central bank it s a powerful institution that literally supplies constituents with cheap money via lower interest rates creating jobs and boosting growth in the process at least in the short term to underscore the kind of weaponry central banks bring to bear economists and journalists use the term bazooka to describe their firepower and with populists taking power across the globe on promises of endless economic prosperity governments are tempted to use this bazooka to help meet them lowering interest rates is one such weapon another is the ability to essentially create money out of thin air even though technically central banks don t print cash this can help governments fill budget shortfalls and fund new spending programs presumably in the hope of more votes on election day economists call the ability to withstand such political pressures and steer the financial side of an economy in a consistent manner monetary credibility attempts to manipulate interest rates or to regain control over monetary policy for political gain is effectively undermining this credibility the price of political meddling a few historical examples show what can happen when a government meddles with a central bank in 1971 us president richard nixon successfully pressured federal reserve chair arthur burns to lower interest rates which juiced up the economy and helped him win reelection the following year americans paid dearly for nixon s victory however as the low interest rates helped fuel double digit inflation throughout most of the 1970s and hurt the value of the us dollar the fed s efforts to fight these rising prices with higher interest rates resulted in two recessions political interference in monetary policymaking can have even worse effects in countries that rely heavily on international investors to fund governments and the private sector hungary s decision to revoke its central bank s independence in 2011 prompted credit rating agencies to downgrade the country s debt to junk status this caused the currency to fall to record lows drove the economy into recession and pushed the country to the brink of default in argentina almost a third of its citizens are in poverty thanks in part to out of control inflation a problem decades of central bank meddling largely caused and it doesn t take actual interference to have disastrous consequences in his attempt to mobilize popular pressure for lower interest rates president recep tayyip erdogan has repeatedly attacked the bank of turkey and called interest rates the mother of all evil although the bank has resisted bending to his will the turkish lira and the country s financial markets have been on a roller coaster ride causing economic turmoil credibility lost is hard to recover undoing the consequences of political meddling and restoring faith in a central bank and the country s currency often requires a lot of short term pain primarily this takes the guise of rising interest rates even if the economy is in trouble this is a sure recipe for recession former fed chair paul volcker attempted to bring inflation down in the 1980s photo credit reuters andy mueller that s what happened in the 1980s as then fed chair paul volcker tried to restore the bank s credibility and bring inflation under control the fed raised rates to a record 20 in the process pushing the u s economy into recession twice the bank of turkey has hiked interest rates to 24 in attempts to fend off further rounds of speculative attacks on the lira and hang on to its credibility the economy is suffering as a result and in argentina although the current government says it believes in central bank independence banco central de la república argentina continues to struggle with the legacy of rampant inflation with only sky high interest rates likely to put it in check more economic pain is likely the experiences of central and eastern europe after the fall of the berlin wall are further testimony of this long and often painful road to monetary credibility something today s populist movements might want to bear in mind put bluntly political meddling with central banks is an incredibly bad and dangerous

the world s central banks have spent much of the past 30 years telling us that inflation was bad and that they would not sacrifice their credibility by allowing the beast they had slain to come back to life in the 1970s surging oil prices helped push inflation higher ushering in a new breed of politicians like margaret thatcher and ronald reagan who once described inflation as being as violent as a mugger as frightening as an armed robber and as deadly as a hitman central banks abandoned a focus on exchange rates and attacked inflation they fell in line from the 1990s on to adopt an inflation target of 2 by the mid 1990s the wall street journal proclaimed the triumph of a new economy not only was inflation on a firm leash but the business cycle was dead of course all of this came crashing down in 2008 2012 as the financial crisis pushed countries into the deepest recession seen since the 1930s and some ireland included came close to collapse with the world still wedded to the fiscal policies of reagan and thatcher which were additionally wrapped up in the stability and growth pact in the eu it was left to the federal reserve european central bank bank of japan and bank of england to prevent a re run of depression era mass unemployment by and large they succeeded and across much of the developed world there has been a steady slow burn economic expansion what hasn t happened is a sustained return to the path predicted by economic theory that growth would lead to more employment and eventually to rising inflation which would indicate that the recovery was complete and that we could return to the certainties of the pre crisis era what appears to have happened is that economic policymakers across the world congratulated themselves for slaying inflation in the 1980s and 1990s when in fact there were other factors at work during that period china emerged onto the global stage its exports to the us have risen 500 fold since 2001 when it joined the world trade organisation and the price of making things like the smartphones and computers we all use has fallen sharply there are other long term factors driving inflation lower and none of them have anything to do with the success of central bank policy from the likes of the german bundesbank whose anti inflation playbook was written into that of the european central bank when it was set up while china became the workshop of the world wealthier nations were ageing rapidly and the arrival of natural gas as a fuel meant we were less vulnerable to oil 1970s style oil shocks as industry became much more energy efficient central banks are of course full of smart economists who know all of this but that hasn t changed their thinking or the way in which they frame the world s economic problems their concern is that without a sustained rise in inflation they will not be able to cut interest rates as far as might be needed in the next economic shock in the case of the federal reserve rates have been cut by 4 5 points in a recession something that would require a shift to substantially negative interest rates if it were needed as the current fed benchmark is 2 5 if things are bad for the fed they are worse for the ecb whose main rate sits at zero pity then the bank of japan which has been in the business of zero rates and economic pump priming for 20 years without any pickup the range of answers coming from policymakers on how to deal with the current problems are all framed in the ideas of 30 plus years ago and in the mantra of independent central banks which were supposed to pursue policy outside the political maelstrom and electoral cycle some of the suggestions on offer from economists and central bankers include raising the inflation target from 2 to say 4 which would in the view of john williams the head of the new york federal reserve give them more room to cut interest rates there s one glaring problem no one is quite sure how they arrived at the idea of the 2 inflation target which spread like flu across the world of central banking from new zealand to the mighty fed which only got round to having an inflation target in 2012 when the financial crisis had hit the only explanation of why they agreed on 2 was that it would mean a doubling of prices every 35 years something that consumers would barely notice that begs the question of how 4 would make things better given that they really meant about 2 it is just that the age old question of economic management which is basically how to avoid a train wreck likely needs a new answer as inflation targeting monetary policy has gone the way of exchange rate management the gold standard and all the other old gods of central banking in the words of economist tony yates all the central banks were doing when they started targeting inflation was the only thing they had not yet tried and failed at simply fiddling with the justifications for a policy that has now clearly reached its limits and may in fact be doing harm for example by increasing inequality by pushing up stock markets and house prices which benefit the rich perhaps it is now time to kick the tyres on fiscal policy the use of which has been outlawed by tough rules and penalties in europe or to look at the idea that central banks could themselves become fiscal authorities and finance deficits

by marshall auerback a market analyst and commentator produced by economy for all a project of the independent media institute beijing and washington have been engaged in long standing negotiations to resolve an increasingly contentious trade dispute it looks like we are approaching the endgame but as james politi and lucy hornby report in the financial times the two sides remain apart on two key issues the fate of existing us levies on chinese goods which beijing wants to see removed and the terms of an enforcement mechanism demanded by washington to ensure that china abides by the deal assuming we resolve these final issues what will the ultimate deal look like will it rectify lingering structural problems that have devastated u s manufacturing with genuine enforcement provisions or will the deal simply represent yet another faux bargain in which china essentially bribes u s officialdom via purchases of some additional soybeans and wide bodied aircraft to make cosmetic reductions in beijing s bilateral trade surplus there s no question that a simple restoration of the status quo ante would not constitute a trade win for the president by any stretch that would be an epitomic case of sound and fury signifying nothing at the same time it would be highly unrealistic to expect beijing to eliminate its elaborate system of state subsidies for industry the basis for its state capitalist growth model which has accelerated china s quantum leap up the technology curve in this regard the president s current trade representative robert lighthizer will play a crucial role in determining the outcome although questions still linger as to whether he will ultimately be undermined by trump in the latter s quest to secure a win at any cost especially if this win comes with the usual pledges to purchase much higher quantities of american goods and nothing else behind it by the same token even if beijing goes beyond that and pledges to open up more sectors of china s domestic economy to u s investment tighten laws on intellectual property etc such additional promises do not really help american workers quite the contrary if it means that companies like gm keep shutting down domestic facilities and making increasingly large bets on the chinese market as they appear to be doing already using trump s simplistic metric of success the actual bilateral trade figures between the united states and china investing more in china will not reduce america s trade deficit with beijing and indeed might add to it as these chinese manufactured goods are re exported back to the american market the granting of a permanent normal trading relationship pntr and then the subsequent accession to the world trade organization wto in 2001 have been a boon for china but the persistence of ongoing american trade deficits have led many including the current president to judge the united states a loser in ongoing trade negotiations with beijing it s not a totally irrational judgment china s wto accession hasn t been great for u s manufacturers part of the problem stems from the extraordinary fact that washington has seldom deployed a negotiator who is actually well versed in trade issues since the days of the clinton administration it has been the u s treasury secretary as opposed to the country s chief trade representative who has consistently directed trade negotiations with the resultant and eminently predictable impact that financial interests have superseded those of any other economic sector that pattern was briefly disrupted when president george w bush appointed alcoa s ceo paul o neill to head the treasury and then csx president john w snow but ultimately the wall street uber alles mentality again prevailed with the appointment of hank paulson to be followed by tim geithner jack lew and now steve mnuchin all of whom have finance centric backgrounds for all of the supposed financial sophistication of america s wall street based treasury secretaries it is indeed ironic that china has consistently been able to play them for fools with the implied threat of its so called nuclear option a highly flawed narrativethat alleges that as a final resort beijing would dump its huge stockpile of u s treasuries thereby driving up u s rates and creating a catastrophic depression for the u s economy that so called threat to the bond market is the traditional reason why successive treasury secretaries have been hesitant to resort to the blunt trauma force of trade sanctions or tariffs when it came to negotiating with beijing they were also comforted by the idea that as it modernized china would increasingly abide by traditional norms of free trade doctrine against all available evidence that shows that it has not played by the same rules let s leave aside the internal incoherence of the nuclear option china exiting dollar denominated assets could well create downward pressure on the external value of the free floating currency but that would enhance u s export competitiveness assuming of course that america has anything left to export an unfortunate legacy of the treasury s malign neglect of u s manufacturing it s also operationally wrong see herefor further detail and mistakenly assumes against all historical evidence to the contrary that beijing would pursue an economic policy that is the functional equivalent of cutting its own nose to spite its face as paul krugman among others notes even if paulson geithner lew mnuchin etc didn t truly believe in the nuclear option they have been happy to tamp down the possibility of a trade war in order to keep the capital markets stable each trade deal has therefore largely sustained the status quo the price for which sees beijing usually offering up a few well timed purchases of soybeans or boeing aircraft although the latter will be more problematic in light of the 737 fiasco but china s policy makers have never been forced to deal with the economic consequences of their country s mercantilism which has resulted in the steady erosion of america s rust belt as the u s economy gave back the considerable employment gains it achieved during the 1990s via a historic contraction in manufacturing employment things have changed markedly since trump seized the china trade portfolio from the treasury s steve mnuchin and placed it under the control of robert lighthizer the current trade representative unusually for a member of the trump administration lighthizer actually knows his brief he has had literally decades of experience in trade issues dating from his days as a deputy u s trade representative in 1983 when japan was widely perceived as the main trade threat to his current role as america s chief trade negotiator as trump s u s trade representative ustr he has provided policy flesh and bones to the president s robustly unilateral approach in trade if anything lighthizer s trade hawkishness has become even more pronounced over the years as he has shifted his attention away from japan to china in his 2010 congressional testimony he argued that u s policy makers gravely underestimated the threat posed to american manufacturing by virtue of china s entry into the wto marshaling an array of evidence to cast doubt on the idea that its entry had brought any significant economic benefits to u s workers and businesses he also highlighted the mercantilist nature of beijing s state capitalism and noted that the country s administrative complexity likely precluded it embracing wto rules even if wanted to do so which he doubted as part of china s system specific large companies receive government patronage in the form of credit contracts and subsidies the chinese government in turn sees these national champions as a means of competing with foreign rivals and encourages their dominant role in the domestic economy and in export markets cholars have questioned whether given its lack of institutional capacity and the complexity of its constitutional administrative and legal system china is even capable of complying with its wto obligations no doubt in thrall to the prevailing free trade ideology washington s policy passivity made it loath to use available tools such as the wto s 421 special safeguardsto counter the resultant trade shock in that same testimony lighthizer also signaled that he was uninterested in the niceties of wto style multilateralism more inclined to the use of aggressive unilateralism via executive orders diplomatic pressure and most importantly the use of section 232of the 1962 trade expansion act to levy tariffs on various products premised on the notion that the targeted country in today s case china represented a national security threat most significant from the lighthizer perspective is an explicit rejection of the idea that china needs to do more than just buy more u s goods before the two countries strike a permanent trade deal which in any case is highly problematic if the end objective is to bring the bilateral trade balance between the two countries to zero you can understand why for one thing the math doesn t add up even if china were to raise its agricultural purchases by 30 billion as it has reportedly pledged to do this is pretty small beer in the context of a 300 billion bilateral trade deficit as the economist brad setser highlights the scope for explosive growth in soybeans is actually fairly limited as the pre tariff base for soybeans was quite high the united states was supplying 12 billion of china s almost 40 billion in oil seed imports a huge tilt away from brazil might cause u s beans exports to double but getting much more than that would be difficult there is a natural seasonality to soybean trade that favors alternating supply from the southern and northern hemispheres the real growth would need to come in sectors where china doesn t buy much now corn rice perhaps pork and beef getting really big numbers there though would risk pushing up u s prices and getting china to abandon its goal of self sufficiency in basic grains so u s farm prices would be pushed up which would hurt u s domestic consumers even as it cosmetically dresses up america s trade position vis a vis china setser adds china has signaled it is willing to let foreign firms take majority stakes in a few more sectors and has reiterated its belief that technology transfer isn t a legal requirement for entry into the chinese market there are likely to be settlements on some long standing disputes as well the rating agencies have gotten approval to enter the chinese market visa american express and mastercard likely will finallyget approval too mastercard through a joint venture not everything changes and some tariffs introduced as retaliation in the past may get dropped but how does the entry into china of consumer credit card companies or the ratings agencies help americans ironically this looks precisely like the kind of sop to finance that trump said he would eschew however because of corporate wall street pressure the trump agenda pivoted a few months ago from selective decoupling and protection of american strategic industries to opening up china for u s investment and pushing china to treat american companies doing business in china more equally that is why leading u s companies have become friendlier and increasingly less critical of the president s trade policy even as the economic commentariat has continued to blast him trump himself needs to understand that a third to a half of trade is really transnational production with inputs from suppliers coordinated by mostly third party manufacturers in asia notably in semiconductors the purpose of modern mercantilism particularly as it is practiced in china today is not just to sell more finished goods but to try to monopolize the high value added rungs of supply chains it is unclear that targeting china s bilateral trade surplus with the united states will ultimately disrupt these entrenched supply chains it almost certainly won t bring semiconductor manufacturing back to america s shores in the end therefore pushing china s leadership to make structural changes to open up china to american companies is probably an illusion beijing is unlikely to rip up the model that has seen it create national champions that can now compete successfully with america s biggest corporations it may make token promises to curtail cybertheft or the subsidies that the administration complains create an uneven playing field for american companies but as noted above even lighthizer himself has cast doubt that beijing could enforce those promises given the administrative complexity of its system of governance in his eagerness to claim a win therefore trump ironically might end up settling for the usual faustian bargain more large chinese purchases selective decoupling of supply chains as american companies rethink their reliance on china and increased domestic protection for certain sectors such as 5g on national security grounds lighthizer s considerable efforts notwithstanding we may have reached the peak as far as this particular tariff war goes but the longer term trade tensions will almost certainly persist well beyond this hollow victory which mr art of the deal will no doubt claim for himself when the negotiations do officially end

net income of 9 5 million or 0 48 diluted earnings per share and 8 8 million or 0 52 diluted earnings per share for the three months ended december 31 2018 and march 31 2018 respectively we are pleased with our operating performance for the first quarter said mr alan thian chairman president and ceo we delivered another solid quarter of net income driven by an increase in average loan balances stable fee income and strong credit quality we continued to execute on our plan to reduce the size of our loans held for sale as we sold 129 8 million during the first quarter and plan to sell approximately 150 million per quarter going forward we are making progress with our integration of first american international corp introducing many of our business deposit products to their branch network with commercial lending to follow we are also on schedule for additional systems conversion which we anticipate will generate incremental savings in addition we have been successful in selling some of first american s fnma loan portfolio as part of our balance sheet management strategy we see 2019 as a rebalancing year as we remain focused on reducing the size of our portfolio of loans held for sale which will likely offset the growth in our loans held for investment we will continue to invest in our business to diversify our revenue mix and provide additional catalysts for generating increased profitability all with the view of creating additional long term value for our shareholders concluded mr thian key performance ratios net income of 10 4 million for the first

was 25 9 million for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 25 6 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 the 330 000 increase was primarily attributable to a 119 1 million increase in average earning assets mainly due to a 106 2 million increase in average total loans partially offset by a 112 7 million increase in interest bearing liabilities net interest income was slightly impacted by a decrease of 4 basis points in the net interest margin accretion of purchase discounts contributed 1 1 million to net interest income in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 0 9 million in the fourth

interest margin was 3 84 for the first quarter of 2019 a decrease from 3 88 in the fourth quarter of 2018 the decrease was primarily attributable to a 26 basis point increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities partially offset by an 18 basis point increase in the yield on average earning assets resulting from higher yields on loans and higher loan discount accretion loan discount accretion contributed 16 basis points to the net interest margin in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 14 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2018 noninterest income noninterest income was 4 2 million for the first quarter of 2019 a decrease of 1 3 million from 5 5 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 in the first quarter recoveries on loans acquired in business combinations decreased by 1

000 in the first quarter of 2019 none were sold in the prior quarter or in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2018 noninterest income increased by 1 7 million the increase was

noninterest expense noninterest expense for the first quarter of 2019 was 15 3 million compared to 15 5 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 the decrease was primarily attributable to a 1 0 million

occupancy and equipment expenses and a 157 000 increase in data processing expenses compared to the first quarter of 2018 noninterest expense increased from 8 3 million to 15 3 million the 7 0 million increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits of 4 2 million occupancy and equipment expenses of 1 5 million data processing expenses of 536 000 and amortization of intangibles of 307 000 the increase in salary expense is attributable to additional staff for expansion and the first american acquisition the increase in occupancy expense is mainly due to the first

noninterest bearing deposits decreased 19 8 million to 419 0 million as of march 31 2019 the decrease was driven by a number of factors including certain import customers investing in inventory ahead

964 22 796 stephen g kaniewski president and chief executive officer commented let me first start by saying we are extremely thankful that our employees at our valley columbus and west point nebraska locations and the surrounding areas remained safe during the midwest flooding event since reopening the valley campus on march 22 we have been focused on returning to full production and expediting customer orders our ability to resume manufacturing one week after the flooding began is a true testimony to the strength of our operational excellence and dedicated efforts by our teams while the events caused some revenue shifts into the second and third quarters no customer orders of significance were canceled kaniewski continued higher revenues in the engineered support structures utility support structures and coatings segments have led to a good start for the year as expected lower project sales in international irrigation markets led to unfavorable comparisons in that segment with north america irrigation revenues only slightly below last year positive performance from recent acquisitions also contributed to first quarter results first quarter 2019 segment review infrastructure engineered support structures segment 33 of sales poles towers and components for the global lighting traffic and wireless communication markets engineered access systems integrated structure solutions for smart cities and highway safety products sales of 230 3 million increased 2 4 versus prior year led by improved pricing across the segment and higher volumes in north america in international markets lower volumes and unfavorable currency translation impacted sales in north america lighting and traffic product sales were higher strong order flow resulting in the expansion of backlogs across all product lines led to extended lead times with revenue growth led by improved pricing in europe sales were lower from decreased volumes across the region sales of highway safety products in the asia pacific region were also lower due to a mix shift resulting in lower average selling prices wireless communication and components sales increased more than 25 globally compared to last year specifically strong demand in north america markets was driven by carriers continued buildout of 4g networks and 5g site preparation and improved pricing actions partially offset by lower volumes in china and australia sales of access systems products of 30 2 million were similar to 2018 operating income was 12 4 million or 5 4 of sales compared to 6 9 million or 3 1 of sales 10 6 million or 4 7 adjusted1 profitability improvement was led by pricing actions restructuring benefits and improved operational performance utility support structures segment 35 of sales steel and concrete structures for global utility transmission distribution and generation applications renewable energy generation equipment and inspection services revenues of 243 9 million increased 16 2 compared to last year led by sales of solar tracker structures from the acquisition of convert italia pricing actions also contributed to sales growth revenues in the offshore wind business were slightly higher operating income was 25 0 million or 10 3 of sales compared to 23 4 million or 11 1 of sales 24 1 million or 11 5 adjusted1 in 2018 pricing actions and improved factory performance were partially offset by lower volumes from a large project in 2018 that did not repeat this year and unfavorable comparisons in the offshore wind business coatings segment 13 of sales global galvanizing painting and anodizing services to preserve and protect metal products global sales of 86 8 million grew 2 2 versus prior year revenue from recent acquisitions and pricing actions drove sales growth operating income was 10 1 million or 11 7 of sales compared to 11 9 million or 14 0 of sales in 2018 weather events and a one time accrual for legal expenses resulted in lower earnings agriculture irrigation segment 22 of sales agricultural irrigation equipment parts services and tubular products water management solutions and technology for precision agriculture global sales of 152 8 million were 18 7 lower than last year as expected north america sales of 108 5 million were slightly below 2018 sales of 109 9 million farmer sentiment continues to be muted by low net farm income levels adverse weather conditions and uncertainty of trade policies which are all impacting demand pricing actions were offset by lower volumes international irrigation sales of 44 3 million were down 43 3 compared to last year significantly lower project sales in emerging markets and unfavorable currency translation impacts led to the sales decrease demand across most developed markets was muted with more favorable trends in brazil segment operating income was 20 1 million or 13 2 of sales compared to 33 9 million or 18 0 of sales in 2018 pricing actions particularly in north america markets were more than offset by lower international project volumes despite lower volumes factory deleverage was minimized through operational excellence processes corporate expense and other income deferred compensation plan investments appreciated by 2 9 million which increased corporate sg a with a corresponding increase in other income 2019 outlook 2019 full year financial outlook previous outlook

expenditures 90 100 million no change we remain positive on our overall outlook and growth strategies for the year particularly in our infrastructure businesses mr kaniewski said this positive outlook has resulted in a more favorable 2019 earnings estimate and we have narrowed the bottom end of our expected eps range despite a weak irrigation market a strong global backlog approaching 300 million in the engineered support structures segment is being driven by strengthening demand in transportation and wireless communication markets particularly in north america in our utility support structures business our global backlog has exceeded 400 million and is the highest on record for the segment supported by a large multi year order new product introductions and increasing demand for renewable energy structures as we know project shifts each quarter can occur in this segment firm industrial demand across all regions supports growth in our coatings business with recent acquisitions also contributing to the favorable outlook added kaniewski continued low net farm income levels and recent weather events especially in the midwest are contributing to a challenging agriculture market environment in north america recent geopolitical events in developing markets will impact our international irrigation project pipeline this year we expect market conditions in brazil to continue improving in 2019 all of these effects have been accounted for in our financial outlook additionally we expect to generate good cash flows this year leading to a positive comparison to 2018 and remain

the immediate spike in oil prices may be the most visible consequence of donald trump s decision to tighten its sanctions on iranian oil exports but that decision will also add another layer of complexity to america s already complicated relationships with a range of trade and security partners oil prices may surge if donald trump can t get saudi arabia and opec to co operate credit bloomberg us secretary of state mike pompeo announced on monday that the us would no longer grant waivers from the sanctions the us imposed last november it had given waivers to eight countries china japan south korea turkey india taiwan italy and greece those waivers meant iran was still able to export more than a million barrels of oil a day the us is now threatening penalties for any nation that continues to import iranian oil after the waivers expire on may 2 iran s response has been to threaten to close the strait of hormuz the vital shipping lane for middle eastern oil although the presence of the us fifth fleet in bahrain might make that an empty threat
the world s central banks have spent much of the past 30 years telling us that inflation was bad and that they would not sacrifice their credibility by allowing the beast they had slain to come back to life in the 1970s surging oil prices helped push inflation higher ushering in a new breed of politicians like margaret thatcher and ronald reagan who once described inflation as being as violent as a mugger as frightening as an armed robber and as deadly as a hitman central banks abandoned a focus on exchange rates and attacked inflation they fell in line from the 1990s on to adopt an inflation target of 2 by the mid 1990s the wall street journal proclaimed the triumph of a new economy not only was inflation on a firm leash but the business cycle was dead of course all of this came crashing down in 2008 2012 as the financial crisis pushed countries into the deepest recession seen since the 1930s and some ireland included came close to collapse with the world still wedded to the fiscal policies of reagan and thatcher which were additionally wrapped up in the stability and growth pact in the eu it was left to the federal reserve european central bank bank of japan and bank of england to prevent a re run of depression era mass unemployment by and large they succeeded and across much of the developed world there has been a steady slow burn economic expansion what hasn t happened is a sustained return to the path predicted by economic theory that growth would lead to more employment and eventually to rising inflation which would indicate that the recovery was complete and that we could return to the certainties of the pre crisis era what appears to have happened is that economic policymakers across the world congratulated themselves for slaying inflation in the 1980s and 1990s when in fact there were other factors at work during that period china emerged onto the global stage its exports to the us have risen 500 fold since 2001 when it joined the world trade organisation and the price of making things like the smartphones and computers we all use has fallen sharply there are other long term factors driving inflation lower and none of them have anything to do with the success of central bank policy from the likes of the german bundesbank whose anti inflation playbook was written into that of the european central bank when it was set up while china became the workshop of the world wealthier nations were ageing rapidly and the arrival of natural gas as a fuel meant we were less vulnerable to oil 1970s style oil shocks as industry became much more energy efficient central banks are of course full of smart economists who know all of this but that hasn t changed their thinking or the way in which they frame the world s economic problems their concern is that without a sustained rise in inflation they will not be able to cut interest rates as far as might be needed in the next economic shock in the case of the federal reserve rates have been cut by 4 5 points in a recession something that would require a shift to substantially negative interest rates if it were needed as the current fed benchmark is 2 5 if things are bad for the fed they are worse for the ecb whose main rate sits at zero pity then the bank of japan which has been in the business of zero rates and economic pump priming for 20 years without any pickup the range of answers coming from policymakers on how to deal with the current problems are all framed in the ideas of 30 plus years ago and in the mantra of independent central banks which were supposed to pursue policy outside the political maelstrom and electoral cycle some of the suggestions on offer from economists and central bankers include raising the inflation target from 2 to say 4 which would in the view of john williams the head of the new york federal reserve give them more room to cut interest rates there s one glaring problem no one is quite sure how they arrived at the idea of the 2 inflation target which spread like flu across the world of central banking from new zealand to the mighty fed which only got round to having an inflation target in 2012 when the financial crisis had hit the only explanation of why they agreed on 2 was that it would mean a doubling of prices every 35 years something that consumers would barely notice that begs the question of how 4 would make things better given that they really meant about 2 it is just that the age old question of economic management which is basically how to avoid a train wreck likely needs a new answer as inflation targeting monetary policy has gone the way of exchange rate management the gold standard and all the other old gods of central banking in the words of economist tony yates all the central banks were doing when they started targeting inflation was the only thing they had not yet tried and failed at simply fiddling with the justifications for a policy that has now clearly reached its limits and may in fact be doing harm for example by increasing inequality by pushing up stock markets and house prices which benefit the rich perhaps it is now time to kick the tyres on fiscal policy the use of which has been outlawed by tough rules and penalties in europe or to look at the idea that central banks could themselves become fiscal authorities and finance deficits
