told in my first para over the years the one that i got most mail back about and the one i still get reminded of most was the one where i woke up one morning to find 40 freshly planted trees had been stolen overnight from our garden i was apoplectic with rage 5 years on i m still not sure i ve gotten over it well today i report another theft this time of a more baffling variety last week i was listening to spotify and kept on getting booted out as someone was apparently listening elsewhere as i was travelling i put this down to my wife however when i did get in new playlists and albums kept on being added that indicated that my wife was going through an experimental stage albums by artists called hoshi lil peep maes ozel and polock appeared most of which seemed to sing in french and none of which i d ever heard of anyway i meant to grill my wife about it wondering whether she was trying to impress a younger french man but i forgot about it last night over dinner i got booted out of the account again and i asked her if she d added all these new albums she looked at me with deep confusion and as she was in the room with me i realised it couldn t be her after much soul searching and more random music being added to my account while i was trying to play some dinner music myself the only explanation i could find is that someone had stolen my account i changed my password and all was fine again it s quite creepy knowing someone is on your music account though anyway i m sure i had some revenge on the thief as over the weekend my daughter wanted a 1970s children s tv theme song called jamie and the magic torch on about 20 times in a row she loves it we introduced her to this as we call one of our twins jamie as my family still call me to this day i reinvented myself as jim when i went to a new school 34 years ago this was the song everyone sung at me when i was 5 there will be a small group of readers who will remember it well anyway i can now picture this very cool young french man with big headphones in an arty cafe in paris thinking he was very clever stealing my account but suddenly being bombarded with 40 year old u k children tv soundtracks however where my trees are 5 plus years later still haunts me like spotify you can always skip the bits of my research you don t like and if you re a bull you may want to do a little bit of skipping today monday certainly painted a downcast start to the week ahead of a busy calendar of catalysts today s latest brexit shenanigans tomorrow s federal reserve meeting conclusion us china trade talks starting on the same day q4 euro gdp on thursday the us jobs report on friday and plenty of potential tape bombs from the equity world as earnings season reaches a peak indeed earnings were the main culprit yesterday as us and european equity markets were all down the s p 500 and dow retreated 0 79 percent and 0 84 percent respectively as earnings from macro bellwether caterpillar and a pre announcement from nvidia both disappointed details below the s p 500 machinery index shed 3 33 percent and the nasdaq fell 1 11 percent as the poor company level earnings were extrapolated to their parent sectors ten year treasury yields fell 1 5bps while us hy credit widened 5bps earlier european stocks had opened lower as well extending their falls throughout the day although by the close they had stabilised somewhat with the stoxx 600 ending 0 97 percent energy stocks led the falls in europe 1 86 percent as brent crude dipped below 60 a barrel for the first time in two weeks before closing at 60 03 fixed income in europe struggled to rally though with 10y bunds 1 2bp oats 1 0bps and btps 1 6bps as mentioned the negative tone was set by poor company earnings with caterpillar reporting adjusted eps of 2 55 vs 2 99 estimated a 14 6 percent miss and the biggest margin miss since 2008 the company also said their outlook assumes a modest sales increase below previous expectations caterpillar shares fell 9 13 percent and the company said lower demand from china was partly responsible for their reduced estimates with the company expecting sales from the country to be roughly flat in 2019 year on year nvidia later added to the negative picture with its shares opening over 18 percent lower after the company cut its q4 revenue forecast from 2 7bn to 2 2bn before paring back losses to close down 13 82 percent nvidia also cited deteriorating macroeconomic conditions particularly in china as a factor affecting its sales and the company will be releasing q4 earnings on 14 february this comes after data last week showed that the chinese economy grew at its slowest annual rate in 2018 since 1990 note that the key earnings release today is apple which is already 33 05 percent off its 2018 peak after it warned on its outlook late last year so earnings and the outlook here will be a key contributor to the macro outlook after us markets closed yesterday the department of justice announced two separate indictments covering 23 criminal accusations against huawei and its executives the us is formally asking canada to extradite the company s cfo meng wanzhou to face the charges the move could complicate trade talks between the us and china which are set to begin later this week though the offshore renminbi traded flat after the news perhaps signaling that the news has already been discounted staying in the region equity markets have fallen in asia this morning although are paring back losses with the nikkei 0 17 percent up from its lows of the session where it was down over 1 percent the hang seng 0 53 percent the shanghai composite 0 62 percent and the kospi 0 17 percent are also lower meanwhile oil has steadied since its declines yesterday with brent crude trading at 60 11 a barrel before we recap more of the last 24 hours let s move to the exhausting topic of covering brexit today uk mps will vote on a variety of different amendments on where to go next although the specific amendments to be debated will be decided by the speaker of the house of commons two of particular interest are the one by sir graham brady who chairs the 1922 committee of conservative backbench mps and the cross party one offered by the labour mp yvette cooper and the tory mp nick boles the brady amendment calls for the backstop to be replaced with alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border supporters of the amendment argue that if a majority of mps voted in favour it would demonstrate that changes to the backstop would be sufficient to get the withdrawal agreement through parliament and would encourage the eu to modify its position however the irish government have remained uncompromising on the issue with simon coveney the irish deputy prime minister telling the andrew marr tv show on sunday that the backstop is part of a balanced package that isn t going to change the other amendment of interest put forward is the cooper boles amendment which is another attempt to avoid a no deal brexit this would require that parliamentary time be made for mps to debate new legislation which would require there to be an extension of the article 50 negotiations if the house of commons has not approved a deal by february 26 db s oliver harvey published a preview on friday of today s vote link here uk equities fell yesterday along with the rest of europe with the ftse 100 0 91 percent falling for the fifth consecutive day while sterling fell back somewhat against the dollar to trade 0 26 percent weaker at 1 3162 ahead of the votes today leading brexiter jacob rees mogg last night said that the influential european research group of hard brexit supporters within the tory party will not vote in favour of any amendments at this stage simultaneously pm may has endorsed the brady backed motion and the government will reportedly whip the party into voting for the amendment the problem for the government is that without either the erg or support from other parties none of their amendments will get a majority labour has not yet tipped its hand in either direction though the party leadership is reportedly leaning toward supporting the cooper boles motion that could potentially lead to a delay to article 50 anyway the votes will begin at 7pm this evening before turning back to yesterday s action note that db s european equity strategist sebastian raedler haslowered his tactical outlook for european equities from positive to neutral following the 8 percent rally since late december as the market has gone from being almost 10 percent too low on his model based on euro area pmis the eur and euro area real bond yields to being in line with fair value he expects euro area pmi momentum i e the six month change in pmis and a key driver of european equities to improve from the current seven year low of 4 5 points to 1 5 points by mid year but even this mild pmi improvement implies little further upside for european equities over the coming months leading him to turn more cautious on the market back to yesterday and staying in europe ecb president draghi appeared before the economic and monetary affairs committee at the european parliament yesterday following last week s ecb meeting where the governing council acknowledged that the risks had moved to the downside the euro rose against the dollar as draghi spoke reaching its highest level in nearly two weeks and ultimately closing up 0 19 percent draghi said that if the outlook worsened further the ecb could still use other tools to combat this but said that at this point in time we don t see such contingency as likely to materialise certainly this year across the atlantic the us congressional budget office published its latest budget and economic outlook including forecasts for the next 10 years the report makes for stark reading for us policymakers but at least the outlook is somewhat improved relative to last year s edition for the 2018 2028 period deficits are now forecast to average 4 3 percent of gdp per year down from the previous forecast of 4 8 percent per year that level of deficit spending has only been hit a handful of times over the last 50 years and always amid a recession so to have it every year is incredible the improvement in forecasts though is driven by lower projections for federal outlays as a percent of gdp partially helped by lower interest rate projections instead of a peak in 10 year treasury yields around 4 1 percent the cbo now pencils in 3 7 percent revenues are forecast to be lower as well with slightly shallower economic growth projections from previously but this dynamic is outweighed by the outlay side overall these numbers should still worry those who look beyond the immediate path of markets even if there is an interest rate improvement from last year as a market aside the projections include around 245bn in reduced deficits for 2020 2021 which could cause the us treasury to adjust its future issuance plans if the figures are borne out yesterday saw very few data releases although the dallas fed s manufacturing index for january came in above estimates at 1 0 vs 2 7 expected marking a rebound from the previous month s two and a half year low in europe m3 money supply growth rose to 4 1 percent yoy from 3 8 percent though m1 growth slowed to 6 6 percent from 6 7 percent the credit impulse turned slightly negative as well turning to the day ahead and as well as the latest brexit votes in the uk parliament we have earnings releases for apple pfizer and sap in terms of data we have french consumer confidence figures for january italian ppi inflation for december and in the us we also have the conference board consumer confidence reading and preliminary wholesale inventories for december by zerohedge
monrovia in two hours one minute president george weah recited some of the same old challenges liberia faces but said the country is far better of despite the enormity of concerns about the country s struggling economy increasing hardship and allegations of corruption report by alpha daffae senkpeni broken economy cliche the economy is still broken and as ordinary liberians endure the harshness of the situation the president during his speech tried to obliviously dodge the reality during the course of our first year in office i can confidently state that liberia is far better today under our leadership that it was 12 months ago said president weah in his speech president weah discoherantly outlined his achievements and recited age old challenges as his administration s stumbling blocks many of these challenges were also outlined by his predecessor ellen johnson sirleaf said weah it is important to mention that the broken economy inherited by our administration caused by the risk associated with the democratic transition in 2017 collapse of the country s major export commodities prices on the global market the unmil withdrawal and the effect of the ebola virus disease in 2014 is still in a struggling state citing economic data the liberian leader relied on a 2 5 real gdp growth as progress which he said will reach 4 7 by 2023 based on growth of the gold agricultural and forestry sectors and formation of special economic zones said weah even with these optimistic recovery forecasts our projected growth rates are still below the pre ebola period when the economy grew on average by 7 5 percent annually already the liberian dollar is performing dismally against the us dollar and the president s alluding to the market situation chronologically epitomizes the real problem dogging the economy this massive depreciation of the liberian dollar was primarily driven by the deterioration of the country s terms of trade and an increase in demand for united states dollars to service imports other factors were the legacy of the unmil drawdown and the lingering adverse impact of the ebola crisis he said he recalled how his economic speech delivered mid 2018 led to the released of us 25 million dollar to mop up excess liquidity of the liberian dollars on the market although there have been little or impact he revealed that only us 17 million was used and a balance of us 8 million is still reserved in the central bank his disclosure will certainly reignite further debate in the coming days about the impact of his economic strategy while the exchange rate continues to skyrocket the country s trade deficit stood at us 561 8 million from january to november 2018 due to low export earnings as compared to payments for imports he said boasting about doubling of iron ore sale from us 57 8 million to us 106 5 million he added that the slight growth of rubber exports from us 67 million to us 68 9 million and suggested that a major structural transformation to alleviate the huge import dependency meanwhile he pronounced a slight decline of the country s gross foreign reserve this means there might be more economic concerns this year still heavily aid dependent the president also catalogued the support and interventions of foreign partners including usaid european union and the swedish government hailing them for their support according to the president grants to liberia grew by 5 7 percent which is at us 480 6 million as compare to 2017 s us 454 million added president weah tax revenue increased from us 384 9 million in 2017 to us 387 6 million in 2018 non tax revenue increased from us 55 million in 2017 to us 64 7 million in 2018 mainly on account of active collection of the road fund levy possibility of more debts at the same time he put the country s current debt burden at us 987 8 million which he said has increased by us 109 6 million during the 2018 based on borrowing from the world bank african development bank and others to date my administration has not added to the debt stock but that does not mean we will not increase the stock of debt in the interest of our people we are working on this he said signalling that his administration may incurred more debts in the coming months interestingly the president did not mention his two signature loan deals eton and ebomaf during his address those were agreements he sought after in 2018 although the process was overwhelmed with several missteps and have reportedly collapsed l 16 billion report pending president weah s mention the much anticipated investigation report of the missing l 16 billion will certainly be the center of discussion in the coming weeks said weah the report from the kroll audit team is expected at the end of february 2019 and will be released to the public by usaid if it is established that there has been any willful act of criminality negligence or malfeasance by anyone implicated in the reports the full weight of the law will be brought to bear what happened inside the capitol by henry karmo fpa legislative reporter as usual the president s state of the republic address is graced by dignitaries from all sectors including the members of the diplomatic corps politicians and partners on monday guests had to wait for over three hours for the president s address which he begun at 1600 gmt unexpectedly president weah was not wearing his famous pro poor suits he rather donned a three piece navy blue coat suit maybe it was a surprise to many house speaker bhofal chambers kept the presence of what is now been dubbed as the most famous attire of government officials the pro poor suit meanwhile the atmosphere inside the hall was arguably charged as supporters chanted pro government slogans at some point of his speech the president s supporters disrupted the protocol with the chanting of campaign slogans as it as normally done during the party s political rallies muyan muyan cdc muyan amanda amanda they shouted absence amongst liberia s popular political figures was former president ellen johnson sirleaf who attended weah s first address in 2018 however her former vice president ambassador joseph boakai the man who weah defeated in the 2017 fiercely contested election was in attendance per the normal legislative practices when the president comes is at the capitol to deliver the state of the republic address the speaker of the house of representatives calls the joint session to order the joint session comprises of the senate and house of representative this time around the motion for the joint session was made by rep munah pelham youngblood of montserrado county s district 9 a staunch member of the president s party and she was seconded by senator dallas gueh of rivercess county seeking legislature support earlier the president urged the legislature to pass into law several bills including the acts to decriminalize free speech dual citizenship and domestic violence amongst others he is also persistent with acquiring more sweeping appointing powers he promised to submit more bills including an act to pay tuitions of undergraduate students of all public tertiary public institution across the country national youth act and a revised lbdi act youth are potential threat in his speech president weah described liberian youth as the largest component of our population that hold the ultimate key for the development and prosperity of liberia but he is aware that they are also potential threats to national security if existing issues that continue to hinder their economic development and transformation are ignore he disclosed that in this year several youth empowerment projects will target young people across the country the president sought to inform liberians through their lawmakers about what his administration did for youth in 2018 including projects to improve education highlighted among the many progress on education he disclosed how the eu made an investment of 20 million euros for the development of technical vocational education which will enhance the development of young liberians he disclosed that about 15 000 individuals and households will benefit while 129 communities in all 15 counties to be supported by the program development partners hailed speaking further on education pres weah said his administration undertook new measures to improve the sector

amounting to the sum of us 2 03 million and l 41 5 million respectively as a means of relieving parents and students of the financial burden associated with the exams and improve performance he

the broader international community which is ongoing and important in terms of arrears clearance for budget shrinkage he specifically recommended more agricultural subsidy cuts again last september as pro imf finance minister mthuli ncube took office rice made clear that his staff stand ready to help the authorities design a reform package that can help facilitate the clearance of external payment arrears to international development banks and bilateral official creditors and that then would open the way for fresh financing from the internal community including potentially the imf but again just to stress as we said before potential financial support from the fund is conditional on the clearance of those arrears to the world bank the afdb and financing assurances from bilateral official creditors we are working with the zimbabwean authorities in the meantime to provide policy advice and technical assistance that might help could help move that process forward in december rice reiterated imf support for ncube the policies of the new administration under the zimbabwe transition and stabilization program do constitute a comprehensive stabilization and reform effort in order to address zimbabwe s macroeconomic situation and just as full reports of the most recent imf riot and army repression were filed on january 17 this year rice repeated his institution s demands in terms of the imf zimbabwe has in fact cleared its arrears to us to the fund but our rules preclude lending to a country that is still in or under arrears to other international financial situations so until that particular situation is resolved we would not be moving forward with a financial support for zimbabwe i said here the last time that the authority s economic policies we felt were headed in the right direction broadly in terms of addressing the fiscal deficit and monetary policy and so on i won t repeat what i said the last time but that s where we are on zimbabwe clearly the system needs a jolt to get out of the rut who can provide it enter biggish brother talk left about sanctions lend right about 7 million the next door neighbor south africa offers the most logical crutch a desperation visit by leading harare officials to pretoria the day after christmas late last year included a request for a loan to clear the other arrears the lead treasury bureaucrat turned them down initially they wanted money 1 2 billion we don t have 1 2 billion but what we have is the will to assist them our engagements are across the system assisting from a budgeting implementation point of view and reprioritizing of public expenditure including on their behalf engaging multilateral development institutions which we have started a year ago the same official prepared the 2018 19 south african budget cutting social programmes and municipal infrastructure support to such an extent that even neoliberal business day newspaper termed it savage while allowing an extra 5 of all local institutional investor wealth around 36 billion to escape the country via exchange control liberalization with this mentality prevailing in pretoria s treasury it s no wonder that at the very high point of the state s repression last week south africa s neoliberal finance minister tito mboweni endorsed ncube i think the idea of using a new currency in zimbabwe is a good one i think our colleagues there are on a good wicket when it comes to that space we are working together very well but at the end of the day it is zimbabweans who need to fix their country zimbabweans can recount a long history of the south african ruling party propping up its liberation era allies zanu pf when the latter turn most repressive this occurred most regularly when thabo mbeki was president from 1999 2008 lamentsveteran south african business journalist barney mthombothi what still sticks in the craw for many zimbabweans is the arrangement concocted by mbeki 10 years ago to keep mugabe in power despite the fact that he had been defeated by morgan tsvangirai adding insult to injury even while activists remained in appalling prison conditions on january 20 pretoria s foreign minister lindiwe sisulu intoned protests in zimbabwe have calmed down and life in the streets of zimbabwe is returning to normal when it comes to money however the south african finance minister reverts to type a scrooge according to mboweni the existing south africa zimbabwe credit facility of a measly 7 million was in any case backed by harare s collateral in the form of its holding of sa land bank bills the extension of this facility depended on zimbabwe being able to provide further collateral the potential low level debt relief he implied would be a tokenistic sop to elite solidarity and would do nothing to change the structural economic power and financial deficits that zimbabwe faces in the region and the world however if more south africa credit materializes it s also likely that mboweni would try to get a higher repayment prioritization for south african firms more than just fraternal ideology there is also blatant national capitalist self interest at work as the sunday times reported at least 15 major south african linked companies with operations in zimbabwe were struggling to repatriate funds these include delta beverages 40 owned by ab inbev multichoice owned by naspers tongaat hulett ppc and zimplats owned by impala platinum other firms such as edcon pick n pay sanlam tiger brands nedbank and alexander forbes either have units in zimbabwe or are invested in locally owned business mboweni s south african national budget will be tabled in parliament in one month s time it must make gestures to reducing parastatal agencies outsized debt so in talks with ncube he may even demand that the first repayment of arrears go to pretoria s bankrupt national airline south african airways that firm is owed an estimated 60 million in ticket sale revenues on the vital harare johannesburg route funds which zimbabwe has lacked sufficient hard currency to repay early this month the airline s spokesperson claimed that ncube had begun to settle those arrears but provided no details there are other solidarities as well including ordinary south africans working closely with zimbabwean organizations in networks such as the united front johannesburg and the sporadic anti xenophobia movement with zimbabwe s capitalist crisis worsening from the late 1990s south africa began to host a vast immigrant pool who were not only political but also economic refugees with many more expected in coming weeks and months hence anti xenophobia politics remain crucial as an angry south african working class often takes out its frustrations on those they consider competitors for scarce jobs housing and township retail trade the two biggest potential sources of bottom up zimbabwe solidarity are the leftist economic freedom fighters eff which polls around 10 of the vote and the largest trade union the national union of metalworkers of south africa numsa with 350 000 members however in neither case has a concrete strategy emerged on january 23 in contrast to the ruling party s nurturing of the neighbor s oppressors eff leader julius malema emphatically criticized zimbabwe s leaders calling mnangagwa a backward fool his behavior is tyrannical and barbaric how do you switch off internet and kill people in 2019 we do not support brutal dictatorship mnangagwa must beware of that constantino chiwenga a former military general who wants to bring military dictatorship in zimbabwe but on the question of how to aid zimbabwe malema had a mixed message insofar as financing support was required at a time the xenophobia threat again looms south africa must contribute to the bailout of zimbabwe anyone who refuses that is dumb if you won t help zimbabweans the border will be flooded by them anyone who is going to block them from coming into south africa we re going to fight with that person you re always complaining that there re zimbabweans here the only way not to have them here is by helping them in their own country zimbabwe must be helped southern african development community countries need to come together we need to close ranks we must give a conditional grant dedicated to developmental programmes which will help zimbabwe to stand on its own but unasked and unanswered is the question who exactly will deliver a genuinely development programme certainly not the mnangagwa chiwenga ncube regime on january 25 numsa s leader irvin jim issued a statement we salute the masses for acting with courage and for rejecting the austerity measures which have been imposed on them by the zanu pf government it is clear to them that the removal of former president robert mugabe did not result in an improvement of their conditions we stand in solidarity with the zimbabwean people and the working class majority and the poor in particular we support the demands made by workers in the public sector we are calling on all our comrades locally on the continent and around the globe to support zimbabwe in its hour of need but again the central question is how to support zimbabwe another form of south african zimbabwean elite solidarity comes from endorsing the red herring of u s and european sanctions mnangagwa claimed to sputnik during last week s moscow visit those sanctions were able to collapse our own currency the same line of argument was taken up by mboweni interviewed by daily maverick ezine s peter fabricius politically there were two key issues to be resolved by zimbabwe mboweni said the first was for the political leadership to work hard for the lifting of the remaining international sanctions against zimbabwe while the second was to re introduce its own currency a process at least a year away consistent with pretoria s unwillingness to send material support to harare fabricius observed the idea of zimbabwe adopting the rand is clearly not on the table in the current discussions between the finance ministers and officials mboweni tweeted a news report that ncube had said that zimbabwe would not adopt the rand as it did not have adequate resources to do so does african advocacy against the u s and european sanctions against zimbabwe s elites make any difference fabricius provided a reality check though south africa and zimbabwe s other regional allies have often called on western countries to lift the few remaining sanctions against zimbabwe these countries are reluctant to do so mainly because of political considerations when zimbabwean soldiers used live ammunition on zimbabwean opposition supporters protesting against the results of the july elections western sources said mnangagwa had already blown his chances of sanctions being lifted can t borrow either thanks to u s sanctions western sanctions against zimbabwe s ruling elite have essentially been limited to financial and travel bans on individuals and their closely held firms trivially the european sanctions affect only seven elites and mnangagwa was already removed from that list in 2016 likewise a u s law the zimbabwe democracy and economic recovery act of 2001 zidera specifies measures against individuals responsible for the deliberate breakdown of the rule of law politically motivated violence and intimidation in zimbabwe zidera instructs the u s treasury to identify assets of those individuals held outside zimbabwe implement travel and economic sanctions against those individuals and their associates and families there are 141 people on the list at present including mugabe mnangagwa chiwenga and their cronies setting aside the zanu pf elites desires to lubricate their overseas financial holdings zidera has other features worthy of debate according to two critics in zimbabwe tendai murisa and shantha bloem first they write it also enshrined into law the us stance that funding from the likes of the imf and world bank could not be reinstated until the act was lifted but as noted this has not been a consideration at all given that the bank has not been repaid its 1 3 billion in dubious mugabe era loans when making his general pitch for debt relief in an article last september ncube did not even bother mentioning zidera as a factor second murisa and bloem argue last july us congress introduced an amended version of it passed just days before zimbabwe s first ever elections without mugabe this renewed act included the extra demand that the vote be free and fair it is debatable whether zimbabwe s 30 july elections passed that test in addition zidera was amended to support a few of zimbabwe s white farmers who in a regional court won a case for property reimbursement after their land was dispossessed more than 15 years ago do zidera s provisions prevent ncube from repaying arrears nearly impossible as that appears and then acquiring new loans from the imf and other multilateral financiers where the u s has influence apparently not in ncube s view as they were not raised even in passing last september in his own detailed article zimbabwe s options for sovereign debt relief indeed zidera has a provision that would actually help ncube two sectors of financial support for the zimbabwean economy under the imposed sanctions 1 bilateral debt relief restructuring rescheduling or eliminating the sovereign debt of zimbabwe held by any agency of the u s government and 2 multilateral debt relief and other financial assistance a review of the feasibility of restructuring rescheduling or eliminating the sovereign debt of zimbabwe as well as to instruct the u s executive director of international financial organizations to which the u s is a member to proposition financial and technical support for zimbabwe and do sanctions prevent zimbabwe from receiving donor aid in spite of mugabe s degenerate rule since 2010 zimbabwe has received far more western oecd donor grants than it ever did prior to 2010 in the 650mn 800mn year range of that more than a quarter comes from the u s from obama to trump there was a minor decline in 2017 18 but 194 million was given last year mostly in the form of aids medicines and strengthening private sector services of course much northern aid is a self serving sham remaining in multinational corporate or ngo home country accounts much of the funding that does reach zimbabwe is hijacked by the ruling party a crucial question is whether such funding plus large inflows of remittances from migrant often politically exiled zimbabweans then circulates locally relieving the cash shortage but as you would expect from us dollars they leak out of the country quite rapidly given this is still the global currency and can readily be slipped into socks or underpants before traveling over the border unlike a local soft currency which typically requires capital control vetting before it can be changed into a hard currency but zimbabwe s underlying financial dilemma is two fold not only its inability to pay the 5 6 billion in arrears but whether payment is even appropriate given how badly the lenders performed when putting zimbabwe into debt this was the subject of my phd and a 1998 book uneven zimbabwe a study of finance development and underdevelopment when repaying arrears first emerged as a possibility during the period of joint zanu pf mdc rule from 2009 13 at a time foreign aid inflows soared advocacy groups including the zimbabwe coalition on debt and development and the african forum on debt and development demanded a debt audit a repayment moratorium and indeed full cancellation as reuters reported in 2009 at a time tsvangirai was in a government of national unity with mugabe his minister of state gordon moyo said it would be immoral for zimbabwe to pay off its debts to the imf world bank and afdb when it could not pay teachers again in 2017 when it appeared that one of the world s most notorious corporations amsterdam based trafigura would lend mugabe s regime 1 billion reportedly at usurious interest rates biti complained that will not help much or anything at all in reality the biggest challenges facing zimbabwe cannot and will not be addressed by paying off arrears on which we defaulted almost 20 years ago what really needs to be addressed are structural economic issues de industrialization and unemployment that money could be better used to fund industry revival to create jobs and boost production as well as increase exports and improve liquidity indeed none of the prior arrears repayment efforts worked but not because they were immoral or a waste of money but because the funding always fell through and yet today arrears repayment is the choice and first priority of neoliberal authoritarians damn the consequences where to zimbabwe s progressive forces have mainly been located in trade unions urban civic groups feminist and youth organizations rural social movements and a small but impressive intelligentsia at the time of writing we have heard only sporadic appeals for popular solidarity some of which were answered in once off protests by small solidarity groups against zimbabwe high commission offices in the main south african cities zambia s capital of lusaka and london numsa s irvin jim argues for a much more ambitious political agenda there are major lessons to be learned in zimbabwe south africa and all over the globe the removal of mugabe did not solve the crisis which has paralysed the economy just like the removal of jacob zuma did nothing to improve the suffering of the working class in south africa instead conditions worsened and they continue to deteriorate the lesson is that capitalism cannot be reformed tweaked or improved it is a brutal system which creates inequality and poverty as the working class we must unite across borders to destroy it and replace it with a genuine democratic socialist state under the leadership and control of the working class jim is correct insofar as in various ways zimbabwe has served as the world s lead canary in the capitalist crisis coal mine for around three decades a variety of neo colonial strategies were deployed to displace inherited structural problems which include 1970s era overproduction extreme inequality and highly concentrated crony state corporate relations by the early 1990s as assimilation of a few black elites into white capital exhausted the potential for further accumulation within a closed economy washington consensus structural adjustment was introduced what with zimbabwe s small production lines due to the limited middle class base trade liberalization soon deindustrialized what was once africa s most balanced economy then came hyperinflationary reserve bank responses during the 2000s with the second highest price increases in modern human history after post war hungary wiping out a generation of savings and terminating the local currency after the turn to the us dollar from 2009 the regime more recently tried providing liquidity through a supposedly cashless society with electronic transactions augmented by faux currency bond notes which soon rapidly devalued thus today the crisis is unfolding with one fatal overarching characteristic a lack of hard currency in the system the military men in charge are now a big part of that problem having dominated the lucrative diamond trade with chinese partners followed by close relations with trafigura when illicitly managing the supply of oil but the systematic looting by the military politicians and corporations under conditions of structural underdevelopment has nearly exhausted itself short of displacement of this elite through a revolution which appears a long way off on the horizon given chiwenga s military prowess and the troops continuing loyalty the strategic options for a beleaguered human rights and economic justice network are limited at the least such strategies should bolster the popular critique of any relegitimation of zimbabwe s neoliberal authoritarians such as the process south africa s ruling party is half heartedly attempting but beyond that the zimbabwean masses are way overdue in regathering the spirit so evident exactly two decades ago at the january 1999 working people s convention held in a distant harare township chitungwiza while the convention sprogramme itself included social democratic bandaids at that point a new party was mandated to serve poor and working people s interests workers built the mdc throughout 1999 although it was soon thereafter hijacked by middle class elements adopting what its leader tsvangirai termed a spaghetti ideology contrary to the vision of the working people s convention an untouchable ruling elite was formed at cost of the party detaching itself from the mass according to a critique by the zimbabwe national student union in 2011 the mdc a party supposedly a movement for social democracy seems to be under a deadly and toxic siege from a capital centered clique inspired by the ever approaching prospects of economic as well as individual political gains these individuals some of whom have hands which can extend to reach to the party s top leadership clandestinely steered the party into abandoning its founding documents in a rush to reach to the feeding trough with the hitherto enemy nevertheless 1999 was a leap forward consolidating the aching demands of a society that had already suffered nearly a decade of neoliberalism such front building organization is lacking today even if the masses militancy is even higher in the aftermath of the state s recent show of force but unity of the oppressed always lurks as a potential and has more of a chance of re emerging in 2019 than do the efforts of mnangagwa chiwenga ncube have a hope of succeeding with neoliberal authoritarianism if they continue imposing such extreme economic pain expect more political shake ups as zimbabwean capitalism continues to implode source counter punch share this share twitter facebook email linkedin reddit pinterest whatsapp like

by return of the imf the most crucial potential bailout lender for zimbabwe is still the much feared imf to which robert mugabe s regime questionably repaid all arrears in late 2016 a series of self delegitimizing 21st century leaders have helped reduce its reputation rodrigo rato jailed last october for bank fraud dominique strauss kahn resigned in disgrace but demanded imf support for his 2011 rape trial and still today after a guilty verdict in 2016 for corruption negligence in france christine lagarde nevertheless the institution remains the global policeman for the entire financial world

improve the suffering of the working class in south africa instead conditions worsened and they continue to deteriorate the lesson is that capitalism cannot be reformed tweaked or improved it is a brutal system which creates inequality and poverty as the working class we must unite across borders to destroy it and replace it with a genuine democratic socialist state under the leadership and control of the working class jim is correct insofar as in various ways zimbabwe has served as the world s lead canary in the capitalist crisis coal mine for around three decades a variety of neo colonial strategies were deployed to displace inherited structural problems which include 1970s era overproduction extreme inequality and highly concentrated crony state corporate relations by the early 1990s as assimilation of a few black elites into white capital exhausted the potential for further accumulation within a closed economy washington consensus structural adjustment was introduced what with zimbabwe s small production lines due to the limited middle class base trade liberalization soon deindustrialized what was once africa s most balanced economy then came hyperinflationary reserve bank responses during the 2000s with the second highest price increases in modern human history after post war hungary wiping out a generation of savings and terminating the local currency after the turn to the us dollar from 2009 the regime more recently tried providing liquidity through a supposedly cashless society with electronic transactions augmented by faux currency bond notes which soon rapidly devalued thus today the crisis is unfolding with one fatal overarching characteristic a lack of hard currency in the system the military men in charge are now a big part of that problem having dominated the lucrative diamond trade with chinese partners followed by close relations with trafigura when illicitly managing the supply of oil but the systematic looting by the military politicians and corporations under conditions of structural underdevelopment has nearly exhausted itself short of displacement of this elite through a revolution which appears a long way off on the horizon given chiwenga s military prowess and the troops continuing loyalty the strategic options for a beleaguered human rights and economic justice network are limited at the least such strategies should bolster the popular critique of any relegitimation of zimbabwe s neoliberal authoritarians such as the process south africa s ruling party is half heartedly attempting but beyond that the zimbabwean masses are way overdue in regathering the spirit so evident exactly two decades ago at the january 1999 working people s convention held in a distant harare township chitungwiza while the convention sprogramme itself included social democratic bandaids at that point a new party was mandated to serve poor and working people s interests workers built the mdc throughout 1999 although it was soon thereafter hijacked by middle class elements adopting what its leader tsvangirai termed a spaghetti ideology contrary to the vision of the working people s convention an untouchable ruling elite was formed at cost of the party detaching itself from the mass according to a critique by the zimbabwe national student union in 2011 the mdc a party supposedly a movement for social democracy seems to be under a deadly and toxic siege from a capital centered clique inspired by the ever approaching prospects of economic as well as individual political gains these individuals some of whom have hands which can extend to reach to the party s top leadership clandestinely steered the party into abandoning its founding documents in a rush to reach to the feeding trough with the hitherto enemy nevertheless 1999 was a leap forward consolidating the aching demands of a society that had already suffered nearly a decade of neoliberalism such front building organization is lacking today even if the masses militancy is even higher in the aftermath of the state s recent show of force but unity of the oppressed always lurks as a potential and has more of a chance of re emerging in 2019 than do the efforts of mnangagwa chiwenga ncube have a hope of succeeding with neoliberal authoritarianism if they continue imposing such extreme economic pain expect more political shake ups as zimbabwean capitalism continues to implode
this article was originally published in 2016 americans have been trained by decades of cold war propaganda to look for any confirmation that socialism means poverty but in the case of venezuela and other states not governed by the free market this cliche simply doesn t ring true the political and economic crisis facing venezuela is being endlessly pointed to as proof of the superiority of the free market images and portrayals of venezuelans rioting in the streets over high food costs empty grocery stores medicine shortages and overflowing garbage bins are the headlines and the reporting points to socialism as the cause indeed corporate owned mainstream media advises americans to look at the inflation and food lines in venezuela and then repeat to themselves clichés they heard in elementary school about how communism just doesn t work in reality millions of venezuelans have seen their living conditions vastly improved through the bolivarian process the problems plaguing the venezuelan economy are not due to some inherent fault in socialism but to artificially low oil prices and sabotage by forces hostile to the revolution starting in 2014 the kingdom of saudi arabia flooded the market with cheap oil this is not a mere business decision but a calculated move coordinated with u s and israeli foreign policy goals despite not just losing money but even falling deep into debt the saudi monarchy continues to expand its oil production apparatus the result has been driving the price of oil down from 110 per barrel to 28 in the early months of this year the goal is to weaken these opponents of wall street london and tel aviv whose economies are centered around oil and natural gas exports and venezuela is one of those countries saudi efforts to drive down oil prices have drastically reduced venezuela s state budget and led to enormous consequences for the venezuelan economy at the same time private food processing and importing corporations have launched a coordinated campaign of sabotage this coupled with the weakening of a vitally important state sector of the economy has resulted in inflation and food shortages the artificially low oil prices have left the venezuelan state cash starved prompting a crisis in the funding of the social programs that were key to strengthening the united socialist party corruption is a big problem in venezuela and many third world countries this was true prior to the bolivarian process as well as after hugo chavez launched his massive economic reforms in situations of extreme poverty people learn to take care of each other people who work in government are almost expected to use their position to take care of their friends and family corruption is a big problem under any system but it is much easier to tolerate in conditions of greater abundance the problem has been magnified in venezuela due to the drop in state revenue caused by the low oil prices and sabotage from food importers the bolivarian experience in venezuela americans have been trained by decades of cold war propaganda to look for any confirmation that socialism means poverty a quick simplistic portrait of the problems currently facing venezuela coupled with the fact that president nicolas maduro describes himself as a marxist can certainly give them such a confirmation however the actual undisputed history of socialist construction around the world including recent decades in venezuela tells a completely different story hugo chavez was elected president of venezuela in 1999 his election was viewed as a referendum on the extreme free market policies enacted in venezuela during the 1990s in december when i walked through the neighborhoods of central caracas venezuelans spoke of these times with horror venezuelans told of how the privatizations mandated by the international monetary fund made life in venezuela almost unlivable during the 1990s garbage wouldn t be collected electricity would go off for weeks haido ortega a member of a local governing body in venezuela said under previous governments we had to burn tires and go on strike just to get electricity have the streets fixed or get any investment chavez took office on a platform advocating a path between capitalism and socialism he restructured the government owned oil company so that the profits would go into the venezuelan state not the pockets of wall street corporations with the proceeds of venezuela s oil exports chavez funded a huge apparatus of social programs after defeating an attempted coup against him in 2002 chavez announced the goal of bringing venezuela toward 21st century socialism chavez quoted marx and lenin in his many tv addresses to the country and mobilized the country around the goal of creating a prosperous non capitalist society in 1998 venezuela had only 12 public universities today it has 32 cuban doctors were brought to venezuela to provide free health care in community clinics the government provides cooking and heating gas to low income neighborhoods and it s launched a literacy campaign for uneducated adults during the george w bush administration oil prices were the highest they had ever been the destruction of iraq sanctions on iran and russia strikes and turmoil in nigeria these events created a shortage on the international markets driving prices up big oil revenues enabled chavez and the united socialist party to bring millions of venezuelans out of poverty between 1995 and 2009 poverty and unemployment in venezuela were both cut in half after the death of chavez nicolas maduro has continued the bolivarian program housing missions have been built across the country providing low income families in venezuela with places to live the venezuelan government reports that over 1 million modern apartment buildings had been constructed by the end of 2015 the problems currently facing venezuela started in 2014 the already growing abundance of oil due to hydraulic fracturing or fracking was compounded by saudi arabia flooding the markets with cheap oil the result massive price drops despite facing a domestic fiscal crisis saudi arabia continues to expand its oil production apparatus the price of oil remains low as negotiations among opec states are taking place in the hopes that prices can be driven back up while american media insists the low oil prices are just the natural cycle of the market at work it s rather convenient for u s foreign policy russia venezuela ecuador and the islamic republic of iran all have economies centered around state owned oil companies and oil exports and each of these countries has suffered the sting of low oil prices dilma rousseff has already been deposed due to scandal surrounding petrobras the state owned oil company which is experiencing economic problems due to the falling price of oil although much of brazil s oil is for domestic consumption it has been revealed that those who deposed her the leftist president of brazil has already been deposed due to scandal surrounding petrobras the state owned oil company which is experiencing economic problems due to the falling price of oil although much of brazil s oil is for domestic consumption it has been revealed that those who deposed her coordinated with the cia and other forces in washington and wall street utilizing the economic fallout of low oil prices to bring down the brazilian president the son of president ronald reagan has argued that obama is intentionally driving down oil prices not just to weaken the venezuelan economy but also to tamper the influence of russia and iran writing for townhall in 2014 michael reagan bragged that his father did the same thing to hurt the soviet union during the 1980s since selling oil was the source of the kremlin s wealth my father got the saudis to flood the market with cheap oil lower oil prices devalued the ruble causing the ussr to go bankrupt which led to perestroika and mikhail gorbachev and the collapse of the soviet empire the history of socialist construction prior to the 1917 revolution russia was a primitive agrarian country by 1936 after the completion of the five year plan it was a world industrial power surpassing every other country on the globe in terms of steel and tractor production the barren soviet countryside was lit up with electricity the children of illiterate peasants across the soviet union grew up to be the scientists and engineers who first conquered outer space the planned economy of the soviet union drastically improved the living standards of millions of people bringing them running water modern housing guaranteed employment and free education there is no contradiction between central planning and economic growth in 1949 china had no steel industry today more than half of all the world s steel is produced in china s government controlled steel industry cuba has wiped out illiteracy and cubans enjoy one of the highest life expectancies in latin america when the marxist leninist governments of eastern europe collapsed in the early 1990s economists like jeffrey sachs of columbia university who can be counted among capitalism s true believers predicted rapid economic growth since the 1990s conditions in what george w bush called the new europe have become far worse than under socialism the life expectancy has decreased and infant mortality has risen human and drug traffickers have set up shop in endless polls the people of eastern europe repeatedly say life was better before the defeat of communism russia s recovery from the disaster of the 1990s has come about with the reorientation of the economy to one centered around public control of its oil and natural gas resources much like venezuela the putin government has also waged a crackdown on the small number of oligarchs who became wealthy after the demise of the soviet union once strong state to control the economy was re established russia s gross domestic product increased by 70 percent during the first eight years of putin s administration from 2000 to 2008 poverty was cut in half and incomes doubled neoliberal capitalism has failed it is only because these facts are simply off limits in the american media and its discussions of socialism and capitalism that the distorted narrative about venezuela s current hardships are believed when discussing the merits of capitalism and socialism american media usually restricts the conversation to pointing out that socialist countries in the third world have lower living standards than the united states a country widely identified with capitalism without any context or fair comparison this alone is supposed to prove the inherent superiority of u s style capitalism if the kind of neoliberal free trade advocated by u s corporations was the solution to global poverty mexico a country long ago penetrated with the north american free trade agreement would be a shining example of development not a mess of drug cartels and poverty the same can be said for oil rich countries like nigeria where exports are massive but the population remains in dire conditions the governments of bangladesh honduras guatemala indonesia and the philippines have done everything they can to deregulate the market and accommodate western investment despite the promises of neoliberal theoreticians their populations have not seen their lives substantially improve if one compares the more market oriented economy of the u s not to countries in the global south attempting to develop with a planned economy but to other western countries with more social democratic governments the inferiority of the free market can also be revealed even as the social democratic welfare states of europe drift closer to the u s economic model with austerity cuts the u s still lags behind them in terms of basic societal health western european countries with powerful unions strong socialist and labor parties and less punitive criminal justice systems tend to have healthier societies the american perception that socialism or government intervention automatically create poverty while a laissez faire approach unleashes limitless prosperity is simply incorrect despite the current hardships this reality is reflected in the last two decades of venezuela s history a punishment vote not a vote for capitalism the artificially low oil prices have left the venezuelan state cash starved prompting a crisis in the funding of the social programs that were key to strengthening the united socialist party it is odd that the mainstream press blames socialism for the food problems in venezuela when the food distributors remain in the hands of private corporations as venezuelan political analyst jesus silva told me recently most food in venezuela is imported by private companies they ask for dollars subsidized by the government oil sales to do that they rarely produce anything or invest their own money according to silva the economic sanctions imposed on venezuela by the u s in addition to the oil crisis have made it more difficult for the venezuelan government to pay the private food importing companies in u s dollars in response the food companies are running general sabotage venezuela s economy depends on oil sales now that oil prices are dropping down the challenge is to get other sources of economic income he explained meanwhile the opposition is garnering electoral support due to the current economic crisis when the united socialist party and its aligned patriotic pole lost control of parliament in december many predicted the imminent collapse of the bolivarian government however months have passed and this clearly has not taken place while a clear majority cast a voto castigo punishment vote in december punishing the government for mismanaging the crisis the maduro administration has a solid core of socialist activists who remain loyal to the bolivarian project across venezuela communes have been established leftist activists live together and work in cooperatives many of them are armed and organized in bolivarian militias to defend the revolution even some of the loudest critics of the venezuelan government admit that it has greatly improved the situation in the country despite the current hardships in december i spoke to glen martinez a radio host in caracas who voted for the opposition he dismissed the notion that free market capitalism would ever return to venezuela as he explained most of the people who voted against the united socialist party himself included are frustrated with the way the current crisis is being handled but do not want a return to the neoliberal economic model of the 1999s he said the economic reforms established during the chavez administration would never be reversed we are not the same people we were before 1999 martinez insisted the united socialist party is currently engaging in a massive re orientation hoping to sharpen its response to economic sabotage and strengthen the socialist direction of the revolution there is also talk of massive reform in the way the government operates in order to prevent the extreme examples of corruption and mismanagement that are causing frustration among the population the climate is being intensified by a number of recent political assassinations tensions continue to exist on venezuela s border with the u s aligned government of colombia the solid base of socialist activists is not going to let revolution be overturned and tensions continue to rise the maduro and the united socialist party s main task is to hold venezuela together and not let the country escalate into a state of civil war note to readers please click the share buttons above

the fed faces the tough challenge of engineering a soft landing for the economy the recent strong jobs report notwithstanding manufacturing activity and bank business lending are slowing managing the situation is made terribly more difficult by the secular decline of europe and china s recent woes slowing economic activity abroad the government shutdown and trade war with china and structural changes that alter historical relationships between monetary policy and interest rates and employment and inflation the nearly 3 growth accomplished in 2018 was no accident of nature the 2018 tax cuts and february 2018 budget deal that lifted federal appropriations caps through the current fiscal year boosted consumer and government spending lower corporate taxes permitted businesses to invest in labor saving robots artificial intelligence and workforce training and deregulation slashed private sector compliance costs all boosted labor productivity growth more demand more supply and the economy zoomed ahead in 2019 consumers are getting an additional lift from lower gas prices but the boost from personal tax cuts and higher government spending have largely run their course and the slowdown in business bank borrowing likely indicates investments in machines software and skills are slowing too brexit and angela merkel s imminent departure the yellow vest riots in france and a populist government in italy were nominally instigated by unchecked immigration higher taxes on gasoline and a left right coalition agreement to spend more than the european union s national debt limits permit in reality the onerous regulations imposed by the eu bureaucracy and mercantilist policies in germany that impose perennial trade deficits and austerity elsewhere are pulling the eu apart the bottom line is europe can t grow and it s america s most important export market china has run the string on credit driven growth and republicans and democrats alike are tired of beijing s protectionism imposing a whopping 365 billion trade imbalance and exporting unemployment and social problems here the economy should recoup the lost spending by federal employees now that the shutdown is over but the trade talks with china may accomplish only a temporary reprieve on the trade deficit past experience indicates trade deals with china do not result in lasting behavioral changes and renewed tensions lie ahead a decade of low interest rates boosted real estate and stock values in the united states and permitted struggling corporations and foreign governments to avoid reforms that would make them competitive and less corrupt now just about anything the fed does has feedback effects on asset prices corporate and foreign government finances and ultimately u s exports and growth finally tools the fed uses to navigate are broken the phillips curve which charts the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment is flashing red but the hard economic data say otherwise even with unemployment at 3 9 wage increases of 3 2 pose few inflationary pressures with stronger productivity growth to pay for those the yield curve the difference between the short and long term interest rates on treasuries has been flattening historically that has proven a pretty good indicator of a recession in the next year or so theoretically it is supposed to indicate businesses that buy equipment and hire don t believe that prospective sales growth justifies borrowing long term to finance expansion the problem is that since the 2000s u s long rates have been suppressed by foreign investors europeans stuck in a lethargic economy and latin americans and asians fearful that their corrupt governments will ignite inflation to solve their debt problems have been buying up u s real estate and long bonds similarly the dollar has increasingly become the preferred currency for all global trade further increasing the demand for u s bonds those unhinge the relationships between business expectations and interest rates for example the yield curve has been sending warning signals since late 2017 but the economy sped up last year instead of slowing lacking the phillips curve and yield curve as tools fed chairman jerome powell is flying without an altimeter and air speed indicator not being an economist he hasn t been to pilot school either the best thing powell can do for now is pull back on the stick and announce he is not planning any more interest rate increases until at least this summer peter morici is an economist and business professor at the university of maryland and a national columnist he tweets pmorici1
a line of migrants from honduras el salvador and guatemala wait for breakfast in mexico city in early november 2018 protoplasmakid via wikimedia commons some three decades after the wars of revolution and counterinsurgency came to an end in central america the region is once again on the brink of implosion the isthmus has been gripped by renewed mass struggle and state repression the cracking of fragile political systems unprecedented corruption drug violence and the displacement and forced migration of millions of workers and peasants the backdrop to this second implosion of central america reflecting the spiraling crisis of global capitalism itself is the exhaustion of a new round of capitalist development in recent years to the same drumbeat as the globalization that took place in the wake of the 1980s upheavals lost in the headlines on central american refugees fleeing to the united states is both the historical context that has sparked the exodus and the structural transformations through capitalist globalization that has brought the region to where it is today the mass revolutionary movements of the 1970s and 1980s did manage to dislodge entrenched military civilian dictatorships and open up political systems to electoral competition but they were unable to achieve any substantial social justice or democratization of the socioeconomic order capitalist globalization in the isthmus in the wake of pacification unleashed a new cycle of modernization and accumulation it transformed the old oligarchic class structures generated new transnationally oriented elites and capitalists and high consumption middle classes even as it displaced millions aggravated poverty inequality and social exclusion and wreaked havoc on the environment triggering waves of outmigration and new rounds of mass mobilization among those who stayed behind hence the very conditions that gave rise to the conflict in the first place were aggravated by capitalist globalization despite the illusion of peace and democracy so touted by the transnational elite in the wake of pacification the roots of the regional conflict have persisted the extreme concentration of wealth and political power in the hands of elite minorities alongside the pauperization and powerlessness of a dispossessed majority with the 2009 coup d état in honduras the massacre of peaceful protesters in nicaragua in 2018 and the return of death squads in guatemala this illusion has been definitively shattered the transnational model of capitalist development as central america became swept up into globalization from the 1990s a new breed of transnationally oriented capitalists and state elites forged a neoliberal hegemony in consort with washington and the international financial institutions ifis principally the us agency for international development the imf and the world bank they imposed privatization austerity deregulation of labor markets new investment regimes to facilitate transnational corporate access to the region s abundant natural resources and fertile lands and free trade deals including the central american free trade agreement in 2004 the transnational model of accumulation involved the introduction of new economic activities that integrated the region into transnational production and service chains part of the capitalist globalization that has involved a vast expansion of mining operations agribusiness tourism energy extraction and infrastructure mega projects throughout latin america feeding a voracious global economy and swelling transnational corporate coffers like earlier cycles of capitalist development an expansion of exports and a deeper integration into the world economy resulted in a reactivation of growth and investment in the 1990s and on the evolution of central america s political economy closely mirrors that of the global economy as a whole the world economy went through a period of prosperity in the 1960s then crisis and stagnation in the 1970s and 1980s followed by the globalization boom of the 1990s and the first decade of the 21st century closely mirroring this evolution the isthmus experienced an average annual growth rate of 5 7 percent from 1960 1970 which declined to 3 9 percent from 1970 1980 and then plummeted to just 0 8 percent in the tumultuous 1980 1990 decade but then in sync with the global economy growth recovered averaging 4 0 percent annually during the globalization boom of 1990 2008 in the wake of the financial collapse of 2008 central american growth rates began to decline again globalization as a qualitatively new phase in the ongoing and open ended evolution of world capitalism has been characterized above all by the rise of a globally integrated production financial and service system in central america the transnational model of accumulation that took hold during the boom has involved a vast expansion of maquiladoras producing garments electronics and other industrial goods agro industrial complexes mining and raw material extraction global banking tourism and the retail revolution or the spread of walmart and other super stores as i ve written in my book export processing zones epzs meanwhile set up since the late 1980s dot the central american urban landscape some 70 epzs now employ some 800 000 workers mostly young women and have inserted the region inextricably into the global factory at the same time the spread of transnational tourist complexes has turned central america into a global playground local indigenous afro descendant and mestizo communities have fought displacement environmental degradation and the commodification of local cultures by tourist mega projects such as the ruta maya throughout the region roatan in honduras san juan del sur in nicaragua costa del sol in el salvador or guanacaste province in costa rica services commerce and finance have also become transnationalized the arrival of the global supermarket has involved the invasion of transnational retail conglomerates such as walmart and fast food chains which have displaced thousands of small traders disrupted local economies and propagated a global consumer culture and ideology icij online via flickr globalization also brought with it a major expansion of transnational agribusiness in honduras local and transnational capitalist interests have snatched up vast tracks of rural farmland from peasant afro descendant and indigenous communities and converted them into palm oil plantations in guatemala too palm oil planted by local suppliers of global agro industrial giants adm and cargill is uprooting a growing number of peasant communities and driving them to migrate abroad in nicaragua peasants displaced by transnational agribusiness have pushed into and colonized what remained of the agricultural frontier disrupting indigenous land costa rica is now a major exporter of exotic new products such as figs dates and winter fruits and vegetables produced by transnational agribusiness that has displaced peasant producers and pushed them further into the agricultural frontier most devastating to the ecology and livelihood of local communities is a new round of extractive activity including mining oil and gas along with fishing and forestry not to mention the mega infrastructural projects such as an interoceanic canal in nicaragua and the agua zarca dam in honduras conflict has shaken the indigenous highlands in guatemala anew as local communities fight a veritable invasion by gold silver and other metal mining and fossil fuel interests in some cases even facing off death squads and a renewed colonization of their territory by agribusiness anti mining activists have faced death threats and assassinations in el salvador where 90 percent of surface water is estimated to be polluted by toxic chemicals heavy metals and waste matter as a result of mining these activists won a historic victory in 2017 when the government passed legislation imposing a blanket ban on metal mining environmental and community activists fighting the government s concessions to transnational companies for large scale gold mining projects in nicaragua have faced down riot police as have activists in neighboring costa rica protesting gold mining concessions in the north of the country the façade cracks economic stagnation political upheaval and social collapse the tenuous social order globalization brought about could only be sustained so long as the economy expanded and those displaced managed to migrate north yet the resumption of growth since the 1990s has depended on three factors that are now reaching their limits a sharp rise in the inflow of transnational corporate investment a steady increase in external debt and remittances from central americans living abroad after a decade of capital flight and disinvestment in the 1980s central america again became an attractive investment site for transnational capital in the 1990s transnational corporate investment jumped from an annual average of 165 million in the 1990s to 631 million from 2000 to 2010 and then to 6 5 billion from 2011 to 2017 although costa rica accounted for 45 percent of this surge as surplus capital from north america and asia sought new investment opportunities abroad following the 2008 global financial collapse however disaggregating the latter figure foreign direct investment actually dropped sharply starting in 2016 to just above 1 billion annually along with this inflow of investment capital the central american economy has accrued rising levels of foreign debt jumping from 33 billion in 2005 to 79 billion in 2018 which at nearly half the region s combined gdp is unsustainable but above all the 20 billion in remittances central american migrants have sent back home has provided an economic lifeline to the regional economy while outmigration has acted an escape valve containing political crises eighteen and 19 percent of el salvador and honduras gnp respectively comes from remittances and 10 of guatemala and nicaragua s in fact remittances accounted for half of all growth in the gdp in these four countries in 2017 and 78 percent for el salvador in other words the region s economy would collapse without the money central americans send home yet the benefits of growth since the 1990s never trickled down to the impoverished majority with the exception of an expansion of social programs in nicaragua during the first few years of daniel ortega s return to power in 2007 and a few programs that the fmln government in el salvador was able to introduce now however as the global economy sputters toward recession and investment flows decline there are diminishing opportunities for capitalist expansion in the isthmus from the average annual growth rate of four percent from 1990 2008 the regional gdp growth rate dropped to 3 7 percent in 2012 to 3 5 percent in 2017 and an estimated 2 6 percent in 2018 globalization and neoliberalism have wreaked havoc on the working and popular classes leaving them ill equipped to survive the coming global economic downturn and local stagnation a staggering 72 percent of workers in the region labor in precarious work arrangements often in the informal economy and some seven out of every eight new jobs are precarious the central american population has increased from 25 million in 1990 to over 40 million in 2017 but the labor market has been unable to absorb the majority of new entrants which helps explain the surge in migration abroad a number that practically doubled from 2000 to 2017 when it reached 4 3 million the social crisis is now leading to escalating political conflict and an unprecedented spiral of corruption corrupt state elites backed by national private sector associations the transnational capitalist class and ifis have imposed the globalization model these same elites facilitated the conditions for local and transnational capital to appropriate the region s resources and labor in exchange for the opportunity to pillage the state the long list of corruption cases in the region has landed several former presidents in jail and brought charges against dozens of high level government officials eric walter via wikimedia commons in guatemala former president otto pérez molina a retired military officer during a genocide against the country s indigenous majority in the 1980s counterinsurgency was forced to step down in 2015 after mass protests against his government s widespread corruption uncovered by the united nations international commission against impunity in guatemala cicig formed in 2006 to investigate corruption drug trafficking and genocide pérez molina was eventually tried and sentenced to prison current president jimmy morales elected after pérez molina s resignation has dismantled the cicig since it brought fraud and money laundering charges against him his family members and other high level officials the larger backdrop to political instability in guatemala is an upsurge of mass mobilization among the country s poor and largely indigenous majority and the return of widespread repression and human rights violations including the reappearance of death squads that terrorized the population for decades prior to the 1996 peace accord that put an end to the four decade civil war the codeca campesino development committee the campesino committee of the highlands ccda and other indigenous peasant student and worker organizations have organized mass resistance around the country and are calling for a constituent national assembly to re found the republic and develop an alternative to capitalism in honduras several members of the ruling national party and family members of former president porfirio lobo brought to power by the 2009 coup d état and current president juan orlando hernández elected for a second term in 2017 in a contest widely believed to be fraudulent have been implicated in drug trafficking embezzlement and other crimes while the murder of indigenous leader berta cáceres in 2016 grabbed international headlines dozens of leaders from the country s burgeoning social movements of indigenous students workers peasants and afro descendants have been targeted for assassination in el salvador the courts convicted former president antonio saca to 10 years in prison and issued an arrest warrant for former president mauricio funes who took refuge in nicaragua after being charged with embezzlement the attorney general s office is investigating other high level officials for corruption including those from the governing farabundo marti national liberation front fmln which is likely to be voted out of power in elections this february in nicaragua the nepotistic and dictatorial government of president daniel ortega his wife vice president rosario murillo and their inner circle have made pacts with the traditional oligarchy enriched themselves through plunder of state resources and an alliance with transnational capital and deployed the army police and paramilitary forces to violently repress peasants workers students and social movements opposing its policies jorge mejía peralta via flickr the crisis of global capitalism and the future of central america global capitalism now faces a deep structural crisis of social polarization and overaccumulation given unprecedented levels of inequality worldwide the global market cannot absorb the rising output of the global economy which is reaching limits to further expansion the transnational capitalist class cannot find outlets to profitably reinvest the trillions of dollars in accumulated profits continued expansion in recent years has been based on unsustainable debt driven consumption wild speculation in the global casino that has inflated one financial bubble after another and state driven militarization as the world enters a global war economy now the global economy is on the brink of a new downturn moreover the system faces a political crisis of hegemony and escalating international tensions in the larger picture this crisis of global capitalism forms the backdrop to the second implosion of central america the crisis has resulted in sharp polarization worldwide between insurgent left and popular forces and an insurgent far right with openly fascist tendencies at its fringes as the regimes in central america lose legitimacy become more corrupt and repressive and threaten to break with the constitutional order as already happened in honduras and nicaragua and may happen in guatemala a new round of mass popular protest unfolds in response the region s governments have also turned to bogus anti terrorism laws to keep a lid on social protest far right and 21st century fascist projects are on the rise in europe the united states brazil israel the philippines turkey and elsewhere in all these cases the most vulnerable communities have been targeted as scapegoats for the crisis especially refugees and immigrants in a strategy to channel mass anxiety over escalating socioeconomic insecurity towards the targeted groups this helps explain the rabidly racist and even fascist response of the trump government to central american refugees neither fascism nor implosion are inevitable that will depend on how the popular forces in central and north america are able to mobilize to preserve the rule of law and push forward a social justice agenda that could ameliorate the effects of crisis otherwise an economic downturn could bring down the central american house of cards before you go truthout faces a serious threat after 22

the current period results denominated in us dollars at the foreign exchange rates of the comparable period in the prior year the average foreign exchange rates were 1 321 and 1 296 per us 1 00 respectively for the three months and year ended december 31 2018 and 1 272 and 1 298 per us 1 00 for the three months and year ended december 31 2017 on a constant currency basis the company s net income for the three months and year ended december 31 2018 would have been lower by 24 million 0 03 per diluted share and higher by 4 million 0 01 per diluted share respectively free cash flow management believes that free cash flow is a useful measure of liquidity as it demonstrates the company s ability to generate cash for debt obligations and for discretionary uses such as payment of dividends share repurchases and strategic opportunities the company defines its free cash flow measure as the difference between net cash provided by operating activities and net cash used in investing activities adjusted for the impact of business acquisitions if any free cash flow does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by gaap and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies the following table provides a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities as reported to free cash flow for the three months and years ended

income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda multiple is a useful credit measure because it reflects the company s ability to service its debt and other long term obligations the company calculates the adjusted debt to adjusted ebitda multiple as adjusted debt divided by adjusted ebitda these measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by gaap and therefore may not be

accompanying notes to unaudited consolidated financial statements notes to unaudited consolidated financial statements 1 basis of presentation in these notes the company or cn refers to canadian national railway company and as the context requires its wholly owned subsidiaries the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements expressed in canadian dollars have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap for interim financial statements accordingly they do not include all of the disclosures required by gaap for complete financial statements in management s opinion all adjustments consisting of normal recurring accruals considered necessary for fair presentation have been included interim operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year these unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared using accounting policies consistent with those used in preparing cn s 2017 annual consolidated financial statements except as disclosed in note 2 recent accounting pronouncements and should be read in conjunction with such statements and notes thereto 2 recent accounting pronouncements the following recent accounting standards updates asus issued by fasb were adopted by the company during the current year asu 2017 07 compensation retirement benefits topic 715 improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost the asu requires employers that sponsor defined benefit pension plans and or other postretirement benefit plans to report the service cost component in the same line item or items as other compensation costs the other components of net periodic benefit cost are required to be presented in the statement of income separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations the new guidance allows only the service cost component to be eligible for capitalization the guidance must be applied retrospectively for the presentation of the service cost component and other components of net periodic benefit cost in the statement of income and prospectively for the capitalization of the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost the company adopted this asu in the first quarter of 2018 with an effective date of january 1 2018 as a result the classification of the components of pension and postretirement benefit costs other than current service cost are now shown outside of operating income in a separate caption entitled other components of net periodic benefit income in the company s consolidated statements of income as a result of applying this asu for the three months and year ended december 31 2018 operating income was reduced by 73 million and 302 million respectively 76 million and 315 million for the three months and year ended december 31 2017 respectively with a corresponding increase presented in the new caption below operating income with no impact on net income the guidance allowing only the service cost component to be eligible for capitalization did not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements asu 2016 01 financial instruments overall subtopic 825 10 recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities the asu provides guidance for the recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instruments the guidance requires equity investments except for those accounted for under the equity method or that result in consolidation to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income however an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair value at cost minus impairment if any plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer the guidance must be applied prospectively by means of a cumulative effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption the company adopted this asu in the first quarter of 2018 on a prospective basis with an effective date of january 1 2018 as a result of applying this asu the company elected to measure all existing equity investments without readily determinable fair values other than those accounted for using the equity method or that result in consolidation at cost minus impairment if any plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer the adoption of the asu did not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements asu 2014 09 revenue from contracts with customers and related amendments topic 606 the asu requires entities to recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services additional disclosures are required to assist users of financial statements to understand the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows arising from an entity s contracts the guidance can be applied using either the retrospective or modified retrospective transition method the company adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2018 with an effective date of january 1 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method applied to contracts that were not completed as of january 1 2018 the adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements other than for the new disclosure requirements asu 2018 02 income statement reporting comprehensive income topic 220 reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income the asu provides entities the option to reclassify the stranded tax effects resulting from the tax cuts and jobs act u s tax reform from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings the guidance also requires certain disclosures about stranded tax effects and a description of the accounting policy for releasing income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income the guidance can either be applied prospectively from the beginning of the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period or periods in which the effect of the change in the u s federal corporate income tax rate in the u s tax reform is recognized the company adopted the amendments of this asu during the fourth quarter of 2018 with an effective date of october 1 2018 the company did not elect to reclassify the income tax effects resulting from the u s tax reform from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings the adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements other than for the new disclosure requirements the following recent asu issued by fasb has an effective date after december 31 2018 and has not been adopted by the company asu 2016 02 leases and related amendments topic 842 the asu requires a lessee to recognize a right of use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases greater than twelve months and requires additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures the lessor accounting model under the new standard is substantially unchanged the guidance must be applied using a modified retrospective approach entities may elect to apply the guidance to each prior period presented with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings recognized at the beginning of the earliest period presented or to apply the guidance with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings recognized at the beginning of the period of adoption the asu is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december 15 2018 the standard will have a significant impact on the company s consolidated balance sheets due to the recognition of right of use assets and lease liabilities for leases currently classified as operating leases with a term over twelve months the company has identified all contracts that contain a lease and has assembled the data necessary to calculate the estimated impact on transition the company has implemented a new lease management system and has made changes to processes and internal controls necessary to meet the reporting and disclosure requirements of this standard the new standard provides a number of practical expedients and accounting policy elections upon transition the company will not elect the package of three practical expedients that permits the company not to reassess prior conclusions about lease identification lease classification and initial direct costs the company will elect the use of hindsight practical expedient to reassess lease term and the likelihood that a purchase option will be exercised the land easement practical expedient to not evaluate land easements that were not previously accounted for as leases under topic 840 the short term lease exemption for all asset classes that permits entities not to recognize right of use assets and lease liabilities onto the balance sheet and the practical expedient to not separate lease and non lease components for the freight car asset category the company will adopt the requirements of the asu effective january 1 2019 using a modified retrospective approach with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings recognized on january 1 2019 with no restatement of the comparative periods financial information as at january 1 2019 the cumulative effect adjustment required to adopt the new standard will increase the balance of retained earnings by approximately 30 million the initial adoption transition adjustment to record right of use assets and lease liabilities for leases over twelve months on the company s consolidated balance sheet will be approximately 750 million other recently issued asus required to be applied for periods beginning on or after january 1 2019 have been evaluated by the company and will not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 3 income taxes u s tax cuts and job act on december 22 2017 the president of the united states signed into law the tax cuts and jobs act u s tax reform the u s tax reform reduces the u s federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective as of january 1 2018 the u s tax reform also allows for immediate capital expensing of new investments in certain qualified depreciable assets made after september 27 2017 which will be phased down starting in year 2023 as a result of the u s tax reform the company s net deferred income tax liability decreased by 1 764 million for the year ended december 31 2017 the u s tax reform introduced other important changes to u s corporate income tax laws that may significantly affect cn in future years including the creation of a new base erosion anti abuse tax beat that subjects certain payments from u s corporations to foreign related parties to additional taxes and limitations to the deduction for net interest expense incurred by u s corporations since the enactment of the u s tax reform u s authorities have issued various proposed regulations and preliminary guidance interpreting its provisions these interpretations have been taken into account and did not affect the calculation of the company s current year income tax provision and tax payments however the u s tax reform and these proposed regulations are expected to impact the company s income tax provisions and tax payments in future years 4 share capital additional paid in capital in the fourth quarter of 2018 the company changed its presentation for the settlement of equity settled awards when purchasing shares on the open market on a retrospective basis whereas previously upon settlement the stock based compensation expense was reclassified from additional paid in capital to common shares and the settlement cost was recorded in additional paid in capital now upon settlement the company records in retained earnings the excess if any of the settlement cost of the awards over the related stock based compensation expense with no adjustment to common shares the company reclassified prior year balances for common shares additional paid in capital and retained earnings in the consolidated balance sheets to conform with the new presentation for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 the impact of this reclassification increased additional paid in capital by 192 million and 86 million respectively decreased common shares by 167 million and 83 million respectively and decreased retained earnings by 25 million and 3 million respectively

california wildfires excluding the reinstatement premiums written in each period associated with the respective catastrophe events gross premiums written in the catastrophe class of business would

a net negative impact on the underwriting result of 205 7 million and added 74 1 percentage points to the combined ratio in addition the underwriting results in the fourth quarter of 2018 were positively impacted by changes in the estimates of the net negative impact of the q3 2018 catastrophe events and 2017 large loss events of 55 2 million and 24 8 million respectively reducing the property segment combined ratio by 17 7 and 7 9 percentage points respectively in comparison the fourth quarter of 2017 was impacted by the q4 2017 california wildfires which resulted in an

million in the fourth quarter of 2018 an increase of 35 2 million or 11 3 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 the increase was principally due to continued and selective growth from new business

the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to underwriting income of 11 5 million and a combined ratio of 94 5 in the fourth quarter of 2017 the underwriting loss in the fourth quarter of 2018 was the result

number of lines of business other items the company s total investment result which includes the sum of net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments was a loss of 35 3 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to a gain of 65 7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 a decrease of 101 1 million the decrease in the total investment result was principally

portfolio partially offset by unrealized gains on the company s portfolio of fixed maturity investments trading in addition net investment income decreased by 20 1 million primarily driven by losses on the company s portfolio of private equity and catastrophe bond investments partially offset by higher returns on the company s fixed maturity and short term investment portfolios net loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests in the fourth quarter of 2018 was 49 3 million compared to net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests of 0 1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 the result for the fourth quarter of 2018 was primarily driven by more significant losses in davincire associated with hurricane michael the q4 2018 california wildfires and changes in the 2018 aggregate losses as compared to the q4 2017 california wildfires during the fourth quarter of 2017 the company s ownership in davincire was 22 1 at both december 31 2018 and

compared to an income tax expense of 41 2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 in the fourth quarter of 2018 the income tax benefit was principally driven by underwriting losses in the u s associated with hurricane michael the q4 2018 california wildfires and changes in the 2018 aggregate losses and unrealized losses on investments in the company s u s investment portfolio in comparison income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 was principally driven by a write down of a portion of the company s deferred tax asset of 36 7 million as a result of the reduction in the u s corporate tax rate

specialty segment in 2018 gross premiums written in the casualty and specialty segment increased by 192 4 million or 14 2 to 1 5 billion compared to 1 4 billion in 2017 the increase was principally due to selective growth from new business opportunities across various classes of business in the company s casualty and specialty segment much of this growth is a result of the company s differentiated strategy to provide bespoke customer solutions which may be non recurring the company s casualty and specialty segment incurred an underwriting loss of 17 0 million in 2018 compared to an underwriting loss of 78 2 million in 2017 in 2018 the casualty and specialty segment generated a net claims and claim expense ratio of 67 3 an underwriting expense ratio of 34 5 and a combined ratio of 101 8 compared to 71 8 38 1 and 109 9 respectively in 2017 the decrease in the company s casualty and specialty segment s combined ratio was driven by decreases of 4 5 percentage points in the net claims and claim expense ratio and 3 6 percentage points in the underwriting expense ratio in 2018 compared to 2017 the decrease in the company s casualty and specialty segment net claims and claim expense ratio was principally due to favorable development of prior accident year losses of 49 3 million or 5 3 percentage points during 2018 as compared to net adverse development of 6 2 million or 0 7 percentage points in 2017 the net favorable development during 2018 was principally driven by reported losses coming in lower than expected compared to 2017 which experienced adverse development associated with the decrease in the ogden rate during the period the underwriting expense ratio in the company s casualty and specialty segment decreased 3 6 percentage points to 34 5 in 2018 compared to 38 1 in 2017 due to a decrease in both the net acquisition ratio and the operating expense ratio with the latter being due to improved operating leverage other items net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests in 2018 was 41 6 million compared to net loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests of 132 3 million in 2017 a change of 173 8 million

includes the sum of net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments was 86 8 million in 2018 compared to 358 0 million in 2017 a decrease of 271 2 million the

net realized and unrealized losses on investments in 2018 were driven by net realized and unrealized losses on the fixed maturity investments portfolio and net realized and unrealized losses on the equity investments trading portfolio partially offsetting these items was higher net investment income from the company s portfolios of fixed maturity investments trading and short term investments

previous investor communications and the company s management believes that these measures are important to investors and other interested persons and that investors and such other persons benefit from having a consistent basis for comparison between quarters and for comparison with other companies within the industry these measures may not however be comparable to similarly titled measures used by companies outside of the insurance industry investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these non gaap measures in assessing the company s overall financial performance the company uses operating income loss available attributable to renaissancere common shareholders as a measure to evaluate the underlying fundamentals of its operations and believes it to be a useful measure of its corporate performance operating income loss available attributable to renaissancere common shareholders as used herein differs from net loss income attributable available to renaissancere common shareholders which the company believes is the most directly comparable gaap measure by the exclusion of net realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments and the associated income tax expense or benefit the company s management believes that operating income loss available attributable to renaissancere common shareholders is useful to investors because it more accurately measures and predicts the company s results of operations by removing the variability arising from fluctuations in the company s fixed maturity investment portfolio equity investments trading and investments

bigger impact was felt was in the value because we saw fewer large deals or sort of mega deals the mega deals have traditionally come from the energy sector the oil and gas industry however found itself challenged in 2018 by low commodity prices and investor sentiment that was weighed down by canada s pipeline debate sante corona head of equity capital markets at td securities inc said the

all the stories i ve told in my first para over the years the one that i got most mail back about and the one i still get reminded of most was the one where i woke up one morning to find 40 freshly planted trees had been stolen overnight from our garden i was apoplectic with rage 5 years on i m still not sure i ve gotten over it well today i report another theft this time of a more baffling variety last week i was listening to spotify and kept on getting booted out as someone was apparently listening elsewhere as i was traveling i put this down to my wife however when i did get in new playlists and albums kept on being added that indicated that my wife was going through an experimental stage albums by artists called hoshi lil peep maes ozel and polock appeared most of which seemed to sing in french and none of which i d ever heard of anyway i meant to grill my wife about it wondering whether she was trying to impress a younger french man but i forgot about it last night over dinner i got booted out of the account again and i asked her if she d added all these new albums she looked at me with deep confusion and as she was in the room with me i realized it couldn t be her after many souls searching and more random music being added to my account while i was trying to play some dinner music myself the only explanation i could find is that someone had stolen my account i changed my password and all was fine again it s quite creepy knowing someone is on your music account though anyway i m sure i had some revenge on the thief as over the weekend my daughter wanted a 1970s children s tv theme song called jamie and the magic torch on about 20 times in a row she loves it we introduced her to this as we call one of our twins jamie as my family still call me to this day i reinvented myself as jim when i went to a new school 34 years ago this was the song everyone sung at me when i was 5 there will be a small group of readers who will remember it well anyway i can now picture this very cool young french man with big headphones in an arty cafe in paris thinking he was very clever stealing my account but suddenly being bombarded with 40 year old u k children tv soundtracks however where my trees are 5 plus years later still haunts me like spotify you can always skip the bits of my research you don t like and if you re a bull you may want to do a little bit of skipping today monday certainly painted a downcast start to the week ahead of a busy calendar of catalysts today s latest brexit shenanigans tomorrow s federal reserve meeting conclusion us china trade talks starting on the same day q4 euro gdp on thursday the us jobs report on friday and plenty of potential tape bombs from the equity world as earnings season reaches a peak indeed earnings were the main culprit yesterday as us and european equity markets were all down the s p 500 and dow retreated 0 79 and 0 84 respectively as earnings from macro bellwether caterpillar and a pre announcement from nvidia both disappointed details below the s p 500 machinery index shed 3 33 and the nasdaq fell 1 11 as the poor company level earnings were extrapolated to their parent sectors ten year treasury yields fell 1 5bps while us hy credit widened 5bps earlier european stocks had opened lower as well extending their falls throughout the day although by the close they had stabilized somewhat with the stoxx 600 ending 0 97 energy stocks led the falls in europe 1 86 as brent crude dipped below 60 a barrel for the first time in two weeks before closing at 60 03 fixed income in europe struggled to rally though with 10y bunds 1 2bp oats 1 0bps and btps 1 6bps as mentioned the negative tone was set by poor company earnings with caterpillar reporting adjusted eps of 2 55 vs 2 99 estimated a 14 6 miss and the biggest margin miss since 2008 the company also said their outlook assumes a modest sales increase below previous expectations caterpillar shares fell 9 13 and the company said lower demand from china was partly responsible for their reduced estimates with the company expecting sales from the country to be roughly flat in 2019 year on year nvidia later added to the negative picture with its shares opening over 18 lower after the company cut its q4 revenue forecast from 2 7bn to 2 2bn before paring back losses to close down 13 82 nvidia also cited deteriorating macroeconomic conditions particularly in china as a factor affecting its sales and the company will be releasing q4 earnings on 14 february this comes after data last week showed that the chinese economy grew at its slowest annual rate in 2018 since 1990 note that the key earnings release today is apple which is already 33 05 off its 2018 peak after it warned on its outlook late last year so earnings and the outlook here will be a key contributor to the macro outlook after us markets closed yesterday the department of justice announced two separate indictments covering 23 criminal accusations against huawei and its executives the us is formally asking canada to extradite the company s cfo meng wanzhou to face the charges the move could complicate trade talks between the us and china which are set to begin later this week though the offshore renminbi traded flat after the news perhaps signaling that the news has already been discounted staying in the region equity

and the kospi 0 17 are also lower meanwhile oil has steadied since its declines yesterday with brent crude trading at 60 11 a barrel before we recap more of the last 24 hours let s move to the exhausting topic of covering brexit today uk mps will vote on a variety of different amendments on where to go next although the specific amendments to be debated will be decided by the speaker of the house of commons two of particular interest are the one by sir graham brady who chairs the 1922 committee of conservative backbench mps and the cross party one offered by the labour mp yvette cooper and the tory mp nick boles the brady amendment calls for the backstop to be replaced with alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border supporters of the amendment argue that if a majority of mps voted in favor it would demonstrate that changes to the backstop would be sufficient to get the withdrawal agreement through parliament and would encourage the eu to modify its position however the irish government have remained uncompromising on the issue with simon coveney the irish deputy prime minister telling the andrew marr tv show on sunday that the backstop is part of a balanced package that isn t going to change the other amendment of interest put forward is the cooper boles amendment which is another attempt to avoid a no deal brexit this would require that parliamentary time be made for mps to debate new legislation which would require there to be an extension of the article 50 negotiations if the house of commons has not approved a deal by february 26 db s oliver harvey published a preview on friday of today s vote link here uk equities fell yesterday along with the rest of europe with the ftse 100 0 91 falling for the fifth consecutive day while sterling fell back somewhat against the dollar to trade 0 26 weaker at 1 3162 ahead of the votes today leading brexiter jacob rees mogg last night said that the influential european research group of hard brexit supporters within the tory party will not vote in favor of any amendments at this stage simultaneously pm may has endorsed the brady backed motion and the government will reportedly whip the party into voting for the amendment the problem for the government is that without either the erg or support from other parties none of their amendments will get a majority labour has not yet tipped its hand in either direction though the party leadership is reportedly leaning toward supporting the cooper boles motion that could potentially lead to a delay to article 50 anyway the votes will begin at 7pm this evening before turning back to yesterday s action note that db s european equity strategist sebastian raedler has lowered his tactical outlook for european equities from positive to neutral following the 8 rally since late december as the market has gone from being almost 10 too low on his model based on euro area pmis the eur and euro area real bond yields to being in line with fair value he expects euro area pmi momentum i e the six month change in pmis and a key driver of european equities to improve from the current seven year low of 4 5 points to 1 5 points by mid year but even this mild pmi improvement implies little further upside for european equities over the coming months leading him to turn more cautious on the market back to yesterday and staying in europe ecb president draghi appeared before the economic and monetary affairs committee at the european parliament yesterday following last week s ecb meeting where the governing council acknowledged that the risks had moved to the downside the euro rose against the dollar as draghi spoke reaching its highest level in nearly two weeks and ultimately closing up 0 19 draghi said that if the outlook worsened further the ecb could still use other tools to combat this but said that at this point in time we don t see such contingency as likely to materialize certainly this year across the atlantic the us congressional budget office published its latest budget and economic outlook including forecasts for the next 10 years the report makes for stark reading for us policymakers but at least the outlook is somewhat improved relative to last year s edition for the 2018 2028 period deficits are now forecast to average 4 3 of gdp per year down from the previous forecast of 4 8 per year that level of deficit spending has only been hit a handful of times over the last 50 years and always amid a recession so to have it every year is incredible the improvement in forecasts though is driven by lower projections for federal outlays as a percent of gdp partially helped by lower interest rate projections instead of a peak in 10 year treasury yields around 4 1 the cbo now pencils in 3 7 revenues are forecast to be lower as well with slightly shallower economic growth projections from previously but this dynamic is outweighed by the outlay side overall these numbers should still worry those who look beyond the immediate path of markets even if there is an interest rate improvement from last year as a market aside the projections include around 245bn in reduced deficits for 2020 2021 which could cause the us treasury to adjust its future issuance plans if the figures are borne out yesterday saw very few data releases although the dallas fed s manufacturing index for january came in above estimates at 1 0 vs 2 7 expected marking a rebound from the previous month s two and a half year low in europe m3 money supply growth rose to 4 1 yoy from 3 8 though m1 growth slowed to 6 6 from

of data we have french consumer confidence figures for january italian ppi inflation for december and in the us we also have the conference board consumer confidence reading and preliminary wholesale

by published by the foreign policy research institute by stephanie petrella fpri as ukraine s march 2019 presidential election nears the kremlin has not masked its interest in the outcome indeed in november nearly five years after kyiv sanctioned russia for the annexation of crimea moscow finally decided to respond with retaliatory restrictions on ukraine s political and business elite weeks later russian coast guard vessels sparked the first ever direct clash between the two countries militaries by firing on a group of ukrainian ships off the coast of crimea as russia s annexation of crimea and the proxy war in the donbas remain the largest political issue among ukrainian voters the timing of moscow s escalations is not a coincidence over the past several years the kremlin has upped its efforts to influence democratic politics abroad backing eurosceptic anti immigrant and isolationist parties moscow has supported candidates of uncertainty the party or individual promising to upturn politics by rejecting the status quo in ukraine s presidential election former prime minister and current frontrunner yulia tymoshenko fits the mold campaigning on a new course for ukraine tymoshenko proffers uncertainty that may well jeopardize ukraine s interests and benefit its hostile neighbor to the east ukraine s obstacles ahead the kremlin s ideal outcome in the ukrainian presidential election is the one that advances its primary interest in the country hindering ukraine s further western integration currently two obstacles stand in the way of ukraine s euro atlantic path economic reforms and the separatist war in the country s east over the next two years ukraine faces 17 billion in debt repayments the country s current lifeline is a 3 9 billion agreement with the international monetary fund imf which in turn unlocks conditional financing from the european union and the world bank to receive imf funds however ukraine must implement reforms to improve macroeconomic stability the imf s terms include tightening contribution requirements for pensioners increasing heavily subsidized consumer gas prices approving a budget with less than a 2 3 percent deficit creating a credible anti corruption court and legalizing the sale of farmland the first three have seen progress while the latter two remain at a standstill although politically unpopular the imf mandated reforms are critical to keeping ukraine solvent indeed ukraine s previous 17 5 billion imf package ran its course with only 8 7 billion disbursed due to sluggish reform progress without cooperation with the imf ukraine would also not have received 3 3 billion euros in financial assistance from the eu the most eu aid ever offered to a non member state and 5 5 billion from the world bank since 2014 the fund s support an implicit guarantee that ukraine will not default on its debts further enabled kyiv to tap global capital markets raising 5 billion in eurobond issuances since 2014 beyond preventing a default reforms would also deepen relations with the eu to join the bloc ukraine must become a functioning market economy with stable macro economic fundamentals a welcoming business environment and strong labor and financial markets the eu will not lend to ukraine absent kyiv s cooperation with the imf let alone seriously consider a path toward accession regarding the war in the east ukraine will struggle to join western military or political economic institutions while a secessionist conflict simmers in the donbas and crimea remains occupied by russia article 5 of the north atlantic treaty organization requires member states come to an ally s aid in the event of an attack it would not be wise for the alliance to accept a new member already at war with one of the world s largest militaries as the experience of georgia promised a path to membership over ten years ago shows russian involvement in a country s frozen conflicts is a non starter for nato accession the eu s concept of the four freedoms free movement of goods capital services and labor within a common market is similarly troubled by disputed borders eu accession is ultimately possible for ukraine if the war in the donbas freezes cyprus accession as a divided island demonstrated such however effectively surrendering crimea and the donbas is not a viable option for kyiv to do so would not only be an act of domestic political suicide but would capitulate long established international norms in the face of aggression reintegrating the territories as part of a federal state is similarly disadvantageous federalism is the kremlin s preferred solution it would allow moscow to end the increasingly unpopular war in the donbas win sanctions relief and ease the financial burden of supporting two self proclaimed republics of course a federal ukraine would also grant the kremlin an avenue to influence its neighbor s politics on a national level there is no doubt that the kremlin would use this influence to advance its primary goal of preventing ukraine s western integration the status quo over the past five years ukraine has steadily bucked the kremlin s interests in these two areas the ukrainian government has been slow to implement economic reforms but it has made enough progress to keep an imf agreement alive and to negotiate a new aid package for 2019 despite fast approaching elections president petro poroshenko and his allies have pushed through several unpopular fiscal policies committing in september to a 23 5 percent increase in household gas prices and controversially voting in december to end the moratorium on agricultural land sales preventing a sovereign default by maintaining relations with the imf has been a key achievement of poroshenko s presidency once the political cycle ends in october 2019 following parliamentary elections the current administration will likely up the pace on the imf s long demanded reforms while ukraine s western backers have their frustrations with the poroshenko administration they know that with patience and stern phone calls from imf chairwoman christine lagarde kyiv will eventually push ahead in the donbas kyiv has given the kremlin little opening since the conclusion of the minsk ii agreements in february 2015 neither ukraine nor russia backed separatists have observed a ceasefire and withdrawn troops a necessary precondition for kyiv to pardon the leaders of the lugansk and donetsk people s republics support local elections and recognize the region s de facto autonomy in the ukrainian constitution while 2018 did see fresh discussion of deploying a un peacekeeping force to the donbas as an avenue to end the stalemate the proposal has led nowhere moscow wants to deploy a mission to the contact line unless kyiv obtains permission from the leaders of the donbas de jure illegitimate republics while kyiv insists that the force extend to the entire region including the ukrainian russian border ukraine s february 2018 integration law makes kyiv s current stance on the war clear russia is an aggressor and the donbas is an illegally occupied territory so long as the status quo continues there will be little room for the kremlin to extract beneficial concessions tymoshenko s platform on both the economic and security fronts tymoshenko offers uncertainty her populist campaign launched in june comprises two pillars a new course for ukraine and a new strategy for peace and security in some areas such as western oriented economic reforms tymoshenko s predisposition for change will likely play into the kremlin s hands in others such as the war in the donbas it remains to be seen either way the uncertainty presented by tymoshenko s anti establishment proposals offers the kremlin an opening to change the unfavorable status quo economically tymoshenko s new course means a departure from ukraine s imf program as currently conceived despite the former prime minister s strong pro eu and pro nato orientation anti imf sentiment has become cornerstone of her campaign she railed against the pension reform passed last october calling it a cynical ruthless deception of ukrainians and arguing that the minimum pension should be 100 euros rather than the current 42 in october she called the government s hike in household gas prices a genocide against the ukrainian people she promises gas prices will be three times lower if she is elected these tirades are popular but they spell trouble without committing to reforms ukraine will lose the support of the imf the organization keeping the country solvent of course tymoshenko s anti reform rhetoric may simply be political opposition candidates criticize the government they make promises to improve socio economic conditions and resist unpopular austerity measures indeed tymoshenko s 400 page economic plan does pay lip service to the need for continued cooperation with the imf however tymoshenko s track record shows a genuine disregard for measures intended to decentralize the ukrainian economy secure energy independence and boost government revenues not only has she consistently voted against the western oriented reform agenda over the past four years ranking 330 out of 423 ukrainian mps for her voting record but her time as prime minister revealed a willingness to flout imf demands to the detriment of the program in 2009 tymoshenko s government promised to hike gas prices by 20 percent to receive a 3 3 billion aid tranche months later she canceled the hike and effectively ended the imf s financial support it is not just tymoshenko s resistance to imf mandated reforms that worries western economic organizations at the heart of her economic plan are populist policies that threaten macroeconomic stability while reducing taxes for ordinary ukrainians by replacing income tax with a profit tax tymoshenko wants to increase public expenditures to develop industry infrastructure agriculture and high tech innovation centers she foresees fiscal stimulus deriving from cheap domestic credit and increased lending from multilateral development banks such as the international bank for reconstruction and development the international finance corporation the european investment bank and the european bank for reconstruction and development analysts have noted that tymoshenko s economic plan is heavily borrowed and contains numerous contradictions it is clear that she does not have a thought out plan for how she will finance the government or implement populist promises while maintaining macroeconomic stability this uncertainty is a detriment to ukraine s relationship with western economic institutions and thus will advance the kremlin s interests regarding the war in the east tymoshenko promises to overhaul the current diplomatic process as an opposition candidate her best argument for election is that poroshenko has failed to deliver on his promise to end the war recognizing that the minsk peace agreements helped limit the scope and intensity of the conflict tymoshenko asserts that it is time for ukraine to discuss new strategies at the center of tymoshenko s new strategy for peace and security is a proposal to revisit the 1994 budapest memorandum in which the united states united kingdom and russia offered ukraine security assurances in exchange for relinquishing the world s third largest stockpile of nuclear weapons the former prime minister proposes to renew discussions on the war within a broadened version of this diplomatic format to also include german french chinese and eu representatives through this arrangement tymoshenko believes she will not only be able to secure a peace deal but also restore relations with russia tymoshenko s peace plan otherwise lacks detail she is adamant that federalism is not an option for ukraine as it will only engender separatism and she insists that she will not accept peace on putin s terms however ukrainians are wary that tymoshenko may be too willing to cut a deal with the kremlin as a member of parliament since 2014 she did not vote to declare russia an aggressor country to demand the de occupation of the donbas or to revoke the 1997 russia ukraine friendship treaty similarly while prime minister in 2008 she refrained from commenting on the russo georgian war as the west uniformly condemned russian aggression tymoshenko is keeping her options open to play the role of an agile dealmaker and an agile dealmaker may be just what ukraine needs the war is becoming a frozen conflict while that is not the kremlin s ideal scenario it is a vastly better outcome for russia than for ukraine however renewing negotiations with moscow has major risks indeed tymoshenko has cut unfavorable deals with the kremlin before most notably the 2009 gas deal that led ukraine to pay more for gas than any other country in europe to end the war in order to get something from moscow kyiv must give something whatever that may be it could jeopardize the future of ukraine s western integration a tymoshenko presidency and the potential benefit to the kremlin is a danger to both ukraine s imf program and the war in the east it is hard to say what tymoshenko will do once elected kyiv has little bargaining power vis à vis the imf or the kremlin fresh ideas are of course essential for ukraine s political and economic modernization but it will be challenging for a tymoshenko administration to negotiate a better settlement on either and if things go poorly the downside risks the loss of western economic support or selling out ukraine s interests to russia are huge when asked if she will win the presidential election tymoshenko recently declared i will win and ukraine will be in the e u and in nato and will be strong and prosperous her proposed policies however say something very different about the author stephanie petrella is a research associate in eurasia program at the

now expectations for 2019 growth in global tech have plunged to less than 2 percent from more than 10 percent seen a few months ago illustrating the woes facing the industry but there s also a glimmer of hope an upbeat forecast from chipmakerstmicro for the second half gave a boost to a sector where a lot of negativity has already been priced in and less demanding valuations provide a cushion to selling pressure 2 key u s china trade talks in dc alarm bells from the international monetary fund imf are still ringing in investors ears after the fund cut global growth forecasts warning in particular that failure to resolve trade tensions could further destabilize the world economy advertisement advertisement so markets will focus on chinese manufacturing data due on thursday and friday to glean how the world s number two economy is faring chinese vice premier liu he will also head to the united states on wednesday and thursday with a 30 member delegation for the next round of trade negotiations there are reasons to be hopeful of some kind of agreement even if u s commerce secretary wilbur ross said the two sides were miles and miles from resolving their trade issues he did after all admit there was a fair chance of a deal eventually so far there is little clarity on how bad it could get for china s and for the world economy and how much stimulus beijing may be happy to provide this time around china s obsession with market stability and the quality of credit growth adds to that challenge 3 will the fed pause rates the u s federal reserve convenes its first monetary policy meeting of 2019 after hiking rates for a fifth time in as many quarters in december but while it has forecast two more hikes for 2019 the darkening global economic outlook convulsing stock markets and a record long government shutdown are clouding the policy picture advertisement advertisement now fed chairman jerome powell is preaching patience with regard to future rate increases and he s been joined by two other governors and all 12 fed regional bank presidents but what happens after such a pause interest rate futures markets currently assign a roughly 20 percent probability for a move above the current 2 25 2 50 percent range for the fed funds target rate at any 2019 meeting a year from now a rate cut is almost as probable as a rate hike most previous fed pauses are associated with the end of a cycle and followed by a change in policy direction yet the current tightening cycle and previous two easing phases have featured mid cycle pauses so how rare would a rate hike resumption be after this newest holding period in both the 2000 2003 and 2007 2009 cutting cycles the fed took at least one hiatus of six months or longer and resumed cuts later in the present one they ve managed extended pauses twice since this cycle s first december 2015 hike a full year lapsed between the first and second hike six months between hikes four and five advertisement

by lawmakers including some that seek to delay britain s march 29 exit from the eu parliament won t be asked to vote to approve a revised brexit deal and given the crushing margin by which may s plan a was defeated just a week ago that s just as well greater focus though is on averting a no deal brexit a scenario in which the uk crashes out of the eu with no trade agreement that looks achievable the opposition and many ruling party members will likely back an amendment providing for a nine month extension to brexit should a deal not be agreed by feb 26 advertisement advertisement meanwhile warnings against no deal brexit are coming in thick and fast from finance minister philip hammond as well as companies such as ford jaguar land rover goldman sachs and airbus markets are trading accordingly sterling against the dollar has just has enjoyed its best week since sept 2017 analysts reckon if may s deal or the amendment delaying brexit pass sterling could rally another 5 10 percent that may sound overly optimistic given the challenges the uk economy will still face risks are finely balanced though remember investors have taken off some option hedges they had put on to guard against sterling downside if the possibility of no deal raises its head again they may have to scurry back to safety 5 winds of change in venezuela venezuela is likely to stay in the headlines given

jay jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president thanks carl and good morning let s turn to slide three we had a great first quarter with total company revenue up 135 million from a year ago the adjusted ebitda margin was 11 5 and we generated 0 79 of adjusted diluted eps higher truck production combined with market share gains in north america drove the majority of the revenue increase but we also had year over year sales growth in south america and india as well as in north american aftermarket trailer industrial kevin will give you more color on the quarter but we are obviously pleased to begin the year with such excellent financial performance with our strong first quarter performance and a higher class 8 market than previously expected we are raising our revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share outlook for the year advertisement advertisement on slide four we provided an update on the 200 million equity repurchase program we announced in november you ll recall that our board of directors had just approved this additional share buyback program following the completion of our previous program in the first fiscal quarter of 2019 we utilized 50 million under this recent authorization to repurchase another 3 million shares which now completes 25 of the new program as we referenced last month at analyst day since 2014 we ve invested about half the company s free cash flow in share buybacks with the strong cash flow we expect to generate for fiscal 2019 we will continue to be opportunistic in buying back our shares as kevin told you in december we firmly believe that our ability to generate cash flow and deploy that cash to create shareholder value is the most underappreciated aspect of meritor s story on the next couple of slides we want to highlight growth in our trailer off highway and specialty businesses we have recently signed three significant contracts for new trailer business as you ll see on slide five last month we told you about the three year renewal with wabash that maintains meritor s loose axles in standard position ph on all wabash dry and refrigerated van trailer products also with this contract the meritor tire inflation system is the preferred automatic tire inflation system optional products for all wabash configurations include air disc brakes the trailing arm suspension and our recently launched mtec6 trailer axle we are also excited to announce today that we have signed a two year agreement with great dane this is a conquest win that gives us standard position for loose axles and automatic slack adjusters this is a meaningful word that allows us to strengthen our relationship with great chain in these product lines and also provides further revenue opportunity with this important customer in addition we now have standard position with stoughton for loose axles and preferred position for mtis with these agreements meritor has solidified its position with three of the top six trailer manufacturers moving to slide six you will see some examples of the growth we have achieved in off highway and specialty growing these businesses is a key priority for us in our m2019 and m2022 plans we announced in december that we had completed a strategic supply agreement with manitowoc to supply a variety of drivetrain products for several types of cranes under its grove brand this conquest win is another step toward establishing meritor as a leader in the commercial off highway industry in north america to that end we are also seeing more heavy haul fleets specking their vehicles with meritor s p600 planetary axle which we specifically engineered for heavy haul oilfield logging and mining applications advertisement advertisement ry ty developments which provides heavy hauling and off road transportation services for the canadian gas and oil industry recently became the first fleet in the region to order their kenworth trucks with our p600 axle the strength and reliability of meritor s off highway products combined with our vertically integrated operations short lead times ready access to service and support with 24 hour part availability and our long standing relationships on the line haul side of the business are driving demand for meritor s off highway drivetrain solutions on the specialty side of the business we mentioned in december that we are supplying a unique transfer case for navistar on the launch of its international cv series class 4 and 5 truck these trucks will feature meritor s two speed gear driven transfer case with 3 000 pound per foot capacity and electric shifting controls we are the first into market a gear driven transfer case for this class of trucks we have started production of this product in our laurinburg plant in north carolina where we have made a significant investment to support the expansion of our industrial business shifting next to electrification on slide seven we were proud to be featured at the recent ces technology show as peterbilt unveiled its new class 6 pick up and delivery truck with ces being the global stage for next generation innovations it was exciting to be highlighted as the supplier in collaboration with transpower of peterbilt s 220 electric drive system shown here with peterbilt s head of engineering our relationship with transpower continues to grow with an additional investment we recently made into the company the full system solutions available through transpower as well as our own proprietary eaxle currently in development makes meritor an excellent choice for electric vehicle manufacturers around the world which is evident by our growing customer base in closing i m pleased with our performance in the first quarter and with our outlook for the fiscal year we are on track to achieve another successful year in 2019 advertisement advertisement now i ll turn the call over to kevin for more detail on the financials and then we ll take your questions kevin a nowlan senior vice president and president trailer components and chief financial officer thanks jay and good morning on today s call i ll review our first quarter financial results and our updated 2019 guidance overall as you heard from jay we delivered a strong start to the final year of our m2019 plan we drove increases in revenue adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin and adjusted eps let s walk you the details by turning to slide eight where you will see our first quarter financial results compared to the prior year sales were 1 038 million in the quarter up 135 million from a year ago driven primarily by higher truck production and increased market share the largest increase came from north america with class 8 production of 24 compared to last year in brazil the truck market recovery continues with q1 production up 21 this year and finally growth in our other north american businesses aftermarket trailer and industrial also contributed to the rise in sales advertisement advertisement as you can see from the causal on the right we converted on this revenue at about 16 which is in line with our normal expected range included in this conversion is higher earnings performance at our unconsolidated joint ventures which are also capitalizing on the global market conditions this conversion was partially offset by fx headwinds from the strengthening us dollar which reduced sales by 26 million and adjusted ebitda by 6 million compared to the prior year the result is that we generated adjusted ebitda of 119 million with an adjusted ebitda margin of 11 5 a 50 basis point expansion over last year gross margin came in at 13 6 this quarter down from 14 6 a year ago operating at these production levels and in this overall market environment we ve seen some pressure on gross margin primarily driven by higher material freight and other premium costs we do expect gross margin to recover throughout the year as we have not yet fully recover the increases in steel costs that we experienced in the latter half of 2018 additionally we expect to see some benefit from pricing actions in our aftermarket businesses that were implemented in january to mitigate such costs one more point on gross margin due to a recent accounting standard update that we implemented this quarter you ll notice that our gross margin for both this year and last year now reflects the removal from operating expenses of the non service cost component of our pension and retiree medical expense these amounts have been reclassified to the line item other income on our income statement as you move down the table on the left you ll see that we re reporting 90 million of gaap net income from continuing operations which is significantly higher than last year there were two key drivers to this increase last year we recognized 77 million of non cash tax expense arising from the enactment of us tax reform and this year we ve recognized a 31 million gain from remeasuring the maremont asbestos liability i ll be discussing this in more detail in the subsequent slide adjusted income from continuing operations which excludes the impact of both of these items was 69 million resulting in 0 79 per adjusted diluted share 27 increase over last year and finally free cash flow was negative 12 million this quarter compared to an inflow of 15 million in the same period last year higher adjusted income was more than offset by increased incentive compensation payments due to our 2018 financial performance investments in inventory to support stronger revenue and increased capital expenditures as we invested more in supporting our growth opportunities advertisement advertisement let s move to slide nine which details our first quarter sales and adjusted ebitda for both of our reporting segments in our commercial truck trailer segment sales increased by 16 to 824 million the increase in revenue is primarily driven by higher truck production in north america and increased market share unfavorable foreign currency impacts due to the strengthening dollar only partially offset these gains segment adjusted ebitda was 79 million up 10 million from last year segment adjusted ebitda margin for commercial truck trailer came in at 9 6 roughly flat compared to last year the increase in adjusted ebitda was driven primarily by conversion on higher revenue partially offset by higher material and freight costs sg a expense and fx in our aftermarket industrial segment sales were 257 million up 12 from last year this increase was primarily driven by our north america aftermarket specialty and defense businesses segment adjusted ebitda was 38 million an increase of 6 million or almost 20 compared to last year segment adjusted ebitda margin grew 80 basis points to 14 8 this growth was driven primarily by conversion on higher revenue on slide 10 i wanted to provide an update on the actions of our non operating subsidiary maremont we called it in december we announced that maremont was seeking to create a trust under section 524 g of the us bankruptcy code to resolve our current and future as best as claims last week we announced that maremont and its subsidiaries voluntarily filed cases under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code the remaining key actions include confirmation of the reorganization plan by the codes and funding as a trust primarily with a 28 million contribution and the repayment of an approximately 21 million intercompany loan by meritor advertisement advertisement as a result of this initiative we recorded a 31 million gain in the first quarter as we remeasured maremont s net asbestos liability to the terms of the reorganization plan which now represents the best estimate of the liability once the bankruptcy process is complete these actions are expected to eliminate approximately 70 of net asbestos liabilities from meritor s balance sheet next i ll review our updated fiscal year 2019 global market outlook on slide 11 although we saw some softening of class 8 truck orders in december the backlog is still almost 300 000 units this gives us confidence that production levels should remain elevated for the rest of our fiscal year therefore we are increasing our production estimate by 10 000 trucks to approximately 330 000 driven primarily by our expectations for a stronger fourth quarter than we are previously anticipating our forecast for the remainder of our market is unchanged so we are keeping volume assumptions at our prior guidance levels for all of these other markets overall solid to strong global end markets continued to support our positive outlook for 2019 based on these updated assumptions you can see we are raising our guidance on slide 12 we now expect revenue to be approximately 4 3 billion up 50 million from our prior guidance we are maintaining our outlook for adjusted ebitda margin at approximately 11 5 in light of our stronger revenue outlook and the incremental conversion we re able to generate we are modestly increasing our investment to support our electrification initiatives this incremental investment is offsetting some of the margin conversion from our higher revenue guide in addition as you think about q2 we do expect to see our normal seasonal trend of increasing revenue sequentially however with the strong production levels we experienced in our first quarter we expect the sequential step up to be much more modest in the next couple of quarters than we see in most years for that reason you should expect any sequential step up in ebitda margin to also be relatively modest advertisement advertisement with stronger top line revenue we expect to generate an increase in adjusted income from continuing operations this higher income coupled with the repurchase of 3 million common shares we executed in q1 is expected to drive adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of approximately 3 30 per share an increase of 0 20 from our prior guidance this puts us close to 0 50 above our m2019 target and finally we are maintaining our free cash flow outlook at 175 million to 185 million the increase in earnings from revenue growth expected in q4 is expected to be largely offset by a corresponding increase in working capital investment which yields no change to our free cash flow guidance for 2019 as we discussed in our analyst day last month this is the level of cash performance you should expect from meritor to generate as we transition from m2019 to m2022 and it s this level of cash generation that supports our m2022 capital allocation priorities as we focus on investing in strategic growth and returning value to our shareholders we are excited about the positive start to this year which puts us on the path to a successful conclusion of our m2019 plan now we ll take your questions questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of ryan brinkman of jp morgan your line is now open ryan brinkman jp morgan analyst hi great thanks i was wondering if you could provide some more color on your business in china including after caterpillar missed earnings the other day setting a slowdown in that market i see on slide six that your sales in china actually surged in 2018 but just curious if you re seeing any of the same slowdown more recently and maybe if you could remind us with some of your more unique customer end market exposures within china we should be thinking about in the current environment jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president yeah good question ryan we re still expecting the market to be flat this year as compared to last year these segments we re involved in such as with xcmg in construction are holding up similar to what we saw last year as far as the infrastructure projects their product support and then we tend to be at the higher end of the quality spectrum on the on highway and so far that s performing very similar to what it did last year ryan brinkman jp morgan analyst okay great thanks just last one for me too i was hoping you could comment a little bit more in the market share gains you ve had several in the trailer segment just curious who you re winning these from and what the outlook is going forward jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president well i ll begin that i m actually going to ask kevin to talk a little bit about trailers since he s leading that business for us and he and the team have done an excellent job of getting our product development strategies aligned with what the customer markets are demanding and i think that s starting to show in the three wins we talked about today kevin a nowlan senior vice president and president trailer components and chief financial officer yeah as it relates to trailer i mean the performance that we re generating in terms of seeing some market share gains are being driven by our strong delivery performance as well as our high quality product and so we continue to be the leader in that trailer market in terms of supplying loose axle and among the market leaders in tire inflation so strong product strong delivery performance and strong quality have been supportive of us gaining share there ryan brinkman jp morgan analyst very good thanks operator our next question comes from the line of joe spak of rbc capital markets your line is now open joseph spak rbc capital markets analyst thanks good morning congratulations jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president thanks joe joseph spak rbc capital markets analyst i just maybe we could start in commercial truck first of all i m sorry if i missed this i was wondering just how much of an fx headwind was in that segment this quarter and then back at the envelope it looks to us like maybe 75 to 80 of the organic growth was from what i d call market and then maybe the rest was sort of your new business and end market share gains is that do you roughly agree with those numbers jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president on the market share gains i have to come back to you it s probably in the zip code i mean we had tens of millions of dollars of revenue outperformance as i look q1 to q1 on a year over year basis joseph spak rbc capital markets analyst yeah jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president i didn t do the math to see that 25 or so percent but it s probably in that zip code somewhere joseph spak rbc capital markets analyst okay jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president and with respect to the question on the fx headwind the bulk of that headwind is in the commercial truck trailer segment because the aftermarket industrial business is predominantly in north american business they have some european exposure but it s predominantly a north america based business joseph spak rbc capital markets analyst okay and you said it was 26 million is it what for the total company was that the number jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president revenue of the whole company 6 million of ebitda that s right joseph spak rbc capital markets analyst okay and then just in aftermarket if i recall correctly i think you were sort of taking some pricing actions there because that was sort of the area where you were able to offset some of the raw material movements is that what occurred and if so how much of that contributed in the quarter kevin a nowlan senior vice president and president trailer components and chief financial officer yeah i mean part of what we executed in the middle of last year in july of last year we did execute some pricing actions to mitigate some of the costs that we were seeing from a steel perspective and a freight perspective and as we start this new calendar year in january we ve continued to execute pricing actions to reflect any market economics that we re seeing i d also point out in that segment the industrial business is performing well as well and saw some growth and contributed to margin growth there joseph spak rbc capital markets analyst okay and maybe just a follow up then and i think you were sort of previously sort of talking about this business that could get sort of 40 and 50 margins but i think that was before you made some reporting changes so is there any additional sort of color you want to provide sort of what you think the right or the ultimate sort of margin potential of the aftermarket industrial businesses kevin a nowlan senior vice president and president trailer components and chief financial officer yeah i think you obviously saw a big step up in margin on a year over year basis 80 basis points we expect that business to operate north of 14 each quarter as we look ahead through 2019 and that s a step up from what we saw a year ago because you know we did have a couple of quarters in the middle of the year where we operated below 14 on a per diluted basis so we are expecting to operate north of 14 of that business for the year joseph spak rbc capital markets analyst okay thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of james picariello of keybanc your line is now open james picariello keybanc capital markets analyst hi guys so for your joint ventures i mean you had a solid quarter for equity income just wondering if you could talk about you have i think four primary joint ventures at this point can you talk about what drove the upside in the quarter and then how you re thinking about the rest of the year jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president yeah i think thanks james i think you can think about those joint ventures really seeing the benefit of the end market increases and market share gains that we talked about so we have our mexican joint venture sisamex for example that shared in the growth we saw in north america we re seeing the recovery in brazil and that brings masters our breaking joint ventures results along with that and then we ve talked about the strength of india as well and so we have our significant joint venture there with the kalyani group so it s pretty widespread just those joint ventures participating both in our market share gains and the end market increases james picariello keybanc capital markets analyst yeah on the topic of india you have new missions standards hitting you also have a mandatory forced aging at the fleet of replacement greater than 20 years older so what s your outlook on the timing of when you might see some significant pre buy ahead of both of those factors in the market and are you already seeing it or right now is this would you chalk this up to just strong market demand jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president i think it s really primarily strong market demand i think if we would expect maybe late in 2019 but remember india does have some history of pushing off those deadlines because the market at times cannot ramp up capacity to meet the demand required for those changes in regulation and we are making some modest increases in our capacity through our joint venture to make sure we re ready for that but i would say it we would expect at earliest to see the impact of those changes in late 2019 james picariello keybanc capital markets analyst got it appreciate it just last one if i could have you guys quantified the commodity headwind that you expect for fy 2019 in terms of the incremental impact that s it thanks kevin a nowlan senior vice president and president trailer components and chief financial officer yeah i mean in the first quarter on a year over year basis it had a few million dollars of negative impact on us remember steel indices are actually up particularly in north america year over year anywhere from about 20 to 30 most of that increase happened in the latter part of 2018 so it s really just a delay as our recovery mechanism start to kick in and we ll start to see some sequential tailwind from that heading into q2 but if you take a step back in totality for the full year 2019 versus 2018 we expect steel to be a headwind on a net basis high single digit millions and that s embedded in our guidance james picariello keybanc capital markets analyst thanks a lot okay operator thank you our next question comes from the line of mike baudendistel of stifel your line is now open michael baudendistel stifel nicolaus company analyst thank you can you give us some sense i mean these contracts seem pretty significant on the trailer side just what how big those contracts are in terms of revenues and sort of how that fits into your plan to outperform the market kevin a nowlan senior vice president and president trailer components and chief financial officer it s this is kevin i ll speak to that it s a mix i mean a couple of those are solidifying existing positions that we have particularly with wabash and stoughton although they position us to grow with certain product categories with those key customers in the case of great dane there is some conquest business there that we achieved on loose axles and slack adjustors so important growth opportunity for that trailer business michael baudendistel stifel nicolaus company analyst got it so it s a mix of the two i guess also just getting back to the materials cost can you sort of explain why that seems to be impacting the margins on the commercial truck and trailer side but not the aftermarket side and when does it start to be a neutral or on a year over year basis kevin a nowlan senior vice president and president trailer components and chief financial officer for commercial truck remember we have recovery mechanisms with our oe customers that kick in generally on about a six month lag so as we saw steel indices increasing toward the back half of our fiscal year 2018 those mechanisms simply haven t had a chance yet to kick in with aftermarket aftermarket updates its pricing periodically once or twice per year based on overall macroeconomic conditions inclusive of steel and so the aftermarket started pricing for that back in january or back in july of last year and started to see some recovery from the mechanisms from the increase in steel indices that we were seeing last year so they saw a little bit of an improvement sooner than the truck business michael baudendistel stifel nicolaus company analyst got it that makes sense that s all i had this morning thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of colin langan of ubs colin langan ubs investment bank analyst okay great thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a good quarter jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president thank you kevin a nowlan senior vice president and president trailer components and chief financial officer thanks colin langan ubs investment bank analyst more of an accounting question but there was 11 million of other income which typically that s only a couple of million or 0 any color on what that is in the quarter and whether that s a sustainable number kevin a nowlan senior vice president and president trailer components and chief financial officer yes colin this relates to an accounting standard update that we had to implement this quarter so it s actually the reclassification of non service cost component of our pension and retiree medical expense so that s about 9 million that we moved out of gross margin or cost of goods sold that s actually income and moved down to other income we actually recap 2018 numbers as well so you ll see that went from a number that was de minimis to now at the positive 8 million in q1 of a year ago so that s simply an accounting change that we had to make that impacted both last year and this year colin langan ubs investment bank analyst got it okay that make sense and then when we think of share repurchases those 50 million in the quarter is that that the pace we should be thinking about for the rest of the year is that or will it move around through the year jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president all right i think you should remember colin as our cash flows tend to be seasonal where we generate a meaningful portion of our free cash flow in q3 and then we do have some other obligations one of which kevin spoke to the funding of the maremont liabilities that we think are upcoming so we saw a great opportunity in q1 given the price at which our shares were trading and we felt highly confident on our free cash flow projection for the year so we decided to lean out a little in q1 and take advantage of that market disconnect in our evaluation colin langan ubs investment bank analyst got it any can you just remind me of the 200 million authorization for the next two years is there a timeline on that kevin a nowlan senior vice president and president trailer components and chief financial officer the 200 million authorization is open to be able to support repurchase activity through our 2022 planning horizon and so it s just the initial approval that we ll execute on as we generate free cash flow and we see the opportunity to deploy cash accordingly so at this point we re 50 million utilize of that full 200 million 25 done but we ll continue to execute as we see opportunities to deploy cash accordingly colin langan ubs investment bank analyst got it and just lastly any update we covered most of the regions other than south america i mean any update on that business i think you were expecting a small increase is that still on track and how should we think about the potential there with maybe higher incremental because of the low base you re off of jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president well we are seeing a pretty measurable increase year over year over 20 and what we expect in the market 18 to 19 and we still feel confident in that so i think we re feeling good about that and the market with the new government in place the confidence seems to be developing in the country and i would say where we consider to be more optimistic on that market recovering to more normalized levels colin langan ubs investment bank analyst got it and thanks for taking my question operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brian johnson of barclays your line is now open brian johnson barclays bank analyst yes good morning my question is on two fronts just some of the margin in aftermarket and then on evs on the margin i think you alluded to this but what is what we can takeaway from the lack of freight sg a and material offsets in aftermarket in the aftermarket industrial business that it s just shorter cycle pricing and you re able to move those factors up and down so you just it s just basically straight incrementals there kevin a nowlan senior vice president and president trailer components and chief financial officer no i d actually say it s more because we ve reacted to what we ve seen in the market from escalating cost throughout 2018 and we executed some pricing actions in july of last year to mitigate the impact of those so we have seen increased freight cost last year in 2018 and other economic factors and we ve been pricing for it brian johnson barclays bank analyst okay secondly over on the ev front you know we know you guys have 22 prototype programs out there is there any kind of way to bucket what you re spending the ev money on is there kid of a core technology that you spend on across all those programs is it just on each prototype or anyway you kind of think about that and then how that might progress if any of those actually move closer to production jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president yeah i would say brian we re spending you could say approximately 10 million this coming year on both our pure r d and also prototype development where we re not receiving reimbursement from customers so in certain cases we do receive reimbursement from the customer for partial reimbursement of the cost we re incurring but as kevin mentioned in his remarks we ve seen such great opportunities there we ve ramped up the spending a bit from what we had initially expected because of how well the company is performing and the opportunities we re seeing brian johnson barclays bank analyst okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of neil frohnapple of buckingham research your line is now open neil frohnapple the buckingham research analyst hi thanks congrats on a great quarter first i just want to round out the ebitda margin discussion for the year so i mean you guys just delivered an 11 5 adjusted ebitda margin well above the expectations in and again what is historically i think the seasonally lowest quarter of the year so great performance there so could you just talk about some of the puts and takes from a margin perspective for the remainder of the year to get to the 11 5 full year guidance i know you guys cited the increased investment in electrification but on the flip side it sounds like you ll get maybe a sequential tailwind in q2 from steel the pricing initiatives in truck trailer and then expect higher gross margins i think you said so again just wanted to round that out and if you could provide more color that would be great kevin a nowlan senior vice president and president trailer components and chief financial officer okay thanks neil definitely anywhere we re pleased with the fact that we started the first quarter strong 11 5 of 50 basis points year over year is a strong first quarter for us as we look ahead the first thing i would just mention is that typically our second and third quarter we see a much more robust step up from a revenue perspective than we would expect this year because q1 was so strong from a revenue perspective and take last year going from q1 to q3 revenue was up 200 ish plus million from one quarter to the third quarter this year we expect it to be up less than 100 million so there is lot less conversion opportunity as you go from one quarter to the next but we are expecting to continue to convert on that incremental revenue so you re going see a little bit of upside of margin from that but then being offset by some of the additional electrification investment that we ll be making over the couple of quarters starting in our second fiscal quarter so net net we still expect to be around approximately 11 5 for the full year but pretty pleased with the start to the year neil frohnapple the buckingham research analyst okay thanks for the color kevin and then with nafta class 8 production this past quarter coming meaningfully higher than expected due to a surge in build i think in the month of december did that require you to more over time and things like escalated freight cost to serve the market which may have laid on commercial truck trailer margin in the quarter and i guess just curious on relative to what you d expect for the rest of the year jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president the short answer is yes we continue to see so continuing less than optimal efficiency in our operating plans and also some additional premiums as we expedite freight they were within our planning assumptions so and we do have some expectations for the rest of the year that we are running some layered capacity as we speak to it on the margins of our supply relationships and that we have embedded in the guidance that kevin updated the cost of those additional expedited freight and layered capacity suppliers neil frohnapple the buckingham research analyst okay great thank you so much guys jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president thank you neil operator thank you our next question comes from the line of alex potter of piper jaffray your line is now open alexander potter piper jaffray analyst hi thanks good job this quarter guys i guess i have one additional question on electrification deploying more capital for that opportunity which is a good sign i m interested to know if this is something that you re doing opportunistically because you re doing better than what you thought revenue s higher margins are higher so you can redeploy same capital or is that something that you would have likely done anyway jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president well that s a good question i think we in my mind probably would have done it anyway but would have had to allocate where different investments would have been reduced i think with the good news we re seeing in the business we re able to continue to deploy capital to all the opportunities we re seeing and increase that investment in electrification i think as you know under this leadership team through m2016 m2019 and now m2020 we take the targets that we set very seriously and try to manage all our different puts and takes within those targets but certainly because of the strength we re seeing in our business we were allowed to continue to make all the investments required alexander potter piper jaffray analyst okay very good another question on china also i know that historically you ve got more of an off highway focused you mentioned more when it comes to the on highway side of the business there s more premium high end but my understating is that that s also one of the goals of the company i suppose is to increase exposure to the on highway segment there it s a area that you ve historically been under indexed is that has there been any development in that regard what do you expect over the next one two three years jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president yeah there have been developments what i m pleased with is we have an excellent disc brake offering in china so we re starting to see opportunities there that are coming forward in our core axle business we continue to see opportunities on the premium side of the market so the one caution i would give is we will not derogate the margins of the overall company by chasing opportunities in spaces in that market that just don t have the returns required and that s been our challenge over the years is that market has not had the returns for suppliers in our segment that have been acceptable to us so we that s why our growth strategy has been more measured maybe than others alexander potter piper jaffray analyst okay that makes sense and then my last question i guess related to the supply chain in the us still there s as you mentioned expedited freight overtime things of that nature do you think the supply chain is properly capacitized at this point or when do you think that people have their upstream or downstream or whatever the supply bottlenecks are do you think that more investment is likely to be earmarked to address those bottlenecks or do you think we re basically just going to be dealing with the current situation indefinitely until the backlog runs down jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president i ll give a few brief comments and ask kevin to provide additional detail but as we spoke to previously we ve increased some capacity in north america just beginning coming online here in january and that capacity directed at the class 8 market was the investment was primarily directed at our supply base just trying to bring on more capacity and different suppliers so we continued to monitor very closely but have to make some incremental investments to bring on that additional capacity kevin a nowlan senior vice president and president trailer components and chief financial officer this is kevin i ll just i don t have much to add i mean i don t anticipate seeing a significant step up in investment beyond that i think the modest investments we ve made in some supplier tooling to support the strong market that we anticipate at least through the balance of this fiscal year i think that will carry us through this year but i m not expecting to see more from the way of capacity investments beyond that at this point alexander potter piper jaffray analyst okay nice job again guys jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president thanks alex operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of faheem sabeiha of longbow research your line is now open faheem sabeiha longbow research analyst hi good morning guys and congrats on a good quarter just wondering with the acceleration in share repurchases in q1 and the funding of the maremont trust coming up soon can you maybe talk about your appetite may be used debt to make an acquisition if one were to come up over the next quarters jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president well i think the question we ask ourselves and the answer we provided in the roll out of the m2022 plan is we re very pleased with the core business in our ability to grow organically so we continue to look at opportunities and acquisition that are more bolt on in nature and really we do not believe we are interested in a transformational acquisition of the scale that would take us off track on our capital allocation strategy that we laid out in the december analyst day so we have a significant number of opportunities we re constantly evaluating but those tend to be bolt on in nature faheem sabeiha longbow research analyst okay and final question for me can you talk about other opportunities for your gear transfer case within the class 4 and 5 market given the success you had getting on the platform with gm and navistar or maybe any other adjacent markets to that jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president well we do see the investment we ve made and the development of that transfer case and also a brand new assembly line in our laurinburg facility that i spoke about on the call as an opportunity to look at additional market share gains in that area so we don t i don t see anything specifically that will be announcing in the near term but we certainly are continuing to make headway in that market and i think it s very unique technology that navistar appreciated and i think the end market will appreciate as that vehicles rolled out here over the next few months faheem sabeiha longbow research analyst okay thanks operator thank you and i m showing no further questions at this time i d like to turn the call back to carl anderson for any closing remarks carl

faced with surging inflation and a falling national currency due to harsh u s sanctions that were reimposed after the united states unilaterally withdrew from the nuclear deal with world powers in may iran is planning to remove four zeros from the rial taking its current official exchange rate with the u s dollar from 42 000 to the more palatable 4 2 the official rate is meaningless on the street however in reality the value of the rial is far less this week it was trading at 120 000 to the dollar on the black market faced with surging inflation and a falling national currency due to harsh u s sanctions that were reimposed after the united states unilaterally withdrew from the nuclear deal with world powers in may iran is planning to remove four zeros from the rial taking its current official exchange rate with the u s dollar from 42 000 to the more palatable 4 2 the official rate is meaningless on the street however in reality the value of the rial is far less this week it was trading at 120 000 to the dollar on the black market for years iran has been operating two exchange rates one for crucial imports and one for everything else even more rates have emerged in recent months on the back of a currency crisis if implemented carefully and as part of wider financial reforms redenomination would be a positive move but hardly an answer for all the country s intertwined economic woes in an instagram post on jan 6 abdolnaser hemmati the governor of the central bank of iran cbi announced that during a meeting with members of parliament on the same day he notified them that the regulator has officially submitted a redenomination bill to the government for review the bill aims to slash four zeros off the rial after which each 10 000 rials will be equal to 1 toman the unit that currently equals 10 rials and has been used in daily transactions and trade by iranians for decades hemmati also explained that the legal and technical requirements including passing the bill through government and parliament and recalling old banknotes and printing new ones mean that fully replacing the national currency will take roughly two years he said while redenomination will run alongside articles of bank reform currently being reviewed by members of parliament in the meantime implementing the finalized plan and introducing new banknotes will come after the rial has been iran s official currency since 1932 the toman was the national currency during the qajar dynasty 1785 1925 and the first few years of the pahlavi dynasty 1925 1979 neither are persian words with rial and toman having spanish portuguese and turko mongol origins respectively the redenomination proposal comes just over two years after a previous attempt on a smaller scale in early december 2016 president hassan rouhani s cabinet approved a measure aimed at removing one zero from the national currency effectively introducing the toman as the new official unit officials emphasized that it was not an attempt at redenomination but merely an initiative aimed at easing day to day transactions it was criticized as a costly and insufficient move so the initiative remained in a state of limbo and was ultimately rejected by lawmakers in september 2018 so now the cbi has come up with a more substantial effort that could be worth the cost but this is not the first time iran has considered currency redenomination and a quick look at its modern history shows why since the islamic revolution in 1979 iran has experienced inflation on a regular basis there have been only four fiscal years with single digit inflation cbi data show iranian authorities considered currency redenomination in 1994 when a 49 percent inflation rate was stoking fears of hyperinflation the second attempt came in 2008 in an era defined by the controversial policies of hard line president mahmoud ahmadinejad and multilateral sanctions put in place in response to the country s nuclear ambitions in 2010 ahmadinejad announced plans to lop off three zeros both plans were halted due to the many uncertainties that stopped officials from reaching an agreement on how to implement them when rouhani s central promise of curbing inflation was delivered in 2016 it was the first time in 26 years that inflation was brought down to single digits a decade after ahmadinejad s botched redenomination the plan has resurfaced but this time things are different on multiple levels for one currency devaluation caused mainly by galloping inflation has continued unabated a major reason behind this is a lack of independence on the part of central banks that for the most part have had to act as mere executors of monetary policies devised by governments most infamously the populist ahmadinejad used the central bank and government budgets to organize cash handouts and a controversial cheap housing megaproject both of which remain unfinished today and represent thorns on the side of the rouhani administration and iran s economic growth at the time of the islamic revolution each u s dollar fetched about 70 rials on the open market when ahmadinejad announced his redenomination plan each greenback was traded for about 10 000 rials a rate that stood at more than 35 000 rials by the time his presidency ended still thanks to reimposed u s sanctions and local mismanagement many iranians surely yearn for that rate today like ahmadinejad rouhani s central bank managed to stabilize foreign exchange rates roughly at their previous levels during his first tenure but a vastly different picture has emerged since rouhani began his second term in office in august 2017 and donald trump came to power in the united states the rial hit an all time low of 190 000 rials on the black market shortly after the rouhani trump showdown at the united nations general assembly in late september 2018 forming a currency crisis it has since regained some lost ground on the back of the central bank s intervention and is now traded at around 120 000 to the dollar the cbi put the inflation rate for the 12 months finishing in november at 18 4 percent but has since stopped disclosing inflation figures allegedly to prevent further confusion emanating from a discrepancy with figures published by the statistical center of iran estimates say inflation now stands at higher than 35 percent compared with below 10 percent a year ago but in addition to the currency crisis and inflation the local political landscape is also different this time there is much more cooperation between rouhani s administration and parliament in terms of reaching economic solutions for months parliament s economic commission has been reviewing and gradually passing bank reforms that promise to deliver the biggest changes to iran s banking system in decades including granting the cbi more independence therefore the currency redenomination bill could become a good addition to much larger banking and monetary reforms that are the product of active cooperation between the government and parliament but to become law it would still need to be approved by the powerful guardian council after receiving the approval of parliament the council s clerics have raised no objections to redenomination so far and there is a consensus on all levels of the establishment that the banking system is in dire need of reforms also promising is the fact that officials are seemingly aware of the benefits and limitations of currency redenomination after a cabinet meeting on jan 9 cbi gov hemmati told reporters that the central bank does not expect too much from redenomination we re not saying it will have an impact on economic growth and inflation we know it s a cosmetic move we re doing it to facilitate payments and save on printing costs he said this shows officials view it only as a component of much larger necessary reforms the iranian government doesn t need to look far to see that if implemented as part of wider financial reforms especially in the beleaguered banking system redenomination could be helpful in several aspects in 2005 neighboring turkey took six zeros off its currency and redenominated the lira in response to an inflation rate of higher than 50 percent the move was relatively successful because it was implemented in tandem with wider reforms but turkey s 2018 currency crisis proved immensely challenging and again decreased confidence in the lira mostly due to a problematic banking system turkey s central bank gained independence in 2001 in the aftermath of an economic crisis but that hasn t meant it has been fully free of government meddling slashing four zeros before the end of the rouhani administration when there is hope that the overall iranian economy will also be more stable in a post trump world could indeed decrease spending in several areas the most obvious is money printing total money supply in iran has been growing at an alarming annual rate of about 30 percent for the past decade annual money supply growth has now been decreased to around 20 percent on the back of unanimous warnings even from supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei who called the liquidity volume mindboggling to prevent another budding crisis still iran s total money supply was close to a whopping 17 quadrillion rials at the end of the seventh month of the current iranian year on oct 22 according to the latest cbi figures furthermore if the redenomination bill is passed into law all monetary regulations and auditing books will also be changed to facilitate transactions that will make accounting and auditing processes much easier finally the rial s nominal exchange rate will benefit from simplicity smaller numbers make transactions much easier for businesspeople and the general public to calculate while redenomination won t actually strengthen the rial or boost public purchasing power as a stand alone measure it could have a positive psychological impact on the people they are increasingly dissatisfied with the fact that a single u s dollar fetches tens of thousands of their national currency but authorities also need to recognize that the initial positive psychological impact of currency redenomination will be short lived and could be quickly reversed if high inflation persists the general public especially a hammered middle class knows that taking a few zeros off the rial won t do anything to lift their deteriorating prospects by itself the fact that the government does not view redenomination as a silver bullet solution for high inflation and a weak currency is promising especially since history has shown what price people have had to pay for their leaders lack of policy foresight venezuela cut five zeros off its national currency last august in a move socialist president nicolás maduro said would turn the faltering economy around it came as little surprise that it did nothing to curb the country s hyperinflation that the international monetary fund says will reach 10 million percent in 2019 worst yet zimbabwe slashed 12 zeros off its currency at the height of an economic crisis in 2009 dealing with an astronomical inflation rate that was estimated at 89 7 sextillion percent by the cato institute meant that the move was an absolute failure zimbabwe was forced to ditch its currency altogether in 2009 and opt for the u s dollar south african rand and a basket of other currencies bond notes pegged to the dollar were introduced in 2016 as legal tender but the zimbabwean government may scrap them as well it is highly unlikely that iran s situation will get as bad as venezuela s or zimbabwe s authorities are well aware that iranians patience for economic hardship fueled by corruption and mismanagement is already running thin but those countries still plagued by instability today should serve as cautionary tales to ensure a smooth transition process and to prevent a rebound that would force another redenomination and massive implementation costs a decade down the line iran s government and parliament need to reach a united vision they need to aim for macroeconomic stability through local reforms on the national scale and weather the sanctions storm by working with foreign partners to keep the nuclear deal alive and buoy trade only after achieving those things can they take four zeros off the rial and rebuild public trust in a reinvented national currency
there is corruption at the highest levels of the government the president along with key officials in the government financial institutions corporations and the military quietly move their money out of the stock market and banks and transfer their assets into gold and swiss bank accounts once the members of the elite have safely parked their money away the president suddenly announces a devaluation of nearly 50 of the currency the move stuns the stock market which plunges to epic lows there is a run on the banks as panicked depositors withdraw most if not all of their money the government steps in and takes over the banks the devaluation hits the average citizen hard prices at the supermarket and gas stations almost immediately rise by 50 many businesses go bankrupt and shut down rents rise by 50 many people can t afford the increase get evicted and are homeless many people go begging for food on the streets violent crime skyrockets vigilante groups form to protect neighborhoods from criminals it happened in mexico a future scenario no all this actually happened in 1982 but not in the united states it happened in mexico where i was living at the time some commentators speculate about what might happen in a future economic collapse we hear many different theories about how the banks might react how the government might respond and what panicked investors might do well 36 years ago i survived an economic collapse not a total collapse but it was bad enough following is my story of what actually happened before during and after an economic collapse how i survived it and lessons i learned from it i moved to mexico in 1979 with the idea of supporting myself teaching english as a second language esl this actually worked well for a while as i worked not only for a university extension school but also taught esl lessons to several companies in private industry including employees at factories businesses and even the military sector things were going well until 1982 the economy was more or less normal businesses were more or less thriving and many people were prospering of course this is mexico so the standard of living is lower than the united states or else we wouldn t have the steady parade of people crossing our border looking for a better life for the mexicans living at poverty level conditions are always difficult but for the middle class in mexico most of these people are able to get by get an education and a profession there is a large and growing middle class in mexico now for the upper class life is generally always easy at least financially 1982 was an election year but back then the partido revolutionario institucional pri party was firmly entrenched and it was a foregone conclusion that every new president was going to be a pri member and for a single six year term the president of mexico in 1970 76 was luis echeverria and just before the end of his term there was a massive devaluation of the peso it went from 12 50 to the dollar to 22 69 for a loss of 82 of buying power prices for food gas rent and everything else skyrocketed a devastating devaluation the devaluation devastated the middle class and especially the poor no wonder people flee to the u s it s impossible to support a family on wages that range from 1 2 a day which is what a farmworker earns there but the devaluation didn t affect the very rich especially those who were part of the elite yes we ve all heard of the elite and they are worldwide and they are in mexico according to many reports i read and heard at the time what happened was that the so called ricos the rich elite were warned by the outgoing president and his cronies that a devaluation was coming and to prepare for it so what did they do they immediately yanked out most or all of their money from mexican banks and deposited their cash into american and swiss banks then after the devaluation was over most of them promptly withdrew most of their money from the american and swiss banks and re deposited their money in the mexican banks again where it earned a very attractive 20 interest so there was a history linking devaluation to the end of a president s term based on that 1976 partial collapse therefore when 1982 came along a lot of people were fearful that history might repeat itself so many people were fearful of a devaluation that they switched their accounts in mexican banks from the peso to the dollar an option the banks were offering that seemed at the time to be the wise safe choice echevarria s successor as president was jose lopez portillo 1976 1982 in august 1982 near the end of portillo s term mexico defaulted on its sovereign debt due to government deficit spending and a reduction in demand for mexican oil due to increasing prices worldwide in september the government nationalized mexico s private banking system in order to prevent bankruptcy of the private banking sector and imposed comprehensive exchange controls so the government now owns all mexican banks and by extension all the deposits should they decide to use them the crippling blow however was when the government devalued the peso by nearly 50 in relation to the dollar though this helped mexican exports it hit the poor and middle class hard just like the 1976 devaluation of course the elite ricos again were warned by their government insider friends ahead of time and pulled the american swiss bank switch so they effectively sidestepped the crisis an account not really in dollars i ll never forget the day i heard about the devaluation people were in an absolute panic my first thought was to get to the bank i had my money deposited in banamex or banco de mexico the oldest and supposedly safest bank in the country as i walked closer to the bank i noticed a long line of people all looking very nervous finally i got to the teller and said i would like to and then she finished my sentence by saying close your account i said yes i have my account in dollars thinking i was safe from any problems related to the peso wrong she replied of course you may withdraw your money but first we will need to exchange your dollars to pesos at the new exchange rate and then we can give you your dollars wow this is when the reality sets in that it doesn t matter how secure you think you are because a bank or the government or whoever is in charge can do whatever they decide to do at any time to change the rules to protect their interests lesson 1 rules can be broken you think something like that couldn t happen here in the good old u s a think again more on that later rules in banking and government are being broken all over the world something similar happened in the cyprus bail in in 2013 when any depositor with an amount exceeding 130 000 lost 9 9 of their money just like that depositors with amounts less than 130k were clipped for 6 75 of their deposits even if they were insured the banks and the government needed the money to avoid going broke so their board of directors sits around and writes a new rule giving them the authority to charge whatever amount they choose and the depositors can do nothing about it but back to mexico 1982 i walked away from that mexican bank with about half my original deposit prices of groceries and gas almost immediately skyrocketed about 50 products imported from the u s were so expensive they were mostly out of reach for most people my rent was jacked up by 50 everybody else was raising rents leases etc my father in law had bought a chevy blazer a week before the devaluation for about 1 800 in dollars the deal was done the money had changed hands and the paperwork all signed the lady who sold him the vehicle came back to him in a panic demanding that he give her the vehicle back because of the devaluation he refused and told her it was a done deal she finally went away shouting in a fury and then the crime rate jumped before the devaluation crime in mexico was already a huge problem of course we are all aware of the violence accompanying the drug cartels which is getting worse all the time i m referring just to the average person who is unemployed and sometimes gets to the point of stealing to feed his family or to support his drug or alcohol habit in mexico after the devaluation crime got worse my in laws in mexico even had their plastic water tank stolen they would even take the battery out of their vehicle to prevent it from being stolen their house was broken into a few times even though they have bars on all the windows kidnapping for ransom is getting worse all the time when some people are hungry or needy they do desperate things my own apartment was broken into and money stolen how did i survive this crisis i tried to hang on for a while teaching english lessons to private industry in addition to my low paying university extension school job by the end of 1982 though i realized my only future was to move back to the states i did so completing my teacher s credential and worked as a teacher for over 30 years until retiring a few years ago but i will always remember the years i spent in mexico where the average citizen just wants to work without being surprised by a devaluation or some other broken rule to benefit the elite and step on the little guy in part 2 i will discuss the lessons i learned from the mexico devaluation and how they can very well apply to a future economic collapse not only here in the united states but worldwide editor s note part 2 of this article will be posted on wednedsay january 30 2019

as thousands of central americans continued to join an exodus headed toward mexico and the united states government officials from the region met in san salvador on january 15 to discuss the details of a foreign assistance plan mexico ambitiously claims will address the root causes of migration by funding job creation and poverty reduction in central america and southern mexico u s funding for the region continues to support state security forces with track records of human rights abuses and violent repression of social movements following the example of the marshall plan for european reconstruction in the wake of world war ii the government of mexican president andrés manuel lópez obrador is calling for the investment of some 30 billion over five years to stimulate economic development in the region while details remain unclear the northern triangle countries of el salvador guatemala and honduras signed a joint declaration with mexico last month to kick off talks to define the initiative formally called the comprehensive development plan mexico has asked the united states to pitch in though so far the commitment has been paltry under the original marshall plan officially called the european recovery program the united states pumped nearly 13 billion into western europe between 1948 and 1951 the goal was to reconstruct european nations devastated by world war ii liberalize trade and contain communism in the early years of the cold war noam chomsky has argued that the plan was crafted to serve u s corporate interests and laid the groundwork for the rise of transnational corporations though it did contribute to europe s recovery alongside the economic agenda covert cia operations financed with 5 percent of marshall plan funds used a a network of false fronts to undermine socialist and communist labor unions and other social organizations as part of his call for a marshall plan for central america lópez obrador known as amlo has proposed prioritizing development over security in the region signaling that sustainable development in central america is tied to that of mexico mexico says the plan aims to combat the drivers of migration in a comprehensive way as part of a broader effort to ease restrictive immigration policy to improve conditions for central americans in transit meanwhile security remains the top pillar in the u s state department s strategy for central america under which new funding to the region will fall endorsing the agreement between mexico and the northern triangle countries the united nations economic commission for latin america and the caribbean says the plan has the potential to change the paradigm of migration development and cooperation in the region but critics argue that while the situations in the northern triangle are indeed dire and require urgent attention the plan will likely follow in the footsteps of other regional u s backed initiatives that have failed to effectively tackle the underlying causes of migration and instead prioritized militarization and private profits misguided priorities compounded by weak and corrupt government institutions in the region have led to a funding model that not only falls short of tackling root causes but may exacerbate the inequality displacement and failed anti violence policies that drive people to flee their homes in their first place difficult conditions deep institutional crises in the governments of the region rooted at least in part in unrealized promises of peace and democracy after the end of u s backed civil wars in the region leaves many wary of regional leaders will and ability to effectively administer funds in ways that will benefit populations in need while the idea of a marshall plan for central america sounds promising it is unlikely to produce meaningful results without rethinking the ways foreign aid has been allocated and administered critics say i think it is very difficult in these conditions that any plan could change the situations in our countries ursula roldan director of the institute for research and social projection on global and territorial dynamics at the rafael landivar university in guatemala city tells in these times first we would have to stabilize the region through deepening the fight against corruption and through more legitimate elections the crises are deep guatemala is in the grips of a slow motion coup set off by the government s bid to unilaterally boot a un backed anti corruption commission out of the country honduras is still reeling from a 2009 military coup and widely condemned 2017 presidential election both tacitly endorsed by the united states and accompanied by widespread political violence and el salvador set to vote for a new president on february 3 remains locked into a 15 year old iron fist clampdown on gangs that has failed to rein in violent crime geoff thale vice president of programs at the washington office on latin america wola argues it s time to fundamentally rethink foreign aid plans for the region to yield meaningful results in principle a marshall plan for central america is the right thing thale tells in these times but there s a long way from saying that it s a good idea to figuring out how to actually make it work in a way that generates both development and equity in the region that is adequate funded and that is not riddled by corruption and mismanagement in ways that make it ineffective government of criminals bartolo fuentes a honduran journalist and former member of congress tells in these times that the southern mexico development portion of the marshall plan could be promising fuentes helped get the word out last october about the first big caravan from honduras made up of people fleeing violence political persecution poverty and unemployment contrary to trump s rhetoric he says the idea of the caravan was never to enter the united states en masse or by force and some 3 000 central americans opted to request asylum in southern mexico fuentes believes that if salaries are decent employment in mexico could be an attractive option for some hondurans seeking economic opportunities he points to the mexican government s maya train rail project as one potential source of employment for migrant workers indigenous groups in mexico have rejected the project over the government s failure to consult their communities while environmentalist warn of impacts on forests and wildlife habitat in southern states but fuentes argues that investment in honduras administered by the government of president juan orlando hernández sworn in for a controversial second term one year ago after a highly questioned presidential election would be a lost cause we have a corrupt government he says rhyming off a raft of underfunded public programs like health and education as well as a slew of high profile government corruption scandals including the arrest of the president s brother in miami on drug trafficking charges in few words we need a change of government says fuentes this is a government of criminals as long as those people there will be no plan for prosperity that really works neither by mexico nor the united states doubling down on failed policies fuentes criticism of the united states references an ongoing regional development initiative ostensibly aimed at stemming migration from the region the alliance for prosperity developed under the obama administration the alliance for prosperity includes plans to build a gas pipeline from mexico to central america expand energy infrastructure and logistics corridors coordinate border security across the region and attract foreign investment though initially billed as a 1 billion per year plan over five years the united states has allocated 2 1 billion to the region since 2016 the northern triangle governments have allocated 7 7 billion to the alliance for prosperity in the same period journalist and author dawn paley reported two years ago that the plan proposed as a solution to the increase in unaccompanied central american children arriving in the united states was likely to deepen the refugee crisis because it proposed the same kinds of corporate projects and militarized security that community leaders in the region were fighting to stop far from improving the situation four years on we see increased social and environmental conflict increased militarization increased polarization increased poverty and an ongoing mass exodus she tells in these times of the alliance for prosperity in her book drug war capitalism paley argues that the war on drugs in latin america has provided a pretext for u s backed militarization which in turn pushes the frontiers of global capitalism by opening up land and resources for foreign investment and extraction the 18 year old 10 billion counter narcotics and counterinsurgency program plan colombia for example sold free market economic reforms and military aid as a package deal back in 1998 colombia s then president andrés pastrana arango had called for a kind of marshall plan for colombia a year later he forged plan colombia with then president bill clinton plan colombia utterly failed to curb cocaine production while the human costs of the war soared foreign direct investment hit a high in 2013 at roughly seven times the 2000 level and investment in mining and oil in particular ballooned exponentially the alliance for prosperity follows a familiar playbook we don t have many specific details about the proposed plan at this point paley says of the new marshall plan but based on the fact that funding is supposed to come from international financial institutions and private investors as well as the u s and mexican governments it s unlikely we ll see a departure from the alliance for prosperity the inter american development bank facilitated the creation of the alliance for prosperity and will continue to be one of the partners with which u s support for the marshall plan proposes to work closely along with the world bank international monetary fund and private sector partners such as the overseas private investment corporation rights groups and researchers have warned militarized security paired with development schemes designed to keep riches in the hands of transnational corporations and local elites often exacerbate conditions that drive people to flee home in the first place one of the things that has continuously failed is investment in security which means militarization that doesn t attend to the longer historical realities of a region that is completely stratified alex villalpando professor of pan african studies and latin american studies at california state university los angeles tells in these times many also have raised concern that u s funding for the region continues to support state security forces with track records of human rights abuses and violent repression of social movements more than 50 members of u s congress for example have called for the united states to more rigorously condition foreign aid and loans to honduras police and military in light of rampant impunity for violence against human rights defenders epitomized by the murder of internationally renowned indigenous leader berta cáceres in guatemala military jeeps the united states donated in the name of the war on drugs were deployed last year to intimidate the anti corruption commission the intercept reported for villalpando any talk of a marshall plan for central america is shaped by a racialized logic in the kind of relationship the united states has with central america compared to europe while the united states saw european countries as imperial allies when the marshall plan was rolled out after world war ii washington has long had a paternalistic relationship with central america he explains that s where the idea of a marshall plan falls villalpando says central america has been crucial to the u s s development as an empire and as a global capitalist power a sordid history in response to amlo s push for the central america plan the united states pledged to pitch in 5 8 billion for central america though most of that sum recommits existing funds with over half coming from private investment guarantees washington says the aid proposes to promote institutional reforms and development through public and private investment in the name of promoting a safer and more prosperous central america private investment guarantees for southern mexico total 4 8 billion the trump administration will ask for just 180 million in new bilateral assistance for the region for 2019 wola s thale says the u s contribution remains fictional at this point there s almost no real new money in the proposal the administration made he tells in these times if this is a 30 billion plan we ought to be contributing a larger share aquiles magaña executive secretary of el salvador s national council for the protection and development of migrants and their families believes that the united states has a historical responsibility to address structural causes of migration after decades of intervention in the region unlike other critics he tells in these times that the alliance for prosperity and other u s socio economic investments are a step in the right direction but he also argues that present day funding doesn t measure up to the hundreds of millions of dollars in u s economic and military aid that propped up el salvador s dictatorship during the country s 12 year civil war when washington also sent military advisors to support the salvadoran military suggesting the united states should invest more in regional development u s history in neighboring guatemala and honduras is similarly sordid in 1954 a cia backed coup in guatemala set the stage for 36 years of brutal civil war and genocide against maya indigenous peoples the conflict claimed 200 000 victims mostly at the hands of state forces and aligned death squads meanwhile honduras served as the cold war staging ground for u s counterinsurgency strategy in the region and in the 1980s a secret cia trained military unit terrorized tortured and killed at least 184 dissidents to discourage a revolutionary uprising on honduran soil in the years after the region s peace accords u s free trade policies shaped the region s economies including undermining local agricultural production by flooding local markets with cheap u s imports in 2009 the obama administration refused to cut aid to honduras after the military coup and later endorsed widely boycotted elections that took place under the coup regime and most recently the trump administration appears to be turning a blind eye to constitutional crisis in guatemala central america never managed to deepen its democracies explains rafael landivar university s roldan she says powerful economic interests undermined the transition to democracy and the creation of meaningful public policies after the end of us backed civil wars today we have co opted governments a business sector with too much power no checks and balances on the exercise of power and illicit forces that have controlled judicial and legislative apparatuses she says what we need is to retake the path of democratic reconstruction in these countries the u s administration s plans to request 180 million in new foreign aid for the northern triangle pales in comparison to trump s 5 7 billion request to build 234 miles of a new physical barrier at the border since the announcement of the central america aid trump has focused immigration debate squarely on the wall as the only way to combat what he calls a crisis at the southern border critics argue that the only humanitarian crisis is one of the united states own making as artificially slow processing of asylum seekers left thousands of central americans in limbo at the us mexico border late last year tens of thousands more asylum seekers living in the united states will be impacted as the government shutdown interrupts immigration court hearings meanwhile deterrence policies from obama era efforts to tighten mexico s southern border through programa frontera sur to trump s zero tolerance policies continue to show no signs of slowing the central american exodus a new paradigm against the backdrop of the manufactured border crisis and years of misguided u s responses to central american migration wola s thale believes it is positive that mexico is leading the strategy but berenice valdez rivera public policy coordinator with the institute for women in migration a mexican social organization stresses that amlo should learn from his predecessor s mistakes and move away from failed solutions of militarized borders and increased immigration policing independent of the marshall plan for the region she believes mexico s priorities in responding to the central american exodus in the short term should include simplifying processes for central americans to regularize their status in mexico reducing immigration patrols and raising awareness about and facilitating humanitarian visa options with thousands of central americans on their doorstep mexican immigration authorities will attend to foreigners who arrive in mexican territory with full respect or their human rights offering them a humane reception regularization processes so they can transit the country as well as information and orientation marissa gonzalez ramirez a spokesperson for mexico s national institute for migration told in these times since the latest large group of central americans arrived at its border mexican officials have received over 12 000 requests for humanitarian visas including from 1 897 children and adolescents about three quarters of applicants are from honduras but only a fraction of applicants have received their visas mexico s agreement with the northern triangle countries proposes to address all facets of migration from root causes to transit asylum and deportation processes although these moves appear to be making good on commitments to improve rights of migrants and refugees in transit mexico announced it has closed requests for humanitarian visas some rights groups also have raised concern about processing times being slower than the five days expected noting the uncertainty has prompted some central americans to carry on without waiting for the visa but simultaneously amlo has attracted ire for pushing a plan to create a 60 000 strong national guard critics say the force will continue a militarized public security strategy that far from containing violent crime has perpetuated violence and human rights abuses since former mexican president felipe calderón launched the war on drugs 12 years ago lower house lawmakers overwhelmingly approved the plan which now passes to the senate amlo has called for the final version of the national guard to include a stronger role for the military the move does not inspire confidence that amlo is willing to take a clear step away from militarization as central americans interested in staying in mexico have options to request asylum or one year humanitarian visas it remains unclear what will happen to refugees seeking asylum in the united states under trump s remain in mexico plan the policy requires asylum seekers to wait for their immigration court dates in mexico which could take years mexico has criticized the policy as unilateral but nevertheless has stated the country will accept asylum seekers returned to mexican territory immigration lawyers and human rights groups slam remain in mexico as a logistical nightmare that will put vulnerable asylum seekers at greater risk for valdez rivera ensuring humane treatment of migrants and refugees in transit through mexico as well as effective implementation of a marshall plan for the region will require the government to work closely with human rights and social organizations with decades of frontline experience with these communities development doesn t work without strengthening institutions she says the mexican government needs to be close to civil society organizations in central america and mexico

first monetary policy meeting of 2019 after hiking rates for a fifth time in as many quarters in december but while it has forecast two more hikes for 2019 the darkening global economic outlook convulsing stock markets and a record long government shutdown are clouding the policy picture now fed chairman jerome powell is preaching patience with regard to future rate increases and he s been joined by two other governors and all 12 fed regional bank presidents advertisement advertisement but what happens after such a pause interest rate futures markets currently assign a roughly 20 percent probability for a move above the current 2 25 2 50 percent range for the fed funds target rate at any 2019 meeting a year from now a rate cut is almost as probable as a rate hike most previous fed pauses are associated with the end of a cycle and followed by a change in policy direction yet the current tightening cycle and previous two easing phases have featured mid cycle pauses so how rare would a rate hike resumption be after this newest holding period in both the 2000 2003 and 2007 2009 cutting cycles the fed took at least one hiatus of six months or longer and resumed cuts later

but we also had year over year sales growth in south america and india as well as in north american aftermarket trailer industrial kevin will give you more color on the quarter but we are obviously

flow in share buybacks with the strong cash flow we expect to generate for fiscal 2019 we will continue to be opportunistic in buying back our shares as kevin told you in december we firmly believe

that we had completed a strategic supply agreement with manitowoc to supply a variety of drivetrain products for several types of cranes under its grove brand this conquest win is another step toward establishing meritor as a leader in the commercial off highway industry in north america to that end we are also seeing more heavy haul fleets specking their vehicles with meritor s p600 planetary axle which we specifically engineered for heavy haul oilfield logging and mining applications ry ty developments which provides heavy hauling and off road transportation services for the canadian gas and oil industry recently became the first fleet in the region to order their kenworth trucks with our p600 axle the strength and reliability of meritor s off highway products combined with our vertically integrated operations short lead times ready access to service and support with 24 hour part availability and our long standing relationships on the line haul side of the business are driving demand for meritor s off highway drivetrain solutions on the specialty side of the business we mentioned in december that we are supplying a unique transfer case for navistar on the launch of

2019 now i ll turn the call over to kevin for more detail on the financials and then we ll take your questions kevin a nowlan senior vice president and president trailer components and chief financial officer thanks jay and good morning on today s call i ll review our first quarter financial results and our updated 2019 guidance overall as you heard from jay we delivered a strong start to the final year of our m2019 plan we drove increases in revenue adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin and adjusted eps let s walk you the details by turning to slide eight where you will see our first quarter financial results compared to the prior year sales were 1 038 million in the quarter up 135 million from a year ago driven primarily by higher truck production and increased market share the largest increase came from north america with class 8 production of 24 compared to last year in brazil the truck market recovery continues with q1 production up 21 this year and finally growth in our other north american businesses aftermarket trailer and industrial also contributed to the rise in sales as you can see from the causal on the right we converted on this revenue at about 16 which is in line with our normal expected range included in this conversion is higher earnings performance at our unconsolidated joint ventures which are also capitalizing on the global market conditions this conversion was partially offset by fx headwinds from the strengthening us dollar which reduced sales by 26 million and adjusted ebitda by 6 million compared to the prior year the result is that we generated adjusted ebitda of 119 million with an adjusted ebitda margin of 11 5 a 50 basis point expansion over last year gross margin came in at 13 6 this quarter down from 14 6 a year ago operating at these production levels and in this overall market environment we ve seen some pressure on gross margin primarily driven by higher material freight and other premium costs we do expect gross margin to recover throughout the year as we have not yet fully recover the increases in steel costs that we experienced in the latter half of 2018 additionally we expect to see some benefit from pricing actions in our aftermarket businesses that were implemented in january to mitigate such costs one more point on gross margin due to a recent accounting standard update that we implemented this quarter you ll notice that our gross margin for both this year and last year now reflects the removal from operating expenses of the non service cost component of our pension and retiree medical expense these amounts have been reclassified to the line item other income on our income statement as you move down the table on the left you ll see that we re reporting 90 million of gaap net income from continuing operations which is significantly higher than last year there were two key drivers to this increase last year we recognized 77 million of non cash tax expense arising from the enactment of us tax reform and this year we ve recognized a 31 million gain from remeasuring the maremont asbestos liability i ll be discussing this in more detail in the subsequent slide adjusted income from continuing operations which excludes the impact of both of these items was 69 million resulting in 0 79 per adjusted diluted share 27 increase over last year and finally free cash flow was negative 12 million this quarter compared to an inflow of 15 million in the same period last year higher adjusted income was more than offset by increased incentive compensation payments due to our 2018 financial performance investments in inventory to support stronger revenue and increased capital expenditures as we invested more in supporting our growth opportunities let s move to slide nine which details our first quarter sales and adjusted ebitda for both of our reporting segments in our commercial truck trailer segment sales increased by 16 to 824 million the increase in revenue is primarily driven by higher truck production in north america and increased market share unfavorable foreign currency impacts due to the strengthening dollar only partially offset these gains segment adjusted ebitda was 79 million up 10 million from last year segment adjusted ebitda margin for commercial truck trailer came in at 9 6 roughly flat compared to last year the increase in adjusted ebitda was driven primarily by conversion on higher revenue partially offset by higher material and freight costs sg a expense and fx in our aftermarket industrial segment sales were 257 million up 12 from last year this increase was primarily driven by our north america aftermarket specialty and defense businesses segment adjusted ebitda was 38 million an increase of 6 million or almost 20 compared to last year segment adjusted ebitda margin grew 80 basis points to 14 8 this growth was driven primarily by conversion on higher revenue on slide 10 i wanted to provide an update on the actions of our non operating subsidiary maremont we called it in december we announced that maremont was seeking to create a trust under section 524 g of the us bankruptcy code to resolve our current and future as best as claims last week we announced that maremont and its subsidiaries voluntarily filed cases under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code the remaining key actions include confirmation of the reorganization plan by the codes and funding as a trust primarily with a 28 million contribution and the repayment of an approximately 21 million intercompany loan by meritor as a result of this initiative we recorded a 31 million gain in the first quarter as we remeasured maremont s net asbestos liability to the terms of the reorganization plan which now represents the best estimate of the liability once the bankruptcy process is complete these actions are expected to eliminate approximately 70 of net asbestos liabilities from meritor s balance sheet next i ll review our updated fiscal year 2019 global market outlook on slide 11 although we saw some softening of class 8 truck orders in december the backlog is still almost 300 000 units this gives us confidence that production levels should remain elevated for the rest of our fiscal year therefore we are increasing our production estimate by 10 000 trucks to approximately 330 000 driven primarily by our expectations for a stronger fourth quarter than we are previously anticipating our forecast for the remainder of our market is unchanged so we are keeping volume assumptions at our prior guidance levels for all of these other markets overall solid to strong global end markets continued to support our positive outlook for 2019 based on these updated assumptions you can see we are raising our guidance on slide 12 we now expect revenue to be approximately 4 3 billion up 50 million from our prior guidance we are maintaining our outlook for adjusted ebitda margin at approximately 11 5 in light of our stronger revenue outlook and the incremental conversion we re able to generate we are modestly increasing our investment to support our electrification initiatives this incremental investment is offsetting some of the margin conversion from our higher revenue guide in addition as you think about q2 we do expect to see our normal seasonal trend of increasing revenue sequentially however with the strong production levels we experienced in our first quarter we expect the sequential step up to be much more modest in the next couple of quarters than we see in most years for that reason you should expect any sequential step up in ebitda margin to also be relatively modest with stronger top line revenue we expect to generate an increase in adjusted income from continuing operations this higher income coupled with the repurchase of 3 million common shares we executed in q1 is expected to drive adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of approximately 3 30 per share an increase of 0 20 from our prior guidance this puts us close to 0 50 above our m2019 target and finally we are maintaining our free cash flow outlook at 175 million to 185 million the increase in earnings from revenue growth expected in q4 is expected to be largely offset by a corresponding increase in working capital investment which yields no change to our free cash flow guidance for 2019 as we discussed in our analyst day last month this is the level of cash performance you should expect from meritor to generate as we transition from m2019 to m2022 and it s this level of cash generation that supports our m2022 capital allocation priorities as we focus on investing in strategic growth and returning value to our shareholders we are excited about the positive start to this year which puts us on the path to a successful conclusion of our m2019 plan now we ll take your questions questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of ryan brinkman of jp morgan your line is now open ryan brinkman jp morgan analyst hi great thanks i was wondering if you could provide some more color on your business in china including after caterpillar missed earnings the other day setting a slowdown in that market i see on slide six that your sales in china actually surged in 2018 but just curious if you re seeing any of the same slowdown more recently and maybe if you could remind us with some of your more unique customer end market exposures within china we should be thinking about in the current environment jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president yeah good question ryan we re still expecting the market to be flat this year as compared to last year these segments we re involved in such as with xcmg in construction are holding up similar to what we saw last year as far as the infrastructure projects their product support and then we tend to be at the higher end of the quality spectrum on the on highway and so far that s performing very similar to what it did last year ryan brinkman jp morgan analyst okay great thanks just last one for me too i was hoping you could comment a little bit more in the market share gains you ve had several in the trailer segment just curious who you re winning these from and what the outlook is going forward jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president well i ll begin that i m actually going to ask kevin to talk a little bit about trailers since he s leading that business for us and he and the team have done an excellent job of getting our product development strategies aligned with what the customer markets are demanding and i think that s starting to show in the three wins we talked about today kevin a nowlan senior vice president and president trailer components and chief financial officer yeah as it relates to trailer i mean the performance that we re generating in terms of seeing some market share gains are being driven by our strong delivery performance as well as our high quality product and so we continue to be the leader in that trailer market in terms of supplying loose axle and among the market leaders in tire inflation so strong product strong delivery performance and strong quality have been supportive of us gaining share there ryan brinkman jp morgan analyst very good thanks operator our next question comes from the line of joe spak of rbc capital markets your line is now open joseph spak rbc capital markets analyst thanks good morning congratulations jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president thanks joe joseph spak rbc capital markets analyst i just maybe we could start in commercial truck first of all i m sorry if i missed this i was wondering just how much of an fx headwind was in that segment this quarter and then back at the envelope it looks to us like maybe 75 to 80 of the organic growth was from what i d call market and then maybe the rest was sort of your new business and end market share gains is that do you roughly agree with those numbers jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president on the market share gains i have to come back to you it s probably in the zip code i mean we had tens of millions of dollars of revenue outperformance as i look q1 to q1 on a year over year basis joseph spak rbc capital markets analyst yeah jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president i didn t do the math to see that 25 or so percent but it s probably in that zip code somewhere joseph spak rbc capital markets analyst okay jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president and with respect to the question on the fx headwind the bulk of that headwind is in the commercial truck trailer segment because the aftermarket industrial business is predominantly in north american business they have some european exposure but it s predominantly a north america based business joseph spak rbc capital markets analyst okay and you said it was 26 million is it what for the total company was that the number jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president revenue of the whole company 6 million of ebitda that s right joseph spak rbc capital markets analyst okay and then just in aftermarket if i recall correctly i think you were sort of taking some pricing actions there because that was sort of the area where you were able to offset some of the raw material movements is that what occurred and if so how much of that contributed in the quarter kevin a nowlan senior vice president and president trailer components and chief financial officer yeah i mean part of what we executed in the middle of last year in july of last year we did execute some pricing actions to mitigate some of the costs that we were seeing from a steel perspective and a freight perspective and as we start this new calendar year in january we ve continued to execute pricing actions to reflect any market economics that we re seeing i d also point out in that segment the industrial business is performing well as well and saw some growth and contributed to margin growth there joseph spak rbc capital markets analyst okay and maybe just a follow up then and i think you were sort of previously sort of talking about this business that could get sort of 40 and 50 margins but i think that was before you made some reporting changes so is there any additional sort of color you want to provide sort of what you think the right or the ultimate sort of margin potential of the aftermarket industrial businesses kevin a nowlan senior vice president and president trailer components and chief financial officer yeah i think you obviously saw a big step up in margin on a year over year basis 80 basis points we expect that business to operate north of 14 each quarter as we look ahead through 2019 and that s a step up from what we saw a year ago because you know we did have a couple of quarters in the middle of the year where we operated below 14 on a per diluted basis so we are expecting to operate north of 14 of that business for the year joseph spak rbc capital markets analyst okay thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of james picariello of keybanc your line is now open james picariello keybanc capital markets analyst hi guys so for your joint ventures i mean you had a solid quarter for equity income just wondering if you could talk about you have i think four primary joint ventures at this point can you talk about what drove the upside in the quarter and then how you re thinking about the rest of the year jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president yeah i think thanks james i think you can think about those joint ventures really seeing the benefit of the end market increases and market share gains that we talked about so we have our mexican joint venture sisamex for example that shared in the growth we saw in north america we re seeing the recovery in brazil and that brings masters our breaking joint ventures results along with that and then we ve talked about the strength of india as well and so we have our significant joint venture there with the kalyani group so it s pretty widespread just those joint ventures participating both in our market share gains and the end market increases james picariello keybanc capital markets analyst yeah on the topic of india you have new missions standards hitting you also have a mandatory forced aging at the fleet of replacement greater than 20 years older so what s your outlook on the timing of when you might see some significant pre buy ahead of both of those factors in the market and are you already seeing it or right now is this would you chalk this up to just strong market demand jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president i think it s really primarily strong market demand i think if we would expect maybe late in 2019 but remember india does have some history of pushing off those deadlines because the market at times cannot ramp up capacity to meet the demand required for those changes in regulation and we are making some modest increases in our capacity through our joint venture to make sure we re ready for that but i would say it we would expect at earliest to see the impact of those changes in late 2019 james picariello keybanc capital markets analyst got it appreciate it just last one if i could have you guys quantified the commodity headwind that you expect for fy 2019 in terms of the incremental impact that s it thanks kevin a nowlan senior vice president and president trailer components and chief financial officer yeah i mean in the first quarter on a year over year basis it had a few million dollars of negative impact on us remember steel indices are actually up particularly in north america year over year anywhere from about 20 to 30 most of that increase happened in the latter part of 2018 so it s really just a delay as our recovery mechanism start to kick in and we ll start to see some sequential tailwind from that heading into q2 but if you take a step back in totality for the full year 2019 versus 2018 we expect steel to be a headwind on a net basis high single digit millions and that s embedded in our guidance james picariello keybanc capital markets analyst thanks a lot okay operator thank you our next question comes from the line of mike baudendistel of stifel your line is now open michael baudendistel stifel nicolaus company analyst thank you can you give us some sense i mean these contracts seem pretty significant on the trailer side just what how big those contracts are in terms of revenues and sort of how that fits into your plan to outperform the market kevin a nowlan senior vice president and president trailer components and chief financial officer it s this is kevin i ll speak to that it s a mix i mean a couple of those are solidifying existing positions that we have particularly with wabash and stoughton although they position us to grow with certain product categories with those key customers in the case of great dane there is some conquest business there that we achieved on loose axles and slack adjustors so important growth opportunity for that trailer business michael baudendistel stifel nicolaus company analyst got it so it s a mix of the two i guess also just getting back to the materials cost can you sort of explain why that seems to be impacting the margins on the commercial truck and trailer side but not the aftermarket side and when does it start to be a neutral or on a year over year basis kevin a nowlan senior vice president and president trailer components and chief financial officer for commercial truck remember we have recovery mechanisms with our oe customers that kick in generally on about a six month lag so as we saw steel indices increasing toward the back half of our fiscal year 2018 those mechanisms simply haven t had a chance yet to kick in with aftermarket aftermarket updates its pricing periodically once or twice per year based on overall macroeconomic conditions inclusive of steel and so the aftermarket started pricing for that back in january or back in july of last year and started to see some recovery from the mechanisms from the increase in steel indices that we were seeing last year so they saw a little bit of an improvement sooner than the truck business michael baudendistel stifel nicolaus company analyst got it that makes sense that s all i had this morning thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of colin langan of ubs colin langan ubs investment bank analyst okay great thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a good quarter jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president thank you kevin a nowlan senior vice president and president trailer components and chief financial officer thanks colin langan ubs investment bank analyst more of an accounting question but there was 11 million of other income which typically that s only a couple of million or 0 any color on what that is in the quarter and whether that s a sustainable number kevin a nowlan senior vice president and president trailer components and chief financial officer yes colin this relates to an accounting standard update that we had to implement this quarter so it s actually the reclassification of non service cost component of our pension and retiree medical expense so that s about 9 million that we moved out of gross margin or cost of goods sold that s actually income and moved down to other income we actually recap 2018 numbers as well so you ll see that went from a number that was de minimis to now at the positive 8 million in q1 of a year ago so that s simply an accounting change that we had to make that impacted both last year and this year colin langan ubs investment bank analyst got it okay that make sense and then when we think of share repurchases those 50 million in the quarter is that that the pace we should be thinking about for the rest of the year is that or will it move around through the year jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president all right i think you should remember colin as our cash flows tend to be seasonal where we generate a meaningful portion of our free cash flow in q3 and then we do have some other obligations one of which kevin spoke to the funding of the maremont liabilities that we think are upcoming so we saw a great opportunity in q1 given the price at which our shares were trading and we felt highly confident on our free cash flow projection for the year so we decided to lean out a little in q1 and take advantage of that market disconnect in our evaluation colin langan ubs investment bank analyst got it any can you just remind me of the 200 million authorization for the next two years is there a timeline on that kevin a nowlan senior vice president and president trailer components and chief financial officer the 200 million authorization is open to be able to support repurchase activity through our 2022 planning horizon and so it s just the initial approval that we ll execute on as we generate free cash flow and we see the opportunity to deploy cash accordingly so at this point we re 50 million utilize of that full 200 million 25 done but we ll continue to execute as we see opportunities to deploy cash accordingly colin langan ubs investment bank analyst got it and just lastly any update we covered most of the regions other than south america i mean any update on that business i think you were expecting a small increase is that still on track and how should we think about the potential there with maybe higher incremental because of the low base you re off of jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president well we are seeing a pretty measurable increase year over year over 20 and what we expect in the market 18 to 19 and we still feel confident in that so i think we re feeling good about that and the market with the new government in place the confidence seems to be developing in the country and i would say where we consider to be more optimistic on that market recovering to more normalized levels colin langan ubs investment bank analyst got it and thanks for taking my question operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brian johnson of barclays your line is now open brian johnson barclays bank analyst yes good morning my question is on two fronts just some of the margin in aftermarket and then on evs on the margin i think you alluded to this but what is what we can takeaway from the lack of freight sg a and material offsets in aftermarket in the aftermarket industrial business that it s just shorter cycle pricing and you re able to move those factors up and down so you just it s just basically straight incrementals there kevin a nowlan senior vice president and president trailer components and chief financial officer no i d actually say it s more because we ve reacted to what we ve seen in the market from escalating cost throughout 2018 and we executed some pricing actions in july of last year to mitigate the impact of those so we have seen increased freight cost last year in 2018 and other economic factors and we ve been pricing for it brian johnson barclays bank analyst okay secondly over on the ev front you know we know you guys have 22 prototype programs out there is there any kind of way to bucket what you re spending the ev money on is there kid of a core technology that you spend on across all those programs is it just on each prototype or anyway you kind of think about that and then how that might progress if any of those actually move closer to production jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president yeah i would say brian we re spending you could say approximately 10 million this coming year on both our pure r d and also prototype development where we re not receiving reimbursement from customers so in certain cases we do receive reimbursement from the customer for partial reimbursement of the cost we re incurring but as kevin mentioned in his remarks we ve seen such great opportunities there we ve ramped up the spending a bit from what we had initially expected because of how well the company is performing and the opportunities we re seeing brian johnson barclays bank analyst okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of neil frohnapple of buckingham research your line is now open neil frohnapple the buckingham research analyst hi thanks congrats on a great quarter first i just want to round out the ebitda margin discussion for the year so i mean you guys just delivered an 11 5 adjusted ebitda margin well above the expectations in and again what is historically i think the seasonally lowest quarter of the year so great performance there so could you just talk about some of the puts and takes from a margin perspective for the remainder of the year to get to the 11 5 full year guidance i know you guys cited the increased investment in electrification but on the flip side it sounds like you ll get maybe a sequential tailwind in q2 from steel the pricing initiatives in truck trailer and then expect higher gross margins i think you said so again just wanted to round that out and if you could provide more color that would be great kevin a nowlan senior vice president and president trailer components and chief financial officer okay thanks neil definitely anywhere we re pleased with the fact that we started the first quarter strong 11 5 of 50 basis points year over year is a strong first quarter for us as we look ahead the first thing i would just mention is that typically our second and third quarter we see a much more robust step up from a revenue perspective than we would expect this year because q1 was so strong from a revenue perspective and take last year going from q1 to q3 revenue was up 200 ish plus million from one quarter to the third quarter this year we expect it to be up less than 100 million so there is lot less conversion opportunity as you go from one quarter to the next but we are expecting to continue to convert on that incremental revenue so you re going see a little bit of upside of margin from that but then being offset by some of the additional electrification investment that we ll be making over the couple of quarters starting in our second fiscal quarter so net net we still expect to be around approximately 11 5 for the full year but pretty pleased with the start to the year neil frohnapple the buckingham research analyst okay thanks for the color kevin and then with nafta class 8 production this past quarter coming meaningfully higher than expected due to a surge in build i think in the month of december did that require you to more over time and things like escalated freight cost to serve the market which may have laid on commercial truck trailer margin in the quarter and i guess just curious on relative to what you d expect for the rest of the year jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president the short answer is yes we continue to see so continuing less than optimal efficiency in our operating plans and also some additional premiums as we expedite freight they were within our planning assumptions so and we do have some expectations for the rest of the year that we are running some layered capacity as we speak to it on the margins of our supply relationships and that we have embedded in the guidance that kevin updated the cost of those additional expedited freight and layered capacity suppliers neil frohnapple the buckingham research analyst okay great thank you so much guys jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president thank you neil operator thank you our next question comes from the line of alex potter of piper jaffray your line is now open alexander potter piper jaffray analyst hi thanks good job this quarter guys i guess i have one additional question on electrification deploying more capital for that opportunity which is a good sign i m interested to know if this is something that you re doing opportunistically because you re doing better than what you thought revenue s higher margins are higher so you can redeploy same capital or is that something that you would have likely done anyway jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president well that s a good question i think we in my mind probably would have done it anyway but would have had to allocate where different investments would have been reduced i think with the good news we re seeing in the business we re able to continue to deploy capital to all the opportunities we re seeing and increase that investment in electrification i think as you know under this leadership team through m2016 m2019 and now m2020 we take the targets that we set very seriously and try to manage all our different puts and takes within those targets but certainly because of the strength we re seeing in our business we were allowed to continue to make all the investments required alexander potter piper jaffray analyst okay very good another question on china also i know that historically you ve got more of an off highway focused you mentioned more when it comes to the on highway side of the business there s more premium high end but my understating is that that s also one of the goals of the company i suppose is to increase exposure to the on highway segment there it s a area that you ve historically been under indexed is that has there been any development in that regard what do you expect over the next one two three years jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president yeah there have been developments what i m pleased with is we have an excellent disc brake offering in china so we re starting to see opportunities there that are coming forward in our core axle business we continue to see opportunities on the premium side of the market so the one caution i would give is we will not derogate the margins of the overall company by chasing opportunities in spaces in that market that just don t have the returns required and that s been our challenge over the years is that market has not had the returns for suppliers in our segment that have been acceptable to us so we that s why our growth strategy has been more measured maybe than others alexander potter piper jaffray analyst okay that makes sense and then my last question i guess related to the supply chain in the us still there s as you mentioned expedited freight overtime things of that nature do you think the supply chain is properly capacitized at this point or when do you think that people have their upstream or downstream or whatever the supply bottlenecks are do you think that more investment is likely to be earmarked to address those bottlenecks or do you think we re basically just going to be dealing with the current situation indefinitely until the backlog runs down jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president i ll give a few brief comments and ask kevin to provide additional detail but as we spoke to previously we ve increased some capacity in north america just beginning coming online here in january and that capacity directed at the class 8 market was the investment was primarily directed at our supply base just trying to bring on more capacity and different suppliers so we continued to monitor very closely but have to make some incremental investments to bring on that additional capacity kevin a nowlan senior vice president and president trailer components and chief financial officer this is kevin i ll just i don t have much to add i mean i don t anticipate seeing a significant step up in investment beyond that i think the modest investments we ve made in some supplier tooling to support the strong market that we anticipate at least through the balance of this fiscal year i think that will carry us through this year but i m not expecting to see more from the way of capacity investments beyond that at this point alexander potter piper jaffray analyst okay nice job again guys jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president thanks alex operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of faheem sabeiha of longbow research your line is now open faheem sabeiha longbow research analyst hi good morning guys and congrats on a good quarter just wondering with the acceleration in share repurchases in q1 and the funding of the maremont trust coming up soon can you maybe talk about your appetite may be used debt to make an acquisition if one were to come up over the next quarters jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president well i think the question we ask ourselves and the answer we provided in the roll out of the m2022 plan is we re very pleased with the core business in our ability to grow organically so we continue to look at opportunities and acquisition that are more bolt on in nature and really we do not believe we are interested in a transformational acquisition of the scale that would take us off track on our capital allocation strategy that we laid out in the december analyst day so we have a significant number of opportunities we re constantly evaluating but those tend to be bolt on in nature faheem sabeiha longbow research analyst okay and final question for me can you talk about other opportunities for your gear transfer case within the class 4 and 5 market given the success you had getting on the platform with gm and navistar or maybe any other adjacent markets to that jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president well we do see the investment we ve made and the development of that transfer case and also a brand new assembly line in our laurinburg facility that i spoke about on the call as an opportunity to look at additional market share gains in that area so we don t i don t see anything specifically that will be announcing in the near term but we certainly are continuing to make headway in that market and i think it s very unique technology that navistar appreciated and i think the end market will appreciate as that vehicles rolled out here over the next few months faheem sabeiha longbow research analyst okay thanks operator thank you and i m showing no further questions at this time i d like to turn the call back to carl anderson for any closing remarks carl anderson group vice president finance thank you this does conclude meritor s first quarter 2019 earnings call if you have any follow up questions please feel free to reach out to me directly thank you

boston s colleges are going broke and we may all have to pay what the closure of small schools like mount ida and newbury college means for the city s education system get a compelling long read and must have lifestyle tips in your inbox every sunday morning great with coffee just after noon on april 6 the cafeteria at mount ida college in newton was buzzing with hundreds of students sitting down for lunch suddenly a chorus of phone pings began to sound throughout the hall mount ida president barry brown had just sent mass emails to all students and staff important announcement the subject line read as students tapped the notification on their phones an eerie hush settled over the room while they read the message in unison the email s language was vague but several lines leapt off the phone screens as if in 3 d the financial pressure on small colleges has never been greater our limited resources obligate us mount ida will end its role as an independent college the college founded more than a century earlier was flat broke and would shut down for good after the spring semester every student would have to find a new academic home moments later once the shocking news began to settle in the cafeteria grew loud again but now it was a different kind of loud everyone was running around says josh barrows a freshman at the time everyone was in a panic in boston mount ida s sudden closure sparked a different kind of frenzy attorney general maura healey opened an investigation state senators rigorously questioned the board of trustees chair reporters radio heads and bloviators of all stripes hung on to every new detail coming out of newton each person had their own angle but all shared a singular question how could this have happened it seemed incomprehensible that a 119 year old school could terminate its staff and put approximately 1 000 students on the street with just a few weeks notice the dirty little secret in higher education though is that what happened at mount ida was not an isolated event but merely a painful example of a slow moving emergency that is overtaking american universities one that will only get worse in the coming years after decades of unfettered growth higher education especially in new england is tipping into a sharp decline enrollment is falling skepticism about the value of a college education is soaring and tuitions which have been rising steadily for decades seem to have reached the limits of what the public can pay taken together these trends have left this once booming industry looking a lot like a bubble experts predict that closures like mount ida s will soon become commonplace and the facts they marshal to support this prediction are chillingly convincing over the past four years eastern massachusetts alone has seen eight colleges shut down or merge with larger institutions including wheelock college which became a new school within boston university last december within a matter of days news broke that newbury college in brookline and the college of st joseph in vermont would likely shut down after the spring 2019 semester and in january hampshire college in amherst announced it would seek a merger you could see a situation in the not too distant future says state senator eric lesser where potentially dozens of these small private colleges end up closing these days being america s college town is starting to look like one of our greatest liabilities miles away university of massachusetts president marty meehan saw an opportunity the school quickly snapped up mount ida s real estate assumed its 75 million of debt and guaranteed mount ida students acceptance at the umass dartmouth campus meehan viewed the deal as a remarkable value yet mount ida s closure still left him deeply troubled it seemed to confirm his fears about the future of higher ed ultimately we re going to have far too much capacity and not enough demand he told me adding that he felt as if he were standing at ground zero of a growing crisis economist nathan grawe who has written a book on the topic agrees we ve already seen an uptick from eight or so closures per year to 20 just among private nonprofit colleges he says grawe believes many colleges may be able to evolve and survive but other experts predict even more carnage harvard business school professor clayton christensen believes that within a decade around 30 to 50 percent of private colleges will close or merge with another school higher ed consultant michael horn who founded a think tank with christensen in 2007 is slightly more optimistic but his prognosis is still scary i don t think it s going to be 100 institutions disappearing in a year he told me it will be 20 going under each year for 15 years and then you look back and say whoa a quarter of the institutions are gone to be clear prestigious universities such as harvard and mit the ones with endowments the size of a small country s gdp are virtually immune to pressures of the downturn but as you descend the higher ed food chain things look increasingly grim by the time you get to the smaller lower ranking schools that is the majority of higher ed institutions in new england things really get ugly these small colleges are the ones facing an imminent risk of collapse and faculty and administrators around boston are constantly whispering about which will be the next to go it might be tempting to think this is a crisis that affects only higher ed but that couldn t be farther from the truth in boston where it is arguably the linchpin of the entire economy the industry accounts for more than 165 000 jobs and nearly 11 billion in revenue in metro boston according to data from emsi a labor market data firm but even those figures vastly understate its importance to the economy higher ed is the foundation that supports even bigger boston industries including healthcare and tech then there are the students around 374 000 as of 2017 of them pouring money into the local economy through everything from off campus rentals to concert tickets once they graduate they become even more valuable around half of graduates stay in the area becoming our workforce and tax base college is the only industry whose customers turn into residents says jonathan rothwell an economist with gallup in other words if universities can t get their act together one of our most important and iconic industries will be headed for a crisis that will send shockwaves throughout the entire local economy being america s college town is still boston s greatest laurel but these days it s also starting to look a lot like one of our greatest liabilities the end of spring semester is normally the time when college students are rushing to class enjoying the last parties of the school year and upping their library time to cram for finals but last april students at mount ida had their minds on far more pressing matters like finding a new college on april 17 the school s gymnasium served as an emergency shelter of sorts admissions officers from dozens of colleges and universities set up tables hung posters decorated in their school colors and laid out branded pens for the student refugees several of them with their parents in tow i didn t think this school could possibly run out of money says mitchell boudreau a freshman at the time who had done the whole college search process just one year earlier that wasn t really a thought that went through my mind that wasn t the only thing that was different for him and his fellow students this time around coming out of high school applicants tried to convince faceless admissions officers to choose them over their peers for a coveted acceptance letter but now the dynamic had reversed the colleges were courting them it was like they were competing for us says kelsie rainone a former mount ida freshman who attended the fair with her parents rainone felt swarmed by the college reps you walked in and you kind of felt like they were on top of you they were like what s your major what s your major oh we have that rainone recalls but then you find out that they really don t rainone felt like prey it seemed the schools were there she says kind of to take advantage that mount ida had closed oh they have students let s take them meehan was also struck by the sense of desperation i was amazed at the number of small private colleges offering free tuition or deep discounts to any of these students as long as they would come and take a bed says meehan of the schools bringing in students who could pay rent for dorm rooms even if they didn t pay a nickel in tuition would at least stem the schools hemorrhaging losses the whole scene reeked of infomercial pitchmen trying to unload surplus goods you just pay shipping or housing as it were it was a rare window into the desperation of the times and certainly not what colleges want you to see schools prefer to cash in on the myth of scarcity you should be so lucky to get the chance to pay us six figures worth of tuition to attend and tend to highlight carefully curated data such as the number of applications they receive to suggest higher ed is still a growth industry but more applications does not mean there are more college applicants generally just that students are applying to more schools in fact last semester there were 1 9 million fewer students enrolled in higher education programs than there were in the fall of 2011 the public can be forgiven for falling for this sleight of hand because for half a century the story that colleges are still peddling was actually true higher ed s boom years began after world war ii as the g i bill pumped money and students into the industry and the labor market demanded more college educated workers between 1950 and 1990 the number of colleges and universities in the united states almost doubled and the number of students increased from nearly 3 million to more than 13 million the baby boom and the entrance into the workforce of large numbers of women only supercharged the growth in 2010 the population of college students in boston topped 150 000 for the first time then the birth rate in america which had already ebbed to below replacement level in new england took a nosedive during the great recession of 2008 and it s never recovered the great recession did not simply delay births it eliminated them grawe wrote in his 2017 book demographics and the demand for higher education this birth dearth as grawe called it set a time bomb with an 18 year fuse the result is that by 2029 the number of students graduating from new england high schools who are likely to attend four year institutions will be 24 percent lower than it was in 2012 according to grawe s forecasts in other words colleges will be drawing on a much smaller pool of customers the new college competitors treat their students as the product instead of as the customer and shape them into something employers actually want to buy it s not just an economist on a soap box who is worried though a little over a year ago the credit rating agency moody s downgraded the higher education industry s outlook to negative fitch ratings followed suit in december meehan sums up the situation more colloquially it s a perfect storm demographics aren t the only thing contributing to colleges serious financial woes it s also a matter of money management put simply at more and more schools revenues aren t covering costs when i tell that to parents of college age children they are gobsmacked they demand to know how colleges can be cash strapped given the soul crushing amount of tuition they charge nearly 57 percent of median household income at private schools more than triple the percentage it was in 1970 between 1985 and 2011 in fact the price of a college education increased at more than twice the rate of inflation for consumer goods and well above inflation for healthcare the poster child for runaway costs it literally costs more than the house i m living in one middle class mom tells me if you have two or three kids it s insane to be fair colleges are giving back an inordinate amount of their tuition revenue in the form of grants and financial aid and state appropriations for public universities were slashed by 44 percent per student between 2001 and 2013 that said there s simply no getting around the fact that colleges and universities themselves are largely to blame for unaffordable tuition and the industry s spreading financial malaise when all the demographic and economic trends were in their favor colleges happily jacked up tuition and parents kept paying federal financial aid programs were supposed to make college more affordable by giving money to students but may have had the opposite effect some economists including experts at the federal reserve bank of new york have argued that when colleges noticed their students had more money to spend in the form of guaranteed loans they simply kept raising prices with all that dough rolling in colleges acquired some pretty bad habits including what ohio university economist richard vedder calls administrative bloat between 1976 and 2011 the number of students and faculty at colleges and universities roughly doubled but during the same period non teaching staff almost quadrupled according to vedder s forthcoming book restoring the promise administrators and universities have taken on more and more self appointed tasks he says one of his favorite examples is the university of michigan which employs almost 100 full time diversity officers at a cost of a cool 11 million a year these new administrators don t teach a single student he says they don t do a lick of research perhaps as a result of the skyrocketing costs many would be students are deciding against college or having second thoughts even after they ve begun one of the factors that helped sink mount ida was that between the spring and fall of 2013 a significant portion of the freshman class decided not to return as if on cue leaner postsecondary options have sprung up in the form of boot camps certificate programs and online four year degree programs all of which are poised to break the academy s lucrative monopoly on access to the middle class and the american dream their central pitch is that they ve turned the business model on its head colleges like beach resorts invest heavily in fancy buildings and amenities to attract customers but these new competitors treat their students as the product instead of as the customer and shape them into something employers actually want to buy i saw this play out firsthand when a friend of mine was in his twenties his parents spent around 200 000 on an elite college education when he graduated with a 3 8 gpa he got a job working long hours for 40 000 a year at a tech startup i didn t know where my career was going he says then he convinced his boss to foot the bill for a 10 000 coding boot camp after the three month course he returned to the same company as a web developer making 80 000 a year it doesn t take a finance degree from a fancy college to figure out which of his education investments produced a better return with all of their in house brain power it s easy to assume that colleges are hard at work finding solutions to address the demographic and economic pressures they face but according to david strauss a higher ed consultant at art science group all too often college presidents simply are not willing or are too constrained by their own bureaucracies to make the substantive changes needed to adapt strauss received distress calls from two administrators at the same liberal arts college asking for his help he declined to name the school strauss met the president and listened as he explained how his college was suffering from a drop in enrollment the president told strauss he had hired seven firms to try to improve his school s admissions office in hopes of attracting more students although these previous efforts hadn t worked the president was not interested in doing anything else and insisted strauss examine his admissions office too i said to him i can t vouch for these other seven firms and the work they did for you but i can tell you how albert einstein defined insanity on other end of the spectrum some administrators are taking a scorched earth approach last january marygrove college a small liberal arts school in detroit discontinued its undergraduate program and continued offering only master s degrees last year the university of wisconsin stevens point proposed discontinuing majors in english history philosophy and other liberal arts disciplines strauss believes that significant numbers of colleges may not close but will just become unrecognizable and you ll wonder why they exist except to have survived other colleges in the face of an eroding financial position respond by spending even more to attract new students but their investments often only make their problems worse the hechinger report an education news outlet found that since 2012 colleges and universities have created more than 40 000 new degrees and certificates an analysis by eduventures another higher ed consultancy found more than a dozen virtually empty degree programs racking up costs but generating little revenue in 2016 for example 15 schools with recently added casino management majors produced a grand total of 34 graduates the first economic impacts we will see from the college downturn are significant layoffs in the higher education sector colleges and universities find themselves stuck in a double bind if they invest they drive up the costs that are sending some careening toward insolvency but if they don t students stop showing up it doesn t help that their customer base is ultimately a bunch of fickle 18 year olds who like shiny objects just take a look at the massive multimillion dollar dorms sprouting up around town that s the way they re competing harvard business school s christensen says it s not who has the best courses but who has the best dormitories vedder derisively calls the university building spree the edifice complex fancy student centers and athletic complexes only add to students shock once they graduate to the real world when many can t afford a membership to the ymca that complex is part of the story of how mount ida fell apart in 2012 brown embarked on a modernization project to make the small school s campus more attractive to prospective students thirty million dollars later mount ida had a gleaming new student center and a state of the art media lab but was insolvent fixed campus costs says horn the consultant become a noose around you the president of newton s lasell college michael alexander has spent the past decade obsessed with the financial structure of an undergraduate education which he considers to be the single biggest problem facing higher ed he is a member of a small group of innovative college presidents who are cost conscious and not particularly troubled by flouting academic convention not surprisingly many of them hail from the private sector after a career in media entertainment and tech alexander assumed the presidency of lasell in 2007 and quickly got to work cutting costs he sold the services of lasell s in house it staff to another college to offset his technicians salaries shared some athletic facilities with nearby brandeis university and fired his health insurance carrier to pool resources with other colleges so they could insure themselves but he was still far short of his goal of delivering an undergraduate education for 30 to 50 percent less than the typical cost so last fall he launched a program called lasell works a novel hybrid of traditional and online education with students spending their sophomore year living off campus working part time and taking all of their courses online the savings amount to a 22 000 reduction in total tuition last year lasell gave every admitted freshman the option to enroll in lasell works we were hoping 22 would sign up alexander told me instead nearly triple that number opted in more than 15 percent of the fall 2018 freshman class that level of enthusiasm has to make you wonder if more students would be eager to see a re coding of the traditional college dna even if the old hands of higher ed aren t another leader of alexander s ilk is helen drinan a bank executive turned president of simmons university in the fenway when she took the helm in 2008 she was astounded by the opaque accounting methods the college used instead of comparing revenues to expenses the school measured financial performance in terms of the growth of all of its net assets counting things like the endowment s investment gains this is like consulting your brokerage account to see if your monthly budget is square drinan and her chief financial officer redid the books and discovered the school had been operating at a loss for three years no one had known the really bad news is that this kind of accounting is an industry standard her discovery of a budget shortfall provided drinan with a key insight an undergraduate program on its own is a barely viable proposition it breaks even at best she tells me graduate programs on the other hand have less overhead and attract working professionals who are not only more willing to pay the full sticker price for their education but don t require food and housing the problem was that there weren t enough potential grad students in new england so she took the programs online at first she says she got fierce pushback from the school community you re going to ruin simmons reputation she remembers alumni and donors telling her but there was no arguing with the money that the online courses were producing 26 million in net revenue last year simmons isn t the only college seeking to grow outside its local market some new england institutions with deeper pockets are doing it in brick and mortar form middlebury college acquired and rebranded the monterey institute of international studies which gave the school access to a new market of students and donors northeastern university built satellite campuses in charlotte a white collar boomtown where the school sells locals career advancing degrees in silicon valley and in seattle it also crossed the border opening a campus in toronto according to data collected by the cross border education research team at the state university of new york at albany and penn state 61 american colleges are tapping into foreign student markets by building campuses abroad 17 of which are in china other schools are confronting the looming crisis by implementing innovative programs to address students fears about graduating with crushing debt or failing to land a job in 2016 purdue university rolled out income share agreements under which students agree to pay back a percentage of their income to the university for about 7 to 10 years after graduating which decreases the amount of loans the isas reassured students that they wouldn t be servicing mountains of debt on barista wages and forced purdue to take an interest in setting them up for successful careers meanwhile depauw university in indiana guarantees its students that if they don t have a full time gig six months after graduating the school will get them a job itself it puts schools incentives squarely behind the students incentives horn says back on simmons campus drinan s can do attitude and sanguine view of the school s prospects made me wonder if she was ignoring the problems in the broader landscape but when i asked her if she believed in the prediction of an imminent wave of college closures she put my question to rest immediately i absolutely believe it she said who s going to succumb i asked not simmons she said breaking out in laughter although the coming downturn is top of mind for higher ed insiders there has been surprisingly little discussion of it in political or economic circles worse yet to date no one not the state the city or the dozens of higher ed institutions that may be affected has conducted a rigorous study of the broader economic impact of the looming crisis there seems little doubt however that in a town as dependent on higher ed as boston the impact will be significant with everyone else seemingly asleep at the wheel i enlisted some economists to do some back of the envelope estimates what they found isn t pretty the first economic impacts we will see from the college downturn are significant layoffs in the higher ed sector if grawe s predictions hold rothwell the gallup economist says that we could reasonably expect a 10 to 15 percent reduction in boston s 165 000 higher ed jobs worse still according to the labor market data firm emsi every higher ed job in boston creates 0 7 jobs in other economic sectors that means we could lose a total of 28 000 jobs under the more conservative 10 percent estimate at that same rate emsi also estimates a 1 7 billion loss in direct economic activity and a loss of 112 million in tax revenue retail real estate healthcare and various white collar services would be hit especially hard then there s the matter of the higher ed industry s most valuable product graduates in a 2015 study rothwell found that every college graduate was worth an incremental 278 000 to the economy compared to a high school graduate just in the form of extra spending at local businesses for every college grad the area loses we lose that much cash as well the loss of talent the lifeblood of boston s knowledge based industries is harder to quantify but no less worrying fewer graduates means fewer high value workers that would pose a serious problem for boston s economy considering that our human capital is what lures big employers to set up shop here of course a reasonable person could look at boston s economy or even the local higher ed sector today and push back against the doom and gloom predictions after all the number of higher ed jobs in metro boston has actually increased every year but one since 2012 but what many experts would say to all those reasonable people is just wait and also brace yourself the 18 year fuse lit by the great recession s birth dearth is still burning the bomb goes off in 2026 that s when we go from the waning demand of today to the bottom falling out and the industry being in free fall the closures of small institutions are a warning sign like the tide racing out before the arrival of a tsunami and those signs continue to appear as i finished work on this story in december brookline s newbury college announced that the spring 2019 semester would likely be its last a now familiar ritual began neighboring schools swooped in like vultures to whisk away newbury s most valuable remaining resource its paying students since mount ida s closure some of these schools seem to have refined their methods perhaps anticipating that recruiting displaced students will soon become a permanent feature of their business model just before christmas curry college set up a slick purpose built web page and advertised it on facebook click on the link and you see an enticing panoramic drone shot of curry s verdant milton campus the website s tag at the top of the screen reads curry college welcomes newbury college students also seeking enrollees fisher college sent newbury students emails with their names in the subject line followed with your journey continues at fisher college that might not have been the most reassuring choice of words considering the very real risk of closure facing the region s small colleges what newbury students including one unfortunate young woman who had transferred there from mount ida likely want to know is not just where their college education will continue but where it will end

jay jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president thanks carl and good morning let s turn to slide three we had a great first quarter with total company revenue up 135 million from a year ago the adjusted ebitda margin was 11 5 and we generated 0 79 of adjusted diluted eps higher truck production combined with market share gains in north america drove the majority of the revenue increase but we also had year over year sales growth in south america and india as well as in north american aftermarket trailer industrial kevin will give you more color on the quarter but we are obviously pleased to begin the year with such excellent financial performance with our strong first quarter performance and a higher class 8 market than previously expected we are raising our revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share outlook for the year on slide four we provided an update on the 200 million equity repurchase program we announced in november you ll recall that our board of directors had just approved this additional share buyback program following the completion of our previous program in the first fiscal quarter of 2019 we utilized 50 million under this recent authorization to repurchase another 3 million shares which now completes 25 of the new program as we referenced last month at analyst day since 2014 we ve invested about half the company s free cash flow in share buybacks with the strong cash flow we expect to generate for fiscal 2019 we will continue to be opportunistic in buying back our shares as kevin told you in december we firmly believe that our ability to generate cash flow and deploy that cash to create shareholder value is the most underappreciated aspect of meritor s story on the next couple of slides we want to highlight growth in our trailer off highway and specialty businesses we have recently signed three significant contracts for new trailer business as you ll see on slide five last month we told you about the three year renewal with wabash that maintains meritor s loose axles in standard position ph on all wabash dry and refrigerated van trailer products also with this contract the meritor tire inflation system is the preferred automatic tire inflation system optional products for all wabash configurations include air disc brakes the trailing arm suspension and our recently launched mtec6 trailer axle we are also excited to announce today that we have signed a two year agreement with great dane this is a conquest win that gives us standard position for loose axles and automatic slack adjusters this is a meaningful word that allows us to strengthen our relationship with great chain in these product lines and also provides further revenue opportunity with this important customer in addition we now have standard position with stoughton for loose axles and preferred position for mtis with these agreements meritor has solidified its position with three of the top six trailer manufacturers moving to slide six you will see some examples of the growth we have achieved in off highway and specialty growing these businesses is a key priority for us in our m2019 and m2022 plans we announced in december that we had completed a strategic supply agreement with manitowoc to supply a variety of drivetrain products for several types of cranes under its grove brand this conquest win is another step toward establishing meritor as a leader in the commercial off highway industry in north america to that end we are also seeing more heavy haul fleets specking their vehicles with meritor s p600 planetary axle which we specifically engineered for heavy haul oilfield logging and mining applications ry ty developments which provides heavy hauling and off road transportation services for the canadian gas and oil industry recently became the first fleet in the region to order their kenworth trucks with our p600 axle the strength and reliability of meritor s off highway products combined with our vertically integrated operations short lead times ready access to service and support with 24 hour part availability and our long standing relationships on the line haul side of the business are driving demand for meritor s off highway drivetrain solutions on the specialty side of the business we mentioned in december that we are supplying a unique transfer case for navistar on the launch of its international cv series class 4 and 5 truck these trucks will feature meritor s two speed gear driven transfer case with 3 000 pound per foot capacity and electric shifting controls we are the first into market a gear driven transfer case for this class of trucks we have started production of this product in our laurinburg plant in north carolina where we have made a significant investment to support the expansion of our industrial business shifting next to electrification on slide seven we were proud to be featured at the recent ces technology show as peterbilt unveiled its new class 6 pick up and delivery truck with ces being the global stage for next generation innovations it was exciting to be highlighted as the supplier in collaboration with transpower of peterbilt s 220 electric drive system shown here with peterbilt s head of engineering our relationship with transpower continues to grow with an additional investment we recently made into the company the full system solutions available through transpower as well as our own proprietary eaxle currently in development makes meritor an excellent choice for electric vehicle manufacturers around the world which is evident by our growing customer base in closing i m pleased with our performance in the first quarter and with our outlook for the fiscal year we are on track to achieve another successful year in 2019 now i ll turn the call over to kevin for more detail on the financials and then we ll take your questions kevin a nowlan senior vice president and president trailer components and chief financial officer thanks jay and good morning on today s call i ll review our first quarter financial results and our updated 2019 guidance overall as you heard from jay we delivered a strong start to the final year of our m2019 plan we drove increases in revenue adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin and adjusted eps let s walk you the details by turning to slide eight where you will see our first quarter financial results compared to the prior year sales were 1 038 million in the quarter up 135 million from a year ago driven primarily by higher truck production and increased market share the largest increase came from north america with class 8 production of 24 compared to last year in brazil the truck market recovery continues with q1 production up 21 this year and finally growth in our other north american businesses aftermarket trailer and industrial also contributed to the rise in sales as you can see from the causal on the right we converted on this revenue at about 16 which is in line with our normal expected range included in this conversion is higher earnings performance at our unconsolidated joint ventures which are also capitalizing on the global market conditions this conversion was partially offset by fx headwinds from the strengthening us dollar which reduced sales by 26 million and adjusted ebitda by 6 million compared to the prior year the result is that we generated adjusted ebitda of 119 million with an adjusted ebitda margin of 11 5 a 50 basis point expansion over last year gross margin came in at 13 6 this quarter down from 14 6 a year ago operating at these production levels and in this overall market environment we ve seen some pressure on gross margin primarily driven by higher material freight and other premium costs we do expect gross margin to recover throughout the year as we have not yet fully recover the increases in steel costs that we experienced in the latter half of 2018 additionally we expect to see some benefit from pricing actions in our aftermarket businesses that were implemented in january to mitigate such costs one more point on gross margin due to a recent accounting standard update that we implemented this quarter you ll notice that our gross margin for both this year and last year now reflects the removal from operating expenses of the non service cost component of our pension and retiree medical expense these amounts have been reclassified to the line item other income on our income statement as you move down the table on the left you ll see that we re reporting 90 million of gaap net income from continuing operations which is significantly higher than last year there were two key drivers to this increase last year we recognized 77 million of non cash tax expense arising from the enactment of us tax reform and this year we ve recognized a 31 million gain from remeasuring the maremont asbestos liability i ll be discussing this in more detail in the subsequent slide adjusted income from continuing operations which excludes the impact of both of these items was 69 million resulting in 0 79 per adjusted diluted share 27 increase over last year and finally free cash flow was negative 12 million this quarter compared to an inflow of 15 million in the same period last year higher adjusted income was more than offset by increased incentive compensation payments due to our 2018 financial performance investments in inventory to support stronger revenue and increased capital expenditures as we invested more in supporting our growth opportunities let s move to slide nine which details our first quarter sales and adjusted ebitda for both of our reporting segments in our commercial truck trailer segment sales increased by 16 to 824 million the increase in revenue is primarily driven by higher truck production in north america and increased market share unfavorable foreign currency impacts due to the strengthening dollar only partially offset these gains segment adjusted ebitda was 79 million up 10 million from last year segment adjusted ebitda margin for commercial truck trailer came in at 9 6 roughly flat compared to last year the increase in adjusted ebitda was driven primarily by conversion on higher revenue partially offset by higher material and freight costs sg a expense and fx in our aftermarket industrial segment sales were 257 million up 12 from last year this increase was primarily driven by our north america aftermarket specialty and defense businesses segment adjusted ebitda was 38 million an increase of 6 million or almost 20 compared to last year segment adjusted ebitda margin grew 80 basis points to 14 8 this growth was driven primarily by conversion on higher revenue on slide 10 i wanted to provide an update on the actions of our non operating subsidiary maremont we called it in december we announced that maremont was seeking to create a trust under section 524 g of the us bankruptcy code to resolve our current and future as best as claims last week we announced that maremont and its subsidiaries voluntarily filed cases under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code the remaining key actions include confirmation of the reorganization plan by the codes and funding as a trust primarily with a 28 million contribution and the repayment of an approximately 21 million intercompany loan by meritor as a result of this initiative we recorded a 31 million gain in the first quarter as we remeasured maremont s net asbestos liability to the terms of the reorganization plan which now represents the best estimate of the liability once the bankruptcy process is complete these actions are expected to eliminate approximately 70 of net asbestos liabilities from meritor s balance sheet next i ll review our updated fiscal year 2019 global market outlook on slide 11 although we saw some softening of class 8 truck orders in december the backlog is still almost 300 000 units this gives us confidence that production levels should remain elevated for the rest of our fiscal year therefore we are increasing our production estimate by 10 000 trucks to approximately 330 000 driven primarily by our expectations for a stronger fourth quarter than we are previously anticipating our forecast for the remainder of our market is unchanged so we are keeping volume assumptions at our prior guidance levels for all of these other markets overall solid to strong global end markets continued to support our positive outlook for 2019 based on these updated assumptions you can see we are raising our guidance on slide 12 we now expect revenue to be approximately 4 3 billion up 50 million from our prior guidance we are maintaining our outlook for adjusted ebitda margin at approximately 11 5 in light of our stronger revenue outlook and the incremental conversion we re able to generate we are modestly increasing our investment to support our electrification initiatives this incremental investment is offsetting some of the margin conversion from our higher revenue guide in addition as you think about q2 we do expect to see our normal seasonal trend of increasing revenue sequentially however with the strong production levels we experienced in our first quarter we expect the sequential step up to be much more modest in the next couple of quarters than we see in most years for that reason you should expect any sequential step up in ebitda margin to also be relatively modest with stronger top line revenue we expect to generate an increase in adjusted income from continuing operations this higher income coupled with the repurchase of 3 million common shares we executed in q1 is expected to drive adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of approximately 3 30 per share an increase of 0 20 from our prior guidance this puts us close to 0 50 above our m2019 target and finally we are maintaining our free cash flow outlook at 175 million to 185 million the increase in earnings from revenue growth expected in q4 is expected to be largely offset by a corresponding increase in working capital investment which yields no change to our free cash flow guidance for 2019 as we discussed in our analyst day last month this is the level of cash performance you should expect from meritor to generate as we transition from m2019 to m2022 and it s this level of cash generation that supports our m2022 capital allocation priorities as we focus on investing in strategic growth and returning value to our shareholders we are excited about the positive start to this year which puts us on the path to a successful conclusion of our m2019 plan now we ll take your questions questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of ryan brinkman of jp morgan your line is now open ryan brinkman jp morgan analyst hi great thanks i was wondering if you could provide some more color on your business in china including after caterpillar missed earnings the other day setting a slowdown in that market i see on slide six that your sales in china actually surged in 2018 but just curious if you re seeing any of the same slowdown more recently and maybe if you could remind us with some of your more unique customer end market exposures within china we should be thinking about in the current environment jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president yeah good question ryan we re still expecting the market to be flat this year as compared to last year these segments we re involved in such as with xcmg in construction are holding up similar to what we saw last year as far as the infrastructure projects their product support and then we tend to be at the higher end of the quality spectrum on the on highway and so far that s performing very similar to what it did last year ryan brinkman jp morgan analyst okay great thanks just last one for me too i was hoping you could comment a little bit more in the market share gains you ve had several in the trailer segment just curious who you re winning these from and what the outlook is going forward jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president well i ll begin that i m actually going to ask kevin to talk a little bit about trailers since he s leading that business for us and he and the team have done an excellent job of getting our product development strategies aligned with what the customer markets are demanding and i think that s starting to show in the three wins we talked about today kevin a nowlan senior vice president and president trailer components and chief financial officer yeah as it relates to trailer i mean the performance that we re generating in terms of seeing some market share gains are being driven by our strong delivery performance as well as our high quality product and so we continue to be the leader in that trailer market in terms of supplying loose axle and among the market leaders in tire inflation so strong product strong delivery performance and strong quality have been supportive of us gaining share there ryan brinkman jp morgan analyst very good thanks operator our next question comes from the line of joe spak of rbc capital markets your line is now open joseph spak rbc capital markets analyst thanks good morning congratulations jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president thanks joe joseph spak rbc capital markets analyst i just maybe we could start in commercial truck first of all i m sorry if i missed this i was wondering just how much of an fx headwind was in that segment this quarter and then back at the envelope it looks to us like maybe 75 to 80 of the organic growth was from what i d call market and then maybe the rest was sort of your new business and end market share gains is that do you roughly agree with those numbers jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president on the market share gains i have to come back to you it s probably in the zip code i mean we had tens of millions of dollars of revenue outperformance as i look q1 to q1 on a year over year basis joseph spak rbc capital markets analyst yeah jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president i didn t do the math to see that 25 or so percent but it s probably in that zip code somewhere joseph spak rbc capital markets analyst okay jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president and with respect to the question on the fx headwind the bulk of that headwind is in the commercial truck trailer segment because the aftermarket industrial business is predominantly in north american business they have some european exposure but it s predominantly a north america based business joseph spak rbc capital markets analyst okay and you said it was 26 million is it what for the total company was that the number jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president revenue of the whole company 6 million of ebitda that s right joseph spak rbc capital markets analyst okay and then just in aftermarket if i recall correctly i think you were sort of taking some pricing actions there because that was sort of the area where you were able to offset some of the raw material movements is that what occurred and if so how much of that contributed in the quarter kevin a nowlan senior vice president and president trailer components and chief financial officer yeah i mean part of what we executed in the middle of last year in july of last year we did execute some pricing actions to mitigate some of the costs that we were seeing from a steel perspective and a freight perspective and as we start this new calendar year in january we ve continued to execute pricing actions to reflect any market economics that we re seeing i d also point out in that segment the industrial business is performing well as well and saw some growth and contributed to margin growth there joseph spak rbc capital markets analyst okay and maybe just a follow up then and i think you were sort of previously sort of talking about this business that could get sort of 40 and 50 margins but i think that was before you made some reporting changes so is there any additional sort of color you want to provide sort of what you think the right or the ultimate sort of margin potential of the aftermarket industrial businesses kevin a nowlan senior vice president and president trailer components and chief financial officer yeah i think you obviously saw a big step up in margin on a year over year basis 80 basis points we expect that business to operate north of 14 each quarter as we look ahead through 2019 and that s a step up from what we saw a year ago because you know we did have a couple of quarters in the middle of the year where we operated below 14 on a per diluted basis so we are expecting to operate north of 14 of that business for the year joseph spak rbc capital markets analyst okay thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of james picariello of keybanc your line is now open james picariello keybanc capital markets analyst hi guys so for your joint ventures i mean you had a solid quarter for equity income just wondering if you could talk about you have i think four primary joint ventures at this point can you talk about what drove the upside in the quarter and then how you re thinking about the rest of the year jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president yeah i think thanks james i think you can think about those joint ventures really seeing the benefit of the end market increases and market share gains that we talked about so we have our mexican joint venture sisamex for example that shared in the growth we saw in north america we re seeing the recovery in brazil and that brings masters our breaking joint ventures results along with that and then we ve talked about the strength of india as well and so we have our significant joint venture there with the kalyani group so it s pretty widespread just those joint ventures participating both in our market share gains and the end market increases james picariello keybanc capital markets analyst yeah on the topic of india you have new missions standards hitting you also have a mandatory forced aging at the fleet of replacement greater than 20 years older so what s your outlook on the timing of when you might see some significant pre buy ahead of both of those factors in the market and are you already seeing it or right now is this would you chalk this up to just strong market demand jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president i think it s really primarily strong market demand i think if we would expect maybe late in 2019 but remember india does have some history of pushing off those deadlines because the market at times cannot ramp up capacity to meet the demand required for those changes in regulation and we are making some modest increases in our capacity through our joint venture to make sure we re ready for that but i would say it we would expect at earliest to see the impact of those changes in late 2019 james picariello keybanc capital markets analyst got it appreciate it just last one if i could have you guys quantified the commodity headwind that you expect for fy 2019 in terms of the incremental impact that s it thanks kevin a nowlan senior vice president and president trailer components and chief financial officer yeah i mean in the first quarter on a year over year basis it had a few million dollars of negative impact on us remember steel indices are actually up particularly in north america year over year anywhere from about 20 to 30 most of that increase happened in the latter part of 2018 so it s really just a delay as our recovery mechanism start to kick in and we ll start to see some sequential tailwind from that heading into q2 but if you take a step back in totality for the full year 2019 versus 2018 we expect steel to be a headwind on a net basis high single digit millions and that s embedded in our guidance james picariello keybanc capital markets analyst thanks a lot okay operator thank you our next question comes from the line of mike baudendistel of stifel your line is now open michael baudendistel stifel nicolaus company analyst thank you can you give us some sense i mean these contracts seem pretty significant on the trailer side just what how big those contracts are in terms of revenues and sort of how that fits into your plan to outperform the market kevin a nowlan senior vice president and president trailer components and chief financial officer it s this is kevin i ll speak to that it s a mix i mean a couple of those are solidifying existing positions that we have particularly with wabash and stoughton although they position us to grow with certain product categories with those key customers in the case of great dane there is some conquest business there that we achieved on loose axles and slack adjustors so important growth opportunity for that trailer business michael baudendistel stifel nicolaus company analyst got it so it s a mix of the two i guess also just getting back to the materials cost can you sort of explain why that seems to be impacting the margins on the commercial truck and trailer side but not the aftermarket side and when does it start to be a neutral or on a year over year basis kevin a nowlan senior vice president and president trailer components and chief financial officer for commercial truck remember we have recovery mechanisms with our oe customers that kick in generally on about a six month lag so as we saw steel indices increasing toward the back half of our fiscal year 2018 those mechanisms simply haven t had a chance yet to kick in with aftermarket aftermarket updates its pricing periodically once or twice per year based on overall macroeconomic conditions inclusive of steel and so the aftermarket started pricing for that back in january or back in july of last year and started to see some recovery from the mechanisms from the increase in steel indices that we were seeing last year so they saw a little bit of an improvement sooner than the truck business michael baudendistel stifel nicolaus company analyst got it that makes sense that s all i had this morning thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of colin langan of ubs colin langan ubs investment bank analyst okay great thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a good quarter jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president thank you kevin a nowlan senior vice president and president trailer components and chief financial officer thanks colin langan ubs investment bank analyst more of an accounting question but there was 11 million of other income which typically that s only a couple of million or 0 any color on what that is in the quarter and whether that s a sustainable number kevin a nowlan senior vice president and president trailer components and chief financial officer yes colin this relates to an accounting standard update that we had to implement this quarter so it s actually the reclassification of non service cost component of our pension and retiree medical expense so that s about 9 million that we moved out of gross margin or cost of goods sold that s actually income and moved down to other income we actually recap 2018 numbers as well so you ll see that went from a number that was de minimis to now at the positive 8 million in q1 of a year ago so that s simply an accounting change that we had to make that impacted both last year and this year colin langan ubs investment bank analyst got it okay that make sense and then when we think of share repurchases those 50 million in the quarter is that that the pace we should be thinking about for the rest of the year is that or will it move around through the year jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president all right i think you should remember colin as our cash flows tend to be seasonal where we generate a meaningful portion of our free cash flow in q3 and then we do have some other obligations one of which kevin spoke to the funding of the maremont liabilities that we think are upcoming so we saw a great opportunity in q1 given the price at which our shares were trading and we felt highly confident on our free cash flow projection for the year so we decided to lean out a little in q1 and take advantage of that market disconnect in our evaluation colin langan ubs investment bank analyst got it any can you just remind me of the 200 million authorization for the next two years is there a timeline on that kevin a nowlan senior vice president and president trailer components and chief financial officer the 200 million authorization is open to be able to support repurchase activity through our 2022 planning horizon and so it s just the initial approval that we ll execute on as we generate free cash flow and we see the opportunity to deploy cash accordingly so at this point we re 50 million utilize of that full 200 million 25 done but we ll continue to execute as we see opportunities to deploy cash accordingly colin langan ubs investment bank analyst got it and just lastly any update we covered most of the regions other than south america i mean any update on that business i think you were expecting a small increase is that still on track and how should we think about the potential there with maybe higher incremental because of the low base you re off of jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president well we are seeing a pretty measurable increase year over year over 20 and what we expect in the market 18 to 19 and we still feel confident in that so i think we re feeling good about that and the market with the new government in place the confidence seems to be developing in the country and i would say where we consider to be more optimistic on that market recovering to more normalized levels colin langan ubs investment bank analyst got it and thanks for taking my question operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brian johnson of barclays your line is now open brian johnson barclays bank analyst yes good morning my question is on two fronts just some of the margin in aftermarket and then on evs on the margin i think you alluded to this but what is what we can takeaway from the lack of freight sg a and material offsets in aftermarket in the aftermarket industrial business that it s just shorter cycle pricing and you re able to move those factors up and down so you just it s just basically straight incrementals there kevin a nowlan senior vice president and president trailer components and chief financial officer no i d actually say it s more because we ve reacted to what we ve seen in the market from escalating cost throughout 2018 and we executed some pricing actions in july of last year to mitigate the impact of those so we have seen increased freight cost last year in 2018 and other economic factors and we ve been pricing for it brian johnson barclays bank analyst okay secondly over on the ev front you know we know you guys have 22 prototype programs out there is there any kind of way to bucket what you re spending the ev money on is there kid of a core technology that you spend on across all those programs is it just on each prototype or anyway you kind of think about that and then how that might progress if any of those actually move closer to production jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president yeah i would say brian we re spending you could say approximately 10 million this coming year on both our pure r d and also prototype development where we re not receiving reimbursement from customers so in certain cases we do receive reimbursement from the customer for partial reimbursement of the cost we re incurring but as kevin mentioned in his remarks we ve seen such great opportunities there we ve ramped up the spending a bit from what we had initially expected because of how well the company is performing and the opportunities we re seeing brian johnson barclays bank analyst okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of neil frohnapple of buckingham research your line is now open neil frohnapple the buckingham research analyst hi thanks congrats on a great quarter first i just want to round out the ebitda margin discussion for the year so i mean you guys just delivered an 11 5 adjusted ebitda margin well above the expectations in and again what is historically i think the seasonally lowest quarter of the year so great performance there so could you just talk about some of the puts and takes from a margin perspective for the remainder of the year to get to the 11 5 full year guidance i know you guys cited the increased investment in electrification but on the flip side it sounds like you ll get maybe a sequential tailwind in q2 from steel the pricing initiatives in truck trailer and then expect higher gross margins i think you said so again just wanted to round that out and if you could provide more color that would be great kevin a nowlan senior vice president and president trailer components and chief financial officer okay thanks neil definitely anywhere we re pleased with the fact that we started the first quarter strong 11 5 of 50 basis points year over year is a strong first quarter for us as we look ahead the first thing i would just mention is that typically our second and third quarter we see a much more robust step up from a revenue perspective than we would expect this year because q1 was so strong from a revenue perspective and take last year going from q1 to q3 revenue was up 200 ish plus million from one quarter to the third quarter this year we expect it to be up less than 100 million so there is lot less conversion opportunity as you go from one quarter to the next but we are expecting to continue to convert on that incremental revenue so you re going see a little bit of upside of margin from that but then being offset by some of the additional electrification investment that we ll be making over the couple of quarters starting in our second fiscal quarter so net net we still expect to be around approximately 11 5 for the full year but pretty pleased with the start to the year neil frohnapple the buckingham research analyst okay thanks for the color kevin and then with nafta class 8 production this past quarter coming meaningfully higher than expected due to a surge in build i think in the month of december did that require you to more over time and things like escalated freight cost to serve the market which may have laid on commercial truck trailer margin in the quarter and i guess just curious on relative to what you d expect for the rest of the year jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president the short answer is yes we continue to see so continuing less than optimal efficiency in our operating plans and also some additional premiums as we expedite freight they were within our planning assumptions so and we do have some expectations for the rest of the year that we are running some layered capacity as we speak to it on the margins of our supply relationships and that we have embedded in the guidance that kevin updated the cost of those additional expedited freight and layered capacity suppliers neil frohnapple the buckingham research analyst okay great thank you so much guys jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president thank you neil operator thank you our next question comes from the line of alex potter of piper jaffray your line is now open alexander potter piper jaffray analyst hi thanks good job this quarter guys i guess i have one additional question on electrification deploying more capital for that opportunity which is a good sign i m interested to know if this is something that you re doing opportunistically because you re doing better than what you thought revenue s higher margins are higher so you can redeploy same capital or is that something that you would have likely done anyway jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president well that s a good question i think we in my mind probably would have done it anyway but would have had to allocate where different investments would have been reduced i think with the good news we re seeing in the business we re able to continue to deploy capital to all the opportunities we re seeing and increase that investment in electrification i think as you know under this leadership team through m2016 m2019 and now m2020 we take the targets that we set very seriously and try to manage all our different puts and takes within those targets but certainly because of the strength we re seeing in our business we were allowed to continue to make all the investments required alexander potter piper jaffray analyst okay very good another question on china also i know that historically you ve got more of an off highway focused you mentioned more when it comes to the on highway side of the business there s more premium high end but my understating is that that s also one of the goals of the company i suppose is to increase exposure to the on highway segment there it s a area that you ve historically been under indexed is that has there been any development in that regard what do you expect over the next one two three years jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president yeah there have been developments what i m pleased with is we have an excellent disc brake offering in china so we re starting to see opportunities there that are coming forward in our core axle business we continue to see opportunities on the premium side of the market so the one caution i would give is we will not derogate the margins of the overall company by chasing opportunities in spaces in that market that just don t have the returns required and that s been our challenge over the years is that market has not had the returns for suppliers in our segment that have been acceptable to us so we that s why our growth strategy has been more measured maybe than others alexander potter piper jaffray analyst okay that makes sense and then my last question i guess related to the supply chain in the us still there s as you mentioned expedited freight overtime things of that nature do you think the supply chain is properly capacitized at this point or when do you think that people have their upstream or downstream or whatever the supply bottlenecks are do you think that more investment is likely to be earmarked to address those bottlenecks or do you think we re basically just going to be dealing with the current situation indefinitely until the backlog runs down jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president i ll give a few brief comments and ask kevin to provide additional detail but as we spoke to previously we ve increased some capacity in north america just beginning coming online here in january and that capacity directed at the class 8 market was the investment was primarily directed at our supply base just trying to bring on more capacity and different suppliers so we continued to monitor very closely but have to make some incremental investments to bring on that additional capacity kevin a nowlan senior vice president and president trailer components and chief financial officer this is kevin i ll just i don t have much to add i mean i don t anticipate seeing a significant step up in investment beyond that i think the modest investments we ve made in some supplier tooling to support the strong market that we anticipate at least through the balance of this fiscal year i think that will carry us through this year but i m not expecting to see more from the way of capacity investments beyond that at this point alexander potter piper jaffray analyst okay nice job again guys jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president thanks alex operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of faheem sabeiha of longbow research your line is now open faheem sabeiha longbow research analyst hi good morning guys and congrats on a good quarter just wondering with the acceleration in share repurchases in q1 and the funding of the maremont trust coming up soon can you maybe talk about your appetite may be used debt to make an acquisition if one were to come up over the next quarters jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president well i think the question we ask ourselves and the answer we provided in the roll out of the m2022 plan is we re very pleased with the core business in our ability to grow organically so we continue to look at opportunities and acquisition that are more bolt on in nature and really we do not believe we are interested in a transformational acquisition of the scale that would take us off track on our capital allocation strategy that we laid out in the december analyst day so we have a significant number of opportunities we re constantly evaluating but those tend to be bolt on in nature faheem sabeiha longbow research analyst okay and final question for me can you talk about other opportunities for your gear transfer case within the class 4 and 5 market given the success you had getting on the platform with gm and navistar or maybe any other adjacent markets to that jeffrey craig chief executive officer and president well we do see the investment we ve made and the development of that transfer case and also a brand new assembly line in our laurinburg facility that i spoke about on the call as an opportunity to look at additional market share gains in that area so we don t i don t see anything specifically that will be announcing in the near term but we certainly are continuing to make headway in that market and i think it s very unique technology that navistar appreciated and i think the end market will appreciate as that vehicles rolled out here over the next few months faheem sabeiha longbow research analyst okay thanks operator thank you and i m showing no further questions at this time i d like to turn the call back to carl anderson for any closing remarks carl

in foreign affairs trump is famously winging it without a plan this could be very dangerous he went into the north korean talks last year after refusing a briefing he announced the us withdrawal from syria impulsively and without consultation with the pentagon triggering the resignation of his defense secretary he declared the end of nafta without a back up plan quit the asia trade tpp deal and environmental talks and mentions leaving nato rather often he is likely to quit the wto he is going into trade talks with china without a plan too this is disruption and distraction but without a re building follow up no construction just destruction a long time foreign affairs expert wrote an op ed in the nyt saying trump lacks the people the process and the policy to manage foreign affairs it s a mind blowing accusation of incompetence and yet somebody is managing the huawei case behind the scenes presumably the justice dept and somebody else is guiding the white house on venezeula it s tempting to think treassec mnuchin might be behind the latest move sanctions on the oil company and controlling the money are these two developments a sign that some competence remains in the us government despite trump s mismanagement that would probably be wishful thinking at least in the china case it may seem that singling out one bad actor in china gives the trumpies a real arm twister give us what we want or your daughter goes to an american jail for years but that would be to suppose that the justice dept in three states would drop their cases if the white house asked them to because a good trade deal would come out of it that s not how the justice dept works it was developing the case against huawei for years before trump came along and has its own rules and practices to obey besides trump keeps thrusting forward the national security excuse for his power grabs the hypocrisy of letting huawei off the hook for a better trade balance might be too blatant even for him the ft writes that the huawei charges cripple the trade talks it s right again we can t forecast a good outcome for the china trade talks at the heart of the matter is the us wanting two things once of which it cannot have and shouldn t ask for a drastic re structuring of china s industrial base we can get and may deserve more export sales but it goes too far to interfere with the state owning and pampering its industrial base with subsidies endless debt and a free pass on theft of intellectual property china sees the future it s tech not steel ai and robots not tvs and socks to become the next tech powerhouse as china intends every advantage must be pressed including those acquired dishonestly we cannot believe any promises of good behavior going forward china is sure to be recidivist and will get caught and any deal if we even get one in the first place suspended the trade talks run tomorrow and thursday with trump expected to drop by to shake hands with top trade guy premier liu he the us guys running the show are hawks lighthizer and navarro we are probably going to get leaks rumors and various bits of chatter well into friday and over the coming weekend as a footnote this is a saga japan understands all too well history repeats sort of japan has no illusions about the outcome either which may account for the yen creeping stronger regardless of data and the boj as for the chinese yuan it is doing more than creep see the chart we are not getting stories about outright intervention but observers guess that the dollar drop yuan appreciation is engineered to take the currency off the trade talk table given the recent data releases and news stories the yuan should be falling not rising anyone who sees hope for the trade talks in the appreciating yuan is not paying attention to the jackass in the white house outlook geopolitical developments are engrossing but so is the stock market these days or rather the earnings coming out of important names like caterpillar nvidia and whirlpool yesterday with big deal apple later today what we had so far from apple is that demand in china fell off the cliff this is likely to be the story for a wide range of multinational companies going forward ah but when factset reports that about 61 of the 113 companies that have reported year end results through monday morning have seen their share prices rise in subsequent trading sessions according to the wsj and that s in the face of earnings falling to half the speed of q3 when the tax cut was still an active factor if the stock market smells the predator in the wind before anyone else and constitutes a forward looking indicator what kind of job is it doing we wonder if the market smells the lion in the tall grass but is missing the thundering herd of elephants institutional investor has a cute story on how institutional managers eschew short selling only about a quarter of trading volume but maybe they should re consider not because of current conditions but rather because it s not a bad overall strategy despite negative connotations betting on failure vix is arguably too low given conditions not just the geopolitical crises but also the upcoming earnings disappointments normally we watch the stock market only out of the corner of one eye because it tends not to affect currencies all that much except japan where the correlation of the topix or nikkei to the yen is very tight if we assume the us stock market is headed for a fall what does that mean for the dollar not much but not nothing that s because the s p leads the world you don t get a big move downward in the s p without also getting nearly lockstep drop in the dax or ftse what s interesting this time is that all the gathering conditions pointing to a stock market rout sometime in q1 are not also pointing to a dollar rise on the same core factor risk aversion but stay tuned the euro s teflon coating has been pretty strong for a few days see euro skepticism tidbit below but it s starting to get scraped off the euro is not the only currency of course and we see the pound and yen moving upward but the euro is the benchmark it s a question of which girl in the beauty contest is less ugly to abuse the keynes quote it s hard to see how that s not the dollar given the awful trump but let s not overweight politics and personalities we shall see how the market digests 3 billion and 0 4 of first quarter gdp lost to trump s temper tantrum shutdown with another one looming instinct says sell the dollar but some facts like earnings so far say not to be hasty the fed is perhaps trying to head off another bout of stock market volatility by offering greater clarity on the balance sheet contraction after the fed meeting ends tomorrow is halting or altering the contraction of the balance sheet a policy tool there s a stink of deliberate stock market manipulation about the whole thing regardless of what data we get or don t this is going to be a focal point some say it s a question of powell s speaking style balderdash powell doesn t want to look like a craven pawn of wall street old timey observers are appalled but we say it doesn t matter all that much the dog gets fat if you feed him too many treats but in the end he won t be able to resist chasing the squirrel in this case the squirrel is earnings and specially china trade related and global slowdown earnings tidbit the euro started going up yesterday pretty much at the handoff from asia to european around 3 am et this was a bit mysterious there was no hard or even interesting news except may money supply and banking lending for dec money supply went up from 3 7 to 4 1 when a gain to only 3 8 was expected loans to non financial companies were flat and so were loans to households yawn we didn t bother to mention it but evidently this tepid and fairly distant data was the prod to the higher euro it s a long way from household lending to gdp we suspect this move shows once again that the euro has not lost its teflon coating despite all the grumbling about the failure of the eurozone in its 20th year funny this happened even before the ft featured a story on how the eurozone has conquered anti european sentiment before here is the chart granted discontent is leading to over 30 of those surveyed saying they are disenchanted with the eurozone but we have seen it before the early 1980s saw the convulsions of deindustrialisation and anti system forces benefited much like now when the aftermath of the financial crisis and its dire mishandling by policymakers has come on top of lingering hardship from the structural change decades earlier but it also shows that during the good economic times of the 1990s and the early 2000s the anti european wave ebbed and support for the european project returned what has been achieved before can surely be achieved again if we draw lessons not just from the mistakes of the past but from the successes too we are given no reason for optimism just a warning that sentiments shift the unspoken goal of the eu and eurozone is to prevent another war between the parties the explicit goal is broadly to get economic convergence so remove excuses for conflict we periodically get papers on convergence with the latest from june 2018 it shows in statistical data what we already know that yes there is overall convergence in incomes as measured by gdp per capita but clear geographical clusters emerge central and eastern countries lead the convergence process while southern regions have systematically underperformed relatively to the eu average thereby further deteriorating their relative position and diverging to the bottom not to be overly simplistic or flippant but the degree of variation in incomes per capita kind of lines up with the chart of dissatisfaction with the european project can it be that simple well yes italy complains all the time that it has not yet recovered incomes personal and national to the level before the financial crisis italian discontent attributed to the eu and emu and popular support for the new governing coalition arises directly from the absence of income convergence to the rest of the group as noted before italian tax mismanagement has a lot to do with it and cannot be laid at the eu s doorstep but still the concept of convergence is alive and well even if participants don t always position the debate that way crudely put the southerners want a bigger piece of the pie as well as wanting a bigger pie
by lance roberts as we discussed in this past weekend s missive a wsj article suggesting that the fed would not only stop hiking interest rates but also cease the balance sheet reduction which has been extracting liquidity from the market in mid 2018 the federal reserve was adamant that a strong economy and rising inflationary pressures required tighter monetary conditions at that time they were discussing additional rate hikes and a continued reduction of their 4 trillion balance sheet all it took was a rough december pressure from wall street s member banks and a disgruntled white house to completely flip their thinking this is a change for jerome powell who was believed to be substantially against fed interventions shows his worst fear being realized being held hostage by the markets a look at fed meeting minutes from 2013 was his recognition of that fear i have one final point which is to ask what is the plan if the economy does not cooperate we are at 4 trillion in expectation now that is where the balance sheet stops in expectation now if we have two bad employment reports the markets are going to move that number way out we re headed for 5 trillion as others have mentioned and the idea that president kocherlakota said and governor duke echoed that we re now a captive of the market is somewhat chilling to me this week the fed meets to discuss their next policy moves if the fed announces a reduction elimination of future rate hikes and or a reduction elimination of the balance sheet reduction stocks will likely find a bid at least in the short term longer term the markets are still dealing with an aging economic growth cycle weakening rates of earnings growth and rising political tensions but from a technical basis they are also dealing with a break of long term trend lines and very major sell signals the problem for the fed is that while ceasing rate hikes and balance sheet reductions may be a short term positive monetary policy is already substantially tighter than it was at the lows in other words stopping tightening is not the same as easing back to the future 2015 2016 we have seen a similar period previously during the 2015 2016 correction the fed had just announced it s intent to start hiking rates and had stopped reinvesting liquidity into the markets early tightening the market plunged sharply prompting several fed presidents to make announcements reminding markets they still remained extremely accommodative the market rallied back closing in on previous highs it certainly looked as if the bulls had regained control of the market headlines declared the correction was over but it wasn t the retest of lows and setting of new lows happened over the next 60 days with concerns over the impact of the upcoming brexit vote the fed chairman janet yellen coordinated with global central banks to provide liquidity to support global markets in the event of a disorderly break up in november of that same year donald trump was elected to office with promises of deregulation tax cuts and massive infrastructure spending projects which provided an additional boost to equities into the end of the year those promises combined with massive central bank stimulus led to one of the longest bull market runs in history with virtually no volatility so here we are today the trump administration successfully passed tax cut legislation for corporations in december of 2017 subsequently stocks surged at the beginning of 2018 as bottom line earnings were expected to explode however that surge also marked the blow off top of the rally as the administration launched its trade war with china stocks fell in february however the markets were able to regain their footing in april as the first look at earnings post tax cuts had soared we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us then came october the ongoing tariffs on goods being shipped along with a stronger dollar began to weigh on corporate outlooks but it was the fed who was in the process of tightening monetary policy uttered the words that spooked the markets we are still a long way from the neutral rate jerome powell despite evidence of an already slowing economy and the yield curve almost inverted the idea the fed would remain consistent in hiking interest rates and reducing their balance sheet further weighed on investor confidence the fed put was gone market dependent despite commentary from the fed they were only data dependent all it took was a 20 correction from the highs to change their minds but not just the fed s while the wsj is reporting a change in attitude from the fed on the reduction of their balance sheet the white house which has pinned their measurement of success to stock prices took prompt action the secretary of the treasury made announcements assuring the markets of stability and pushing for banks to put liquidity back into the markets the trump administration has repeatedly assured the markets that trade talks are going well and deal is close to being done for now the markets have bought into the rhetoric and have rallied sharply from the lows mr market clearly has control over both fiscal and monetary policy data dependency has been relegated to the dust bin of history so is the bull back or is the market despite all of the support set to retest lows as seen in early 2016 bryce coward cfa recently studied all the previous similar declines we ve cataloged all 20 uninterrupted 15 declines in the post war period and documented what has happened afterward as well as the type of market environment in which those declines have taken place by uninterrupted decline we mean a waterfall decline of at least 15 without an intermediate counter trend rally of at least 5 some bullet points describing the rallies following those declines are below the average counter trend rally following a 15 waterfall decline is 11 9 11 median and it takes place over 21 trading days on average median 11 days the rallies end up retracing 57 of the decline on average median 52 the average of those bear markets have a peak to trough decline of 33 median 29 the duration of those bear markets is 284 trading days on average median 139 days in 16 of 19 instances excluding the decline we just witnessed a recession was associated with the bear markets waterfall declines of at least 15 have only taken place in bear markets 100 of the time the low resulting from the waterfall decline was retested and in 15 of 19 cases a new lower lower was made what do these data say about the current counter trend rally first this rally has already retraced 65 of the waterfall decline greater than average and median and has lasted about three weeks less than average but greater than median this suggests upside from here may be limited in both magnitude and duration furthermore these data strongly suggest the major index will retest the christmas eve low at the very least and most likely will make a new lower low in the weeks and months ahead while we are not forecasting a recession at this time waterfall declines of the magnitude just witnessed tend to take place in recessionary market environments so we need to at least be open to that possibility finally waterfall declines typically take place in bear markets lasting an average of 284 days median 139 days at just 81 days in duration these data suggests we have bit further to run before we reach the bear market nadir that said there are four instances of waterfall declines taking place in short bear markets so we don t place much weight on this particular piece while the markets could certainly rally in the weeks ahead there are significant challenges coming from both weaker economic growth rising debt levels and slowing earnings growth but most importantly the biggest challenge in the months and years ahead will be the sustainability of the price deviation from long term trends as dana lyons penned last week finally even stock prices themselves can be considered excessive in fact when compared to a regression trend line on the s p composite going back to inception in 1871 the index price reached 122 above its long term trend this past september another way of saying that is that the s p 500 is 122 overbought in other words if stock prices were simply to revert to their long term mean the s p 500 would be down closer to 1300 than recent highs near 2900 there are certainly plenty more examples of excess in the stock market but these few should give you an idea why if we have entered a longer term bear market the oft derided bears may end up getting the last laugh yes this could certainly work out much like 2015 2016 if the fed throws in the towel to appease the markets if they don t there are plenty of indications which suggest a more important mean reversion process has already begun

executive officer thank you john good morning everyone on today s call we ll be reviewing our results for the fourth quarter of 2018 key takeaways from the call today are 2018 was another successful year for wesbanco as we successfully executed upon our well defined growth strategies we have and continued to diversify and strengthen our franchise we remain diligently focused on credit quality profitability and positive operating leverage and strong underlying fundamentals including our core deposit funding advantage will be a benefit during 2019 solid execution of our strategies and strong fundamentals drove record earnings of 143 million during 2018 when excluding merger costs and the impacts of a revaluation of deferred tax assets last year net income increased 46 to 157 million borrowings per share increased 31 to 3 21 on a similar basis these earnings generated strong profitability ratios for 2018 with core returns on average assets and average tangible equity of 1 39 and 17 78 respectively for the three months ended december 31st net income excluding merger related expenses was 45 million or 0 82 per diluted share 2018 was another successful year for wesbanco as well as a year full of milestones for us as i mentioned we reported record earnings with net income surpassing 143 million and income before provisions for credit losses and income taxes increasing 15 year over year to more than 182 million we have continued to benefit from our core funding advantage as demonstrated by a total deposit beta of only 12 on the four federal funds rate increases during 2018 we remain diligent on expense management while continuing to make technology and staffing investments to support future growth helping to drive our 2018 efficiency ratio at 54 6 a year over year improvement of 184 basis points our credit quality ratios have continued to improve to be at or near historic lows as we ve stayed disciplined and balanced on our lending decisions we strengthened the franchise by expanding into new and diversified markets with strong demographics while maintaining strong market positions across our major markets we continue to be nationally recognized for our performance strength and credit quality as we were again named one of america s best banks by a leading financial magazine recently coming in at number 27th our ninth top ranking since the list s inception in 2019 2010 i m sorry as we remain committed to returning value to our shareholders as demonstrated by increasing our dividend by 107 since 2010 including an 11 5 annualized dividend increase announced earlier in 2018 a strong core return on average tangible equity of 17 78 which has increased 606 basis points since 2010 and increasing tangible book value per share by 62 since 2010 to 19 63 our credit and risk management strategy guides our loan growth to be both disciplined and balanced to ensure stability and success across the economic cycles our approach is not to sacrifice long term shareholder value for near term gains we are focused on long term sustainable and profitable growth during the fourth quarter we continue to see strength in our underlying credit fundamentals as key credit quality metrics remained at or near historic lows in fact despite the addition of 1 4 billion of portfolio loans from ftsb and ffkt acquisitions non performing loans and assets decreased year over year on both an absolute dollar basis as well as a percentage of the loan portfolio i m very pleased with the strong quarterly trend in our asset quality measures as they reflect the consistent high quality of our overall loan portfolio total organic loan growth excluding our consumer portfolio was down 1 3 during the last 12 months however when adjusting for active portfolio management of several larger relationship exposures during the fourth quarter total organic loan growth was essentially flat year over year as i mentioned the loan growth has been influenced by a number of factors including targeted reductions in our consumer portfolio to improve the risk return profile through past couple of years lower home equity loan balances due to lower demand as a result of higher interest rates and tax changes elevated levels of commercial real estate loans moving to an aggressive secondary financing market as well as property owners selling properties outright due to favorable property valuations and continued deleveraging by commercial customers reflective of the current operating environment and higher cash levels from tax reform while loan growth most likely continue to be impacted in the near term by these factors we do see some positive signs i believe we have neared the end of our targeted reductions in our consumer portfolio our residential mortgage program continues to be a bright spot its overall production continues to be strong across all of our markets with total closed loans up 23 year over year and we continue to make appropriate investments to ensure long term growth including additional c i lender and securities brokerage new hires and building out our online lending application capabilities furthermore we are encouraged that our commercial pipeline going into 2019 is better than what we experienced going into 2018 year over year we continue to experience strong organic deposit growth excluding cds of 2 5 which is driven by nearly 6 growth in total demand deposits as i mentioned before this deposit growth is just one of the key strategic advantages of our franchise which sits on top of the marcellus and utica shale formations providing a distinct advantage that is hard to replicate as shale energy related deposits continue to be in the low eight figure range each month this core funding advantage aids profitability while aligning us to meet the loan demand across our markets these consistent strong deposit inflows which mainly reside in demand accounts have allowed us to maintain a loan to deposit ratio in the high 80 range while also keeping our funding costs low the growth we have experienced in demand deposits which now represents 52 of total deposits has helped to keep our total annual deposit funding costs low as i mentioned earlier one of the key pillars of our long term growth strategy is franchise enhancing acquisitions during the last few years we have made significant and successful strides in our growth and diversification plans in addition we developed and disclosed to appropriately cross the 10 billion asset threshold and we did exactly what we said we were going to do during 2018 we filled in the southern edge of our franchise with the acquisition of ftsb and we expanded into kentucky s high growth markets to become one of the state s strongest franchises with the acquisition of ffkt both of these mergers and the respective operational integrations have gone very well to date we maintained key sales personnel including commercial lenders and trust personnel and are on track with our anticipated cost saves before turning the call over for a review of our financials i want to take a minute to highlight our fundamentals there has been a lot of uncertainty across our marketplace through the last few months from worries about a potential trade war with china and a recession to continued discord in washington dc to significant decline in equity markets late last year i wanted to reaffirm the strength of our underlying operating fundamentals we remain well positioned for success in a variety of operating environments we remain focused on long term profitability and success as we continue to effectively execute upon our well defined growth strategies and most importantly this long term success will occur without sacrificing our legacy of credit quality and regulatory compliance i d now like to turn the call over to bob young our chief financial officer for an update on our fourth quarter s financial results bob robert h young executive vice president chief financial officer thanks todd and good morning everyone we reported strong profitability with year over year growth in both pre tax and after tax earnings and continued to display solid credit quality and expense management for the 12 months ended december 31 2018 we reported gaap net income of 143 1 million and earnings per diluted share of 2 92 as compared to 94 5 million or 2 14 per diluted share the same period last year excluding after tax merger related expenses from both periods as well as the 2017 net deferred tax asset revaluation net income increased 45 7 to 157 2 million with earnings per diluted share up 0 76 to 3 21 per share for the three months ended december 31 2018 we reported gaap net income of 43 9 million and earnings per diluted share of 0 80 as compared to 15 9 million and 0 36 per share respectively in the prior year s period excluding after tax merger related expenses from both periods and the net deferred tax asset reevaluation in the 2017 period net income increased 55 4 to 45 million and earning per diluted share increased 24 2 to 0 82 per share as a reminder financial results for first sentry and farmers capital our two acquisitions last year have been included in wesbanco s results subsequent to their respective merger dates of april 5th and august 20 2018 we ll turn now to balance sheet total assets as of december 31 2018 grew 12 5 billion year over year reflecting approximately 2 3 billion of assets from the first sentry and farmers acquisitions furthermore total portfolio loans of 7 7 billion increased 20 7 compared to the prior year due to both acquisitions the strength of our residential mortgage lending program continued to drive strong loan originations that are better than the residential mortgage market nationwide our total year to date originations which were up 23 year over year continue to be driven by home purchases representing approximately 80 of total volume including construction relatively consistent with 2017 s rate as refinances have continued to drop in the marketplace furthermore while we continued our strategy to sell residential mortgage originations into the secondary market we again realized year over year organic growth of 3 3 during the fourth quarter from an increase in the amount of 1 to 4 family mortgage loans held on our balance sheet primarily due to growth in certain non conforming residential loans in the jumbo and private banking areas lastly our residential mortgage pipeline heading into 2019 is stronger than it was going into 2018 turning to the income statement now the net interest margin increased 29 basis points year over year reflecting the benefit to asset yields from the increases in the federal reserve board s target federal funds rate over the past year as well as the benefit from the higher margin on the acquired farmers net assets these benefits were partially offset by higher funding costs and a flatter yield curve which averaged approximately 20 basis points between the two year and the 10 year portion of the curve in the fourth quarter as a reminder also negatively affecting the margin in 2018 was a 6 basis point reduction related to the lower tax equivalency of the state and local municipal tax exempt securities resulting from 2017 tax cuts and jobs act excluding this reduction as well as purchase accounting accretion of 23 basis points in the fourth quarter and 6 basis points in the prior year period the core net interest margin increased 18 basis points year over year and 10 basis points sequentially from the third quarter to 3 55 purchase accounting accretion during the fourth quarter of 2018 was also positively impacted by an additional 4 basis points due to the december payoff of a former ycb originated loan as todd mentioned one of the key strategic differentiators of our franchise is our long term core deposit funding advantage which benefits profitability by helping to keep our overall deposit funding costs low as of december 31 2018 total deposits including non interest bearing increased 26 3 year over year to 8 9 billion reflecting the 1 8 billion from the two acquisitions however total deposit costs for the fourth quarter were up only 11 basis points year over year representing a beta of 11 compared to the 425 basis points federal funds rate increases during 2018 and on a year to date basis our total deposit beta was equally strong at just 12 for the quarter ended december 31 2018 non interest income increased 15 8 from the prior year to 26 6 million driven by the first sentry and farmers capital acquisitions as well as organic growth the associated larger customer base and higher transaction volumes drove the increases in electronic banking fees as well as deposit service charges the year over year change in net loss on other real estate owned was due to two larger oreo gains at the end of 2017 totaling 0 6 million as compared to a slight loss in 2018 net securities losses of 1 3 million were primarily due to the accounting treatment of the market adjustment on our deferred compensation plan the treatment of this adjustment is neutral to operating income as an offsetting 1 1 million is recorded as a credit within employee benefits expense as we have discussed many times our long term growth strategy is built upon delivering positive operating leverage while making necessary growth oriented and risk prevention investments and maintaining our strong culture of credit quality risk management and compliance we continue to demonstrate strong profitability and positive operating leverage through successful execution of our strategies as well as controlling discretionary costs despite the inclusion of farmers capital operating expenses since august 20 excluding merger related expenses non interest expense increased 15 2 million or 28 compared to the prior year period this year over year increase is reflective of the two acquisitions and their associated staffs and locations which were the primary reasons for the increases in salaries and wages employee benefits net occupancy and equipment cost the year over year increase in total employee benefits was partially mitigated by the 1 1 million reduction in the deferred compensation plan obligation due to market declines discussed earlier and a change in our accounting for pension costs whereby most of the annual expense is now accounted for in salaries our companywide dedication to controlling costs is evident in the 184 basis point year over year improvement in our 2018 core operating efficiency ratio of 54 6 which again is inclusive of farmers capitals expense base part of the cost savings expected to commence later during the first quarter of 2019 during the fourth quarter of 2018 our credit quality ratios remained strong as we balanced disciplined loan origination growth in the current environment with our prudential lending standards there are many ways to achieve increased profitability but adjusting our risk profile is not one of them especially at this point to the elongated economic expansion cycle our approach is not to sacrifice long term shareholder value for near term gains as our credit and risk management strategy guides our loan growth to be both disciplined and balanced to ensure stability and success across various economic cycles in addition we have continued to maintain strong regulatory capital ratios as both consolidated and bank level ratios grew this quarter and significantly exceed both well capitalized standards and peer ratios indeed our fourth quarter tangible common equity ratio increased both sequentially and year over year to 9 28 due to strong growth in retained earnings and lower accumulated other comprehensive losses offsetting the slightly negative impact earlier in the year of the two acquisitions before opening the call for your questions i would like to provide some current thoughts on our outlook for 2019 the inherent strength of our diversified growth strategies is how the components complement and support each other to ensure success and profitability in different operating environments despite our general asset sensitivity we are not immune from the factors that are affecting net interest margins across the industry including a very flat spread between the two year to 10 year treasury yields while our core deposit funding advantage combined with our low loan to deposit ratio will help to contain the overall deposit funding costs we still expect deposit betas to increase as we move forward we anticipate purchase accounting accretion to be in the mid teens during 2019 declining at a rate of 1 basis points to 2 basis points per quarter in the fourth quarter of 2018 we model 225 basis point federal funds rate increases in march and june of 2019 however the market outlook has changed since then and we are currently expecting just one midyear increase in our net interest income projections for 2019 while we do not anticipate much overall change in our core net interest margin this year as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 we do expect somewhat lower purchase accounting accretion which will reduce the stated margin a few basis points overall as we proceed through the year regarding operating expenses we remain on pace to achieve the remaining 25 of the anticipated first sentry cost savings of 38 this year and expect to achieve the planned 35 of farmers capital cost savings with 75 of those realized during 2019 and the remainder in 2020 we will continue to focus on expense trends to ensure positive operating leverage while positioning the company for long term growth we are planning our typical mid year merit increases for our employees and expect that marketing expense will ramp up from our fourth quarter run rate reflecting additional marketing spend in our various markets as well as the 25 larger company size furthermore fdic insurance expense will increase in the second quarter as we are assessed a higher rate for banks over 10 billion in asset size credit quality measures have been at or near historic lows over the last several periods and as such variability from quarter to quarter may occur which is currently not suggestive of a change in the direction of overall credit quality unless the economy were to slow down beyond current economic projections that said we do expect our credit quality measures to remain strong during 2019 we anticipate our effective full year tax rate to be between 18 to 20 subject to changes in certain taxable income strategies lastly during the second half of 2019 we will begin to incur the impact from the durbin amendment on interchange fee income which currently is anticipated to reduce fee income by approximately 2 5 million per quarter as well as have a slight negative influence on the efficiency ratio we are now ready to take your questions operator would you please review the instructions questions and answers operator thank you sir ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions and your first question this morning will be from casey whitman of sandler o neill please go ahead todd f clossin president chief executive officer good morning casey casey whitman sandler o neill partners analyst good morning good morning nice quarter todd f clossin president chief executive officer thank you casey whitman sandler o neill partners analyst just wanted to circle back on the accretion guidance you guys just gave so i think you said mid teens expected accretion just to be clear are you talking about mid teens margin impact like basis points or dollar amount in million robert h young executive vice president chief financial officer no that s the margin impact casey whitman sandler o neill partners analyst okay robert h young executive vice president chief financial officer so 23 basis points in the fourth quarter we re expecting mid teens beginning in the first quarter of 2019 and then a reduction of that as we proceed through the year and into 2020 of 1 basis points maybe 2 basis points a quarter prepayments will impact that as well casey whitman sandler o neill partners analyst okay and it sounds like your core margin guidance for that being relatively flat assuming one rate hike so what do you think where does your guidance move to if we don t get another rate hike robert h young executive vice president chief financial officer it would impact by 1 basis points to 2 basis points for the year that s about the impact of each 25 basis points increase casey whitman sandler o neill partners analyst okay got it and maybe i ll circle back to just your comments around loan growth so it sounds like we could maybe expect loans to grow better in 2019 but do you still think we re a few quarters out from seeing some of that growth or do you think we start to see a little bit of pick up earlier than that todd f clossin president chief executive officer yeah i think as we said ex consumer we were down about 1 3 but maybe i ll give a little color on that we had four performing loans filling about 46 million that we either exited or reduced to either being outside of our risk tolerance or maybe a little larger exposure then we really wanted with a couple of companies that are good performing companies so we brought in some other banks to share some of their growing exposure excluding those and some other smaller loans we kind of managed exposures i am really kind of looking at loans as essentially flat year over year again driven by active exposure management pipeline as i mentioned a little bit stronger going into the fourth quarter of this year first quarter of this year then going into the first quarter of last year and we would expect that commercial real estate pay downs in cre that s moving to the secondary market that start to stabilize at some point in 2019 as you kind of wash through all that and we did see that slow down a little bit toward the end of 18 and the very beginning of 19 and our strategy in terms of reducing parts of the consumer portfolio the risk return piece of that it s really stabilized over the last couple of months and we think we re kind of where we need to be on that piece of it so longer term we would still think low to mid single digit loan growth once that market dynamics return to a little bit of a more normalized level and that s kind of our view on it at this point casey whitman sandler o neill partners analyst very helpful thanks for taking my questions todd f clossin president chief executive officer sure operator the next question will be from austin nicholas of stephens please go ahead todd f clossin president chief executive officer hi austin austin nicholas stephens inc analyst hey guys good morning maybe just looking at the balance sheet again on the deposit growth it looks like those were down kind of quarter over quarter can you walk me through was there any kind of one time items or seasonality in your public funds that impacted that robert h young executive vice president chief financial officer i would tell you yeah obviously on a year over year basis excluding cds we were up 2 5 but in the fourth quarter we typically have some movement in some of the public funds that also kind of assorting to two mergers that we went through as well too while the customer basis stayed strong and we didn t see significant amount of attrition or anything like that you will see some changes associated with that but public funds is it s a big business for us and you do see some fluctuations in the fourth quarter also you ll see some fluctuations in different times in both directions in the first quarter as well austin nicholas stephens inc analyst got it okay and then maybe just on the expense growth number and maybe just outside of farmers could you maybe just guide us to where we should be thinking about the core expense growth rate kind of going into 19 i know you mentioned kind of marketing expenses ramping up and the fdic insurance expense also kind of increasing if you could quantify both of those as well that would help be helpful robert h young executive vice president chief financial officer well i would look at marketing expense as ramping up through the year and just reflecting the size of the company our budget in the past has been in that 5 million to 6 million area so you would figure 25 growth on that number next year and we expect it as campaigns activate that all proceeded at a pace that would suggest higher marketing in the back half of the year toward the end of the second quarter on the fdic side that increase will become effective on april the 1st and we re currently estimating between 1 million and 1 5 million over last year s expense reflecting both the growth in the company again austin as well as the higher assessment base or rate for banks over 10 billion overall guidance or comments about total expenses in the new year first of all you re looking at a little bit less than 70 million here in the fourth quarter if you exclude merger related expenses i would add back to that that deferred compensation amount is neutral to operating income but for purposes of operating expenses add that back and so that that really puts you slightly above 70 million 70 5 million as the fourth quarter run rate and we would see then cuts here toward the end of the first quarter and second quarter from the farmers acquisition as we convert systems and back office in the branches and then you would be looking at typically a 2 to 3 increase as we proceed throughout the year from that level as a result of normal midyear salary increases and other inflationary amount so kind of starting the year in that 71 million to 72 million level austin nicholas stephens inc analyst got it thanks that s helpful and then just maybe taking a step back thinking about capital and maybe just more importantly just on the m a are we still on a pause here in 19 or are transactions still are kind of back on the table todd f clossin president chief executive officer yeah and i appreciate the question i think with the integration of first sentry which the conversion was last summer and ffkt coming up here in the next couple of weeks everything has gone very well so the integration the simulation and everything else is very much on track so i said in the last spring year and a half to two years or so in terms of kind of what we saw from a pause standpoint but i could see we could end the pause in the second half of this year kind of the back half of this year there was the right opportunity to try to do something we would probably be willing to entertain that again i think we ve covered the 10 billion threshold very well and we re really managing things very tightly and i m real pleased with the team not only the existing legacy wesbanco team but the new employees that have come on from first sentry and ffkt and but it really it feels very much like one bank has been together a long time so i think as a result of that we could look at something in the back half of this year or early 2020 austin nicholas stephens inc analyst got it okay great thanks for taking my questions operator the next question will be from steve moss of b riley fbr please go ahead zachary weiss b riley fbr analyst hi good morning this is zach weiss on for steve today todd f clossin president chief executive officer good morning zachary weiss b riley fbr analyst good morning so i guess on fee income here curious your outlook maybe outside of the durbin impact just on trust fees and maybe mortgage how you guys are thinking about that for 2019 todd f clossin president chief executive officer let me start off bob might want to add some additional on here so we had the market impact on the trust fees in the fourth quarter and markets rebounded a little bit so far in the first quarter we ll see how the rest of the quarter goes we also have our fee program our fee initiative we mentioned in the past i think kind of phase one of that was atm fees and that was pretty much addressed in the early part of 2018 we also are continuing to look at other fees where we are below markets and are pretty significantly below market in a lot of places and addressing those over time as well as yeah just more disciplined around the fee waivers and being able to control those type of things and we think those are some pretty meaningful numbers that are going to part of it s in 18 part of it s in 19 part of it s going to be 2020 i mean it s 20 or 30 different little initiatives all of which have a different timeline and different processes associated with them and different approval processes associated with them but we would expect those to give us some additional fee growth in the future quarters as we implement them bob what else would you add to that robert h young executive vice president chief financial officer well i d say that it s kind of obvious but the first two quarters are going to have higher fee income in the back half of the year and as i said during my prepared remarks we do expect a slightly negative influence on the efficiency ratio in the back half of the year from a lower base here in the first half of the year so i would kind of look at the fourth quarter as a placeholder for a run rate at this point yes there is some impact on trust fees but typically the first quarter is a better quarter for us on trust fees because of a tax preparation fees primarily and we do expect mortgage banking to continue to ramp up despite lower refis and lower overall business in the economy and that s just because we re hiring more originators and taking business from others and have some very good programs with some great leadership as well so those are my main guidance points the electronic banking will continue to increase in the first half of the year before you ll see that line item reflect durbin in the back half of the year zachary weiss b riley fbr analyst okay thank you and then on the balance sheet in terms of the securities balances should we expect those to be relatively flat for the year todd f clossin president chief executive officer yeah our anticipation isn t to dramatically increase them as a percentage of the balance sheet i think we re pretty comfortable where we re at i mean we realize margin and expense control is what s driving a lot of the earnings growth and the positive operating leverage right now and we do need to grow the balance sheet funds in particular are going to need to grow over time moving forward so we don t have a real pessimistic view of the economy or anything like that we re just taking the opportunity to position the loan portfolio a little bit for long term success but we re not going to be ramping up the securities portfolio to offset slower loan growth that isn t our plan zachary weiss b riley fbr analyst all right thank you very much todd f clossin president chief executive officer sure operator and our next question will be from russell gunther of d a davidson please go ahead russell gunther d a davidson company analyst hey good morning guys todd f clossin president chief executive officer hi russell russell gunther d a davidson company analyst i just wanted to circle back to the longer conversation todd appreciate your comments around the low to mid single digit range for next year but if we think about the two recent deals that 1 4 billion in loan balances is there a bucket of that that you guys kind of ring fenced or thought about in terms of intended rundown or a managed decline or have pro forma balances there kind of shook out where you thought i m just trying to get a sense if there s been anything else kind of weighing on loan balances in addition to the industry headwinds todd f clossin president chief executive officer yeah those both of those two mergers as customary with prior mergers we did sell some loans right before or right at the time of the merger was completed so we kind of move those things off the books early on that we didn t think really fit with our profile going forward and the lending teams have all stayed intact and the plan isn t to run loan balances down or anything like that at all i mean a part of the reason and going into those markets is because of the household growth and the demographic growth and the business environment there they were growing those markets louisville and lexington in particular were growing faster than some of our legacy markets so we think that ll be good for us from a loan growth perspective and a balance sheet perspective going forward but we re comfortable with the credit that we picked up we re comfortable with the loan categories and we re comfortable with the businesses so the plan would be to expand it and not to intentionally run down to any part of that russell gunther d a davidson company analyst great i appreciate that and then todd as a follow up there what do you think the biggest delta in your mind is to achieving that mid single digit growth versus the low end of the range todd f clossin president chief executive officer yeah it s a great question i spent some time in the market the last couple of weeks with our lending teams and i think there still is just uncertainty out there just some hesitancy to want to pull the trigger on expansion i m hearing a lot from customers around having a hard time finding people they could generate additional revenue work on additional contracts things like that but they re all struggling to find additional people to be able to capitalize on that but i also think there s some conservatism there in terms of really not being 100 sure of what s going on from an economic standpoint you wouldn t think that the trade wars would have a big impact on a lot of our companies but a lot of them are bringing in aluminum and steel and things like that and they re a little nervous about where those prices are going so they re trying not to get overextended so i think there s just lack of maybe the lack of animal spirits i guess as some people say and a conservatism that s out there and people are sitting on cash balances businesses are sitting on cash balances so i think if we can get some more i mean less volatility on some of those talks and some more definite direction that people can plan for then i think you might see a little more activity out there but i just i attribute it to people just kind of pulling in their horns and being conservative right now russell gunther d a davidson company analyst i d appreciate your thoughts there and then just last one for me you mentioned a willingness to take a look at m a again in the back half of the year if the opportunity arose can you just remind us from a size perspective geography perspective sort of where you re focused with deals going forward todd f clossin president chief executive officer yeah very much same as in the past i mean we re looking at a six hour drive time from our wheeling headquarters here so you can see the map and where that six hours would be we re not the bank that s going to be jumping over states and going down south and out west and stuff like that we ll stay within that market that we ve stayed in historically and if it s an in market deal obviously higher expense saves if it s an outer market deal then we d be looking at growth characteristics that would be stronger than our legacy markets very similar to what you saw with ffkt and even your community bank a couple of years ago that would be the that would be the plan russell gunther d a davidson company analyst thanks for taking my questions todd f clossin president chief executive officer sure operator operator instructions your next question will be from stuart lotz of kbw please go ahead stuart lotz keefe bruyette woods inc analyst hey guys good morning todd f clossin president chief executive officer good morning stuart lotz keefe bruyette woods inc analyst most of my questions have been asked but maybe just one follow up around credit costs or credit cost expectations for next year i know that provision was higher this quarter related to some charge offs but any outlook for 2019 what we can expect from a quarter to quarter provision expense todd f clossin president chief executive officer yeah i mean we don t see a whole lot of change from the last couple of years i mean everything is really quiet it really all looks very very good i think our first or second second and third quarter were almost nothing third quarter was actually a recovery so we just don t see anything there at all i think for the year the number was just incredibly low and we don t see anything impacting that we don t see things in the pipeline deteriorating we don t have any exposure or concentration issues in areas or industries that we re really concerned about so kind of steady as she goes and i would expect the next few quarters at this point to look very similar to what we ve had in the past stuart lotz keefe bruyette woods inc analyst all right well yeah that s all i had so thanks guys todd f clossin president chief executive officer thank you operator and ladies and gentlemen that will conclude our question and answer session i would like to hand the conference back over to todd clossin

executive officer thank you john good morning everyone on today s call we ll be reviewing our results for the fourth quarter of 2018 key takeaways from the call today are 2018 was another successful year for wesbanco as we successfully executed upon our well defined growth strategies we have and continued to diversify and strengthen our franchise we remain diligently focused on credit quality profitability and positive operating leverage and strong underlying fundamentals including our core deposit funding advantage will be a benefit during 2019 solid execution of our strategies and strong fundamentals drove record earnings of 143 million during 2018 when excluding merger costs and the impacts of a revaluation of deferred tax assets last year net income increased 46 to 157 million borrowings per share increased 31 to 3 21 on a similar basis these earnings generated strong profitability ratios for 2018 with core returns on average assets and average tangible equity of 1 39 and 17 78 respectively for the three months ended december 31st net income excluding merger related expenses was 45 million or 0 82 per diluted share 2018 was another successful year for wesbanco as well as a year full of milestones for us as i mentioned we reported record earnings with net income surpassing 143 million and income before provisions for credit losses and income taxes increasing 15 year over year to more than 182 million we have continued to benefit from our core funding advantage as demonstrated by a total deposit beta of only 12 on the four federal funds rate increases during 2018 we remain diligent on expense management while continuing to make technology and staffing investments to support future growth helping to drive our 2018 efficiency ratio at 54 6 a year over year improvement of 184 basis points our credit quality ratios have continued to improve to be at or near historic lows as we ve stayed disciplined and balanced on our lending decisions we strengthened the franchise by expanding into new and diversified markets with strong demographics while maintaining strong market positions across our major markets we continue to be nationally recognized for our performance strength and credit quality as we were again named one of america s best banks by a leading financial magazine recently coming in at number 27th our ninth top ranking since the list s inception in 2019 2010 i m sorry as we remain committed to returning value to our shareholders as demonstrated by increasing our dividend by 107 since 2010 including an 11 5 annualized dividend increase announced earlier in 2018 a strong core return on average tangible equity of 17 78 which has increased 606 basis points since 2010 and increasing tangible book value per share by 62 since 2010 to 19 63 our credit and risk management strategy guides our loan growth to be both disciplined and balanced to ensure stability and success across the economic cycles our approach is not to sacrifice long term shareholder value for near term gains we are focused on long term sustainable and profitable growth during the fourth quarter we continue to see strength in our underlying credit fundamentals as key credit quality metrics remained at or near historic lows in fact despite the addition of 1 4 billion of portfolio loans from ftsb and ffkt acquisitions non performing loans and assets decreased year over year on both an absolute dollar basis as well as a percentage of the loan portfolio i m very pleased with the strong quarterly trend in our asset quality measures as they reflect the consistent high quality of our overall loan portfolio total organic loan growth excluding our consumer portfolio was down 1 3 during the last 12 months however when adjusting for active portfolio management of several larger relationship exposures during the fourth quarter total organic loan growth was essentially flat year over year as i mentioned the loan growth has been influenced by a number of factors including targeted reductions in our consumer portfolio to improve the risk return profile through past couple of years lower home equity loan balances due to lower demand as a result of higher interest rates and tax changes elevated levels of commercial real estate loans moving to an aggressive secondary financing market as well as property owners selling properties outright due to favorable property valuations and continued deleveraging by commercial customers reflective of the current operating environment and higher cash levels from tax reform while loan growth most likely continue to be impacted in the near term by these factors we do see some positive signs i believe we have neared the end of our targeted reductions in our consumer portfolio our residential mortgage program continues to be a bright spot its overall production continues to be strong across all of our markets with total closed loans up 23 year over year and we continue to make appropriate investments to ensure long term growth including additional c i lender and securities brokerage new hires and building out our online lending application capabilities furthermore we are encouraged that our commercial pipeline going into 2019 is better than what we experienced going into 2018 year over year we continue to experience strong organic deposit growth excluding cds of 2 5 which is driven by nearly 6 growth in total demand deposits as i mentioned before this deposit growth is just one of the key strategic advantages of our franchise which sits on top of the marcellus and utica shale formations providing a distinct advantage that is hard to replicate as shale energy related deposits continue to be in the low eight figure range each month this core funding advantage aids profitability while aligning us to meet the loan demand across our markets these consistent strong deposit inflows which mainly reside in demand accounts have allowed us to maintain a loan to deposit ratio in the high 80 range while also keeping our funding costs low the growth we have experienced in demand deposits which now represents 52 of total deposits has helped to keep our total annual deposit funding costs low as i mentioned earlier one of the key pillars of our long term growth strategy is franchise enhancing acquisitions during the last few years we have made significant and successful strides in our growth and diversification plans in addition we developed and disclosed to appropriately cross the 10 billion asset threshold and we did exactly what we said we were going to do during 2018 we filled in the southern edge of our franchise with the acquisition of ftsb and we expanded into kentucky s high growth markets to become one of the state s strongest franchises with the acquisition of ffkt both of these mergers and the respective operational integrations have gone very well to date we maintained key sales personnel including commercial lenders and trust personnel and are on track with our anticipated cost saves before turning the call over for a review of our financials i want to take a minute to highlight our fundamentals there has been a lot of uncertainty across our marketplace through the last few months from worries about a potential trade war with china and a recession to continued discord in washington dc to significant decline in equity markets late last year i wanted to reaffirm the strength of our underlying operating fundamentals we remain well positioned for success in a variety of operating environments we remain focused on long term profitability and success as we continue to effectively execute upon our well defined growth strategies and most importantly this long term success will occur without sacrificing our legacy of credit quality and regulatory compliance i d now like to turn the call over to bob young our chief financial officer for an update on our fourth quarter s financial results bob robert h young executive vice president chief financial officer thanks todd and good morning everyone we reported strong profitability with year over year growth in both pre tax and after tax earnings and continued to display solid credit quality and expense management for the 12 months ended december 31 2018 we reported gaap net income of 143 1 million and earnings per diluted share of 2 92 as compared to 94 5 million or 2 14 per diluted share the same period last year excluding after tax merger related expenses from both periods as well as the 2017 net deferred tax asset revaluation net income increased 45 7 to 157 2 million with earnings per diluted share up 0 76 to 3 21 per share for the three months ended december 31 2018 we reported gaap net income of 43 9 million and earnings per diluted share of 0 80 as compared to 15 9 million and 0 36 per share respectively in the prior year s period excluding after tax merger related expenses from both periods and the net deferred tax asset reevaluation in the 2017 period net income increased 55 4 to 45 million and earning per diluted share increased 24 2 to 0 82 per share as a reminder financial results for first sentry and farmers capital our two acquisitions last year have been included in wesbanco s results subsequent to their respective merger dates of april 5th and august 20 2018 we ll turn now to balance sheet total assets as of december 31 2018 grew 12 5 billion year over year reflecting approximately 2 3 billion of assets from the first sentry and farmers acquisitions furthermore total portfolio loans of 7 7 billion increased 20 7 compared to the prior year due to both acquisitions the strength of our residential mortgage lending program continued to drive strong loan originations that are better than the residential mortgage market nationwide our total year to date originations which were up 23 year over year continue to be driven by home purchases representing approximately 80 of total volume including construction relatively consistent with 2017 s rate as refinances have continued to drop in the marketplace furthermore while we continued our strategy to sell residential mortgage originations into the secondary market we again realized year over year organic growth of 3 3 during the fourth quarter from an increase in the amount of 1 to 4 family mortgage loans held on our balance sheet primarily due to growth in certain non conforming residential loans in the jumbo and private banking areas lastly our residential mortgage pipeline heading into 2019 is stronger than it was going into 2018 turning to the income statement now the net interest margin increased 29 basis points year over year reflecting the benefit to asset yields from the increases in the federal reserve board s target federal funds rate over the past year as well as the benefit from the higher margin on the acquired farmers net assets these benefits were partially offset by higher funding costs and a flatter yield curve which averaged approximately 20 basis points between the two year and the 10 year portion of the curve in the fourth quarter as a reminder also negatively affecting the margin in 2018 was a 6 basis point reduction related to the lower tax equivalency of the state and local municipal tax exempt securities resulting from 2017 tax cuts and jobs act excluding this reduction as well as purchase accounting accretion of 23 basis points in the fourth quarter and 6 basis points in the prior year period the core net interest margin increased 18 basis points year over year and 10 basis points sequentially from the third quarter to 3 55 purchase accounting accretion during the fourth quarter of 2018 was also positively impacted by an additional 4 basis points due to the december payoff of a former ycb originated loan as todd mentioned one of the key strategic differentiators of our franchise is our long term core deposit funding advantage which benefits profitability by helping to keep our overall deposit funding costs low as of december 31 2018 total deposits including non interest bearing increased 26 3 year over year to 8 9 billion reflecting the 1 8 billion from the two acquisitions however total deposit costs for the fourth quarter were up only 11 basis points year over year representing a beta of 11 compared to the 425 basis points federal funds rate increases during 2018 and on a year to date basis our total deposit beta was equally strong at just 12 for the quarter ended december 31 2018 non interest income increased 15 8 from the prior year to 26 6 million driven by the first sentry and farmers capital acquisitions as well as organic growth the associated larger customer base and higher transaction volumes drove the increases in electronic banking fees as well as deposit service charges the year over year change in net loss on other real estate owned was due to two larger oreo gains at the end of 2017 totaling 0 6 million as compared to a slight loss in 2018 net securities losses of 1 3 million were primarily due to the accounting treatment of the market adjustment on our deferred compensation plan the treatment of this adjustment is neutral to operating income as an offsetting 1 1 million is recorded as a credit within employee benefits expense as we have discussed many times our long term growth strategy is built upon delivering positive operating leverage while making necessary growth oriented and risk prevention investments and maintaining our strong culture of credit quality risk management and compliance we continue to demonstrate strong profitability and positive operating leverage through successful execution of our strategies as well as controlling discretionary costs despite the inclusion of farmers capital operating expenses since august 20 excluding merger related expenses non interest expense increased 15 2 million or 28 compared to the prior year period this year over year increase is reflective of the two acquisitions and their associated staffs and locations which were the primary reasons for the increases in salaries and wages employee benefits net occupancy and equipment cost the year over year increase in total employee benefits was partially mitigated by the 1 1 million reduction in the deferred compensation plan obligation due to market declines discussed earlier and a change in our accounting for pension costs whereby most of the annual expense is now accounted for in salaries our companywide dedication to controlling costs is evident in the 184 basis point year over year improvement in our 2018 core operating efficiency ratio of 54 6 which again is inclusive of farmers capitals expense base part of the cost savings expected to commence later during the first quarter of 2019 during the fourth quarter of 2018 our credit quality ratios remained strong as we balanced disciplined loan origination growth in the current environment with our prudential lending standards there are many ways to achieve increased profitability but adjusting our risk profile is not one of them especially at this point to the elongated economic expansion cycle our approach is not to sacrifice long term shareholder value for near term gains as our credit and risk management strategy guides our loan growth to be both disciplined and balanced to ensure stability and success across various economic cycles in addition we have continued to maintain strong regulatory capital ratios as both consolidated and bank level ratios grew this quarter and significantly exceed both well capitalized standards and peer ratios indeed our fourth quarter tangible common equity ratio increased both sequentially and year over year to 9 28 due to strong growth in retained earnings and lower accumulated other comprehensive losses offsetting the slightly negative impact earlier in the year of the two acquisitions before opening the call for your questions i would like to provide some current thoughts on our outlook for 2019 the inherent strength of our diversified growth strategies is how the components complement and support each other to ensure success and profitability in different operating environments despite our general asset sensitivity we are not immune from the factors that are affecting net interest margins across the industry including a very flat spread between the two year to 10 year treasury yields while our core deposit funding advantage combined with our low loan to deposit ratio will help to contain the overall deposit funding costs we still expect deposit betas to increase as we move forward we anticipate purchase accounting accretion to be in the mid teens during 2019 declining at a rate of 1 basis points to 2 basis points per quarter in the fourth quarter of 2018 we model 225 basis point federal funds rate increases in march and june of 2019 however the market outlook has changed since then and we are currently expecting just one midyear increase in our net interest income projections for 2019 while we do not anticipate much overall change in our core net interest margin this year as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 we do expect somewhat lower purchase accounting accretion which will reduce the stated margin a few basis points overall as we proceed through the year regarding operating expenses we remain on pace to achieve the remaining 25 of the anticipated first sentry cost savings of 38 this year and expect to achieve the planned 35 of farmers capital cost savings with 75 of those realized during 2019 and the remainder in 2020 we will continue to focus on expense trends to ensure positive operating leverage while positioning the company for long term growth we are planning our typical mid year merit increases for our employees and expect that marketing expense will ramp up from our fourth quarter run rate reflecting additional marketing spend in our various markets as well as the 25 larger company size furthermore fdic insurance expense will increase in the second quarter as we are assessed a higher rate for banks over 10 billion in asset size credit quality measures have been at or near historic lows over the last several periods and as such variability from quarter to quarter may occur which is currently not suggestive of a change in the direction of overall credit quality unless the economy were to slow down beyond current economic projections that said we do expect our credit quality measures to remain strong during 2019 we anticipate our effective full year tax rate to be between 18 to 20 subject to changes in certain taxable income strategies lastly during the second half of 2019 we will begin to incur the impact from the durbin amendment on interchange fee income which currently is anticipated to reduce fee income by approximately 2 5 million per quarter as well as have a slight negative influence on the efficiency ratio we are now ready to take your questions operator would you please review the instructions questions and answers operator thank you sir ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions and your first question this morning will be from casey whitman of sandler o neill please go ahead todd f clossin president chief executive officer good morning casey casey whitman sandler o neill partners analyst good morning good morning nice quarter todd f clossin president chief executive officer thank you casey whitman sandler o neill partners analyst just wanted to circle back on the accretion guidance you guys just gave so i think you said mid teens expected accretion just to be clear are you talking about mid teens margin impact like basis points or dollar amount in million robert h young executive vice president chief financial officer no that s the margin impact casey whitman sandler o neill partners analyst okay robert h young executive vice president chief financial officer so 23 basis points in the fourth quarter we re expecting mid teens beginning in the first quarter of 2019 and then a reduction of that as we proceed through the year and into 2020 of 1 basis points maybe 2 basis points a quarter prepayments will impact that as well casey whitman sandler o neill partners analyst okay and it sounds like your core margin guidance for that being relatively flat assuming one rate hike so what do you think where does your guidance move to if we don t get another rate hike robert h young executive vice president chief financial officer it would impact by 1 basis points to 2 basis points for the year that s about the impact of each 25 basis points increase casey whitman sandler o neill partners analyst okay got it and maybe i ll circle back to just your comments around loan growth so it sounds like we could maybe expect loans to grow better in 2019 but do you still think we re a few quarters out from seeing some of that growth or do you think we start to see a little bit of pick up earlier than that todd f clossin president chief executive officer yeah i think as we said ex consumer we were down about 1 3 but maybe i ll give a little color on that we had four performing loans filling about 46 million that we either exited or reduced to either being outside of our risk tolerance or maybe a little larger exposure then we really wanted with a couple of companies that are good performing companies so we brought in some other banks to share some of their growing exposure excluding those and some other smaller loans we kind of managed exposures i am really kind of looking at loans as essentially flat year over year again driven by active exposure management pipeline as i mentioned a little bit stronger going into the fourth quarter of this year first quarter of this year then going into the first quarter of last year and we would expect that commercial real estate pay downs in cre that s moving to the secondary market that start to stabilize at some point in 2019 as you kind of wash through all that and we did see that slow down a little bit toward the end of 18 and the very beginning of 19 and our strategy in terms of reducing parts of the consumer portfolio the risk return piece of that it s really stabilized over the last couple of months and we think we re kind of where we need to be on that piece of it so longer term we would still think low to mid single digit loan growth once that market dynamics return to a little bit of a more normalized level and that s kind of our view on it at this point casey whitman sandler o neill partners analyst very helpful thanks for taking my questions todd f clossin president chief executive officer sure operator the next question will be from austin nicholas of stephens please go ahead todd f clossin president chief executive officer hi austin austin nicholas stephens inc analyst hey guys good morning maybe just looking at the balance sheet again on the deposit growth it looks like those were down kind of quarter over quarter can you walk me through was there any kind of one time items or seasonality in your public funds that impacted that robert h young executive vice president chief financial officer i would tell you yeah obviously on a year over year basis excluding cds we were up 2 5 but in the fourth quarter we typically have some movement in some of the public funds that also kind of assorting to two mergers that we went through as well too while the customer basis stayed strong and we didn t see significant amount of attrition or anything like that you will see some changes associated with that but public funds is it s a big business for us and you do see some fluctuations in the fourth quarter also you ll see some fluctuations in different times in both directions in the first quarter as well austin nicholas stephens inc analyst got it okay and then maybe just on the expense growth number and maybe just outside of farmers could you maybe just guide us to where we should be thinking about the core expense growth rate kind of going into 19 i know you mentioned kind of marketing expenses ramping up and the fdic insurance expense also kind of increasing if you could quantify both of those as well that would help be helpful robert h young executive vice president chief financial officer well i would look at marketing expense as ramping up through the year and just reflecting the size of the company our budget in the past has been in that 5 million to 6 million area so you would figure 25 growth on that number next year and we expect it as campaigns activate that all proceeded at a pace that would suggest higher marketing in the back half of the year toward the end of the second quarter on the fdic side that increase will become effective on april the 1st and we re currently estimating between 1 million and 1 5 million over last year s expense reflecting both the growth in the company again austin as well as the higher assessment base or rate for banks over 10 billion overall guidance or comments about total expenses in the new year first of all you re looking at a little bit less than 70 million here in the fourth quarter if you exclude merger related expenses i would add back to that that deferred compensation amount is neutral to operating income but for purposes of operating expenses add that back and so that that really puts you slightly above 70 million 70 5 million as the fourth quarter run rate and we would see then cuts here toward the end of the first quarter and second quarter from the farmers acquisition as we convert systems and back office in the branches and then you would be looking at typically a 2 to 3 increase as we proceed throughout the year from that level as a result of normal midyear salary increases and other inflationary amount so kind of starting the year in that 71 million to 72 million level austin nicholas stephens inc analyst got it thanks that s helpful and then just maybe taking a step back thinking about capital and maybe just more importantly just on the m a are we still on a pause here in 19 or are transactions still are kind of back on the table todd f clossin president chief executive officer yeah and i appreciate the question i think with the integration of first sentry which the conversion was last summer and ffkt coming up here in the next couple of weeks everything has gone very well so the integration the simulation and everything else is very much on track so i said in the last spring year and a half to two years or so in terms of kind of what we saw from a pause standpoint but i could see we could end the pause in the second half of this year kind of the back half of this year there was the right opportunity to try to do something we would probably be willing to entertain that again i think we ve covered the 10 billion threshold very well and we re really managing things very tightly and i m real pleased with the team not only the existing legacy wesbanco team but the new employees that have come on from first sentry and ffkt and but it really it feels very much like one bank has been together a long time so i think as a result of that we could look at something in the back half of this year or early 2020 austin nicholas stephens inc analyst got it okay great thanks for taking my questions operator the next question will be from steve moss of b riley fbr please go ahead zachary weiss b riley fbr analyst hi good morning this is zach weiss on for steve today todd f clossin president chief executive officer good morning zachary weiss b riley fbr analyst good morning so i guess on fee income here curious your outlook maybe outside of the durbin impact just on trust fees and maybe mortgage how you guys are thinking about that for 2019 todd f clossin president chief executive officer let me start off bob might want to add some additional on here so we had the market impact on the trust fees in the fourth quarter and markets rebounded a little bit so far in the first quarter we ll see how the rest of the quarter goes we also have our fee program our fee initiative we mentioned in the past i think kind of phase one of that was atm fees and that was pretty much addressed in the early part of 2018 we also are continuing to look at other fees where we are below markets and are pretty significantly below market in a lot of places and addressing those over time as well as yeah just more disciplined around the fee waivers and being able to control those type of things and we think those are some pretty meaningful numbers that are going to part of it s in 18 part of it s in 19 part of it s going to be 2020 i mean it s 20 or 30 different little initiatives all of which have a different timeline and different processes associated with them and different approval processes associated with them but we would expect those to give us some additional fee growth in the future quarters as we implement them bob what else would you add to that robert h young executive vice president chief financial officer well i d say that it s kind of obvious but the first two quarters are going to have higher fee income in the back half of the year and as i said during my prepared remarks we do expect a slightly negative influence on the efficiency ratio in the back half of the year from a lower base here in the first half of the year so i would kind of look at the fourth quarter as a placeholder for a run rate at this point yes there is some impact on trust fees but typically the first quarter is a better quarter for us on trust fees because of a tax preparation fees primarily and we do expect mortgage banking to continue to ramp up despite lower refis and lower overall business in the economy and that s just because we re hiring more originators and taking business from others and have some very good programs with some great leadership as well so those are my main guidance points the electronic banking will continue to increase in the first half of the year before you ll see that line item reflect durbin in the back half of the year zachary weiss b riley fbr analyst okay thank you and then on the balance sheet in terms of the securities balances should we expect those to be relatively flat for the year todd f clossin president chief executive officer yeah our anticipation isn t to dramatically increase them as a percentage of the balance sheet i think we re pretty comfortable where we re at i mean we realize margin and expense control is what s driving a lot of the earnings growth and the positive operating leverage right now and we do need to grow the balance sheet funds in particular are going to need to grow over time moving forward so we don t have a real pessimistic view of the economy or anything like that we re just taking the opportunity to position the loan portfolio a little bit for long term success but we re not going to be ramping up the securities portfolio to offset slower loan growth that isn t our plan zachary weiss b riley fbr analyst all right thank you very much todd f clossin president chief executive officer sure operator and our next question will be from russell gunther of d a davidson please go ahead russell gunther d a davidson company analyst hey good morning guys todd f clossin president chief executive officer hi russell russell gunther d a davidson company analyst i just wanted to circle back to the longer conversation todd appreciate your comments around the low to mid single digit range for next year but if we think about the two recent deals that 1 4 billion in loan balances is there a bucket of that that you guys kind of ring fenced or thought about in terms of intended rundown or a managed decline or have pro forma balances there kind of shook out where you thought i m just trying to get a sense if there s been anything else kind of weighing on loan balances in addition to the industry headwinds todd f clossin president chief executive officer yeah those both of those two mergers as customary with prior mergers we did sell some loans right before or right at the time of the merger was completed so we kind of move those things off the books early on that we didn t think really fit with our profile going forward and the lending teams have all stayed intact and the plan isn t to run loan balances down or anything like that at all i mean a part of the reason and going into those markets is because of the household growth and the demographic growth and the business environment there they were growing those markets louisville and lexington in particular were growing faster than some of our legacy markets so we think that ll be good for us from a loan growth perspective and a balance sheet perspective going forward but we re comfortable with the credit that we picked up we re comfortable with the loan categories and we re comfortable with the businesses so the plan would be to expand it and not to intentionally run down to any part of that russell gunther d a davidson company analyst great i appreciate that and then todd as a follow up there what do you think the biggest delta in your mind is to achieving that mid single digit growth versus the low end of the range todd f clossin president chief executive officer yeah it s a great question i spent some time in the market the last couple of weeks with our lending teams and i think there still is just uncertainty out there just some hesitancy to want to pull the trigger on expansion i m hearing a lot from customers around having a hard time finding people they could generate additional revenue work on additional contracts things like that but they re all struggling to find additional people to be able to capitalize on that but i also think there s some conservatism there in terms of really not being 100 sure of what s going on from an economic standpoint you wouldn t think that the trade wars would have a big impact on a lot of our companies but a lot of them are bringing in aluminum and steel and things like that and they re a little nervous about where those prices are going so they re trying not to get overextended so i think there s just lack of maybe the lack of animal spirits i guess as some people say and a conservatism that s out there and people are sitting on cash balances businesses are sitting on cash balances so i think if we can get some more i mean less volatility on some of those talks and some more definite direction that people can plan for then i think you might see a little more activity out there but i just i attribute it to people just kind of pulling in their horns and being conservative right now russell gunther d a davidson company analyst i d appreciate your thoughts there and then just last one for me you mentioned a willingness to take a look at m a again in the back half of the year if the opportunity arose can you just remind us from a size perspective geography perspective sort of where you re focused with deals going forward todd f clossin president chief executive officer yeah very much same as in the past i mean we re looking at a six hour drive time from our wheeling headquarters here so you can see the map and where that six hours would be we re not the bank that s going to be jumping over states and going down south and out west and stuff like that we ll stay within that market that we ve stayed in historically and if it s an in market deal obviously higher expense saves if it s an outer market deal then we d be looking at growth characteristics that would be stronger than our legacy markets very similar to what you saw with ffkt and even your community bank a couple of years ago that would be the that would be the plan russell gunther d a davidson company analyst thanks for taking my questions todd f clossin president chief executive officer sure operator operator instructions your next question will be from stuart lotz of kbw please go ahead stuart lotz keefe bruyette woods inc analyst hey guys good morning todd f clossin president chief executive officer good morning stuart lotz keefe bruyette woods inc analyst most of my questions have been asked but maybe just one follow up around credit costs or credit cost expectations for next year i know that provision was higher this quarter related to some charge offs but any outlook for 2019 what we can expect from a quarter to quarter provision expense todd f clossin president chief executive officer yeah i mean we don t see a whole lot of change from the last couple of years i mean everything is really quiet it really all looks very very good i think our first or second second and third quarter were almost nothing third quarter was actually a recovery so we just don t see anything there at all i think for the year the number was just incredibly low and we don t see anything impacting that we don t see things in the pipeline deteriorating we don t have any exposure or concentration issues in areas or industries that we re really concerned about so kind of steady as she goes and i would expect the next few quarters at this point to look very similar to what we ve had in the past stuart lotz keefe bruyette woods inc analyst all right well yeah that s all i had so thanks guys todd f clossin president chief executive officer thank you operator and ladies and gentlemen that will conclude our question and answer session i would like to hand the conference back over to todd clossin

k earnings release joining me today are malcolm holland our chairman and ceo terry earley our chief financial officer and clay riebe our chief credit officer malcolm charles malcolm holland chairman and chief executive officer good morning everybody thank you susan first and foremost i want to officially welcome terry earley and the entire green bank team to the veritex family last seven months working toward the january 1st green bank closings and has been an incredibly positive experience with all parties pulling together to build something very special i personally like to thank manny mehos for his constant support and trust over the past few months as we work toward uniting these two great companies i ll start with a couple of exciting announcements our board has adopted our first quarterly dividend of 0 125 per share payable on february 21st for shareholders of record on february 7th and we have finalized and received approval of a buyback agreement for up to 50 million of our common stock during 2019 now on the results fourth quarter was an encouraging quarter for veritex we recorded fourth quarter eps of 0 40 and fully diluted operating eps of 0 47 we continue to see a very strong texas lending market with veritex net loans during the quarter increasing 110 million or 18 annualized 2018 marked the eighth consecutive year of record loan growth for veritex veritex originated new loan commitments in excess of 1 675 billion while green originated just short of 1 2 billion that s almost 3 billion in combined new loan commitments our pipelines remain active and full and we are extremely confident that our 2019 net loan growth will be in the low double digits our texas economy is strong our unemployment rate continued at historic rates of 3 7 with new jobs of 391 000 and 127 000 statewide and dfw respectively texas remains a robust economy as mentioned last quarter we felt our core nim had some upward movement the quarter produced a 9 basis point increase to 3 82 from 3 73 last quarter terry will provide some additional color on the nim in a few moments credit quality has remained very strong net charge offs for the year were virtually non existent non performing assets decreased from 0 80 to 0 77 during the quarter and concentrations remained at acceptable levels additionally we completed the december review of the outstanding green bank loan portfolio to obtain the most current data available and are making the appropriate up to date marks to the acquired portfolio the deposit side of our business continue to be extremely competitive in all of our markets veritex grew deposits 343 million or 15 1 for the calendar year 2018 recognizing that a majority of this growth was in the interest bearing categories we continue to be keenly focused on this side of the business we have multiple levers available to continue to grow our core deposits such as treasury management focused sales efforts relationship manager deposit incentive plans and the creation of a new hoa division we re also looking forward to new customer opportunities provided by the scale achieved with the merger of green now i will turn the call over to terry for some additional color on our numbers terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning everybody malcolm definitely did a good job in covering the major highlights for the quarter and there is certainly some good news and results i ll move to now drill down into numbers and try to give you a sense of the earnings power of the new combined company i ll just start by acknowledging that by including the discussion of green results in the press release it does make it very long but the importance of the green acquisition to the veritex financials along with the desire to be totally transparent led us to conclude this presentation approach was best finally while gaap reporting is certainly important and required i m going to focus most of my comments on combined operating results even though the slides reflect the companies on a stand alone basis turning to slide five in the deck malcolm has already commented on the key financial results for the quarter so i just want to spend a minute focusing on a couple of other points the combined and annualized fourth quarter operating net income for green and veritex totaled 111 million again combined and annualized this translates into 2 04 in fully diluted earnings per share and you get there by adding the fully diluted shares for both companies and applying the exchange rate for the merger this earnings level should give everyone a sense of the run rate earnings power before 2019 growth the impact of the cost saves and the balance sheet marks on slide six just please note the growth in tangible book value per share in q4 with veritex ending the year at 14 57 and green at 11 18 obviously the tangible book value will change materially on january 1st with the closing of the merger the work on the fair value marks for the balance sheet is still under way but veritex remains confident that is earlier estimates of upfront tbv dilution from balance sheet marks and merger cost remain materially correct in the aggregate turning to the next slide these graphs demonstrate this earnings power i ve been talking about of the two companies and show the pre tax pre provision operating earnings contribution as well this level of pre tax pre provision operating earnings bodes well as we move later and later in the credit cycle both companies are producing strong operating results clearly the level of excess capital being carried by the two companies will be significantly lower from the merger coupled with the initiation of the dividend and the announcement of the buyback the merger and these capital management actions should result in significantly higher returns on tangible common equity going forward on slide eight both companies were already very efficient on an operating basis before we see the benefits of the cost saves related to the merger with the conversion and branch consolidations planned for the end of the second quarter the bulk of the cost saves will be back end loaded there has been a small portion of the overall savings that were realized late in 2018 and that level will increase in q1 and q2 with scheduled employee departures and other cost saving integration activities on a combined basis loan production increased approximately 77 from 2017 to 2018 to the almost 3 billion number that malcolm mentioned earlier the planned divestiture of green s austin branch was announced late in q4 and is expected to close in late q1 loan growth on a combined basis excluding the impact of the austin loans which are classified as held for sale was approximately 530 million or almost 10 in 2018 this growth was achieved in spite of the distraction from the merger and the work on the integration management remains confident in our ability to achieve low double digit loan growth in 2019 commercial real estate concentrations remained steady in q4 and should not be a constraint on loan growth as we go through 2019 on slide 10 the combined non interest bearing dda portfolio is almost 1 5 billion and represents approximately 24 of total deposits total deposit costs continued to increase but remember please consider the loan beta where we have almost 70 floating rates additionally the branch light business model provides other expense synergies given the 6 1 billion in deposits with only 43 banking offices turning to slide 11 now the increase in contractual loan rates from q3 to q4 for both veritex and green highlights the floating rate nature of our loan portfolio and the combined interest net interest margin in q4 was 3 84 as we look out into 2019 the companies is expecting a net interest margin in the range of 4 05 to 4 2 this is the this range assumes no fed fund rate increases and is a result of first the purchase accounting marks on loans and investments second the rate marks on the time deposits and borrowings and third a favorable mix shift in both earning assets and interest bearing liabilities finally on slide 12 as malcolm stated earlier q4 reflected continued credit stability at veritex with a slight decline in npas and green has shown considerable improvement in npas since the end of q1 also recall that the credit mark was refreshed at green right before year end and should provide considerable downside protection as it relates to net charge offs and loan loss provisions it s important to note that post merger approximately 63 of the loan portfolio now carries a credit mark and the part that isn t marked has been underwritten to veritex credit standards and continues to show exceptional loss performance with that i d like to turn the call back malcolm charles malcolm holland chairman and chief executive officer thank you terry as you might imagine we have a lot of moving parts right now consolidating our two institutions the integration of our systems and teams is going extremely well personnel and management determinations have been made and communicated companywide over the last months we offered 18 retention agreements to key green producers with a 100 acceptance rate other highlights include us hiring our first ever full time training director from the green side and engage in a brand agency to better connect with our customers additionally our cio just hired a new chief technology officer to lead us in our growing technology area candidly i ve never seen this much communication and collaboration between similar sized institutions while coming together we have a great deal of work to accomplish and our goal is to have a majority of it completed by june 30 we ll continue to monitor us we will take the best of each institution to produce a better company and stronger than either one of us was independently increased scale and countless new opportunities enhance our new veritex and our excitement about what we can build together in 2019 and beyond operator at this time we d be happy to answer any questions questions and answers operator operator instructions and our first question comes from the line of matt olney from stephens you may begin matt olney stephens analyst hi thanks good morning guys charles malcolm holland chairman and chief executive officer good morning terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning matt olney stephens analyst want to start on capital you had some interesting announcements last night as far as the stock repurchase program the dividend i think they all make sense curious on the buyback how active do you expect to be is this more of an insurance policy in case the stock gets down to below 22 again and then on the pro forma tce ratio i guess with green bank i want to make sure i m thinking about this right i m about at 9 5 tce ratio in the first quarter am i in the right ballpark there charles malcolm holland chairman and chief executive officer go ahead terry terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah matt it s terry let me take your last question first i think you are in the right ballpark with respect to tce at the end of q1 you know and on the buyback i would i do view it more as an insurance policy although i would probably put a little bit higher number on it than you did you used 22 so let s just let s leave it there i think the last point i would make is that this company is going to generate a lot of excess capital even with the earnings power and so it s a great problem to have but certainly the dividend and if we need the buyback we re going to stay given our risk profile we ll have plenty of capital to support the growth we need in our key markets matt olney stephens analyst okay that s perfect thank you for that and then on the cost savings i think you said in the prepared remarks there was a small portion of the cost saves that were recognized at the end of 2018 so just taking a step back any change in the overall cost saving expectations and can you kind of firm up for us the timing of those cost savings i think you said they would be back half loaded any other color you can provide on the timing of the cost saves terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer well i chose those remarks carefully and you ll note that we gave guidance on nim and we felt like we needed to give guidance on the nim because the range of everybody out there who writes on us was so wide especially in q1 and it felt like there was a need to clarify and tighten that up a little bit we didn t say anything on the efficiency because i felt like you got in the cost saves because my general view is you guys have done pretty good job there and you know it will have we will have we will realize additional saves in the first half of the year whether it d be personnel or non personnel related things but when you got your consolidation and your conversion at in june that s when you re really going to start to see the operational saves and things like that so i don t know i ll probably just leave it there charles malcolm holland chairman and chief executive officer yeah i think you re on the cost save number we it moves within the number but then the total that we had originally when we originally looked at the deal is virtually the same matt olney stephens analyst okay all right guys i ll step back in the queue thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of brady gailey from kbw your line is now open brady gailey kbw analyst hey good morning guys charles malcolm holland chairman and chief executive officer good morning brady brady gailey kbw analyst so the 2019 nim guidance of the 4 05 to 4 20 i got that how are you all thinking about the core nim for 2019 i m just trying to figure out how much yield accretion will be flowing through the margin this year terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer my estimates of yield accretion on the loan side are probably in the 9 to 10 basis points range well let me say 8 to 9 basis points sorry needed to look back at my notes 8 to 9 basis points brady gailey kbw analyst okay yeah so a core margin somewhere in kind of the high 3 low 4 range is that correct terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer no no i mean well not yet let s be careful as you know that when i say 8 to 9 bps on the loan portfolio there s another 4 to 5 bps on the investment portfolio and there s some on the liability side so i don t see the core nim doing a lot it might be up a handful basis points but both from earning assets as well as the december fed increase but that s the way i think about this brady gailey kbw analyst okay right that s helpful and then just on the m a front i know it feels a little early to ask about m a just because it s still the big deal and i know you are going to be focused on it for the at least the first half of the year if not the full year but i mean both green and veritex have been pretty acquisitive in the past how are you all and you ll be around 8 billion so you got not a ton of room until you hit 10 billion how are you all thinking about m a for the back half of this year and into 2020 charles malcolm holland chairman and chief executive officer we re thinking about it the back half really we re thinking about it 2020 i mean you hit the nail on the head we this is a big deal for both of us we are zero focused on making sure this integration goes well and it is going exceedingly well but there is a bunch of stuff to do between now and 6 30 that the m a discussion has really been off the table until we can get through 6 30 and we even have a small little piece of our data converting in september it s a smaller piece it s a treasury piece but we ve got a lot to get done here and so if we do what we think we can do and we can deliver what we think we can deliver then we re going to have some optionality in the back half of the year and going into in 2020 to make some of those decisions but those are decisions that we ll make down the road brady gailey kbw analyst okay great thanks guys charles malcolm holland chairman and chief executive officer thanks brady terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks brady operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of brad milsaps from sandler o neill you may begin brad milsaps sandler o neill analyst hey guys good morning charles malcolm holland chairman and chief executive officer hey brad brad milsaps sandler o neill analyst terry i just wanted to follow up on the whole core nim discussion it looks like maybe you changed the way you presented to some degree in that the core nim as you define it includes some level of expected purchase accounting and then anything above that is sort of the accelerated piece is that correct terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer yes that is correct in my view the scheduled accretion is no different than buying the loan portfolio is like buying a bond at a discount and it s got a life and when you look at veritex s stand alone accretion in the fourth quarter one it was down materially which drove the decline in the nim but there is if you take the remaining marks accretable yield and look at it and look at q4 we got 17 quarters if the level stays exactly the same and so of life left in those marks if you will 17 quarters and i just think that bodes well and it s an ongoing revenue stream that needs to be considered as core because it really has got a pretty long life on it so yeah we ve changed that s why we ve changed i guess reflecting my view of that scheduled accretion as part of the yield that you priced into the deal when you marked the balance sheet and announced a deal and that s the way we ought to treat it and if there s anything above that then we ought to call that out because that is lumpy and unusual brad milsaps sandler o neill analyst got it so the 4 05 to 4 20 would include everything the accelerated and the expected or that s just the expected terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer that s the expected brad milsaps sandler o neill analyst okay so then it could there could be upside if you get something accelerated terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer correct brad milsaps sandler o neill analyst okay and then you said you expressed comfort with kind of the efficiency expenses that are out there does that include like any new update on cdi because you have new marks here terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer when yes we have it does include cdi both the positive impact of wiping out the green and the estimated cdi from the merger our work on the cdi is not yet complete but i just really don t think it s going to change materially from what was filed in the s 4 brad milsaps sandler o neill analyst okay great and then just a final question on fees specifically sba i think if i read correctly it would sound like veritex had a pretty good sba quarter maybe you guys did and may have that flip flop but just kind of curious what s all going on with that product kind of how you think about that kind of a on a combined basis charles malcolm holland chairman and chief executive officer yeah i mean we it s still a major focus for us both companies were very active and had folks in at the green the green guy is going to be leading us there we think it has understandably slowed down a little bit but we still think that we will be fairly active i think we re kind of looking at about 1 5 million or so a quarter in usda and sba but that s those are lumpy as you know so those usda deals show up and you could have a great quarter and the next quarter be a little bit down but that s still a very very much a focus for us the 10 year product is pretty difficult to sell right now just because of the pricing the 25 year product you still get some really good pricing so we ll make those decisions depending on what the markets are but it s still a major piece of what we re going to have for next year terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer and but tagging on the great thing about the usda product is you don t have to split the premium over 10 so the economics are even better it s lumpy but it s going to have even more great focus for us going forward and the rest of what malcolm said i totally agree with brad milsaps sandler o neill analyst great thank you guys charles malcolm holland chairman and chief executive officer thanks brad terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks brad operator and our next question comes from the line of gary tenner from d a davidson you may begin gary tenner d a davidson analyst good morning charles malcolm holland chairman and chief executive officer good morning gary tenner d a davidson analyst some of my questions have been answered good morning couple of questions though i guess in terms of fees for the combined company are there any fee categories where maybe the structure or types of fees differed materially whether there d be any sort of meaningful difference than just the combination of the two companies fee items charles malcolm holland chairman and chief executive officer no i mean i think the combination is accurate green definitely had a really nice non interest income treasury fee product products which we re going to be adopting but combining them together i think is very accurate terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer i do think it s the place where they we see revenue synergies trying to leverage that customized green treasury management code across the veritex footprint and the green within the customer interest rate swap business and that s something we d like to see expand across the veritex footprint so but malcolm s right it s combining it and thus just focusing on it and growing it gary tenner d a davidson analyst okay thanks for that and actually as you mentioned the swap book and the swap business with prospects of a fed pause and not knowing where they ll go after this and you noted the large amount of your loans that are floating rate in nature any thoughts in terms of sort of moderating or adjusting the rate sensitivity at this point in the cycle terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer well we ve now run we ve got three quarters we ve already run on the pro forma combined basis for the institution and i m pretty comfortable with where the asset sensitivity is i d say it s modestly or moderately asset sensitive it s come down with some fixed rate lending that we ve done in the back half of the quarter we re certainly not neutral or not liability sensitive but i m pretty comfortable with where we are and i don t see the need i think the asset duration we have i want to use in the owner occupied commercial real estate book to help us drive deposits and operating from operating businesses so we ve got the ability to do that we will continue to do it i think it will keep us neutral and i like what it can help us do on the deposit side so feeling pretty good there gary tenner d a davidson analyst all right thank you very much charles malcolm holland chairman and chief executive officer thanks terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks gary operator and our next question comes from the line of daniel mannix from raymond james you may begin daniel mannix raymond james analyst hey guys good morning charles malcolm holland chairman and chief executive officer hey daniel terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer hey daniel daniel mannix raymond james analyst appreciate the updated outlook here i want to start with credits so maybe clay want to ask it looked like the credit metrics regained their footing this quarter can you give us an update on those three pci loans that were removed to non performing last quarter in 3q michael clayton riebe executive vice president and chief credit officer sure sure we can the first credit that was in the auto industry that loan resolved and is on a performing basis today the other two credits that are in the oil and gas space we expected one to resolve in the fourth quarter through a refinance that has not taken place we continue to work that credit and the final credit was another oil and gas credit that s in the bankruptcy today and we expect that to resolve in q2 of this year terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer no additional marks or anything on any of those credits valuations has stayed pretty stable michael clayton riebe executive vice president and chief credit officer right daniel mannix raymond james analyst got it so adequately reserved michael clayton riebe executive vice president and chief credit officer yes terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer yes sir daniel mannix raymond james analyst great okay and then just wanted to switch over to deposits looked like there was sequential declines in the core deposits after what was really a great third quarter how much of that fourth quarter decline is seasonal or i guess transitory in nature i mean i and i totally understand the high loan growth and tilt toward commercial what how that impacts deposit costs and betas but how do you see those trending this year and 2019 charles malcolm holland chairman and chief executive officer seasonal probably isn t the right word but they are opportunistic and that there were a couple of large company sales that happened in the third quarter that were substantial and so those money sat around for 60 to 120 days while they reinvested and did whatever they did with those dollars we still know that deposits are probably one of our largest challenges we do have a bunch of levers to pull this market is still growing it s quite robust but it is very competitive the good news is that at least on the loan side we continue to move our loan yields up and as we move up our deposit side but we have seen some flattening i guess locally in terms of cost and so is the competition the same yes but i think it s at a lesser price which is encouraging to us but it s just it s something that s got to be top of mind for all of our relationship managers and in my management team it is the most frequently talked about subject but we still feel good about getting our growth next year terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer i think we ve also increased the weight we give it in our lender incentive plan to support that importance and view of the challenge it represents for us so hopefully that will contribute as well daniel mannix raymond james analyst yeah that s really helpful i appreciate the additional color on those deposit growth strategies so just wanted to confirm there are you still targeting that 95 loan to deposit ratio for the combined company terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer yes sir daniel mannix raymond james analyst great all right that s it from me thanks gentlemen charles malcolm holland chairman and chief executive officer thanks daniel terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks daniel operator and our next question comes from the line of bill dezellem from tieton capital management you may begin bill dezellem tieton capital management analyst thank you i had a couple of questions first of all your i guess i should say veritex s salaries and employee benefits was up by roughly 900 000 versus the third quarter would you please walk us through what was behind that and then secondarily terry you d mentioned that the combined entity had 2 04 of earnings when annualized is that the number that we should be taking that 25 accretion on that you originally noted when the combination was announced terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer let me take let me start the first there on veritex salaries i think there s two things that are playing into the increase in the salary line first is variable incentives driven by growth and production by the by our bankers so it was a strong it s strong growth translated into better incentives for them secondly though even though we had a lot of growth production was actually down and veritex has been talking for several quarters now about a lot of production that was going to fund up and i think that was what was going on so production was down a little so our cost deferral under fas 91 was less and so the combination of higher variable incentives and lower cost deferral is what s contributing to the salary line on the second question i went blank charles malcolm holland chairman and chief executive officer it is on the 2 04 terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer 2 04 yeah i think that s look we i gave you that number because i think it s indicative of what our run rate earnings are as we jump off into 2019 before those things and so we certainly didn t know on july 24th exactly what our q4 run rate earnings were going to be but i think our comments and everything still generally we re not sitting here and giving guidance that or comments that would change that guidance so it s in the range of when you get to a nim of 4 05 to 4 20 it puts you in a similar place with respect to that accretion eps accretion we originally discussed when we announced the merger bill dezellem tieton capital management analyst and the 2 04 that s the combined annualized is the correct base to be using that on as opposed to veritex only or i just want to make sure that we don t start doing a 25 accretion on the wrong base terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer well it gets you to the the comment was based on veritex the merger announcement was based on veritex s eps expectations for 2019 so i mean you re layering in the green earnings but you re layering in the green fully diluted shares as well so the calculation was different what i m really saying that what you suggested gets you into the right range if you will of where we think about 2019 performance bill dezellem tieton capital management analyst okay thank you for the clarity and i appreciate the help charles malcolm holland chairman and chief executive officer thanks terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator and our next question comes from the line of matt olney from stephens you may begin matt olney stephens analyst hey thanks for taking the follow up i just wanted to understand the one time expenses for 2019 as a result of the acquisition kind of the timing and the amount we should be expecting terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah matt it s terry we timing we want them to be front end loaded at first half of the year and i would estimate that we have about two thirds of them to go and they there will be a lot in q1 with the closing of the deal and the advisory cost and some of the severance et cetera so we certainly have got about again about two thirds to go with i think and i would say that will be weighted a little bit toward q1 over q2 matt olney stephens analyst okay and then on the green bank side i think there was a larger charge off than we ve seen for a few quarters now any color was that cleanup or anything you can tell us about that charge off or just credit in general at green bank terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah that charge off related to the syndicated healthcare credit that green identified in q1 and provided for and so that bankrupt that company went into bankruptcy and that during q4 that bankruptcy was resolved and green was paid down on its unreserved portion if you will and so we were just cleaning it up we had gotten far enough along we had real clarity on what the charge off needed to be and we dealt right to get that done in 12 31 so matt olney stephens analyst and outside of that terry it looks like non accrual levels fell at green bank so i assume there is no other color there or any other details on the green bank credit piece terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer no it s actually moving in the right direction matt olney stephens analyst perfect terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer and that s all before the march that we re going to make on the portfolio so we feel really good about their portfolio matt olney stephens analyst okay and then circling back to the margin discussion i looked at my notes and i believe the mark that we talked about last time on that sub debt and maybe some trust preferreds was around 8 million is that still the right ballpark number or has that moved around with rates being volatile terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer it s i think it s rates have moved up and moved back down i m still using as i think about things that same general number that work is still that we ve been more focused on the loan and investment side than on the liability side of the balance sheet on the marks so far in january but i think you re probably still in the ballpark matt olney stephens analyst and just how do i think about the duration of some of these moving pieces so take that first one on the sub debt part what s the duration of something like that terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer well the bulk of the marks coming out of the green sub debt which was put on in december of 16 it s a 10 year no call 5 so you got three years to run it was expensive when issued and that we would expect to actively refinance it when the time comes so that s the way i would think about that the other liability marks are going to be relatively short the federal home loan bank advances are all inside of 18 months and the duration of the cd portfolio on average is probably about a year i mean it s as is most i don t think in my entire career i ll be ever seeing a cd book with a duration of more than inaudible it s a that s where so they don t have long lives matt olney stephens analyst and what about the duration on the loan side terry what s your best guess of that terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer i would say that s got it s that s probably four to five years and the same is true in the investment portfolio i talked about the yield the nim pickup and the investment portfolio it s got a effective duration if at probably around about 4 1 years so yeah so it s got a pretty good tail on it as well matt olney stephens analyst okay all right this is challenging my accounting knowledge but i ll do the best i can on this thanks guys charles malcolm holland chairman and chief executive officer so be it thanks matt terry s earley executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks matt operator operators instructions and i m showing no questions at this time i d like to turn the call back to malcolm for closing remarks charles malcolm holland chairman and chief executive

china is moving quickly to push forward a draft version of its first foreign investment law this week among other things the proposed law bans forced technology transfers guarantees national treatment for foreign investors and steps up intellectual property right protections all key issues in the ongoing trade dispute with washington it also supports a negative list management for foreign investment a list unveiled in june last year cut the number of restricted items down to 48 from 63 and removed access restrictions in several sectors according to state media analysts note however that the way the law is being rushed through and the vague wording of many of its 39 clauses is casting some serious doubts on authorities ability to enforce the legislation after it is passed being rushed through lester ross who chairs the china policy committee of the american chamber of commerce amcham in beijing said he s concerned about the draft s expedited review including a two day legislative session for the draft bill that begins tuesday the meeting comes before the period of solicitation of public comments is set to end in late february china s largely rubber stamp legislature the national people s congress is working to fast track the bill s passage during its annual meeting in march which may serve as an olive branch to ease trade tensions with washington said liu meng chun of the chung hua institution of economic research cier in taipei while acknowledging the draft s consistency with the competitive neutrality principal which encourages fair competition between domestic and foreign businesses ross said the draft has many shortcomings the problem is that there are many provisions in the law which do not address the concerns of foreign investors and in addition the provisions are in some cases so broadly worded that they actually create a basis for mistreatment of foreign businesses he said additional hurdles for example article 20 allows the state to take control of foreign investment in the interest of the public yet what defines public interest isn t clear as is the case when article 33 states the need for safety reviews on foreign businesses which influence or are likely to influence national security that ross said creates an additional hurdle when the law is intended to reduce hurdles as a principal he urges china to keep restrictions on foreign investment to a minimum in accordance with international norms and china s own wto commitments walker wallace partner at the u s international law firm o melveny myers office in shanghai finds the draft s article 39 problematic as it is currently worded the article only gives foreign businesses a five year grace period to reorganize their existing corporate structure mainly joint ventures or wholly foreign owned enterprises a problematic deadline putting the five year term limit basically puts the gun to the heads of the joint venture parties and says you have five years to try and reopen a deal that was closely negotiated before where people made trade offs one way or another and that opens up the possibility for all kinds of mischief wallace says he said china should allow foreign invested enterprises to retain their existing corporate structures till the end of their current contract so that no shareholders for example a chinese land owner and a foreign hotel company with an agreement longer than five years use the opportunity to unfairly renegotiate another issue he adds is the bill fails to spell out the consequences foreign businesses will face if they re unable to complete such reorganization within the time frame wallace also urged china to add provisions to the draft that would allow foreign businesses to be able to freely establish domestic subsidiaries just like their local competitors it remains to be seen whether foreign companies will be governed by china s company law after the bill takes effect if so the company law presents another set of problems said ross for example he added foreign businesses will find it unacceptable to set up a communist party branch within the companies as required by article 19 enforceable assurances compared to the 2015 draft the earlier version of the law the new bill further opens up the chinese market to foreign investment through deregulation and institutional reform but how that will all play out in practice remains to be seen as the law s enforcement will be handled by local governments cier s liu noted china has often embraced protectionist policies at the local level if the open up policy involves sectors that have long been dominated by local government owned enterprises it means these government run companies will now face foreign competition given that their performance is tied to local governments fiscal it remains to be seen if local authorities will fully execute the central government s policies the economist said in other words the removal of hidden hurdles for foreign businesses that contradict to the law upon its adoption will be key he added those hurdles include bureaucratic red tape taxation practices or the level of priorities given to foreign businesses in listing queues all of which have in the past added difficulties to the operation of foreign investment there observers say
rep maxine waters d calif recently outlined her agenda as the new chairwoman of the house financial services committee unfortunately a continued misdiagnosis of the most recent financial crisis stoked her calls for perpetuating heavy government involvement in the housing market and further intrusion into other financial sectors the hints of bipartisanship outreach on several matters meanwhile smacked largely of cronyism waters blamed wall street running amok for the foreclosures unemployment and stock market collapse she said that abusive institutions had been peddling toxic products like no doc loans interest only mortgages and other predatory products no government agency waters said in her remarks jan 17 was responsible for prioritizing consumer protection she flatly declared that fannie mae and freddie mac did not cause the financial crisis and were not to blame for the private market packaging those toxic risky loans although fraud on the parts of some lenders and many borrowers certainly surged during the housing bubble leading up to 2008 this proved a symptom rather the primary culprit of the excesses that honorific lies with the decision of politicians to embark on a plan of increasing home ownership and expanding credit access to accomplish this mission the government used a combination of affordable housing mandates and implicit federal guarantees of mortgages purchased by the two leading government sponsored entities fannie mae and freddie mac thanks to these mortgage guarantees credit flowed prices soared and everyone realtors mortgage brokers banks investors builders and homeowners seemed to win until the bottom dropped out a large part of the entire housing sector proved largely a house of cards refusing to acknowledge this harsh reality only serves to perpetuate the problems leaders of all political stripes hope to solve waters rightfully labeled housing affordability a crisis the government continues to guarantee the vast majority of residential mortgage debt helping to flood the market with capital and the federal reserve continues to allocate through fiat a disproportionate amount of capital to the housing market through its hundreds of billions of purchases of mortgage backed securities with this in mind it s no surprise that unaffordable housing continues to plague the nation after bottoming out 27 percent below the peak home prices have spiked 54 percent since 2012 more than quadruple the rate of inflation inflation adjusted home prices are near the frothy levels of 2004 within striking distance of the bubble s climax in 2006 in her remarks waters articulated principles of housing finance reform centered on maintaining access to housing credit for all qualified borrowers that can sustain homeownership this means housing finance reform will need to include a comprehensive strategy around access to affordable mortgage credit as well as access to affordable rental housing she said a dive into the details of plans to provide this access shows a perpetuation of government mortgage subsidies guarantees and mandates a swath of special interests in the business community may benefit at least temporarily from this but taxpayers bear the ultimate risk of these mortgages souring homeowners bear the costs of inflated prices and the possibility of another severe decline now waters is calling for an increase of more than 13 billion in federal spending over five years through the ending homelessness act including vouchers and rental subsidies nearly half of this additional spending stems from bolstering revenue available to the housing trust fund in order to further affordable rental housing freddie mac and fannie mae already set aside 4 2 basis points of every dollar of unpaid principal of new business purchases for the housing trust fund and the capital magnet fund this required set aside adds more than 120 to a 300 000 mortgage these efforts too often attempt to paper over the mental illnesses foundational social problems and errant local government policies that contribute to many instances of homelessness one thing is for certain politicians and a narrow set of special interests benefit from the billions of dollars flowing to favored developers and organizations from these funds waters also promised to re empower the consumer financial protection bureau in furtherance of her goals prior to the trump administration the cfpb threatened to choke financial innovation and entrepreneurship under the guise of protecting consumers rather than prod the cfpb into paternalistic regulating every corner of our financial system the focus should be on cracking down on fraud and promoting adequate disclosures and transparencies office of management and budget director mick mulvaney who served for more than a year as director of the cfpb reined in many of its most egregious overreaches waters hopes to undo this progress through her consumers first act one hint of the waters approach to regulation is her proposal to reduce the time period that negative items stay on credit reports it is not clear why the federal government needs to mandate this time period as it stands now a government insured mortgage loan with only 3 5 percent down is available just two years out of bankruptcy this move threatens to handicap the ability of lenders and investors to determine the credit worthiness of possible borrowers this likely will result in a combination of higher overall interest rates to compensate for the increased risk along with a tightening of credit standards in other regards of particular concern is how waters will approach the financial technology fintech sector which is rapidly transforming the capital markets entrepreneurs and consumers alike increasingly use fintech solutions to leap past limitations imposed by banks credit unions or the equities markets waters promised to encourage responsible innovation with the appropriate safeguards in place this sounds laudable but the devil is always in the details of particular concern is her attempt to delay advancement in awarding national bank charters for fintech firms despite the heated rhetoric waters also promised to embrace bipartisanship where possible often this term is merely code for advancing cronyism such as her support for reauthorizing government subsidized national flood insurance and the export import bank however the new chairwoman s remarks also give rise to some optimism that she may embrace commonsense initiatives to enable businesses to raise funds more easily in laying out her agenda waters touted her recent work to enact legislation called the supporting america s innovators act the law previously required venture capital funds to register with the securities and exchange commission once their number of investors exceeded 100 in terms of both time and money these registration costs deterred investments in upstart businesses lifting the threshold to 250 investors is allowing additional capital to flow to entrepreneurs spurring economic growth and expanding investment opportunities waters also mentioned her work on the fix crowdfunding act which potentially could provide some further exemptions from the sec s reporting requirements for companies raising funds we must learn the lessons of history well intentioned government policies can lead to negative economic consequences in this regard the vision expressed by waters to continue many of the policies of the current housing finance system falls short however her demonstrated openness to reforming some investment regulations related to rapid developments in crowdfunding are promising our economic future is directly affected by the capacity of political leaders to pursue pragmatic policies over blind ideology partisan interests or political favoritism

be no more negotiations on the withdrawal agreement and given just 60 days from the march 29 brexit date time is already tight to complete the ratification of the treaty however she also pointed out where we do have margin is on the political declaration but she also emphasized that we need decisions on the uk side on the direction of travel also weyand echoed chief negotiator michel barnier s comments regarding irish backstop she said a time limit on the backstop defeats the purpose of the backstop because it means that once the backstop expires you stand there with no solution for this border ecb draghi euro s international role in foreign reserves and debt market eroding ecb president mario draghi appears in the hearing of the committee on economic and monetary affairs of the european parliament yesterday regarding euro s internal dimension draghi said euro has indeed provided two decades of price stability and thanks to the collective efforts of all european citizens the euro area has emerged from the global financial crisis with 22 consecutive quarters of economic growth the unemployment rate at its lowest level since october 2008 and wages and incomes on the rise but draghi also repeated last week s cautious comments he noted over the past few months incoming information has continued to be weaker than expected on account of softer external demand and some country and sector specific factors the persistence of uncertainties in particular relating to geopolitical factors and the threat of protectionism is weighing on economic sentiment he reiterated that significant monetary policy stimulus remains essential and the governing council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments on euro s external dimension draghi said since the global financial crisis the euro s international role seems to have gradually eroded while its importance as the currency of invoice for international trade transactions has remained broadly stable its role in global foreign reserves and global debt markets has declined and he urged that the international role of the euro is supported by the pursuit of sound economic policies in the euro area and a deeper and more complete emu and this requires further efforts along the path of deeper integration japan cabinet office downgraded exports assessment to weakened recently japan cabinet office left overall economic assessment unchanged and said it s in gradual recovery however export assessment was downgraded from flattened to weakened recently in particular shipments of electronics and semiconductor manufacturing equipment to china have slowed sharply the office noted in the monthly report that we need to keep in mind that there is uncertainty about how trade disputes and china s economic outlook

recovering while capital expenditure was increasing both assessments were unchanged australian nab business conditions largest fall since global financial crisis australia nab business confidence was unchanged at 3 in december however business conditions dropped sharply by 9 pts from 11 to 2 that s the largest monthly fall since the global financial crisis and the deterioration was relatively broad based across states and industries nab also noted that at face value the fall over the past 6 months suggests a significant slowing in the momentum of activity in the business sector especially

threat to the markets and the economy this year kelly said tensions were high after u s officials announced criminal charges against china s telecom giant huawei for violating u s sanctions against

report from the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd traces the process of initial coin offering ico fundraising and the potential risks for offerors and buyers the report highlights many ico benefits including cost savings direct access to investors and the active participation of buyers the identified risks include potential conflicts of interest lack of standardized vetted disclosure and high volatility and counterparty risks the oecd calls for a delicate balance in developing a regulatory scheme that will not deprive the ico mechanism of its speed and cost

as we discussed in this past weekend s missive a wsj article suggesting that the fed would not only stop hiking interest rates but also cease the balance sheet reduction which has been extracting liquidity from the market in mid 2018 the federal reserve was adamant that a strong economy and rising inflationary pressures required tighter monetary conditions at that time they were discussing additional rate hikes and a continued reduction of their 4 trillion balance sheet all it took was a rough december pressure from wall street s member banks and a disgruntled white house to completely flip their thinking this is a change for jerome powell who was believed to be substantially against fed interventions shows his worst fear being realized being held hostage by the markets a look at fed meeting minutes from 2013 was his recognition of that fear i have one final point which is to ask what is the plan if the economy does not cooperate we are at 4 trillion in expectation now that is where the balance sheet stops in expectation now if we have two bad employment reports the markets are going to move that number way out we re headed for 5 trillion as others have mentioned and the idea that president kocherlakota said and governor duke echoed that we re now a captive of the market is somewhat chilling to me this week the fed meets to discuss their next policy moves if the fed announces a reduction elimination of future rate hikes and or a reduction elimination of the balance sheet reduction stocks will likely find a bid at least in the short term longer term the markets are still dealing with an aging economic growth cycle weakening rates of earnings growth and rising political tensions but from a technical basis they are also dealing with a break of long term trend lines and very major sell signals the problem for the fed is that while ceasing rate hikes and balance sheet reductions may be a short term positive monetary policy is already substantially tighter than it was at the lows in other words stopping tightening is not the same as easing back to the future 2015 2016 we have seen a similar period previously during the 2015 2016 correction the fed had just announced its intent to start hiking rates and had stopped reinvesting liquidity into the markets early tightening the market plunged sharply prompting several fed presidents to make announcements reminding markets they still remained extremely accommodative the market rallied back closing in on previous highs it certainly looked as if the bulls had regained control of the market headlines declared the correction was over but it wasn t the retest of lows and setting of new lows happened over the next 60 days with concerns over the impact of the upcoming brexit vote the fed chairman janet yellen coordinated with global central banks to provide liquidity to support global markets in the event of a disorderly break up in november of that same year donald trump was elected to office with promises of deregulation tax cuts and massive infrastructure spending projects which provided an additional boost to equities into the end of the year those promises combined with massive central bank stimulus led to one of the longest bull market runs in history with virtually no volatility so here we are today the trump administration successfully passed tax cut legislation for corporations in december of 2017 subsequently stocks surged at the beginning of 2018 as bottom line earnings were expected to explode however that surge also marked the blow off top of the rally as the administration launched its trade war with china stocks fell in february however the markets were able to regain their footing in april as the first look at earnings post tax cuts had soared then came october the ongoing tariffs on goods being shipped along with a stronger dollar began to weigh on corporate outlooks but it was the fed who was in the process of tightening monetary policy uttered the words that spooked the markets we are still a long way from the neutral rate jerome powell despite evidence of an already slowing economy and the yield curve almost inverted the idea the fed would remain consistent in hiking interest rates and reducing their balance sheet further weighed on investor confidence the fed put was gone market dependent despite commentary from the fed they were only data dependent all it took was a 20 correction from the highs to change their minds but not just the fed s while the wsj is reporting a change in attitude from the fed on the reduction of their balance sheet the white house which has pinned their measurement of success to stock prices took prompt action the secretary of the treasury made announcements assuring the markets of stability and pushing for banks to put liquidity back into the markets the trump administration has repeatedly assured the markets that trade talks are going well and deal is close to being done for now the markets have bought into the rhetoric and have rallied sharply from the lows mr market clearly has control over both fiscal and monetary policy data dependency has been relegated to the dust bin of history so is the bull back or is the market despite all of the support set to retest lows as seen in early 2016 bryce coward cfa recently studied all the previous similar declines we ve cataloged all 20 uninterrupted 15 declines in the post war period and documented what has happened afterward as well as the type of market environment in which those declines have taken place by uninterrupted decline we mean a waterfall decline of at least 15 without an intermediate counter trend rally of at least 5 some bullet points describing the rallies following those declines are below the average counter trend rally following a 15 waterfall decline is 11 9 11 median and it takes place over 21 trading days on average median 11 days the rallies end up retracing 57 of the decline on average median 52 the average of those bear markets have a peak to trough decline of 33 median 29 the duration of those bear markets is 284 trading days on average median 139 days in 16 of 19 instances excluding the decline we just witnessed a recession was associated with the bear markets waterfall declines of at least 15 have only taken place in bear markets 100 of the time the low resulting from the waterfall decline was retested and in 15 of 19 cases a new lower lower was made what do these data say about the current counter trend rally first this rally has already retraced 65 of the waterfall decline greater than average and median and has lasted about three weeks less than average but greater than median this suggests upside from here may be limited in both magnitude and duration furthermore these data strongly suggest the major index will retest the christmas eve low at the very least and most likely will make a new lower low in the weeks and months ahead while we are not forecasting a recession at this time waterfall declines of the magnitude just witnessed tend to take place in recessionary market environments so we need to at least be open to that possibility finally waterfall declines typically take place in bear markets lasting an average of 284 days median 139 days at just 81 days in duration these data suggests we have a bit further to run before we reach the bear market nadir that said there are four instances of waterfall declines taking place in short bear markets so we don t place much weight on this particular piece while the markets could certainly rally in the weeks ahead there are significant challenges coming from both weaker economic growth rising debt levels and slowing earnings growth but most importantly the biggest challenge in the months and years ahead will be the sustainability of the price deviation from long term trends as dana lyons penned last week finally even stock prices themselves can be considered excessive in fact when compared to a regression trend line on the s p composite going back to inception in 1871 the index price reached 122 above its long term trend this past september another way of saying that is that the s p 500 is 122 overbought in other words if stock prices were simply to revert to their long term mean the s p 500 would be down closer to 1300 than recent highs near 2900 there are certainly plenty more examples of excess in the stock market but these few should give you an idea why if we have entered a longer term bear market the oft derided bears may end up getting the last laugh yes this could certainly work out much like 2015 2016 if the fed throws in the towel to appease the markets if they don t there are plenty of indications which suggest a more important mean reversion process has already begun

since the world economy went downhill in 2008 times have been pretty tough greece has been teetering on collapse for a while and plenty of other european countries have been close behind brazil has protests over government corruption while ukraine has all out war but plenty of other much more unusual problems can fall on an entire country 10 norwegian butter crisis the norwegian butter crisis of 2011 was an unfortunate combination of reduced supply and increased demand heavy summer rain was followed by a 20 percent rise in demand in october and 30 percent the following month by mid december with christmas approaching the price of a pack of butter jumped to 300 krone or 50 those who had butter took advantage people began auctioning butter online with a going rate of 100 for 450 grams 1 lb over the border swedish supermarkets saw butter sales jump 2 000 percent nearly all of it going to visiting norwegians a couple swedes were caught trying to smuggle 250 kilograms 550 lb into the country in the aftermath retailers demanded compensation for 7 million in losses 9 toilet paper panics of 1973 in december 1973 johnny carson spooked americans by mentioning an impending shortage of toilet paper gullible consumers rushed to stock up and several stores took advantage by ramping up their prices luckily that crisis was pretty much over the next night when carson went on air to explain the entire thing was a joke yet this wasn t the only toilet paper shortage in 1973 across the pacific japan was getting jittery about the arab israeli war the japanese relied heavily on oil from the middle east and one of their government ministers went on television on october 31 to ask people to use paper sparingly it s the worst thing he could have done a few hundred people queued up outside an osaka supermarket the next day and cleared out all of the toilet paper when that made the news others followed suit another official begged for calm on november 2 saying there was plenty of toilet paper for everyone in the country this just fanned the flames and the entire country began hoarding as much toilet paper as they could by the time the crisis came to an end most people had stocked up on at least a year s worth of the stuff despite that the human memory is so odd that those who remember the time recall it as a period of shortage with barely a roll in sight 8 american meat shortage the american meat shortage of 1910 followed a loss in native animal species combined with a booming human population while a lack of meat in the us is an unusual enough prospect one particular plan to solve the crisis stood out two men had a dream to meet the nation s appetite by creating a hippopotamus farm in louisiana louisiana was facing its own strange problem the japanese water hyacinth brought into the state during a cotton exhibition had gotten out and started clogging up waterways congressman robert broussard caught wind of the hippo idea from explorer frederick burnham who said the hippos would devour the hyacinths quite gladly he passed a bill to acquire 250 000 to make it happen the department of agriculture thought beef was a better solution they increased the land available for raising conventional cattle including many of the swamps that would ve housed the much larger african animals but the idea of eating hippos was still popular in the 1960s when popular science said the particularly delicious and not at all fatty meat could help meet food shortages in north africa 7 myanmar is paranoid about cash myanmar is a country desperate for economic growth it is also a country where almost no one is willing to trust a bank and where even fewer people are willing to trust an atm in fact the first atm in the country didn t arrive until 2013 for a long time international sanctions against myanmar s military dictatorship blocked visa and mastercard from setting up facilities banks were horribly corrupt and people often had to bribe staff to withdraw their own money the result is that less than 10 percent of the population has a bank account people just carry their cash with them but the issue runs deeper people won t accept cash in anything less than pristine condition any crease tear or ink mark and people may refuse to take a note people press their money in books to flatten the bills as the country transitions to democracy it s trying everything it can to get people using the banking system while there are some signs of progress there s a very long way to go 6 hungarian hyperinflation inflation is probably among the most normal of national problems hyperinflation is rarer but still fairly frequent inflation in 1920s germany peaked at 32 400 percent per month yet the hyperinflation that happened in hungary in 1945 and 1946 stands out in sheer scale it was one trillion times greater than weimar germany s inflation the situation began in 1945 but by the inflation s height in 1946 prices were doubling every 15 6 hours in january 1946 the government replaced the pengo with another currency the adopengo worth several trillion times the original pengo stayed in circulation its value still dropping until it was literally impossible to get anything for a 100 million pengo bill the highest denomination bill printed was worth 100 quadrillion pengo loose worthless bills piled up in the streets by the time the problem came to an end every single note in circulation in the entire country combined was worth less than one american cent the hungarian government introduced the forint on august 1 1946 it was worth the equivalent of 400 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 pengo the new currency was backed by gold and foreign money leaving it stable enough to survive until today 5 switzerland s economy is too good since the 2008 financial crisis pretty much every country has had to wrestle with demons in their economy one country that weathered the financial collapse extremely well was switzerland when the eurozone began collapsing around them the swiss economy maintained low debt low unemployment and healthy exports having the most resilient economy on the continent may not sound like a problem yet switzerland is still part of the larger world and the world made the country a victim of its own success currency traders looking for a safe investment shifted to swiss francs increasing the value of the currency by 30 percent compared to the euro an overvalued franc made swiss exports more expensive hurting swiss companies negative inflation has other bad consequences as well such as greatly increasing the real cost of citizens fixed debt the government had to artificially weaken the value of their own currency a situation they would ve avoided had they just managed their affairs as poorly as the rest of europe 4 penis panic koro is a mass delusion in which people believe their genitals are shrinking or have been stolen entirely it has overtaken entire towns and villages in several african countries where whole groups of men claim their penises are shrinking they ll often attach string or metal clamps to their genitals to stretch them safely outside the body until a shaman can be found the thefts are often blamed on sorcerers in 2008 in congo rumors began that people wearing gold rings in communal taxis were performing penis theft spells on their fellow passengers it became the talk of local radio stations yet the penis panic itself wasn t the problem it was the public reaction the congo police were forced to arrest 13 suspected penis sorcerers and 14 alleged victims after the victims attacked the sorcerers as a mob it was likely a sensible precaution an episode in ghana in the 1990s saw 12 penis snatchers beaten to death by crowds in nigeria 12 people were killed in 2001 and five were killed in benin the same year the congo police chief explained his frustration saying when you try to tell the victims that their penises are still there they tell you that it s become tiny or that they ve become impotent to that i tell them how do you know if you haven t gone home and tried it 3 korea s kimchi crisis south korea has no food more important than kimchi the fermented cabbage dish almost has a religious status in the country it s served with every meal restaurants offer it for free like ketchup in the us so it was a big problem when the key ingredient napa cabbage rose in price by nearly 500 percent in the space of a month in 2010 the result was a massive spike in the price of kimchi and with it came a shortage newspapers dubbed it a national tragedy and a once in a century crisis the shortage followed heavy rain on top of a relatively small harvest after a bumper year previously in response people began rustling cabbages in one province a group of men were arrested when they tried to make off with 400 of them koreans began calling the sauce keum chi as keum means gold the government suspended import tariffs on cabbage and radishes in a display of solidarity the president declared he would eat only inferior cabbage the sort from europe and the us meanwhile local governments began offering subsidized cabbage causing people to queue for half an hour to pick up a bag 2 operation pig bristle a housing shortage is a very common national problem the uk has one which doesn t look to be resolved any time soon the same goes for australia which has matched the uk in failing to build enough affordable housing for a few decades yet it s not the first time the aussies have needed new places to hide from the country s various dangers in 1944 the australian government introduced a scheme to build new houses to meet their increasing demand yet they ran into a bizarre problem a couple of years into the project a chronic shortage of paintbrushes worse than that there was a chronic shortage of the pig bristles needed to make more and the only viable source was china at the time china was in the middle of a civil war and getting imports was pretty difficult the royal australian air force received the task of acquiring 20 tons of pig bristles from chongqing the mission was launched in may with the fitting title of operation pig bristle and it took five months to complete the work 1 lab mice shortage on may 10 1989 a fire tore through the jackson laboratory in maine it destroyed mouse production facilities and killed 400 000 laboratory mice among them were unique or unusual strains used for research in several thousand diseases including aids and types of cancer the facility supplied 6 500 research labs across the us and the wider world for research worth 1 billion the fire was deemed a national disaster by officials from the laboratory many experiments already in progress had to be abandoned as changing to a different supplier would skew results the mayo clinic among the institutes affected had to postpone tests on an arthritis drug the impact hit medical researchers across the globe as the laboratory had been selling 40 000 mice every week to 11 200 labs the loss to the jackson laboratory was around 40 million their insurance covered only 15 million in damages despite

amounted to 137 7 million an increase of 5 2 million when compared to net interest income of 132 5 million for the third quarter of 2018 the increase in net interest income was mainly due to a 2 6 million increase in interest income on commercial and construction loans primarily due to the growth in the balance of the performing commercial loan portfolio the upward repricing of variable rate commercial loans and higher income recorded in the fourth quarter on a loan restored to accrual status late in the third quarter the aggregate average balance of commercial and construction loan portfolios increased by 36 2 million net of the effect of reductions in non performing commercial and construction loans which resulted in an increase in interest income of approximately 1 0 million compared with the third quarter of 2018 a 2 5 million increase in interest income on consumer loans primarily due to an increase of 82 0 million in the average balance of this portfolio the aggregate average balance of auto loans and finance leases grew by 69 4 million and the average balance of personal loans increased by 14 6 million a 1 3 million increase in interest income on investment securities primarily due to a 0 8 million decrease in the premium amortization of u s agency mortgage backed securities mbs resulting from lower prepayment rates used to forecast future cash flows and the effect of the gradual reinvestment of proceeds from maturing debt securities into higher yielding securities a 0 2 million decrease in interest expense primarily related to the repayment of maturing brokered cds that resulted in a decrease in interest expense of approximately 0 7 million partially offset by the effect of higher market interest rates in the average cost of retail cds that resulted in an increase in interest expense of approximately 0 4 million compared with the third quarter of 2018 despite the increase in the average cost of retail cds the average cost of total non brokered deposits increased only by 2 basis points to 0 66 compared to 0 64 for the third quarter of 2018 partially offset by a 0 9 million decrease in interest income from interest bearing cash balances primarily due to a decrease of 211 8 million in the average balance of deposits maintained at the federal reserve bank of new york partially offset by the increase in the federal funds target rate a 0 6 million decrease in interest income on residential mortgage loans primarily due to a decrease of 33 5 million in the average balance of this portfolio and to a lesser extent lower collections of interest payments on nonaccrual loans for which interest income is recorded on a cash basis net interest margin was 4 77 up 23 basis points from the third quarter of 2018 primarily reflecting the upward repricing of variable rate commercial loans and the decrease in the amortization expense of u s agency mbs as mentioned above provision for loan and lease losses the provision for loan and lease losses for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 7 6 million compared to 11 5 million for the third quarter of 2018 as mentioned above a loan loss reserve release of approximately 5 7 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018 in connection with revised estimates of the hurricane related qualitative reserves for consumer and commercial and construction loans associated with the effects of hurricanes irma and maria compared to a 2 8 million loan loss reserve release recorded in the third quarter of 2018 approximately 4 2 million of the 5 7 million reserve release recorded in the fourth quarter was attributable to the consideration of updated payment patterns and credit risk analyses applied to consumer borrowers subject to payment deferral programs that expired early in 2018 in addition relationship officers continued to closely monitor the performance of hurricane affected commercial loan customers these revisions resulted in a 1 5 million reserve release associated with the resolution of uncertainties surrounding the repayment prospects of a hurricane affected commercial customer as of december 31 2018 the hurricane related qualitative reserve amounted to 19 2 million during the third quarter of 2018 the corporation transferred to held for sale several non performing commercial and construction loans the aggregate recorded investment in these loans of 29 8 million was written down to 17 3 million which resulted in charge offs of 12 5 million and an incremental loss of 10 1 million reflected in the provision for loan and lease losses for the third quarter of 2018 the 3 9 million decrease in the provision for loan and lease losses as compared to the third quarter provision was driven by the following factors an 8 9 million net loan loss reserve release for commercial and construction loans in the fourth quarter of 2018 including the aforementioned 1 5 million release associated with revised estimates of the hurricane related qualitative reserve for commercial loans compared to a charge of 13 7 million in the third quarter of 2018 net of a 0 6 million release associated with revised estimates of the hurricane related qualitative reserve for commercial loans the positive variance of 22 6 million primarily reflects i a 7 4 million loan loss recovery on a commercial mortgage troubled debt restructured loan paid off during the fourth quarter of 2018 ii reserve releases of approximately 6 3 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 resulting from both the quarterly update of internal credit risk ratings and lower specific reserve requirements for certain impaired loans iii a net decrease of 3 5 million related to developments in problem loans resolution strategies including the aforementioned effect related to loans transferred to held for sale in the third quarter and qualitative adjustments to the general reserve for commercial loans in the fourth quarter and iv the 0 9 million increase in releases associated with revised estimates of the hurricane related qualitative reserve for commercial loans partially offset by a 10 3 million increase in the provision for consumer loans as approximately 10 9 million of the consumer loan charge offs recorded in the third quarter were taken against previously established hurricane related qualitative reserves associated with hurricanes irma and maria these charge offs were directly linked to the performance of consumer borrowers that were subject to payment deferral programs other factors that contributed to the increase in the provision for consumer loans were higher loss rates used to calculate the general reserve for auto and personal loans and the overall increase in the size of the consumer portfolios these variances were partially offset by the aforementioned higher reserve releases associated with the hurricane related qualitative reserves for consumer loans an 8 4 million increase in the provision for residential mortgage loans mainly related to changes in the housing price index considered as part of the determination of the general reserve for residential mortgages see credit quality allowance for loan and lease

be helpful to an investor s understanding of the corporation s results of operations or financial position where non gaap financial measures are used the comparable gaap financial measure as well as the reconciliation of the non gaap financial measure to the comparable gaap financial measure can be found in the text or in the tables in or attached to this earnings release any analysis of these non gaap financial measures should be used only in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share the tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share are non gaap financial measures generally used by the financial community to evaluate capital adequacy tangible common equity is total equity less preferred equity goodwill core deposit intangibles and other intangibles such as the purchased credit card relationship intangible and the insurance customer relationship intangible tangible assets are total assets less goodwill core deposit intangibles and other intangibles such as the purchased credit card relationship intangible and the insurance customer relationship intangible management and many stock analysts use the tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share in conjunction with more traditional bank capital ratios to compare the capital adequacy of banking organizations with significant amounts of goodwill or other intangible assets typically stemming from the use of the purchase method of accounting for mergers and acquisitions accordingly the corporation believes that disclosure of these financial measures may be useful to investors neither tangible common equity nor tangible assets or the related measures should be considered in isolation or as a substitute for stockholders equity total assets or any other measure calculated in accordance with gaap moreover the manner in which the corporation calculates its tangible common equity tangible assets and any other related measures may differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names adjusted pre tax pre provision income adjusted pre tax pre provision income is a non gaap performance metric that management uses and believes that investors may find useful in analyzing underlying performance trends particularly in times of economic stress including as a result of natural catastrophes such as the hurricanes that affected the corporation s service areas in 2017 adjusted pre tax pre provision income as defined by management represents net income excluding income tax expense benefit and the provision for loan and lease losses as well as special items that management believes are not reflective of core operating performance are not expected to reoccur with any regularity or may reoccur at uncertain times and in uncertain amounts net interest income on a tax equivalent basis net interest income interest rate spread and net interest margin are reported on a tax equivalent basis in order to provide to investors additional information about the corporation s net interest income that management uses and believes should facilitate comparability and analysis the tax equivalent adjustment to net interest income recognizes the income tax savings when comparing taxable and tax exempt assets and assumes a marginal income tax rate income from tax exempt earning assets is increased by an amount equivalent to the taxes that would have been paid if this income had been taxable at statutory rates management believes that it is a standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest income interest rate spread and net interest margin on a fully tax equivalent basis this adjustment puts all earning assets most notably tax exempt securities and tax exempt loans on a common basis that facilitates comparison of results to the results of peers financial measures adjusted to exclude the effect of special items that management believes are not reflective of core operating performance are not expected to reoccur with any regularity or may reoccur at uncertain times and in uncertain amounts to supplement the corporation s financial statements presented in accordance with gaap the corporation uses and believes that investors would benefit from disclosure of non gaap financial measures that reflect adjustments to net income to exclude items that management identifies as special items because management believes they are not reflective of core operating performance are not expected to reoccur with any regularity or may reoccur at uncertain times and in uncertain amounts this press release includes the following non gaap financial measures for the fourth and third quarters of 2018 the

venezuelan leader nicolas maduro was sworn in for a second term on jan 10 amid tremendous hyperinflation long lasting political and economic crisis and strict sanctions imposed by its former partner and oil purchaser the united states since maduro first took office in 2013 venezuela has faced several brutal riots including the mother of all marches in 2017 and the caracas helicopter attack in the same year and the current crisis is very likely to be the last for the regime we decided to look into the last six years for venezuela and the fate of the petro a national cryptocurrency that was founded to save the agonizing economy but eventually caused even more resentment the legacy of hugo chavez hugo chavez a seemingly irreplaceable venezuelan leader who was in power since 1999 passed away after a long battle with cancer in march 2013 a committed socialist and revolutionary chavez was held in high esteem and loved by venezuelans for his continuous attempts to eliminate poverty and inequality thousands of citizens attending his funeral in an overcrowded caracas bearing witness to that fact according to the stats unveiled by the guardian between 1999 and 2009 the venezuelan government has managed to reduce unemployment from 14 5 percent to 7 6 percent increase gdp per capita from 4 105 to 10 810 and drop the extreme poverty rate from 23 4 percent to 8 5 percent the indigenous peoples of venezuela who form somewhere around 2 percent of the country s population were among those who benefited most from chavez s presidency while he was in charge venezuela shifted toward protecting their rights and granting them fundamental freedoms nonetheless instead of reforming the venezuelan economy that has always been dependent on oil chavez decided to proclaim an economic war and accused the bourgeoisie owners of local farms supermarkets and mills of concealing food in order to destabilize his government maduro s guerra from socialism to an usurpation of power when maduro entered office in 2013 he inherited one of the most shaky economies in the whole south american region as of data provided by an online stats and market research website statista the average inflation rate in 2012 the year preceding to maduro s presidency was around 21 percent despite the fact that the year was relatively stable for maduro s administration his actions only drove venezuela closer to the brink of the abyss in fact during maduro s first year his government continued chavez s economic war blaming wealthy businessmen of hoarding goods and pushing up prices the policy was supported by venezuelan lawmakers who gave maduro special decree powers in order to enforce price control in november 2013 still by the end of 2013 the average inflation rate had climbed up to 43 5 percent but the real crisis emerged in 2014 when crude oil prices lost almost 40 percent in just six months maduro s government first saw mass protests led by the democratic unity roundtable or mud in spanish the participants of the marches that started february 2014 accused officials of corruption shortages and failure to prevent inflation as the clashes between protesters and the venezuelan army became more and more violent with over 40 people reportedly being killed in just two months maduro s supporters faced accusations of excessive use of force while many demanded the resignation of the president himself by 2015 the average inflation rate got close to 68 5 percent while maduro yet again blamed unscrupulous businesses for shortages and price hikes in addition to that venezuela s gdp that year shrank to 3 9 percent as of data provided by the international monetary fund imf in december 2015 the democratic unity roundtable won the congressional elections and became the largest group in the national assembly venezuela s unicameral parliament the opposition soon focused on holding a referendum that would force maduro to leave his post amid the inflation that has more than doubled in 2015 reaching 111 percent however the supreme court backed maduro cut the assembly s power and the decision on referendum has been stuck in bureaucracy the venezuelan parliament then voted to begin impeachment proceedings against maduro for violating democracy and urged the army to disobey the government in late october 2016 in 2016 maduro s presidency was first labeled as a dictatorship for instance following a new twist in the political crisis forbes posted a story entitled sorry bond lords venezuela is a dictatorship now while the guardian came up with an article called let s call venezuela what it is under maduro a dictatorship later that year also in 2016 a chilling poll conducted by several local universities showed that venezuelans barely consumed the 2 000 recommended daily calories needed and 75 percent of citizens had lost around 19 pounds that year due to the crisis in 2017 the high court finally took all the power from the national assembly practically dissolving the body which was considered a coup by the opposition the decision sparked outrage in all segments of society exhausted by long term shortages hyperinflation and even hunger starting in april numerous marches broke out in venezuela once in a while brutally suppressed by government forces the venezuelan observatory of social conflict calculated that the country saw over 6 000 manifestations from april until late july with more than 160 people killed in clashes in the summer a member of the forensic police oscar perez stole a police helicopter flew it to the center of venezuelan capital dropped grenades on the supreme court and fired several shots at the ministry of the interior perez dubbed a terrorist by maduro managed to flee the city and headed an armed resistance until he was killed during an army raid in january 2018 in july maduro finally created the constituent assembly a body set up to draft and adopt a new constitution in order to provide stability and cease the protests according to the president the measure was heavily criticized both by the european union south american trading body mercosur the organization of american states which includes both the united states and mexico the latter tightened sanctions against maduro who was accused of holding sham elections in the meantime the opposition conducted a long awaited unofficial referendum against maduro with 7 million venezuelans reportedly participating in it according to the calculations 98 percent of voters did not want a new constitution venezuela approached 2018 with growing geopolitical tension the ongoing violation of rights and freedoms along with a mass exodus of venezuelans since 2014 more than 2 million locals left the country the average inflation rate in 2017 surpassed 1 000 percent and the gdp lost 14 percent as per the imf nonetheless maduro appeared to have a trick up his sleeve petro takes the field maduro first mentioned the petro a venezuelan cryptocurrency reportedly backed by oil late in december 2017 the leader claimed that crypto which is not controlled by any government could help venezuela to shore up its struggling economy and to circumvent u s sanctions in january 2018 the petro s rate was tied to one barrel of oil and the issuance of the first 100 million coins was ordered initially the industry treated the measure as a first ever bitcoinization of a sovereign state throughout 2018 the national cryptocurrency set to stop the hyperinflation was actively promoted by the government on an international level maduro asked 10 countries in the bolivarian alliance including cuba to support his initiative later that year he claimed that the petro will be used for international commercial transactions although he avoided mentioning the countries that agreed to accept the oil backed currency in addition to this the oil rich country was reportedly going to present the petro to the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec in 2019 as a unit of account maduro even offered the petro to russia s vladimir putin nonetheless moscow which had always been supportive of venezuela s domestic policies both by diplomacy and investments refused to accept the petro as a unit of account meanwhile within the country the petro was actively used as a tool against poverty social injustice and hyperinflation venezuela launched the creation of the petro funded crypto bank for youth initiatives which claimed to use the petro to fund housing for homeless obliged citizens to pay passport fees in oil backed currency and prior to the official launch of coin s circulation made it a unit of account for salaries goods and services but the experts studying the petro were far from optimistic an alarming reuter s report dubbed in venezuela new cryptocurrency is nowhere to be found was published in late august in it the news agency stated that the petro was not currently traded on any of the major global crypto exchanges moreover the journalists doubted that it was actually backed with venezuelan oil the report claimed that atapirire an area that maduro defined as an actual petroleum center for backing the coin didn t indicate any recent activity there is no sign of that petro here locals told the agency the former oil minister rafael ramirez expressed his opinion writing that the petro only exists in the government s imagination u s tech media outlet wired also spoke to local and south american experts jorge farias the ceo of venezuelan startup cryptobuyer revealed the state owned currency was in fact backed by national oil company pdvsa which had 45 billion in debt and showed no signs of any trading activity roger benites the ceo of lima based crypto exchange bitinka called the petro a smoke curtain to conceal maduro s failure to reanimate the national fiat currency by devaluating it corre innovation s dickie armour shared his stance dubbing the petro a stunt by the time the petro was finally launched in november following a series of delays both venezuelans and experts doubted its real value and overall existence while crypto enthusiasts studied the petro s white paper and came to a conclusion that it blatantly copied some parts of dash s documentation available in the github repository maduro was forced to increase the petro s value from 3 600 to 9 000 bolivars in the midst of ongoing inflation since the pension bonuses were converted into petro the country faced another protest this time led by seniors who did not believe in the oil backed coin i don t want petro i want my cash said one of the protesters despite all the efforts by the end of 2018m the petro was still nowhere to be found the coin was not listed by any of the major exchanges nor was it accepted by any of country s allies venezuela s economy kept drowning as the inflation rate according to the most conservative estimates by imf climbed up to 1 37 million percent by the end of the year the opposition though provided much more gloomy data 1 7 million percent in 2018 which in fact converted venezuela into one of the three countries with the highest inflation rates in history the grand finale maduro vs guaido in may 2018 maduro was re elected for his second six year term during a vote that had shown the lowest turnout equalling 40 percent since venezuela s democracy was restored in 1958 as the two main candidates opposing maduro henri falcon and javier bertucci rejected the results and reported critical irregularities the disgraced national assembly also denied the results calling them an electoral farce the eu pointed out that the election did not comply with the minimum international standards for a credible process and mentioned vote buying and suppression of the opposition the lima group established in 2017 by countries including argentina canada and brazil in order to combat crisis in venezuela also rejected the results of the vote finally the u s called the election an insult to democracy and a fraud foretold on the other hand china cuba iran north korea russia and syria supported maduro and congratulated him on his re election in august 2018 an alleged drone attack reportedly happened in the center of caracas where maduro at that time was addressing the bolivarian national guard the official version states that two drones carrying explosives detonated close to maduro and other officials attending the parade the president himself claimed to survive the assassination attempt conducted by terrorists he promised to punish the people behind the attack and blamed the u s and colombia for helping the terrorists however u s national security adviser john bolton and the colombian government consequently denied any involvement in the incident several arrests were made within a week while the opposition claimed that the accusations as well as the attack itself were planned in advance according to firefighters at the scene questioned by the associated press the incident itself might actually have been a gas tank explosion inside a nearby apartment this january maduro was sworn in for a second term against all odds but this time venezuela does not seem to follow a peaceful scenario as people flooded the streets of caracas the following day juan guaido a 35 year old leader of the opposition presented by the national assembly proclaimed himself the venezuelan president in front of a crowd he was immediately supported by u s president donald trump and his administration while many other countries soon followed his decision as of press time guaido is supported by canada the vast majority of latin american countries and the united kingdom while the eu and mexico have called for dialogue and china and russia accuse him of an attempted coup maduro has recently broke diplomatic ties with the u s giving the embassy staff 72 hours to leave the country however guaido insists that venezuela will continue to re establish constitutional order along with maintaining dialogue with other countries the future of venezuela might be in the army s hands now the country s defence minister vladimir padrino lopez is now supporting maduro as the legitimate president and russia urges the u s not to intervene in the conflict however things may change at any time throughout a year of continuous protests and growing tension neither venezuela nor maduro seem to pull anything good out of the whole petro project even guaido who is quite optimistic about cryptocurrencies believes that the petro is nothing but a scam and while maduro s country is on fire the president himself has completely given up on his oil backed coin what he desperately needs now is the most traditional asset in the world gold however the golden bars worth around 1 7 billion are stuck in the bank of england which does not support the current regime a similar fate awaits an additional 6 3 billion in foreign reserves held by the venezuelan central bank and there is no blockchain in the world that could help maduro get that back

this would be especially problematic given that global trade is already on shaky ground following a crisis induced plunge of 12 2 per cent in the volume of global trade in 2009 a modern day record recovery has been muted after a brief two year rebound in 2010 2011 world trade growth averaged just 3 6 per cent from 2012 to 2018 about half the 7 1 per cent average annual pace in the 20 years before the crisis early hints of just such an outcome are evident in the january update of the international monetary fund s world economic outlook while the imf has revised its world economic growth forecast for 2019 from 3 7 per cent to 3 5 per cent its projection of global trade growth has barely budged from 4 per cent this is certainly puzzling in a climate of increased tariffs between the united states and china with threats of more to come and of brexit related risks to euro zone trade there is good reason to expect more significant downward revisions to the global trade outlook as the trade cycle turns so goes the global economy but there is a new twist with growth in global trade sharply diminished since the 2008 2009 global financial crisis an upsurge of protectionism disrupting global supply chains is all the more problematic there is a distinct possibility a turn in an already weakened trade cycle could spark a surprisingly swift deterioration in the global economy to be sure the slowdown in world trade may be traceable to the global economy s relatively weak post crisis recovery but the ratio of growth in global trade to growth in world output an indicator that normalises different recovery trajectories says otherwise in the two prior expansions 1985 1990 and 2002 2007 this ratio averaged 1 6 in other words once the cyclical noise of post recession rebounds subsided global trade grew about 60 per cent faster than world gross domestic product by contrast in the current expansion the ratio has averaged just 1 0 over the comparable 2012 2018 period with global trade growth having slowed to a pace only equal to world output growth debate rages about why growth in global trade has slowed so sharply in recent years extensive research published by the imf in late 2016 attributed the slowdown largely to subdued business capital spending finding only small effects from protectionism yet the world has changed a lot in the subsequent two years while the spending shortfall persists despite a temporary increase from large corporate tax cuts in countries like the us there has been a marked increase in protectionism with attendant pressures on global supply chains as a result a rethinking of the imf findings is in order us president donald trump s administration has obviously taken the lead in moving from trade liberalisation and globalisation to protectionism and fragmentation one line in trump s inaugural address said it all protection will lead to great prosperity and strength rhetoric quickly gave way to action the us disengaged from the trans pacific partnership replaced nafta the north american free trade agreement with a higher cost usmca united states mexico canada agreement and of course imposed a succession of tariff hikes on chinese goods withdrawal from the paris climate agreement threats to pull out of the world trade organisation and complaints about nato participation round out us disengagement from multilateralism and the global trading system it has long supported against this backdrop a rapidly unfolding china slowdown is all the more problematic while recent gdp data points to only a slight deceleration in late 2018 6 4 per cent annual growth in the fourth quarter versus 6 5 per cent in the third quarter monthly data reveals sharp declines in retail sales of key discretionary consumption items such as automobiles and mobile phones reflecting this deterioration in domestic demand chinese imports plunged by 7 6 per cent in the 12 months ending in december a worrisome reversal after a 16 1 per cent gain in 2017 at the same time china s exports fell 4 4 per cent in december as tariff related weakness in us markets finally appears to be taking a meaningful toll needless to say depending on the outcome of us china trade negotiations there could well be more bad news for chinese exports to the us moreover while china is moving aggressively to counter the cyclical shortfall in domestic activity it could be several months before its policy moves start to take hold in the meantime risks remain very much on the downside for chinese import demand that underscores a key risk to the imf s latest forecast china is the world s largest exporter and third largest importer its negative impact on an already weakened global trade cycle is only just starting to become apparent the disruptive effects of brexit can only exacerbate this problem the euro zone as a whole ranks right behind china among global exporters and slightly above china as the world s second largest importer with exports to britain accounting for about 3 per cent of the european union s gdp considerably higher for ireland and the netherlands brexit induced frictions to global trade can hardly be taken lightly all in all the global trade cycle is facing major stress in 2019 and markdowns have only just begun this underscores the risks of a major shortfall in world gdp growth in a still tightly connected world no major economy will be an oasis that includes the us whose 45th president continues to insist that it s easy to win a trade war maybe not stephen s roach a faculty member at yale university and former

from the previous quarter compared to a 25 basis point increase in the federal funds target rate in the quarter this equates to an effective deposit beta of 20 which is unchanged from the previous quarter the increased cost of interest bearing deposits was partially offset by 9 0 million of growth in average noninterest bearing deposits loan yields increased 15 basis points from the previous quarter due to the repricing of variable and adjustable rate loans and higher replacement yields on new loans for the quarter ended december 31 2018 total average earning assets grew 74 million and 367 million respectively from the prior quarter and prior year period the increase in the net interest margin from the prior year quarter was primarily due to a 44 basis point increase in the yield on

31 2018 was 3 71 an increase of 14 basis points from the previous year the increase from the prior year was due primarily to a 40 basis point increase in the yield on interest earning assets partially

quarter of 2018 the provision for credit losses totaled 12 5 million for the year ended december 31 2018 an increase of 7 4 million as compared to the prior year the increase from the prior year is primarily the result of one commercial real estate relationship which was resolved during the year and the recognition of 3 1 million of recoveries on two commercial relationships during the prior year for the year ended december 31 2018 net charge offs were 13 1 million or 0 23 of average loans compared to 7 0 million in the prior year period an increase of 6 1 million the increase from the

nonperforming loan and a 0 4 million insurance recovery during the fourth quarter of 2018 as well as the company s recent emphasis on small business administration sba qualified lending this was partially offset by a decrease of 0 4 million and 0 5 million from the prior quarter and year ago quarter respectively in gain on sale of mortgage loans trust fee income decreased 0 3 million from the prior quarter due to seasonally higher tax advisory services in the third quarter there were no security gains during the fourth and third quarters of 2018 however the company recognized a 4 3 million

a 0 4 million decrease in advertising and promotion a 0 3 million decrease in appraisal fees and a 0 3 million decrease in unfunded commitment reserves on construction loans the 2 1 million decrease

29 01 2019 listen kwame nkrumah once said africa must unite or perish without genuine african unity our continent will remain at the mercy of imperialist domination and exploitation below are 10 simple yet profound reasons why africa must unite under a socialist economic system 1 africa s wealth africa is extremely wealthy in fact it is the wealthiest land mass on the face of the earth this wealth can be found in its abundant mineral resources and in its huge agricultural potential africa s mineral wealth includes a wide variety and huge volume of resources that are critical to the technical and industrial development of humanity e g gold platinum diamonds manganese colbalt cromite coltan coal radium iron ores chromium copper lead zinc tin titanium antiomony tantalum germanium lithium phosphates bauxite uranium petroleum and natural gas similar figures could be provided regarding africa s agricultural potential which remains largely untapped although there are an estimated 632 million hectares of arable land in africa only 179 million hectares are actually cultivated i e less than 30 of its arable land as with africa s mineral resources this arable land is unevenly distributed in fact in just four countries the democratic republic of the congo nigeria and the two sudans where nearly 40 of this uncultivated land is located there is enough agriculturally rich land to feed africa s 1 billion population several times over however because this wealth is unevenly distributed showing no relationship to the artificial imperialist imposed division of the continent this wealth can only benefit the masses of african people when it is shared on a continent wide basis 2 pooling investment resources to invest in large scale production in both industry and agriculture a large amount of investment resources is needed when africa unites it will be able to pool its investment resources to ensure that it will have enough money to invest in the large scale production of industrial and agricultural goods and services once africa unites it will no longer have to go begging the world bank imf and various donor nations of the world for loans that are tied to very high interest rates and exploitative conditions designed to keep africa impoverished and dependent africa s total foreign reserves held by african central banks is ½ trillion dollars 510 billion separately the various individual states in africa will never be able to raise the funds required to invest heavily in any aspect of production especially in the production of heavy equipment designed to build cars trucks tractors roads bridges trains ships airplanes and other basic items required of the 21st century let each african country invest 5 of its foreign reserves into a giant african infrastructure bond in short genuine african unity where the wealth and resources of this great continent are amassed in the great bank of africa and shared amongst its people is the only alternative for africa to avoid begging for loans that are designed to keep africa poor and in perpetual debt 3 optimal market size only a united africa with its more than one billion people can provide the requisite market size to stimulate large scale production in fact according to african union figures the actual purchasing power of the continent of africa is 1 515 trillion which would place it if it were one nation as the 11th highest purchasing power country in the world however as it stands a weak and divided africa has been forced to turn its purchasing power i e its various balkanized markets over to the united states and various other industrialized nations of the world these nations in turn use this so called free market opportunity to flood africa s markets with goods many of which are of very dubious quality produced by their large scale factories plants and farms these factories plants and farms because of the huge size of their markets benefit from what economists call economies of scale and are therefore able to produce their goods at a cheaper cost per unit additionally these same companies often benefit from their governments effort to protect them from international competition in the form of government subsidies as it stands the producers and potential producers of africa have little or no incentive to expand production when faced with the tiny markets of their individual so called nation states as a result workers in other lands are producing everything from underwear to cellular telephones from handkerchiefs to refrigerators from matches to motorcycles from rice to computers from chicken to automobiles and exporting them all to africa 4 protectionism only a united africa will be able to protect its market china protects its industries by keeping its currency the rinminbi relatively low thus ensuring its exports will remain attractive on the global market the united states provides millions of dollars of subsidies for its farmers especially its rice cotton and maize growers in order to protect their goods against local competition in countries around the world the european union does much the same with european poultry farmers being one of their largest beneficiaries and with the declining african poultry farmers being the hardest hit once united however africa will have the power to use tariffs duties quotas salary increments propaganda and subsidies 5 bargaining power the balkanized states of africa are always at a disadvantage when separately bargaining with the stronger industrial nations of europe asia and north america this is especially the case when trying to court foreign direct investment fdi for while there will always be occasions when africa could benefit from fdi the terms of agreement will never be in our favor if we try to bargain with the stronger industrialized nations under our current balkanized status we will always lose however once africa is united it will be in the best position to set the terms of agreement between it and any potential foreign investor 6 common currency one of the best ways to integrate africa s economy enhance inter african trade and gain control in setting the prices of african exports is through the use of a common currency a common african currency will eliminate the transaction costs customers pay when buying a different currency other than their own especially for those involved in inter african trade secondly the prices of goods and services will be more transparent and thus more comparable when there is a common unit of account thirdly the african common currency will become an international currency of higher value that billions of people inside and outside of africa will have to acquire in order to purchase anything made and sold anywhere in africa 7 continental planning only a united africa can plan continentally indeed the major problems facing africa do not affect the various states separately nor can they be solved separately for example global warming is having a devastating impact on our major river basins in africa including the nile congo zambezi niger and orange river basins they are slowly and in some cases swiftly drying up but how do we solve this problem when each of these major river basins interacts with several african micro states in all of the five regions of africa can or should any one african country solve this problem when ultimately the entire continent is being affected in fact all of the major challenges facing africa require continent wide solutions based on continent wide scientific planning for instance there is absolutely no reason for the people of africa to be going hungry anywhere on the continent due to drought with these huge water bodies located throughout the continent however with less than 5 of african land being irrigated is there any wonder that our rain dependent agriculture systems throughout the continent are unable to feed all of its people independent of the critical need to irrigate the continent which perforce is a continent wide task both financially and planning wise the agricultural potential of our great continent can only be realized when we plan continentally to make this happen after all just one country the democratic republic of the congo has the agricultural potential to feed the whole of africa how then are our people starving when just one of africa s 54 micro states is capable of feeding the entire continent 8 providing land locked countries access to the sea a united africa will allow nearly 20 african countries to acquire the benefits of having immediate access to the sea with slightly more than 70 of the earth s surface covered by the ocean the benefits of having immediate access to marine life are tremendous they include minimally food medicine raw materials mineral resources tourism and the protection of geopolitical strategic interests 9 resolving internal conflicts and disputes military defense the balkanization of africa at the infamous berlin conference of 1884 1885 not only created small economically nonviable dependencies it also engendered and or exacerbated ethnic and religious hostilities throughout the continent this longstanding strategy of divide and rule was used to perfection throughout africa which now has more borders than any other continent on earth 166 the recipe was simple fossilize africa s various ethnic groups many of whom were historical rivals then force them under the same national roof independence then would be fraught with so many ethnic hostilities that achieving national integration political stability and economic development would be practically impossible as a result we have an entire continent replete with intrastate and interstate conflicts many of which over the years have blossomed into full scale civil wars however only a unified african government buttressed with the full scale might of an all african military high command will be able to resolve these conflicts and end these wars the un nato eu usa or any other entity outside of africa can never and will never solve our problems none of them have the interest will means or mandate to do so instead if left in their hands they will only make matters worst in order to make africa more malleable for continued imperialist domination 10 asserting the african personality despite the cultural diversity that exists among the african people there is a far greater degree of cultural unity that exists wherever you find africans in the world this is especially obvious in the common african ethos that binds us together as one our core values of humanism collectivism and egalitarianism for example are demonstrated amongst the masses everywhere even our sense of being space and time are fundamentally different from other peoples in the world however because of our status as a dominated people without power to determine our destiny we are rarely able to have our view of the world expressed regarded or respected in any meaningful way by the rest of the world and especially in any of the various corridors of power once africa unites however the rest of the world will have to sit up and take notice we will take our seat on the security council of the united nations and be free to express to the fullest the most salient characteristics of what osagyefo dr kwame nkrumah termed the african personality

aud the australian dollar offered little to excite traders on tuesday maintaining short term ranges ahead of critical data sets and the fed s policy announcement despite a sustained uptick in iron ore prices the aud failed to break outside of the mid 0 71 s and bounced between intraday lows at 0 7140 and session highs at 0 7175 investors appeared content to sit on the sidelines skeptical the iron ore rally will run through the chinese new year break and reluctant to extend or sell down holdings ahead of today s q4 cpi print and tonight s fomc rate announcement after a largely quiet start to the week today s docket could prove the catalyst that awakens the aud and forces a move outside recent ranges should q4 cpi print below consensus forecasts at 0 3 0 4 and 1 5 1 6 year on year the pressure will mount on the rba to shift away from the current neutral policy setting and entertain an easing bias in a bid to kick start the economy price pressures remain well outside the boards 2 3 target band and persistent softness coupled with the banks hiking rates outside the policy cycle may force the rba s hand and prompt a rate cut in a bid to ease the burden on household debt following the domestic data dump attentions will turn to the fed policy announcement and brief rate statement there is no expectations the fomc will raise rates outside the 2 25 2 5 setting and we expect the

can be attributed to the positive trade balance data released by the statistic new zealand yesterday morning showing the difference in value between imported and exported goods it came back higher than it s forecast of 225m at 264m this was a positive for the currency as export demand and currency demand are directly linked and foreigners must buy the domestic currency to pay for the nations

new york march 11 markets are amoral prices aren t right or wrong but for your position and your profits the mix of church and state has been the battle for centuries across all parts of the world governments can t legislate morality either the blasting of the u s indictment of chinese telecomm leader huawei and the extradition of its cfo led to a chinese official to call the u s actions unfair and immoral the cfo s lawyer characterizes her as a hostage this is an interesting clash to watch as it sets the tone for u s china trade talks this week with the march 1 deadline looming and with the focus on china growth not going away asia shares slipped while eu has bounced the yellow vests in france suffered an electoral set back as their campaign director quit due to internal squabbling with 10 candidates pushing for seats in the upcoming may eu elections the french consumer confidence was also better today suggesting the movement s effect on the broader economy maybe petering out overall the worries about asia still dominate the picture into u s earnings the fomc decision and ongoing u s political storms the risk mood is up in europe and down in asia leaving the united states stuck waiting for apple earnings the uk brexit vote and more from trump it s the nature of markets to price risks to reflect the worst possible outcome for the largest positions and that makes the british

powell should pull up on the stick and put rate hikes on hold through the summer the fed faces the tough challenge of engineering a soft landing for the economy the recent strong jobs report notwithstanding manufacturing activity and bank business lending are slowing managing the situation is made terribly more difficult by the secular decline of europe and china s recent woes slowing economic activity abroad the government shutdown and trade war with china and structural changes that alter historical relationships between monetary policy and interest rates and employment and inflation the nearly 3 growth accomplished in 2018 was no accident of nature the 2018 tax cuts and february 2018 budget deal that lifted federal appropriations caps through the current fiscal year boosted consumer and government spending lower corporate taxes permitted businesses to invest in labor saving robots artificial intelligence and workforce training and deregulation slashed private sector compliance costs all boosted labor productivity growth more demand more supply and the economy zoomed ahead in 2019 consumers are getting an additional lift from lower gas prices but the boost from personal tax cuts and higher government spending have largely run their course and the slowdown in business bank borrowing likely indicates investments in machines software and skills are slowing too brexit and angela merkel s imminent departure the yellow vest riots in france and a populist government in italy were nominally instigated by unchecked immigration higher taxes on gasoline and a left right coalition agreement to spend more than the european union s national debt limits permit in reality the onerous regulations imposed by the eu bureaucracy and mercantilist policies in germany that impose perennial trade deficits and austerity elsewhere are pulling the eu apart the bottom line is europe can t grow and it s america s most important export market china has run the string on credit driven growth and republicans and democrats alike are tired of beijing s protectionism imposing a whopping 365 billion trade imbalance and exporting unemployment and social problems here the economy should recoup the lost spending by federal employees now that the shutdown is over but the trade talks with china may accomplish only a temporary reprieve on the trade deficit past experience indicates trade deals with china do not result in lasting behavioral changes and renewed tensions lie ahead a decade of low interest rates boosted real estate and stock values in the united states and permitted struggling corporations and foreign governments to avoid reforms that would make them competitive and less corrupt now just about anything the fed does has feedback effects on asset prices corporate and foreign government finances and ultimately u s exports and growth finally tools the fed uses to navigate are broken the phillips curve which charts the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment is flashing red but the hard economic data say otherwise even with unemployment at 3 9 wage increases of 3 2 pose few inflationary pressures with stronger productivity growth to pay for those the yield curve the difference between the short and long term interest rates on treasuries has been flattening historically that has proven a pretty good indicator of a recession in the next year or so theoretically it is supposed to indicate businesses that buy equipment and hire don t believe that prospective sales growth justifies borrowing long term to finance expansion the problem is that since the 2000s u s long rates have been suppressed by foreign investors europeans stuck in a lethargic economy and latin americans and asians fearful that their corrupt governments will ignite inflation to solve their debt problems have been buying up u s real estate and long bonds similarly the dollar has increasingly become the preferred currency for all global trade further increasing the demand for u s bonds those unhinge the relationships between business expectations and interest rates for example the yield curve has been sending warning signals since late 2017 but the economy sped up last year instead of slowing lacking the phillips curve and yield curve as tools fed chairman jerome powell is flying without an altimeter and air speed indicator not being an economist he hasn t been to pilot school either the best thing powell can do for now is pull back on the stick and announce he is not planning any more interest rate increases until at least this summer
at its first monetary policy committee mpc meeting for the year the central bank of nigeria cbn last week retained its monetary policy rate mpr at 14 per cent for the 15th time since july 2016 the mpc which is the highest decision making organ of the cbn also kept all key parameters at their current levels with asymmetric corridor around the mpr at 2 percent 5 per cent cash reserve requirement crr at 22 5 per cent and liquidity ratio at 30 per cent none of the eleven members of mpc present at the meeting dissented the apex bank explained that it retained the mpr primarily to check inflation maintain the stability of the naira amid global and domestic risks which could lead to our currency depreciation the governor of the cbn godwin emefiele stressed that the mpc felt that any downward review of lending rate would result in loss of the gains so far achieved emefiele also argued that reviewing the existing mpr downward would worsen the position of the non performing loans npls of the banks the committee found that tightening the lending rate will dampen investment and hamper improvement in output growth although the cbn have explained why it retained the mpr we are not persuaded enough that the decision is favourable to economic growth the exchange rate has not achieved the expected stability in recent times despite huge injection of the dollar into the foreign exchange fx market we are also mindful of the bleak economic outlook for 2019 because of global and domestic risks the volatility in the international oil market the trade war between the usa and its major trading partners and the uncertainty ahead of the 2019 elections all the same the refusal of the cbn to reverse course on mpr may stifle economic growth and hamper entrepreneurs and other businesses access to loans at affordable rate at present banks charge between 25 and 30 per cent interest on loans only a few business owners can borrow at this rate and make profit what this means is that the cost of borrowing will remain at the current levels and the slow growth of the economy will continue according to the national bureau of statistics nbs nigeria s inflation rate which has been in double digits for three years rose to a 7 month high of 11 41 percent in december from 11 28 per cent in november 2018 therefore in order to address the ensuing risks and tame inflation and the weak exchange rate the cbn will continue to use the sales of government securities to influence interest rates and yields while we agree with the decision of the mpc that the federal government should be mindful of the implications of the nation s increasing debt as it could be approaching the pre 2005 paris club exit level the cbn should watch the downside negative implications of high interest rate and the cost of borrowing we believe that retaining the mpr at 14 per cent will undo efforts to reduce the rising unemployment in the country it will also not help plans to reinvigorate the real sector and diversify the economy for the economy to meet the projected 2 per cent growth there should be access to credit for productive purposes the current lending rate of 14 per cent is a disincentive to borrowers like many stakeholders we believe that cbn should review downward the lending rate in the interest of the economy and borrowers nigeria s lending rate is perhaps one of the highest in the world at its last mpc meeting of 2015 the cbn announced that it had come to the end of its monetary tightening since then it had retained the mpr at 14 per cent we maintain that without reducing the interest rate access to borrowing may be jeopardised now that emphasis is on exports and diversification of non oil sector of the economy holding the mpr at the current level may not bring about the anticipated economic recovery moreover the high interest rate may lead to capital flight and closure of more businesses that are already at the receiving end of government s flip flop policies above all reducing the lending rate will be more beneficial to the economy

comparing the same three month period ended december 31 2018 and 2017 net interest income slightly decreased 37 thousand which was primarily due to the increased yield paid on deposits and overnight borrowings for the twelve month period ended december 31 2018 net interest income was 41 0 million an increase of 1 9 million or 4 8 over the same period in 2017 which was primarily due to a higher

2018 and 2017 was 1 44 and 1 00 respectively the bank did not record a provision for credit losses this quarter and recorded 665 thousand for the twelve months ended december 31 2018 compared to 2 9

loans was 1 10 at december 31 2018 compared to 1 20 at december 31 2017 and 1 15 at september 30 2018 which reflects management s assessment of the credit quality in the loan portfolio total non interest income for the fourth quarter of 2018 decreased 199 thousand to 601 thousand when compared to the same period in 2017 this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in income from loan fees and service charges primarily due to a lower level of fees generated on loans earned between the two periods the decrease in non interest income from the previous quarter was 47 thousand primarily due to loan fees collected and other miscellaneous income partially offset by an increase in service charges collected and income from bank owned life insurance for the twelve month period ended december

total non interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2018 increased 825 thousand or 15 0 when compared to the same period in 2017 this increase was primarily due increases in salaries and employee benefits professional services fdic deposit insurance and advertising expenses when comparing december 31 2018 to the prior linked quarter non interest expense decreased 337 thousand or 5 1 primarily due to a one time charge the bank recorded against an oreo property partially offset by an increase in salaries and benefits and professional fees expenses for the twelve month period ended december 31 2018 non operating expense was 25 3 million compared to 23 3 million for the same period in 2017 the increase was attributed to an increase of salaries and benefits expense and a one time charge

of 801 thousand resulting in an effective tax rate of 17 5 compared to 830 thousand resulting in an effective tax rate of 18 3 for the three month period ended september 30 2018 and compared to 1 0 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 37 6 for the three month period ended december 31 2017 the current effective tax rate for the reporting periods of 2018 were reduced in part as a result

after december s rate hike the federal reserve indicated it would slow the pace of interest rate rises in 2019 while financial markets are not pricing in a single hike we still think the strong jobs market and rising core inflation pressures will generate two moves later this year acknowledging the risks financial markets had a torrid time of things in the final quarter of 2018 the s p500 dropped 20 and the us 10 year yield plunged 70 basis points as financial markets priced out the chances of interest rate rises in 2019 in response to intensifying trade protectionism and fears of a broader global slowdown despite hiking the fed funds target rate by another 25 basis points at the december fomc meeting the federal reserve did acknowledge market concerns they were clearly wary of the feedback from collapsing market confidence stating they will continue to monitor global economic and financial developments and assess their implications for the economic outlook they also changed their language so that only some further increases in the policy rate will be needed this year a more cautious outlook having signalled in september that three 25bp rate hikes was the most likely scenario for 2019 five fomc members lowered their projection at the december meeting so the median forecast dropped to two 25bp moves the fed continued to expect one further rate rise in 2020 but lowered the long term projection for the fed funds rate to a median of 2 8 from 3 this seemed sensible to us given the us undoubtedly faces more economic headwinds this year the lagged effects of higher interest rates the strong dollar the fading support from 2018 s fiscal stimulus and trade tensions at a time of weakening global activity all suggest that the us economy will experience slower growth in 2019 federal reserve fomc members interest rate hike expectations shutdown woes since that december meeting a number of federal reserve officials have indicated a desire to wait and see rather than continue with the one hike per quarter seen over the past 18 months the disruption from the partial government shutdown has only increased the prospect of a longer pause this week s meeting is certainly not going to see any action the economic pain for the 800 000 government workers not receiving pay cheques is obvious but there have been broader problems too government contractors not being paid either travel visas business permits and federal loans not being approved while the queues at airport security lines were evident for all to see all these things acted as a brake on activity with numerous government departments closed there has also been a much more limited flow of economic data statisticians have not been at work to collect the data so january s economic reports will likely be viewed with scepticism too as such the federal reserve does not have as much information as it would like when making policy decisions but it isn t all bad now that the government has been re opened initially until 15 february to allow negotiations to approve the appropriations bill tied to the border security wall with mexico things are returning to normal with affected workers receiving their back pay the backlog of work will eventually clear and there should be a bounceback in activity indeed the underlying us domestic story looks very good right now a view somewhat supported by a partial rebound in equities the jobs market is red hot with all labour market indicators showing real strength the narrative of a tight jobs market with businesses struggling to fill vacancies resulting in broad based pay increases is pretty clear the federal reserve s beige book talked of pay rises right across the country across industries and across all pay grades with this friday s jobs report set to confirm this picture so households have job security and cash in their pockets doubly helped by the plunge in gasoline prices which should keep consumer spending robust there have also been some encouraging signals on us china trade talks which continue this week china appears to be willing to buy more american products which will lower the bi lateral deficit although from the us perspective there needs to be more movement on intellectual property and technology transfer if an agreement can be reached this will remove a significant amount of uncertainty and provide a major boost to the global economic outlook us labour market indicators showing multi decade strength markets too cautious financial markets remain fairly pessimistic with fed funds futures contracts pricing in no moves this year we agree that the economy will slow in 2019 but still forecast gdp growth of 2 3 moreover given shrinking economic spare capacity and rising wages we think core inflation pressures will be on the up justifying further interest rate hikes most likely in 2q and 3q19 other options we have to acknowledge the federal reserve does have other tools that it could use fed governor lael brainard has suggested that raising countercyclical buffers is one way that could be used to tighten monetary conditions whilst also shoring up financial risks however this seems to have little broad support at this time alternatively if there are fears that the yield curve will soon invert a widely perceived recession indicator the fed could accelerate sales of its longer dated treasury holdings an inverted yield curve is painful for the banking system since banks have long dated assets and short term liabilities and this environment would deter lending making a downturn more likely selling longer dated treasuries would re steepen the curve thereby putting up borrowing costs but taking some of the pressure off the financial system read the

by andrew moran what s old is new again like those teenagers who comb through their grandparents treasure trove of motown vinyl records and declare themselves to be aficionados of the genre after listening to it s the same old song just once so too are young leftists embracing modern monetary theory or mmt and as in that four tops greatest hit mmt is the same old song but with a different meaning what is mmt the axis of economic progressive leftism rep alexandria ocasio cortez d ny paul krugman and stephanie kelton is promoting ambitious big government pet projects from the green new deal to medicare for all despite initial applause upon hearing the word free there is some consternation among the electorate when it is revealed that these proposals would require direct aggressive theft from their pockets keynesian disciples have devised another method of thievery to mask their iniquitous intentions money printing but with a catch now this isn t a new concept the printing press has been a permanent fixture inside the eccles building for decades to fuel bubbles and drive the boom bust cycle it was the primary instrument for the federal reserve following the great recession creating trillions in new dollars out of thin air to artificially suppress interest rates and spur investment the difference with mmt is that instead of newly produced money injected into credit markets it will be sent directly to the treasury considering how politicians channel the santa claus spirit for 12 months of the year this is a dangerous development because the government would have immediate access to fresh cash that would be wasted on welfare warfare and everything in between according to these snake oil salesmen if the government issues its own currency then it no longer needs to worry about fiscal prudence as if it does now it is democratic and republican politicians controlling how many dollars are traveling through the economy not the federal open market committee fomc kelton an economic advisor to the 2016 senator bernie sanders i vt presidential campaign said in an interview with marketplace that officials no longer need to lose sleep at night over balancing the budget if you control your own currency and you have bills that are coming due it means you can always afford to pay the bills on time you can never go broke you can never be forced into bankruptcy you re nothing like a household in other words perpetual prosperity if capitol hill installs its own printing press perhaps this is what rep ocasio cortez meant when she told jorge ramos before the midterm election you just pay for it what can go wrong john maynard keynes famously said when defending expansionary monetary policy in the long run we are all dead this is mmt in a nutshell today thanks to the flick of a switch the public gets to imbibe the champagne flowing from the heavens without having to pay for it everyone is entitled to something for nothing because policymakers have deemed it so tomorrow when the bills come home whether it s inflation or excessive taxation it will not matter because we will have perished unlike the fed s accommodative and unconventional monetary tools a decade ago mmt will not lead to an instantaneous economic boom because it will be in the hands of politicians instead of easy money on wall street to purchase stocks cheap cash will flood main street to waste on infrastructure spending and government guaranteed jobs like every other type of tax yes inflation is a tax mmt will misallocate resources from productive assets and enhance the population s time preferences cut saving reduce capital accumulation and boost consumption society would initially deem mmt a success because if its objectives are genuine then everyone will have a job with a steady paycheck however the unintended consequences are declining living standards a shrinking private sector and inevitable tax hikes in an attempt to stop the inflationary bleeding this will not work because washington will continue to issue money to run annual deficits and spend more ostensibly krugman s proclamation of deficits don t matter is the motto in the world of mmt this will only increase the national debt exacerbate the trillions in unfunded liabilities and expenditures problem and diminish the greenback s already dissipating influence more central planning young democrats are gradually coming to sympathize with mmt but they only perceive it from the perspective of holding power what would happen if republicans garner the keys to this state run printing press in the future it s akin to the argument made against enhancing executive power democrats may have endorsed it under former president barack obama but they may now have buyer s remorse under president donald trump ditto for the gop mmt is nothing new it s just another big government prescription from statists who believe you can manipulate economies and control the people through central planning in the name of justice equality and prosperity conservatives and libertarians often joke that the left thinks the white house and congress have some magical money tree to eternally cover the cost of their something for nothing schemes well this quip is becoming a reality because the anointed took the sarcasm seriously the next time a democrat wants to spend 40 trillion on a progressive cause du jour they don t need to beg a fed chairman they ll just head down to the dungeons of capitol hill insert a dollar amount and witness the ink apply to green paper checkmate fiscal conservatives this

per share compared to net income of 21 4 million or 0 16 per share for the quarter ended september 30 2018 the increase in net income was due primarily to an increase in net interest income which was mainly a result of a full quarter impact of the acquisition of capital city bancshares inc ccb which was completed on august 31 2018 net interest income increased 2 2 million or 4 4 from the prior quarter to 52 3 million for the current quarter the net interest margin increased three basis points from 2 24 for the prior quarter to 2 27 for the current quarter excluding the effects of the leverage strategy the net interest margin would have increased six basis points from 2 26 for the prior quarter to 2 32 for the current quarter the increase in net interest margin excluding the effects of the leverage strategy was due mainly to the addition of higher yielding commercial loans from the ccb acquisition interest and dividend income the weighted average yield on total interest

to a 195 4 million increase in the average balance of the portfolio as well as a 10 basis point increase in the weighted average yield on the portfolio to 3 75 for the current quarter the increases in average balance and weighted average yield were due primarily to loans added in the ccb acquisition the increase in interest income on the mbs portfolio was due to a 14 basis point increase in the weighted average yield on the portfolio to 2 59 for the current quarter as well as a 19 7 million increase in the average balance of the portfolio the increase in the weighted average yield was due primarily to a decrease in net premium amortization in the current quarter due largely to the accretion of discounts on mbs added in the ccb acquisition net premium amortization of 349 thousand during the current quarter decreased the weighted average yield on the portfolio by 14 basis points during the prior quarter 624 thousand of net premiums were amortized which decreased the weighted average yield on the portfolio by 25 basis points as of december 31 2018 the remaining net balance of premiums on our portfolio of mbs was 3 1 million the table above includes interest income on cash and cash equivalents associated and not associated with the leverage strategy interest income on cash and cash equivalents not related to the leverage strategy decreased 399 thousand from the prior quarter due to a 90 1 million decrease in the average balance partially offset by a 24 basis point increase in the weighted average yield which was related to balances held at the federal reserve bank of kansas city the frb of kansas city interest income on cash associated with the leverage strategy increased 900 thousand from the prior quarter due to the leverage strategy being in place for more days in the current quarter compared to the prior quarter see additional discussion regarding the leverage strategy in the financial condition section below interest expense the weighted average rate paid on total interest bearing liabilities for the current quarter increased nine basis points from 1 39 for the prior quarter to 1 48 for the current quarter and the average balance of interest bearing

interest expense 30 120 27 236 2 884 10 6 the increase in interest expense on deposits was due primarily to a six basis point increase in the weighted average rate paid to 1 13 for the current quarter the increase in the weighted average rate paid was due primarily to increases in the average retail business certificate of deposit portfolio rate and money market portfolio rate which increased nine basis points and 22 basis points respectively the weighted average interest rate on deposit accounts assumed in the ccb acquisition was lower than the overall deposit portfolio rate which partially offset the increase in the weighted average rate paid on the rest of the deposit portfolio in the current quarter the table above includes interest expense on fhlb borrowings associated and not associated with the leverage strategy interest expense on fhlb borrowings not related to the leverage strategy increased 593 thousand from the prior quarter due to a 10 basis point increase in the weighted average rate paid to 2 20 for the current quarter as maturing advances were replaced at higher current market rates interest expense on fhlb borrowings associated with the leverage strategy increased 1 0 million from the prior quarter due to the leverage strategy being in place for more days in the current quarter compared to the prior quarter provision for credit losses the bank did not record a provision for credit losses during the current quarter or the prior quarter based on management s assessment of the allowance for credit losses acl formula analysis model and several other factors it was determined that no provision for credit losses was necessary net loan recoveries were 95 thousand during the current quarter compared to 119 thousand in the prior quarter at december 31

interchange network charges related to the adoption of a new revenue recognition accounting standard during the current quarter previously interchange network charges were reported in deposit and loan expense upon adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard on october 1 2018 interchange transaction fee income is reported net of interchange network charges which totaled 944 thousand during the current quarter and 767 thousand during the prior quarter on a net basis interchange fee income totaled 1 4 million for the current quarter compared to 1 5 million for the prior quarter the increase in other non interest income was due mainly to an increase in insurance commissions and trust asset management fees recorded as a result of adopting the new revenue recognition accounting standard discussed above the company also began recording an estimate for contingent insurance commissions it expects to receive from insurance carriers previously the company recorded contingent insurance commissions as revenue when the funds were received in addition as part of the acquisition of ccb the company began offering trust asset management services the current quarter included a

thousand in the prior quarter excluding the impact of former ccb employees salaries and employee benefits decreased approximately 840 thousand from the prior quarter the decrease was due primarily to the prior quarter including compensation expense on unallocated employee stock ownership plan esop shares related to the true blue capitol dividend paid during the prior fiscal year along with expense related to the 2018 tax savings bonus plan approximately half of the increase in information technology and related expenses was due to costs related to the integration of ccb operations the remaining increase was due to depreciation related to the implementation of enhancements in the bank s information technology infrastructure and an increase in software licensing the increase in occupancy net was due primarily to a full quarter of expense related to properties acquired in the ccb acquisition the decrease in advertising and promotional was due primarily to the timing of advertising campaigns and sponsorships the decrease in deposit and loan transaction costs was due mainly to the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard discussed above the decrease in federal insurance premium was due primarily to a decrease in average assets resulting from a reduction in the usage of the leverage strategy during the prior quarter as federal insurance premiums are billed and paid on a quarter lag the increase in other non interest expense was due primarily to amortization of deposit intangibles associated with the acquisition of ccb along with an increase in other real estate owned oreo operations expense the company s efficiency ratio was 46 40 for the current quarter compared to 47 87 for the prior quarter the change in the efficiency ratio was due primarily to higher net interest income in the current quarter compared to the prior quarter the efficiency ratio is a measure of a financial institution s total non interest expense as a percentage of the sum of net interest income pre provision for credit losses and non interest income a lower value indicates that the financial institution is generating revenue with a proportionally lower level of expense income tax expense income tax expense was 6 6 million for the current quarter compared to 7 8 million for the prior quarter the effective tax rate was 21 2 for the current quarter compared to 26 6 for the prior quarter in december 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act was enacted which reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap the company revalued its deferred tax assets and liabilities in december 2017 to account for the lower corporate income tax rate the revaluation was a discrete item in the december 31 2017 quarter and reduced income tax expense by 7 5 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 2 6 for that quarter the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 was 20 2 primarily due to the fiscal year 2018 rate including the 7 5 million discrete item noted above which reduced the 24 5 statutory tax rate effective for that fiscal year due to the company s september 30 year end the company was required to use a blended statutory tax rate of 24 5 for fiscal year 2018 and the enacted tax rate of 21 will be effective for fiscal year 2019 although the statutory tax rate decreased to 21 for fiscal year 2019 the company does not have the same level of discrete items reducing the rate as in the prior fiscal year management estimates the effective income tax rate for fiscal year 2019 will be approximately 22 comparison of operating results for the three months ended december 31 2018 and 2017 the company recognized net income of 24 4 million or 0 18 per share for the quarter ended december 31 2018 compared to net income of 31 8 million or 0 24 per share for the quarter ended december 31 2017 the decrease in net income was due primarily to the prior year quarter including the impact of the enactment of the tax act as well as to an increase in non interest expense in the current quarter these changes were partially offset by an increase in net interest income in the current quarter due primarily to the higher yielding loans added in the ccb acquisition the net interest margin increased 44 basis points from 1 83 for the prior year quarter to 2 27 for the current quarter when the leverage strategy is in place it reduces the net interest margin due to the amount of earnings from the transaction in comparison to the size of the transaction the leverage strategy was suspended at certain times during the current quarter due to the negative interest rate spreads between the related fhlb borrowings and cash held at the frb of kansas city making the transaction unprofitable see additional discussion regarding the leverage strategy in the financial condition section below excluding the effects of the leverage strategy the net interest margin would have increased 12 basis points from 2 20 for the prior year quarter to 2 32 for the current quarter the increase in the net interest margin excluding the effects of the leverage strategy was due mainly to the addition of higher yielding commercial loans in the ccb acquisition interest and dividend income the weighted average yield on total interest earning assets increased 58 basis points from 2 98 for the prior year quarter to 3 56 for the current quarter while the average balance of interest earning assets decreased 1 55 billion

of the portfolio as well as a 19 basis point increase in the weighted average yield on the portfolio to 3 75 for the current quarter the increase in the average balance was due mainly to the acquisition of ccb the increase in the weighted average yield was also due mainly to the addition of higher yielding loans in the ccb acquisition as well as adjustable rate loans repricing to higher market rates and the origination and purchase of new loans at higher market rates the increase in interest income on the mbs portfolio was due to a 34 basis point increase in the weighted average yield on the portfolio to 2 59 for the current quarter along with a 74 8 million increase in the average balance of the portfolio the increase in the weighted average yield was due primarily to a decrease in the impact of net premium amortization as well as adjustable rate mbs repricing to higher market rates net premium amortization of 349 thousand during the current quarter decreased the weighted average yield on the portfolio by 14 basis points during the prior year quarter 854 thousand of net premiums were amortized which decreased the weighted average yield on the portfolio by 37 basis points the decrease in dividend income on fhlb stock was due to a decrease in the average balance of fhlb stock as a result of the leverage strategy not being in place as often during the current quarter as compared to the prior year quarter this was partially offset by a higher dividend rate on fhlb stock during the current quarter the table above includes interest income on cash and cash equivalents associated and not associated with the leverage strategy interest income on cash and cash equivalents not related to the leverage strategy decreased 287 thousand from the prior year quarter due to a 156 9 million decrease in the average balance partially offset by a 96 basis point increase in the weighted average yield which was related to cash balances held at the frb of kansas city interest income on cash associated with the leverage strategy decreased 5 1 million from the prior year quarter due to a 1 70 billion decrease in the average balance as the leverage strategy was in place less often during the current quarter the increase in interest income on the investment securities portfolio was due to a 72 basis point increase in the weighted average yield on the portfolio to 2 04 the increase in the weighted average yield was primarily a result of replacing maturing securities at higher market rates interest expense the weighted average rate paid on total interest bearing liabilities increased 19 basis points from 1 29 for the prior year quarter to 1 48 for the current quarter while the average balance of interest bearing liabilities decreased 1 53

interest expense on deposits was due primarily to a 22 basis point increase in the weighted average rate to 1 13 for the current quarter the deposit accounts assumed in the ccb acquisition were at a lower average rate than our overall deposit portfolio rate which partially offset the increase in the deposit portfolio rate in the current quarter the increase in the weighted average rate was primarily related to the certificate of deposit portfolio which increased 33 basis points to 1 84 for the current quarter the weighted average rate paid on wholesale certificates increased 63 basis points to 1 96 for the current quarter the table above includes interest expense on fhlb borrowings associated and not associated with the leverage strategy interest expense on fhlb borrowings not

and a 37 3 million increase in the average balance of the portfolio the increase in the weighted average rate paid was due to certain maturing advances being replaced at higher effective interest rates interest expense on fhlb borrowings associated with the leverage strategy decreased 5 3 million from the prior year quarter due to the strategy not being in place as often during the current quarter the decrease in interest expense on other borrowings was due mainly to the maturity of a 100 0 million repurchase agreement which was not replaced during the prior fiscal year non interest

was primarily related to policies acquired in the ccb acquisition the increase in other non interest income was due mainly to revenues from the trust asset management operations added in the ccb acquisition and as discussed above the company began recording an estimate for contingent insurance commissions it expects to receive from insurance carriers as part of adopting the new revenue recognition accounting standard in the current quarter additionally the prior year quarter included a loss on the sale of loans as management tested loan sale processes for liquidity purposes and

ccb employees salaries and employee benefits increased approximately 830 thousand from the prior year quarter the increase was primarily due to staff additions and salary adjustments during the prior fiscal year the increase in information technology and related expense was due mainly to an increase in software licensing depreciation related to the implementation of enhancements to the bank s information technology infrastructure and costs related to the integration of ccb operations the increase in occupancy net was due primarily to expenses related to properties acquired in the ccb acquisition the increase in regulatory and outside services was due mainly to audit fees related to the acquisition of ccb as well as an increase in consulting expenses the decrease in deposit and loan transaction costs was due mainly to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard as discussed above the decrease in federal insurance premium was due primarily to a decrease in average assets as a result of a reduction in the usage of the leverage strategy the increase in other non interest expense was due primarily to amortization of deposit intangibles associated with the acquisition of ccb the company s efficiency ratio was 46 40 for the current quarter compared to 40 26 for the prior year quarter the change in the efficiency ratio was due to higher non interest expense in the current quarter compared to the prior year quarter income tax expense income tax expense was 6 6 million for the current quarter compared to 860 thousand for the prior year quarter the effective tax rate was 21 2 for the current quarter compared to 2 6 for the prior year quarter the increase in the effective tax rate compared to the prior year quarter was due mainly to the tax act being signed into law in december 2017 in accordance with gaap the company revalued its deferred tax assets and liabilities in december 2017 to account for the lower corporate tax rate the revaluation reduced income tax expense by 7 5 million in the prior year quarter resulting in an effective tax rate of 2 6 for the prior year quarter fiscal year 2019 projections non interest income based on current market conditions management anticipates boli income will increase approximately 450 thousand in fiscal year 2019 related to boli policies acquired in the ccb acquisition based on the current trust asset management services activities and the amount of assets under management management anticipates trust asset management activities will increase non interest income by approximately 550 thousand in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 non interest expense taking into account salaries and benefits related to former ccb employees along with anticipated annual salary adjustments management anticipates salaries and employee benefits will be approximately 5 6 million higher in fiscal year 2019 management anticipates information technology and related expenses will be approximately 4 0 million higher in fiscal year 2019 due to integration costs associated with ccb higher depreciation related to the continued enhancements to the bank s information technology infrastructure and an increase in software licensing management anticipates occupancy net will be approximately 1 8 million higher in fiscal year 2019 due primarily to the properties acquired in the ccb acquisition management anticipates the deposit intangible amortization expense which is included in other non interest expense will be approximately 2 4 million in fiscal year 2019 financial condition as of december 31 2018 total assets were 9 30 billion at december 31 2018 compared to 9 45 billion at september 30 2018 the 145 8 million decrease was due primarily to decreases in securities and cash and cash equivalents the cash flows were used primarily to pay dividends to stockholders fund certificate of deposit maturities and pay borrowers real estate taxes the loans receivable portfolio net totaled 7 53 billion at december 31 2018 compared to 7 51 billion at september 30 2018 during the current quarter the bank originated and refinanced 189 7 million of loans with a weighted average rate of 4 74 and purchased 52 9 million of one to four family loans from correspondent lenders with a weighted average rate of 4 37 the bank also entered into participations of 61 9 million of commercial real estate loans with a weighted average rate of 4 99 of which 45 3 million had not yet been funded as of december 31 2018 the bank is continuing to manage the size and mix of its loan portfolio while managing liquidity levels as measured by the ratio of securities and cash to total assets to a target level of approximately 15 the ratio of securities and cash to total assets was 14 2 at december 31 2018 the size of the loan portfolio has been managed by controlling correspondent loan volume primarily through the rates offered to correspondent lenders management intends to continue to manage the size and mix of the loan portfolio by utilizing cash flows from the correspondent loan portfolio to fund commercial loan growth during the current quarter the commercial loan portfolio grew by 48 2 million or 8 while the correspondent one to four family loan portfolio decreased by 14 3 million or 1 and the bulk purchased one to four family loan portfolio decreased by 13 9 million or 5 given the balance of total assets it is unlikely that net loan growth will substantially increase in the current environment generally over the past few years cash flows from the securities portfolio have been used primarily to purchase loans and in part to pay down fhlb advances by moving cash from lower yielding assets to higher yielding assets and repaying higher costing liabilities we have been able to maintain our net interest margin in addition to the repayment of securities the bank has emphasized growth in the deposit portfolio in part to pay down term borrowings in the long run management considers a 10 ratio of stockholders equity to total assets at the bank an appropriate level of capital at december 31 2018 this ratio was 13 1 the bank continued at times to utilize a leverage strategy to increase earnings during the current quarter the leverage strategy during the current quarter involved borrowing up to 2 10 billion either on the bank s fhlb line of credit or by entering into short term fhlb advances depending on the rates offered by fhlb the borrowings were repaid prior to quarter end or earlier if the strategy was suspended the proceeds from the borrowings net of the required fhlb stock holdings which yielded 7 3 during the current quarter were deposited at the frb of kansas city net income attributable to the leverage strategy is largely derived from the dividends received on fhlb stock holdings plus the net interest rate spread between the yield on the cash at the frb of kansas city and the rate paid on the related fhlb borrowings less applicable federal insurance premiums and estimated taxes net income attributable to the leverage strategy was 14 thousand during the current quarter compared to 8 thousand during the quarter ended september 30 2018 and 767 thousand during the quarter ended december 31 2017 the decrease compared to the december 31 2017 quarter was due mainly to the strategy being suspended at certain times as a result of the large negative interest rate spread during the current quarter which would have resulted in the strategy not being profitable management continues to monitor the net interest rate spread and overall profitability of the strategy it is expected that the strategy will be reimplemented if it reaches a position that is profitable total liabilities were 7 96 billion at december 31 2018 compared to 8 06 billion at september 30 2018 the 100 1 million decrease was due mainly to decreases in deposits primarily the certificate of deposit portfolio and advance payments by borrowers for taxes and insurance due to the timing of payments stockholders equity was 1 35 billion at december 31 2018 compared to 1 39 billion at september 30 2018 the 45 7 million decrease was due primarily to the payment of 65 4 million in cash dividends partially offset by net income of 24 4 million the cash dividends paid during the current quarter totaled 0 475 per share and consisted of a 0 39 per share cash true up dividend related to fiscal year 2018 earnings per the company s dividend policy and a regular quarterly cash dividend of 0 085 per share on january 22 2019 the company

rate loans totaling 434 1 million at a weighted average rate of 4 26 and adjustable rate loans totaling 305 4 million at a weighted average rate of 4 95 the weighted average rate of fixed rate loans is lower than that of adjustable rate loans due primarily to the majority of the fixed rate loans in the portfolio at december 31 2018 having shorter terms to maturity additionally the credit risk for most of the bank s commercial real estate borrowing relationships is mitigated due to the amount of borrower equity injected into the projects strong debt service coverage ratios and the liquidity personal cash flow and net worth of the guarantors several of these borrowing relationships have a preference for fixed rate loans and the market interest rates are typically lower for these types of

adjustable rate fhlb advances for which the bank has entered into interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in cash flows associated with the advances the effective rate and wam presented include the effect of the interest rate swaps average rates and lives at december 31 2018 the bank s gap between the amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities projected to reprice within one year was 100 6 million or 1 08 of total assets compared to 14 9 million or 0 16 of total assets at september 30 2018 the increase in the one year gap amount was due primarily to an expected increase in cash flows from mortgage related assets compared to september 30 2018 as a result of lower interest rates as interest rates fall borrowers have more economic incentive to refinance their mortgages and agency debt issuers have more economic incentive or opportunity to exercise their call options in order to issue new debt at lower interest rates resulting in higher projected cash flows on these assets the majority of interest earning assets anticipated to reprice in the coming year are repayments and prepayments on one to four family loans and mbs both of which include the option to prepay without a fee being paid by the contract holder the amount of interest bearing liabilities expected to reprice in a given period is not typically impacted significantly by changes in interest rates because the bank s borrowings and certificate of deposit portfolios have contractual maturities and generally cannot be terminated early without a prepayment penalty if interest rates were to increase 200 basis points as of december 31 2018 the bank s one year gap is projected to be 419 2 million or 4 51 of total assets this compares to a one year gap of 394 8 million or 4 18 of total assets if interest rates were to have increased 200 basis points as of september 30 2018 the decrease in the gap compared to no change in rates is due to lower anticipated cash flows in the higher rate environment during the current quarter loan repayments totaled 267 5 million and cash flows from the securities portfolio totaled 93 9 million the majority of these cash flows were reinvested into new loans at current market interest rates total cash flows from fixed rate liabilities that matured and repriced into current market interest rates during the current quarter were 625 2 million including 300 0 million of term borrowings these offsetting cash flows allow the bank to manage its interest rate risk and gap position more precisely than if the bank did not have offsetting cash flows due to its mix of assets or maturity structure of liabilities other strategies include managing the bank s wholesale assets and liabilities the bank primarily uses long term fixed rate borrowings with no embedded options to lengthen the average life of the bank s liabilities the fixed rate characteristics of these borrowings lock in the cost until maturity and thus decrease the amount of liabilities repricing as interest rates move higher compared to funding with lower cost short term borrowings these borrowings are laddered in order to prevent large amounts of liabilities repricing in any one period the wal of the bank s term borrowings as of december 31 2018 was 1 7 years however including the impact of interest rate swaps related to 575 0 million of adjustable rate fhlb advances the wal of the bank s term borrowings as of december 31 2018 was 3 0 years the interest rate swaps effectively convert the adjustable rate borrowings into long term fixed rate liabilities the bank uses the securities portfolio to shorten the average life of the bank s assets purchases in the securities portfolio over the past few years have primarily been focused on callable agency debentures with maturities no longer than five years shorter duration mbs and adjustable rate mbs these securities have a shorter average life and provide a steady source of cash flow that can be reinvested as interest rates rise into higher yielding assets in addition to the wholesale strategies the bank has sought to increase non maturity deposits and long term certificates of deposit non maturity deposits are expected to reduce the risk of higher interest rates because their interest rates are not expected to increase significantly as market interest rates rise specifically checking accounts and savings accounts have had minimal interest rate fluctuations throughout historical interest rate cycles though no assurance can be given that this will be the case in future interest rate cycles the balances and rates of these accounts have historically tended to remain very stable over time giving them the characteristic of long term liabilities the bank uses historical data pertaining to these accounts to estimate their future balances over the last few years the bank has priced long term certificates of deposit more aggressively than short term certificates of deposit with the goal of giving customers incentive to move funds into longer term certificates of deposit when interest rates were lower long term certificates of deposit reduce the amount of liabilities repricing as interest rates rise in a given time period the following table presents the weighted average yields rates and wals in years after applying prepayment call

by melissa luz t lopez senior reporter growth in the philippines is expected to pick up this year with a rebound in consumption analysts at standard chartered stanchart bank said noting that infrastructure spending will be the main swing factor asia economist chidu narayanan estimated philippine gross domestic product gdp growth at 6 4 for 2019 which if realized will be faster than last year s 6 2 pace we think growth will be slightly better this year we think that again as in 2018 consumption will be the biggest driver of growth mr narayanan said during a briefing yesterday at the makati shangri la infrastructure investments both public and private will be the swing factor we think that net exports will be a drag for growth in 2019 as well and infrastructure investment would not be as fast as it had been early 2018 upside risks are that infrastructure investment is significant especially if there is a bsp bangko sentral ng pilipinas rate cut that will aid more private investment the government s official target range is 7 8 for gdp growth fuelled by infrastructure spending as more big ticket projects are rolled out consumer spending is set to recover sharply this year with prices normalizing standard chartered expects inflation to drop drastically this year perhaps below 2 5 within the second half to bring the full year level to 3 5 well below 2018 s 5 2 average and back to within the 2 4 target bad standard chartered expects last year s food driven inflation to scale back this year combining with lower crude prices to pull overall prices down this sharp drop in inflation will increase opportunities or space for the central bank to cut policy rates as required mr narayanan added even as he noted that the bank s base case is for interest rates to be kept steady we do not expect the bsp to be cutting rates at this point in time but if growth underachieves and comes in the lower half of 6 then that would mean that the likelihood of rate cuts increases cuts to bank reserves may also be introduced this year with the global lender pencilling in at least two separate reductions to 16 by yearend meanwhile the current account is expected to remain in deficit though the gap is seen narrowing as imports are likely to remain strong to support the local construction boom on the other hand an uncertain global environment will keep export growth weak mr narayanan added he added that remittances which help support household consumption as filipinos working abroad send more money home will help cushion the trade gap together with tourism receipts edward lee the bank s chief economist for the region also pointed out three key concerns in the global market the trade dispute between the united states and china political developments in the european union particularly brexit and the slowdown in china s economy currency strategist devesh divya noted that the peso will maintain its gradual and modest depreciation this year reeling from a wider current account deficit and strong dollar demand the bank projects the peso to trade at p54 against the dollar by june weakening to the p55 1 level by december
stamford conn business wire silgan holdings inc nasdaq slgn a leading supplier of rigid packaging for consumer goods products today reported full year 2018 net income of 224 0 million or 2 01 per

percent over the prior year after adjustments increasing net income per diluted share by 0 07 adjusted net income per diluted share was 1 65 for the full year 2017 after adjustments decreasing net income per diluted share by 0 77 a reconciliation of net income per diluted share to adjusted net income per diluted share a non gaap financial measure used by the company which adjusts net income per diluted share for certain items can be found in tables a and b at the back of this press release in 2018 we posted record adjusted net income per diluted share of 2 08 and record free cash flow of 311 4 million or 2 79 per diluted share representing a free cash flow yield of 11 8 percent on our year end stock price these record results were largely driven by the continued successful integration and strong performance of the dispensing systems operations and the ongoing improvement in our plastic container business said tony allott president and ceo as expected these improvements were partially offset by unfavorable overhead absorption of approximately 18 million in our metal container business due to the successful reduction of finished goods inventory by approximately 65 million volumes in the metal container business were down approximately four percent in 2018 as a result of a few discrete customer actions as well as a poor fruit and vegetable growing season in europe continued mr allott we expect all of our businesses to deliver improved operating results in 2019 largely offset by an approximately 20 million or 0 13 per diluted share non cash pension headwind as a result of significant market declines in investment values at the end of 2018 as a result we estimate adjusted net income per diluted share for 2019 to be in a range of 2 10 to 2 20 a 9 6 percent improvement over the prior year at the midpoint of the range excluding the unfavorable non cash pension impact we also expect to continue to generate significant free cash flow of approximately 275 million in 2019 concluded mr allott the company reported record net cash provided by operating activities of 506 5 million in 2018 as compared to 389 7 million in 2017 free cash flow improved 87 3 million to a record 311 4 million in 2018 as compared to 224 1 million in 2017 due to working capital benefits largely as a result of a significant planned reduction in finished goods inventory in the metal container business and strong operating performance the company is providing a reconciliation in table c of this press release of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow a non gaap financial measure used by the company which adjusts net cash provided by operating activities for certain items net sales for the full year of 2018 were 4 45 billion an increase of 359 0 million or 8 8 percent as compared to 2017 this increase was the result of higher net sales across all businesses income before interest and income taxes for 2018 was 412 1 million an increase of 55 1 million or 15 4 percent as compared to 357 0 million for 2017 and operating margin increased to 9 3 percent from 8 7 percent over the same periods the increase in income before interest and income taxes was the result of higher segment income in the closures and plastic container businesses and lower costs attributed to announced acquisitions partially offset by lower segment income in the metal container business income before interest and income taxes for 2017 included costs attributed to announced acquisitions of 24 7 million and the unfavorable impact from the write up of inventory for purchase accounting in the dispensing systems operations of 11 9 million rationalization charges were 6 3 million and 5 8 million in 2018 and 2017 respectively interest and other debt expense before loss on early extinguishment of debt for 2018 was 116 3 million an increase of 6 1 million as compared to 2017 due primarily to higher weighted average outstanding borrowings largely as a result of borrowings for the acquisition of the dispensing systems operations in april 2017 and higher weighted average interest rates loss on early extinguishment of debt of 2 5 million in 2018 was the result of the redemption of all remaining outstanding 5 senior notes due 2020 in april 2018 and the amendment to the senior secured credit facility in may 2018 loss on early extinguishment of debt of 7 1 million in 2017 was a result of the prepayment of outstanding u s term loans and euro term loans under the previous senior secured credit facility in conjunction with the issuance of new senior notes and the partial redemption in april 2017 of the 5 senior notes due 2020 the effective tax rate for 2018 which incorporates the lower u s corporate tax rate under the u s tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 was a provision of 23 6 percent as compared to a negative 12 5 percent for 2017 the effective tax rate for 2017 was favorably impacted by the benefit from effective tax rate adjustments primarily related to the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities at december 31 2017 to reflect lower future cash tax obligations as a result of the 2017 tax act the effective tax rate in 2017 exclusive of these effective tax rate adjustments would have been a provision of 33 8 percent metal containers net sales of the metal container business were 2 38 billion in 2018 an increase of 99 9 million or 4 4 percent as compared to 2017 this increase was primarily a result of the pass through of higher raw material and other manufacturing costs and the impact of favorable foreign currency translation partially offset by lower unit volumes of approximately four percent the decrease in unit volumes was principally the result of a seasonal customer reducing inventory levels a customer plant shutdown in the fruit market the competitive loss of a smaller lower margin customer and a less favorable fruit and vegetable pack in europe partially offset by higher pet food volumes and an incremental buy ahead by customers in 2018 as compared to 2017 in anticipation of significant steel inflation in 2019 segment income of the metal container business in 2018 was 198 8 million a decrease of 31 4 million as compared to 230 2 million in 2017 and segment income margin decreased to 8 4 percent in 2018 from 10 1 percent in the prior year the decrease in segment income was primarily attributable to the unfavorable overhead absorption of approximately 18 million due to the reduction of finished goods inventory by approximately 65 million in the current year period lower unit volumes higher freight expense and higher rationalization charges partially offset by the favorable impact from the contractual pass through to customers of indexed inflation on non metal costs as compared to the unfavorable impact in the prior year period from the contractual pass through of indexed deflation on non metal costs lower manufacturing costs and a charge in the prior year period related to the resolution of a past non commercial legal dispute rationalization charges were 5 3 million and 3 3 million in 2018 and 2017 respectively closures net sales of the closures business were 1 46 billion in 2018 an increase of 210 1 million or 16 9 percent as compared to 1 25 billion in 2017 this increase was primarily the result of the inclusion of a full year of the dispensing systems operations the pass through of higher raw material and other manufacturing costs and the impact of favorable foreign currency translation partially offset by lower unit volumes of approximately two percent in the legacy closures operations due primarily to a less favorable fruit and vegetable pack in europe as a result of weather conditions segment income of the closures business for 2018 increased 47 9 million to 189 9 million as compared to 142 0 million in 2017 and segment income margin increased to 13 0 percent from 11 4 percent over the same periods the increase in segment income was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of the dispensing systems operations the unfavorable impact in the prior year period of a charge for the write up of inventory of the dispensing systems operations for purchase accounting lower manufacturing costs and foreign currency transaction losses in the prior year period partially offset by the volume impact from a less favorable fruit and vegetable pack in europe plastic containers net sales of the plastic container business were 614 1 million in 2018 an increase of 49 0 million or 8 7 percent as compared to 565 1 million in 2017 this increase was principally due to the pass through of higher raw material costs and higher volumes of approximately four percent segment income of the plastic container business in 2018 was 42 6 million an increase of 14 8 million as compared to 27 8 million in 2017 and segment income margin increased to 6 9 percent from 4 9 percent over the same periods the increase in segment income was primarily attributable to higher volumes and lower manufacturing costs partially offset by costs associated with the start up of the new manufacturing facility in fort smith arkansas fourth quarter the company reported net income for the fourth quarter of 2018 of 38 2 million or 0 34 per diluted share as compared to net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 of 146 1 million or 1 31 per diluted share adjusted net income per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2018 was a record 0 38 after adjustments increasing net income per diluted share by 0 04 adjusted net income per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 0 32 after adjustments decreasing net income per diluted share by 0 99 net sales for the fourth quarter of 2018 increased 74 8 million or 7 5 percent to 1 07 billion as compared to 995 7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 this increase was primarily due to the pass through of higher raw material and other manufacturing costs and an increase in volumes in each of the businesses partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation the increase in volumes of approximately four percent in the metal container business was principally due to a larger buy ahead by customers in 2018 as compared to 2017 in anticipation of significant steel inflation in 2019 volumes in the plastic container and closures businesses increased approximately four percent and one percent respectively income before interest and income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 77 3 million a decrease of 9 1 million as compared to 86 4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and margin decreased to 7 2 percent from 8 7 percent over the same periods the decrease in income before interest and income taxes was primarily due to the unfavorable overhead absorption of approximately 18 million in the metal container business due to the reduction of finished goods inventory by approximately 65 million higher selling general and administrative expenses higher rationalization charges and costs associated with the start up of the new manufacturing facility in fort smith arkansas partially offset by higher volumes in each of the businesses lower manufacturing costs a favorable mix of products sold in the closures business and the favorable impact from the lagged pass through of lower resin costs in the closures business the increase in selling general and administrative expenses in the current year period was due primarily to the timing of costs for certain services the impact of inflation and foreign currency transaction losses rationalization charges were 4 8 million and 1 3 million in the fourth quarters of 2018 and 2017 respectively costs attributed to announced acquisitions were 0 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 interest and other debt expense for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 27 7 million a decrease of 2 3 million as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 this decrease was primarily due to lower weighted average outstanding borrowings largely as a result of the partial repayment of acquisition borrowings under the senior secured credit facility at the end of 2017 the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2018 which incorporates the lower u s corporate tax rate under the 2017 tax act was a provision of 23 1 percent as compared to a negative 159 2 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017 the effective tax rate for 2017 was favorably impacted by the benefit from effective tax rate adjustments primarily related to the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities at december 31 2017 to reflect lower future cash tax obligations as a result of the 2017 tax act the effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2017 exclusive of these effective tax rate adjustments would have been a provision of 37 6 percent outlook for 2019 the company currently estimates that its adjusted net income per diluted share for the full year 2019 will be in the range of 2 10 to 2 20 which includes the unfavorable non cash pension impact of approximately 20 million or 0 13 per diluted share resulting from significant market declines in investment values at the end of 2018 that negatively impacted the assets held in the company s pension plans despite these significant market declines the company s funded pension plans remain overfunded at approximately 112 percent at year end 2018 the company s estimate for 2019 compares to adjusted net income per diluted share for the full year of 2018 of 2 08 adjusted net income per diluted share excludes rationalization charges and loss on early extinguishment of debt net sales in the metal container business are expected to increase in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to the pass through of anticipated higher raw material and other manufacturing costs partially offset by an anticipated decline in unit volumes unit volumes in the metal container business are expected to decline due to customer pre buy activity in 2018 in advance of raw material price increases expected for 2019 the expected continuation of an inventory and portfolio management program at a certain customer and the continued impact from the prior year loss of a smaller customer partially offset by anticipated continued growth in pet food volumes and an expected more normal fruit and vegetable pack in europe segment income in the metal container business is expected to benefit from a normal production level planned in 2019 as compared to the unfavorable overhead absorption from a significant reduction of finished goods inventory in 2018 and continued manufacturing efficiencies offset by the unfavorable pension impact and anticipated lower unit volumes net sales in the closures business are expected to increase in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily as a result of the pass through of anticipated higher raw material costs and anticipated higher unit volumes segment income in the closures business is expected to benefit from anticipated higher unit volumes and continued manufacturing efficiencies offset by the unfavorable pension impact net sales in the plastic container business are expected to increase in 2019 as compared to the prior year as a result of the pass through of anticipated higher raw material costs and anticipated volume growth segment income in the plastic container business is expected to benefit from higher volumes and continued manufacturing efficiencies partially offset by the unfavorable pension impact the company expects slightly lower interest expense in 2019 due to lower average outstanding borrowings partially offset by higher weighted average variable interest rates the company expects its effective tax rate for 2019 to be approximately 24 percent as compared to the effective tax rate for 2018 of 23 6 percent the company currently estimates that free cash flow in 2019 will be approximately 275 million as compared to 311 4 million in 2018 the prior year free cash flow benefitted from significant improvements in working capital principally as a result of an approximately 65 million reduction of finished goods inventory in the metal container business for the first quarter of 2019 the company is providing an estimate of adjusted net income per diluted share in the range of 0 40 to 0 45 as compared to 0 42 in the first quarter of 2018 the company anticipates slightly higher volumes in the closures and plastic container businesses continued manufacturing efficiencies across all businesses a more normal seasonal inventory build in the metal container business the favorable impact from the lagged pass through of lower resin costs and lower interest costs as well as lower unit volumes in the metal container business and the unfavorable non cash pension impact of approximately 0 03 per diluted share unit volumes are expected to be lower in the metal container business as a result of a strong buy ahead by customers at the end of 2018 the continuation of an inventory and portfolio management program at a certain customer and the continued impact from the loss of a smaller customer in the second quarter of 2018 partially offset by anticipated higher pet food volumes adjusted net income per

if the united states and china are somehow able to make a breakthrough this week on a deal to resolve their current trade conflict how do they plan to enforce it there has been much speculation about what a deal between the two biggest trading countries in the world might contain there has been much less speculation about how the u s and china would make a two way deal work if they concluded one mosads eyes in washington this week are focused on the weary trade negotiators from the two countries as they labor together to reach a deal before they hit the march 2 deadline if a deal is not reached by then president donald trump has threatened to increase tariffs on 200 billion worth of chinese imports to 25 percent from 10 percent which would inflict even more mutual and increasingly global economic pain both the u s and china are among the 164 countries in the world trade organization wto should the two countries enter into a deal that rose to the level of a free trade agreement under the wto treaty by covering substantially all the trade between them they would have broad discretion to improvise on how to enforce any disputes that would inevitably arise between them over fulfilling their mutual obligations under the deal as part of a free trade agreement fta the u s and china could if they wished create an entirely separate dispute settlement system to uphold the deal this is what has been done for example in other ftas one example is the north american free trade agreement nafta which features a dispute settlement system that trump is currently trying to undermine in some respects with his proposed substitute the u s mexico canada agreement but the united states and china are not even considering a free trade agreement as a result if president trump and his trade negotiators reached a deal with the chinese they would whether they liked it or not be obligated under international law to enforce that deal largely within the legal framework of the wto rules for dispute settlement if the u s chose instead to ignore wto rules if china acquiesced to it and if their actions pursuant to their bilateral deal harmed their other trading partners the two countries could each face the possibility of losing billions of dollars annually in their current trade benefits from other wto members through lawful economic sanctions authorized by the wto all wto members have agreed in the wto treaty to take all their disputes involving matters covered by the treaty to the wto for dispute settlement before retaliating by imposing tariffs or other trade restrictions to counter perceived unfair trade practices the wto treaty covers about 98 percent of all world commerce including trade in both goods and services to a limited extent it also covers foreign direct investment thus punitive tariffs and other trade restrictions in response to concerns about matters falling within the scope of the wto treaty that are imposed without first seeking legal judgment and approval by the wto are violations of the treaty so far in his imposition of unilateral tariffs on products from china and other u s trading partners president trump has ignored this wto treaty obligation which is why the united states is now facing an uphill battle in defending against an ever growing number of legal complaints by other countries in the wto china received permission from the wto to proceed with its basic challenge to the unilateral tariffs trump has already applied earlier this week if in return for the removal of the trump tariffs china agreed in a deal with the u s to favor an american product with a guaranteed purchase amount or with a guaranteed percentage of the chinese market in that product or if china agreed to give that same u s product special treatment on chinese technology transfer requirements these would be clear violations of china s basic wto obligation to give like imported products of all 162 other wto members non discriminatory most favored nation treatment and if as has been speculated a u s china trade deal permitted the u s to enforce these illegal obligations made by china in the deal by restoring some or all of the current illegal unilateral tariffs on imported chinese products then such an enforcement provision would itself be in violation of wto rules because it would simply be a renewal of tariffs that were illegal in the first place conceivably china could agree under u s pressure to such an arrangement slanted against china the u s market is vital to china countries can sign away their legal rights if they want but would the chinese yield to trump s intimidation in such a way especially in as much as they are challenging the very tariffs that would snap back as a penalty in the wto now agreeing to such an arrangement would be all too reminiscent of the unequal treaties that were often forced on a weakened china by foreign countries in the 19th century mossecondads on matters not falling within the scope of the wto treaty such as most matters relating to foreign direct investment the u s and china are much freer to agree on a separate deal ideally enforcement of their mutual investment obligations would be done under a bilateral investment treaty bit which despite years of talk is not on the horizon short of a bit a trade deal between the two countries could also be an investment deal and could include its own means of enforcing most investment obligations the irony here is that in order to work those means might need to look a lot like the investor state dispute settlement provisions that trump and his trade enablers loathe in other international agreements otherwise in trying to enforce a trade deal with china the trump administration will likely find itself more often where it least likes to be in geneva pleading the u s case before the judges for the wto former rep james bacchus d fla is a former chief judge for the world trade organization he is an adjunct scholar at the cato institute and professor of global affairs at the university of central florida his new book is the willing world shaping and sharing a sustainable global prosperity

by comparison between december 2017 and january 2018 the ndrc approved just seven projects worth a total of 105 79 billion yuan us 15 69 billion since the start of december the national development and reform commission ndrc has approved 16 projects worth at least 1 1 trillion yuan us 163 2 billion in total according to south china morning post analysis of official data china s state planner has been rapidly approving big infrastructure projects as it looks to give its flagging economy a shot in the arm the most expensive project on the approval list is an expansion of the shanghai urban rail transit with a price tag of 298 35 billion yuan us 44 24 billion the network is aimed to better connect the financial hub s two airports and two major railway stations according to the statement from the ndrc the acceleration comes after the ndrc vowed to speed up project approvals this was in response to beijing last month signalling more stimulus to counter the effect of the trade war with the united states and a broad based slowdown in the domestic economy builders work on the first large scale power grid construction project in xiongan new area in north china s hebei province photo xinhua china will speed up investment projects and local government bond issuance but will not resort to flood like stimulus said ndrc vice chairman lian weiliang earlier this month reiterating beijing s stance against easy borrowing infrastructure spend had previously been slowing investment growth excluding power and utility assets slowed to 3 3 per cent in the first nine months of 2018 from 19 8 per cent for the corresponding period in 2017 according to moody s as a result of beijing s effort to cut debt and tighten control over local government spend the latest splurge is still someway short of the mammoth infrastructure spend that followed the global financial crisis in 2008 china unleashed a 4 trillion yuan us 593 billion stimulus package public infrastructure projects such as airports railway roads and irrigation accounted for almost 1 5 trillion yuan or nearly 38 per cent of the total package aerial photo shows staff members working on an overpass in front of the terminal of a new airport under construction in beijing capital of china photo xinhua the stimulus package was later cited as a major factor in china s surge in debt after 2009 nonetheless it is a significant flexing of financial muscle by the ndrc adding to the measures already taken by the people s bank of china pboc in a bid to stave off further slowing in the economy the pboc china s central bank has cut bank reserve ratios five times since last year this means banks are required to hold less cash in reserve it is a policy measure designed to free up more liquidity for lending last year china s banks extended a record 16 17 trillion yuan in new loans well above the previous record of 13 53 trillion yuan in 2017 an indication that the bank has been moderately aggressive in using monetary policy to stimulate the economy last week the pboc also announced a bill swap mechanism that will allow holders to swap commercial bank perpetual debt that is debt without a maturity date for central bank bills to be used for borrowing collateral however analysts say policymakers and central bankers in china are facing significant challenges in stabilising an economy that grew at 6 4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2018 the lowest growth rate since the chinese government began publishing quarterly growth rates at the beginning of 1992 for all of 2018 the chinese economy grew at 6 6 per cent in line with the government s target for growth of about 6 5 per cent for the year but the lowest rate since 2009 when the world was in the grips of the biggest financial crisis in decades major economic indicators including fixed asset investment industrial production retail sales and external trade are also decelerating and analysts expect further pressure in the first quarter of this year we expect both exports and property investment to slow to low single digit growth in 2019 from around 10 per cent last year therefore policymakers are set to ramp up infrastructure spending to around 10 per cent growth this year to support growth said analysts at macquarie in a note however beefing up infrastructure may do little to prevent the economy from losing steam according to analysts at nomura a japanese investment bank although recent fiscal policy easing measures including an earlier issuance of local government bonds this year intensive approvals of infrastructure investment projects in recent months and further tax cuts towards the small and medium sized enterprises may have a positive effect on growth in our view they are not enough to shore up the economy said analysts at the bank in a note published last week

sen elizabeth warren d mass has made a splash with her plan for a wealth tax on the super rich a major break from typical democratic proposals that target income investment gains and inheritances while wealth taxes aren t a new invention and a handful of developed nations currently have them in place they are on the decline the number nations that are members of the organization for economic cooperation and development with a wealth tax dropped from 12 to four from 1990 to 2017 according to a report by the organization last year with inequality hitting new heights though democrats running for president have made finding new ways to tax the rich and distribute the benefits downward a key part of their economic message wealth taxes are making a comeback in policy discussions abroad as well led by french economist thomas piketty s call for a global tax on the rich now economists are debating what other countries can tell us about the warren ultra millionaires tax and whether it s useful to tie their experiences to the united states one prominent case study is switzerland where a longstanding series of wealth taxes account for about 1 percent of gdp each year that s a much higher share than in other countries with a wealth tax and it s similar to what warren s advisers predict her own tax would raise the comparison everyone is thinking of is switzerland because it s probably the best precedent for a reasonably effective wealth tax ari glogower a professor at ohio state university who researches wealth taxes told nbc news the country s wealth tax may offer some insight into one looming question over warren s wealth tax which is whether its targets would find ways to avoid paying it it s an important debate because warren s counting on her tax to raise a lot of money for social programs 2 75 trillion over 10 years according to an estimate by emmanuel saez and gabriel zucman two economists advising her campaign under warren s proposal households with over 50 million in assets would pay a 2 percent tax on their net worth every year the rate would rise to 3 percent on assets over 1 billion warren s plan would affect just 75 000 households total taxes on wealth in switzerland are not fixed but set by 26 regional governments with rates that varied from 0 13 percent to 1 percent per year in 2016 according to the oecd report they also are much broader affecting not just millionaires but many middle class households as well a study of the country s tax system by jonathan gruber and several other economists found that for every 0 1 percent taxes on wealth went up in an area the wealth taxpayers reported to the government dropped by 3 5 percent when you tax people s wealth they manage to somehow reduce their taxable wealth gruber told nbc news we don t know if it s by saving less or by hiding it critics point to these shifts as evidence that a wealth tax is an inefficient way to collect taxes while the irs can easily check the price of a publicly traded stock it may be hard to value a privately held company or a rare art collection until it s sold which is often a source of legal battles in calculating estate taxes but unlike an estate which is taxed once at death the government would have to figure out the value every year it s really difficult to enforce said alan cole a former adviser to house republicans on tax policy that s why almost everyone goes the capital gains tax route and very few go the wealth tax route the oecd s report found that countries with wealth taxes have tended to collect relatively similar amounts of revenue over time even as the overall wealth in their countries increased at much faster rates this suggests taxpayers either found new ways to get around them or that legislators and tax collectors weren t keeping pace with annual growth anticipating this concern warren s plan includes a pledge to bolster the irs require a minimum number of audits and use a variety of techniques to indirectly value more difficult to price assets while they expect the rich to succeed in shielding some of their assets warren advisers saez and zucman peg the number at 15 percent total based on a survey of existing research in a letter to warren they wrote that gruber s study was an outlier and that studies of wealth taxes in other countries like sweden and denmark showed less tax avoidance as gruber noted switzerland s broad tax base makes it a less than exact comparison but the tax rate in warren s plan would also be much higher giving its targets more motive to avoid it they would also be more likely to have skilled accountants and lawyers to help them out it doesn t mean it s a bad idea or it won t raise money gruber said elizabeth warren s tax would raise money it s a question of how much at the same time some argue recent changes in finance make it harder for the rich to hide assets from tax collectors lily batchelder a professor at new york university and former economic adviser under president barack obama pointed to the foreign account tax compliance act a 2010 u s law in coordination with other governments around the world that requires banks to report activity by american citizens it s certainly not perfect and there s more work to be done but compared to even five years ago the landscape has really changed she said so people who are looking at this from five or 10 or 20 years ago are missing that gruber s study does cut against another top concern raised by critics of a wealth tax that it will cause taxpayers to pack up and move even with lower tax options inside the same country their research found little sign of people moving to avoid higher rates the fear that the ultra rich will not just lowball their fortunes but pack up and take them to a rival country is a significant reason the wealth tax has declined in france president emmanuel macron replaced the country s decades old wealth tax with a narrower tax on real estate partly in response to data suggesting 60 000 millionaires had left the country since 2000 in one prominent case famed actor gérard depardieu moved across the border to less taxed belgium while criticizing france s policies it wasn t just the wealth tax the previous government also imposed a 75 percent tax rate on income for millionaires a policy that bears similarities to a proposal by rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y warren s plan would apply to americans based on citizenship not where they live or where their money is earned so the ultra rich couldn t easily move to avoid it if they renounced their citizenship they d have to pay a one time 40 percent exit tax on their net worth
when you ve made 2 7 billion nearly three thousand million dollars it must be easy to believe you ve got talent so extraordinary that it borders on magical power not many other people have made that much money that you did surely proves you harnessed your gifts and put in some hard work and grit and determination in a way no one else was able or willing if you can do that you can do pretty much anything a belief you can reinforce by paying people to tell you that yes you can do that this appears to be what s powering howard schultz the former starbucks ceo who now thinks he has what it takes to save america so he s seriously considering a run for president schultz has embarked on a pr blitz over the last few days and has earned himself an impressive amount of free media not much of that coverage has been positive probably because he has proven himself almost uniquely adept at misreading the political moment this is not exactly gobsmacking considering he s the same guy who once instructed his employees to write race together on starbucks cups in order to force conversations on race issues with customers before they d had their morning coffee this initiative was greeted by a rare moment of unity across the political spectrum as pretty much everyone agreed it was idiotic the reception was so bad that schultz deactivated his twitter account which he re launched this week to fire off three tweets all of which got ratioed mike pont getty images the early signs are that his candidacy may also unite otherwise sworn enemies in pity and disgust schultz it increasingly seems is unable to grasp politics in general a self declared lifelong democrat schultz has set himself up as a centrist independent in interviews with 60 minutes and the new york times this earned immediate rebukes from democrats and fellow billionaire centrist michael bloomberg all of whom think schultz could split the anti trump vote if he runs as a third party spoiler and possibly throw the election to the tangerine generalissimo this was the sentiment that greeted schultz at a book signing event in new york city on monday night bloomberg for his part is working off experience he scoured the polling data in 2016 and elected not to run for exactly this reason in today s climate it s a reasonable concern having lost some non college educated white voters to trump democrats may lean on some college educated suburban whites who have become disenchanted with the trumpian approach of governing from manufactured crisis to self inflicted fiasco all while being an asshole to everyone who doesn t praise you on the tv if there is any kind of natural constituency for a presidential bid from howard schultz which assumes facts not in evidence it would probably be well off suburban white people who are wary of democrats who are pledging to raise taxes to fund social programs if you re looking for more evidence a schultz run could provide trump with a better path to re election you only need to look to how the president is reacting to this development and the very next morning trump s pravda network jumped into action to hold what they ve surely identified as the party line fox news is a dependable ally to all rich people but surely there s a reason they ve chosen to defend schultz specifically right now it is not because they believe he will remove donald trump from the white house schultz is paying some prominent republican and democratic strategists including msnbc contributor steve schmidt and former obama aide bill burton to advise him on all this he is likely forking over portions of his 2 7 billion net worth that are insignificant to him but nonetheless very significant to these political consultants it s hard to see these guys who surely do not believe schultz has a chance to become president of the united states but took the job anyway telling him that he doesn t have a prayer when we re so far out from the actual contest and they ve only just boarded the gravy train but if schultz is looking for a dose of reality again assumes facts not in evidence then he doesn t even need to look to any op ed page or tweet ratio just look at what the president and his apparatchiks think about his burgeoning political career one reason schultz is no meteoric political talent is that beyond any charisma deficiencies he seems to believe being a centrist independent means you won t do much of anything or at least nothing specific schultz s political views derive almost exclusively from the church of both sides the religion practiced in cable news green rooms where both parties are too extreme and the american people are somewhere in the center schultz even went so far as to call them the silent majority another display of his political savvy in that it s a callback to the race baiting tactics of richard nixon s southern strategy it also came up in more recent times mark reinstein getty images a trump supporter holds a sign suggesting the silent majority stands with him the defining gospel of the church of both sides besides the belief everyone should be more civil is the idea the national debt is a guillotine hanging over the american republic there are plenty of arguments against this as a basic principle the dollar is the world s reserve currency so the idea our debt will collapse the economy in the near or even medium turn is way overblown moreover the gravity of the debt problem is closely tied to the consensus built over just the last few decades that wall street is responsible for creating money in our society through loans while the government should back away from its method of creating money running deficits another argument that the debt isn t actually that pressing or at least that many people who talk about it don t actually care is that republicans continually run up the deficit with debt financed tax cuts for 40 years they have claimed these will pay for themselves through economic growth a theory based on a graph drawn on a napkin that has never ever proven true just look at kansas or the whole country which was subjected to the republican tax cut in 2017 it boosted gdp growth but barely even began to pay for itself and also led to only modest hiring gains and no real wage improvements that may be because the massive corporations who benefited most mostly used their savings on stock buybacks a method of boosting share price in the short term which in turn boosts the ceo s annual compensation rather than on innovation or expansion schultz said the republican cuts were a bit too generous to companies and insufficiently so to working people but has largely refused to get specific on what he d do on taxes miguel medina getty images but even if the national debt is a huge problem we must solve in the medium term it is not the most pressing issue of this political moment or more to the point balancing the budget will not solve any of the deep structural problems fueling the political extremism and social dysfunction in our society the foremost issues in that regard are wealth inequality and decaying social mobility on which schultz has already staked out a familiar position admitting there s a problem but dismissing actual transformative solutions as too costly and unrealistic there is a problem that she has identified but i think the way she s going about it unfortunately a bit misinformed the problem is we have significant inequality in the country the problem is we have about 40 percent of american families that literally don t have 400 for a crisis we have roughly 5 million young people many african american latino that are not in school not in work and one of every six americans are food insecure every night this was a response to a question about ocasio cortez s proposal for a 70 percent top marginal tax rate it is frankly a way to redistribute wealth from the top 1 percent which controls 40 percent of the pie and the top 20 percent which controls 90 percent to the bottom 80 percent which controls just 10 percent of the wealth in most democratic proposals this would be through government funded education and job training and healthcare programs that strengthen the social safety net and increase social mobility schultz opposes this but does not seem to offer an alternative likely because doing something would involve him losing money philosophically howard schultz appears to believe the fact that people like him have billions of dollars is completely unrelated to the fact that 40 percent of americans don t have 400 in savings in fact he made this explicitly clear monday night i respect the democratic party i no longer feel affiliated because i don t know their views represent the majority of americans i don t think we want a 70 percent income tax in america except at least according to the polling he doesn t speak for the majority 59 percent of registered voters support aoc s 70 percent top marginal rate in a recent poll that is to say howard schultz just doesn t want to pay a 70 percent tax which would only apply to his income above 10 million and neither do his rich friends the majority of americans just sounds better he s running as an independent to prevent his taxes getting raised by a democrat nbc newswire getty images alexandria ocasio cortez and this is the most basic argument against running another billionaire against the self styled billionaire in the white house most people particularly those who acquire billions of dollars do not want to give up what they have fixing the american economy so that workers get a fairer share of the pie will involve the obscenely rich giving up some of what they have now or at least going forward more than that extremely rich people almost always struggle to grasp the problems facing working people because over the years they ve just grown so disconnected from those lives that was part of the problem that faced hillary clinton in 2016 a very qualified candidate who believed based on the stock market and speaking to pretty much everyone she knew that the economy was on a big time rebound under obama and that she could run as largely an extension of his legacy but 48 percent of americans do not own any kind of stocks the market doesn t affect them and for many their real wages their pay when you account for the rising price of goods have not budged much in decades many communities have not actually recovered from the great recession this too is tied to an incentive structure in corporate america emphasizing short term profits to maximize share price in the near term the american economic system does not require modest tweaks it requires a major overhaul where the vast majority of people get a much larger share of the pie than they currently do getty images elizabeth warren these are the kind of problems identified by a candidate like elizabeth warren surely one of those schultz has deemed too far to the left who has proposed workers should elect 40 percent of their corporation s board and floated a wealth tax of 2 percent above 50 million and 3 percent above 1 billion this is based on the idea the short termism of the american economy is robbing workers of just desserts and pushing it upwards towards a small cadre of executive types who then get a tax cut every time republicans sweep into power schultz if he is aware of these structural issues is not proposing anything specific to deal with them maybe that s because he was very recently an executive at a major corporation and would not have enjoyed having to cater to the interests of workers particularly if it affected the share price but the idea share price is the only concern for a corporate executive is again a relatively recent development schultz s belief that most americans agree with him seems to be rooted in a single data point he cited on 60 minutes that around 40 percent identify as independents that s true but it has no actual bearing on what kind of policies they favor first of all most independents lean democratic or republican they almost always vote that way most people just like to think of themselves as independent thinkers or otherwise immune to groupthink second of all schultz s brand of national debt obsessed centrism isn t reflected in other polling in general three quarters of americans favor higher taxes on the wealthy in the poll showing 59 percent support aoc s top marginal tax rate of 70 percent 60 percent of the independents schultz claims to represent also support it 45 percent of republicans support it 55 percent of republicans oppose it so it sounds like schultz represents republican voters on that issue in fact he sounds if not conservative than resigned to a slightly modified status quo on a number of issues medicare for all is as unrealistic as the wall even if you ignore that most every other industrialized nation has universal healthcare just look at a study from george mason university one of the most conservative shops around which found bernie sanders mfa plan would cost less than our current system is projected to over the same period also it would insure 30 million more people also it s not free as schultz said it s paid for with tax dollars instead of insurance premiums also 70 percent of americans support it but schultz is trapped in a delusion courtesy of the both sides gospel a steadfast belief that you cannot do anything ambitious because of the debt guillotine notice he said everyone should have the right to access to quality healthcare nowhere did he say they could afford it this is very similar to the rhetoric paul ryan would trot out while trying to force through the various republican healthcare bills scott olson getty images the 2016 republican field in effect howard schultz has positioned himself as a ludicrously rich would be technocrat somewhere between hillary clinton and milquetoast jeb bush style republicans on the political spectrum he s socially liberal and accepts the scientific consensus on climate change but basically opposes any major changes to the economic system this may or may not have to do with a belief that the stratospheric degree of his financial success is unrelated to structural inequities in that system you may have noticed donald trump defeated all these people albeit in the case of clinton using a quirk of our electoral system if we learned anything from 2016 it s that the country now demands someone who will understand the problems working people face and the visceral rage that our decades long insistence on exacerbating those problems has created howard schultz is not that candidate because howard schultz has nearly three billion dollars and thinks racism can be addressed via notes on a coffee cup we don t need someone who thinks donald trump is rude and he cut taxes on rich people a little bit too much trump will not be the last racist authoritarian the republican base nominates if we fail to address the economic despair that drives people at the fringes of his movement to throw in with him on the basis that the other option is the status quo as we ve seen these last few years the country is ripe for fascism howard schultz should stay on the sidelines in his luxury box and pay whatever relatively modest tax is levied on him by someone with an actual grasp on the existential threats facing american society he could use the money he ll save by firing the political consultants who don t actually think he can win anyway

my name is rachel greszler i am a research fellow in economics budgets and entitlements at the heritage foundation the views i express in this testimony are my own and should not be construed as representing any official position of the heritage foundation the congressional budget office cbo finds that the federal government provides significantly higher total compensation to its employees than private sector employers provide this is a problem for taxpayers who are over taxed and over indebted to over pay federal workers it is also a problem for the government although a compensation premium should serve to enhance the federal government s workforce and productivity the federal government s faulty compensation and career advancement structures impede instead of advance government efficiency and achievement i would like to focus my testimony on three things first is the effect of federal benefits that are not included in the cbo s study on the federal compensation premium second is the baseless and obstructive federal employment platform and third is a set of recommendations that would help bring public sector compensation in line with that of the private sector helping make government more efficient and productive broad evidence of significant federal compensation premium overall the cbo report finds a 17 percent compensation premium consisting of a 3 percent wage premium and a 47 percent benefit premium 1 many other studies have also found significant federal compensation premiums back in 1980 alan krueger who served as chairman of president obama s council of economic advisers documented a federal pay premium 2 more recently a 2011 heritage foundation study found a slightly higher overall compensation premium between 30 percent and 40 percent3 and a similar 2011 study by the american enterprise institute found a 61 percent premium 4 the fact that federal employees quit their jobs at only one fifth the rate of private sector workers supports the nearly universal findings of a significant federal compensation premium 5 1 omitted compensation costs and benefits although the cbo s report examined both cash wages and major benefits it did not include some forms of compensation that are difficult to value unequally distributed or that lack sufficient data including these additional benefits would further widen the gap between public and private compensation among the benefits excluded by the cbo and many other comparisons are student loan repayment the federal government provides eligible employees with up to 10 000 a year and 60 000 total in student loan repayments in 2015 federal agencies provided more than 69 5 million in repayments to 9 610 federal employees an average annual benefit of over 7 200 per employee 6 student loan repayments were non existent among private sector benefits until recently although student loan repayments benefits are on the rise only 4 percent of private sector employers offer them and even the most generous private sector plans provide only 10 percent to 20 percent as much in annual and maximum repayments as the federal government 7 student loan forgiveness beginning in 2007 federal employees as well as public sector or nonprofit workers became eligible for student loan forgiveness federal employees can have their student loan payments limited to as little as 10 percent of their income and after 10 years 120 months of on time student loan payments their remaining debt can be forgiven 8 forgiven is another way to say forked over to taxpayers a federal employee with 120 000 in student loans and a 30 year repayment period would have almost 95 000 in principle remaining on their student loan after 10 years that is about twice the median earnings in the u s but for federal workers it is just a job perk and a misguided one at that after 10 years of employment most workers have advanced in their careers and established sustainable living circumstances and finances yes wiping out tens of thousands of dollars of debt and thousands of dollars in annual payments for select employees who clock 10 years of federal service is a huge benefit but employees do not fully value it because they do not know if they will receive it moreover a massive lump sum benefit 10 years into federal employment is less helpful than student loan relief early on in workers careers when they have lower earnings consequently student loan repayments function more as windfall benefits than to make government employment more competitive the federal government extends student loan forgiveness to workers in state and local governments as well as those in public service non profit institutions this allows those subsidized sectors to provide lower compensation than they would need to absent the student loan forgiveness and it presumes that certain groups of workers are more valuable to society than others private institutions can be just as valuable to society as government and non profit institutions yet this selective subsidy disadvantages private sector because companies are not privy to the federal government s ability to convey whatever costs or debts it chooses onto taxpayers transportation benefits federal employees are typically eligible for either free parking something that can cost hundreds of dollars in cities such as dc or tax free mass transit benefits of up to 255 per month 3 060 per year most private employers allow employees to claim transit subsidies but employees typically pay their transit costs retiree health benefits federal employees who have five or more years of federal service and who go directly from federal service to retirement are eligible at a minimum age of 57 to receive the same health insurance subsidy during retirement that they received while working 9 a 2002 study by the congressional budget office cbo estimated the accrual cost of this benefit at 3 475 per year or 6 4 percent of workers pay 10 federal employees also enjoy a number of benefits that are more difficult to value or measure childcare federal employees have greater access to on site childcare while most employees still pay for childcare they pay less than they would absent the rent subsidy typically provided to on site childcare providers additionally some federal employees who make less than about 70 000 a year can receive significant childcare payments from the federal government 11 for example general services administration gsa employees receive federal subsidies to cover the portion of their childcare costs that exceed a specified percentage ranging from 5 percent to 15 percent of their adjusted gross income agi these subsidies can amount to tens of thousands of dollars per year with an annual cap of just under 35 000 12 preferable work schedules most workers recognize federal government jobs as requiring fewer total hours than similar private sector positions and as offering greater flexibility in schedules for example many federal employees work slightly longer days in exchange for every other friday off better hours and flexibility are among the reasons many workers who want a better work life balance seek out federal government jobs job security federal employees receive an invaluable benefit through superior job security federal law makes it extremely difficult to fire federal employees for poor performance misconduct or even posing a threat to the security of the agency on average it takes about a year and a half to fire a federal employee as they have access to multiple layers of appeals 13 consequently the layoff and discharge rate for federal employees is only one third that of the private sector 2 bad business structures hurt government productivity and unnecessarily drive up taxpayer costs while the federal government s compensation premium should increase its competitiveness in attracting and retaining the best and brightest workers the structure of the premium along with perverse features of the government s employment model instead weaken the government s competitiveness and efficiency the government could optimize its workforce and save taxpayers tens of billions of dollars per year by shifting its compensation structure towards that of the private sector unequal compensation premiums as the cbo report showed the federal compensation premium is not uniform across the federal workforce according to the cbo study the federal government overcompensates workers with no more than a high school education by 53 percent compared to 21 percent for workers with a bachelor s degree 14 for workers with professional or masters degrees the cbo report shows the federal government actually undercompensates them by 18 percent these figures do not take into account the omitted benefits discussed above 15 this structure directly contradicts the federal government s workforce needs compared to the private sector the federal government has 2 5 times as many workers with master s degrees or higher and only about one third as many workers with less than a high school degree 16 yet the government provides the biggest compensation premium where it faces the least competition for lower educated workers and the smallest premium even a penalty in some instances where it faces the most competition among highly educated workers a productivity and profit maximizing private company that needs more skilled workers than its competitors provides equal or even greater compensation to attract and retain the best workers it can similarly a private company that needs fewer lower skilled workers than its competitors will not massively and unnecessarily overcompensate them overweighting an undervalued benefit delayed compensation is less valuable to workers than immediate compensation and yet the federal government provides at least three times as much delayed compensation in the form of retirement benefits as the private sector federal employees receive between 16 1 percent and 18 2 percent of their pay in retirement benefits compared to about 3 percent to 5 percent for private workers 17 while saving for retirement is a good thing there is no one size fits all prescription for the level and timing of retirement savings workers benefit from the freedom to choose when and how much to save some workers can afford to sack away significant retirement savings right from the get go and that is great for them others however who start with lower earnings or who begin a family and want to purchase a home or have to pay for childcare are better off with larger paychecks than retirement benefits with rising student loan debt many recent college graduates are hard pressed to meet their living expenses and student loan payments the government s benefit heavy and pay light compensation almost certainly prevents many talented younger workers from taking jobs with the government moreover the government s primary retirement compensation is a defined benefit pension called the federal employees retirement system or fers defined benefit pensions are largely undervalued however because employees do not know how much if anything they will eventually receive in pension benefits it is not until workers attain significant tenure or near their retirement that they have a meaningful understanding of their pensions value a study by maria fitzpatrick of cornell university examined the value of defined benefit pensions to workers and concluded that defined benefit pensions are substantially inefficient forms of compensation with little value in attracting employees 18 according to her analysis illinois public teachers valued additional pension benefits at only 19 cents on the dollar 19 it makes no sense for the federal government to provide a benefit that workers perceive as being worth only a fraction of its actual cost shifting away from defined benefit compensation would be a win win for federal employees and taxpayers it provides the opportunity for federal employees to receive equally or even more valuable compensation at significantly lower costs failure to reward high performers or penalize low performers in the private sector productivity determines workers pay if private employers pay employees more than they produce they lose business to competitors who do not over pay their employees similarly if private employers pay workers less than their productivity warrants they lose those workers to competitors who will pay them more that is not the case in the federal government the federal government has a monopoly over federal services and federal tax collections as well as a seemingly limitless line of credit with current and future taxpayers that translates into the federal government having little incentive to minimize costs or maximize efficiency automatic pay increases in theory the federal government s pay scale is supposed to approximate private sector market driven wages in practice however many government wages bear little resemblance to similar private sector wages the 2011 heritage study found that much of the unexplained wage premium in the federal government comes from more rapid raises and promotions particularly in the lower level steps when increases are more frequent 20 this helps explain why the federal pay premium is generally highest for lower earning workers and lowest for higher earning workers instead of performance based pay increases federal workers receive two effectively automatic pay increases first is an annual cost of living increase something that rarely exists in the private sector and second is an allegedly performance based pay increase every one two or three years for employees in the lower steps and less frequent increases for employees in higher steps the bar is very low however for receiving performance based increases all that is necessary is a rating of at least three out of five and employees who receive lower ratings have access to and actively utilize multiple procedural tools to contest their low ratings consequently virtually all federal employees more than 99 9 percent receive performance based pay increases failure to reward high performers in the private sector aside from union negotiated compensation packages performance drives pay that is not so in the federal government although managers can award performance based bonuses on top of the two aforementioned raises these bonuses are limited both in availability and use the 2011 heritage analysis found that less than one quarter of federal pay increases are meaningfully tied to performance 21 failure to penalize poor performers while the federal government does little to incentivize workers to perform their best or to reward those who go beyond their call of duty it also does almost nothing to penalize poor performers in some ways it actually incentivizes poor performers by shifting part of their work to higher performing workers federal managers are supposed to be able to establish performance improvement plans for low performing workers but it is so difficult and time consuming to do so that most federal managers consider it a waste of their time according to a study by the office of personnel management opm almost 80 percent of all federal managers have managed a poorly performing employee but fewer than 15 percent issued less than fully successful ratings for problematic employees and fewer than 8 percent attempted to reassign demote or remove problematic employees 22 among those who attempted action against problematic employees fully 78 percent said their efforts had no effect 23 that means that in a pool of 50 poorly performing federal employees only one will experience any significant consequences it is no wonder that the federal government s annual 0 4 percent firing rate is only one third that of the private sector 24 the federal government s failure to encourage and reward high performance along with its failure to discipline poor performers is a recipe for driving out the most productive employees and retaining the least productive ones that is the exact opposite of what business schools teach and what successful private businesses practice 3 how to bring federal compensation in line with the private sector the impetus for bringing federal compensation in line with that of the private sector is not just to cut costs it is also about improving the effectiveness and accountability of the federal government and turning unproductive resources and practices into productive ones the government can accomplish this by piggybacking on the way private employers respond to market forces hiring and firing procedures the current federal employment system shelters bad employees by forcing managers to navigate an excessively burdensome process that takes a year and a half on average to fire a federal employee 25 consequently the federal government terminated only 0 3 percent of its tenured workforce for performance or misconduct in 2013 26 this results in higher than necessary employment as agencies must hire additional employees to get the job done congress should make dismissing federal employees less difficult by extending the probationary period from one year to three years requiring employees to appeal their dismissal through only one forum instead of the current four lowering the burden of proof necessary to fire federal workers and expediting the dismissal process for hindering threatening abusive or negligent employees the pay scale congress should reduce the pay gap between public and private employees by condensing the within grade pay variance from 30 percent to 20 percent some of the savings from reduced step increases should go towards larger budgets for performance bonuses to help encourage and reward high performers to address the problem of managers giving virtually all employees pay increases congress should only require managers to develop performance improvement plans for workers it wants to fire instead of all those for whom it does not approve a pay increase and it should limit the appeals process for employees who do not receive pay increases shifting from defined benefit to defined contribution retirement benefits with the federal government providing as much as three to four times the level of retirement benefits as the private sector congress should reduce the overall amount of retirement compensation for federal employees additionally the government should shift towards defined contribution benefits that prevent future taxpayers from having to pay for the compensation of past government employees 27 any changes made to retirement benefits should not apply retroactively however as federal employees should receive the retirement benefits they have already earned a better retirement benefit system for taxpayers and employees would include shifting all new and non vested federal employees those with fewer than five years of service into an exclusively defined contribution retirement plan maintaining already accrued benefits for workers with 5 to 24 years of service and allowing them to choose from three options for future benefit accruals and maintaining the existing system for current retirees and for workers with 25 or more years of federal service for new and recent hires the federal government s current 1 percent automatic contribution to workers thrift savings plans tsp would increase to 4 percent and the full match would rise from 5 percent to 8 percent workers with 5 to 24 years of experience could choose one of three options 1 continue to accrue both fers and tsp benefits with a higher employee contribution to fers and other changes to future accruals 2 maintain a frozen fers benefit alongside higher government contributions to the tsp 4 percent automatic and up to an 8 percent match or 3 shift entirely to the tsp by rolling over accrued fers benefits into the tsp and receive higher tsp contributions nothing would change for current retirees or for workers with 25 years or more of federal service in addition to forcing the federal government to incur compensation costs immediately instead of shifting them to future taxpayers defined contribution retirement plans provide workers with actual dollar contributions that they own and control this allows workers to know their value at every point and time and can help individuals to make more informed decisions about their careers and retirement savings also unlike defined benefit plans that are tenure based and can be lost or minimized if workers change jobs workers can carry defined contribution plans from one employer to another without sacrificing any value paid leave the federal government provides significantly more total paid leave than the private sector federal workers with five years of service receive 20 paid vacation days 13 paid sick days and 10 paid holidays for a total of 43 days per year 28 workers in the private sector who have paid leave typically receive 13 paid vacation days 8 paid sick days and 8 paid holidays for a total of 29 days per year 29 the federal government should reduce its paid leave package by about eight days from the current 20 13 10 schedule to 15 10 10 alternatively or as an option it could shift to a paid time off pto allowance of between 16 and 27 days per year depending on tenure workers health insurance benefits the current predominantly percentage based subsidy for federal employees health benefits discourages employees from choosing lower cost health care plans because employees do not realizing most of the savings from choosing lower cost plans congress should eliminate the requirement that employees pay at least 25 percent of their premium costs and instead provide a flat subsidy amount to workers regardless of the plan they choose retirees health insurance benefits in addition to generous health insurance subsidies during employment the federal government extends those subsidies to certain retirees a 2002 study by the cbo estimated the accrual cost of retiree health coverage to equal 6 4 percent of workers pay 30 only 15 percent of private employers provide retiree health benefits the government inequitably provides the retiree health insurance subsidy only to employees who retire directly from the federal government after five or more consecutive years of service leading up to retirement 31 this can prevent older workers from moving out of federal employment and induce federal workers to begin collecting retirement benefits before they might otherwise desire to claim them moreover with a minimum retirement age of only 57 workers can claim these taxpayer financed benefits while working at jobs that otherwise would provide their health insurance resulting in windfall benefits for employers who do not have to pay employees insurance costs the federal government should eliminate the subsidy for retiree health benefits for new hires although this would not generate immediate budgetary savings it would produce significant future savings summary the federal government provides a significant compensation premium to federal workers the actual size of that premium is likely much higher than estimated by the cbo and other studies because the government provides significant compensation thousands and even tens of thousands of dollars in some cases that is not included in any of the formal analyses the federal government s compensation premium not only imposes unnecessary costs on taxpayers its upside down structure and lack of incentives or consequences hinders output and efficiency the private sector offers an efficient model for maximizing productivity and minimizing costs by shifting its compensation structure towards that of the private sector the federal government could better protect taxpayer resources attract and retain

over 2017 we returned more than 92 of that free cash flow to our shareholders in 2018 through share repurchases and dividend exceeding our commitment to return at least 50 of the free cash flow to shareholders and we ended the year with 1 1 billion of cash on the balance sheet revenue on the fourth quarter was down 6 1 at constant currency year over year which was in line with our expectations

share in the a3 product category increasing 3 points year over year and we remain poised to gain share in a4 by expanding our indirect and digital channels we ve also seen good momentum in the high end with iridesse overall there s still more opportunity to capture market share across all our core segments and we will address our strategy to do so at next week s investor day our value to customer derives not just from our core equipment product but from the software and services that support our customer s work processes which we invent and build around our products idc recently named us the clear leader in document services and we won the document imaging software line of the year award from keypoint intelligence buyers lab these awards reflect our leadership position and our broad portfolio of software and services solution to deliver unique and differentiated value to our customers an example of this differentiated value is with purdue university where we are delivering end to end solutions that cover their entire production life cycle we are not only managing the entire fleet of devices across their campus we re also providing production print and communication marketing services including document design consultation and optimization services to help them more effectively communicate with prospective students an important function and support of recruiting top students another key focus is to leverage industry specific assets and integrate them with our core technology to create industry solutions an example here is our recently developed digital

strategy we have created a dedicated business unit focused on driving end to end solutions including software and services to increase our portfolio and extend further into our client base we will share more details at next week s investor day our expertise in technology and printing uniquely positions us to leverage innovation to move into adjacencies that go beyond core technology requirements we have prioritized four areas for innovation disrupting digital packaging and print ai workflow systems for knowledge workers 3d printing digital manufacturing and sensors and services for the internet of things we have a long history of disrupting industries through our technology and innovation and these four areas present long term commercial opportunities for us just this past quarter we will recognize with an idtechex technical development materials award for the printed methane sensor we develop at parc which can detect methane leaks in oil and gas well that contributes significantly to global warming a real world problem for those in the oil and gas industry that we can potentially help address through our sensors technology in the critical area of security we recently introduced new software enhancements to our flagship line of altalink multifunction printers which allows companies to monitor critical security setting and automatically remediate unauthorized changes without having to reboot the device it s a proactive step in stemming security breaches and a critical component in maintaining device uptime our leadership position in this area was recently highlighted by idc as part of our broad range of security services designed to help businesses identify security risks remediate current vulnerability gaps and provide for ongoing management of an adherence to corporate security policies and guidelines you re going to hear us talk a lot more about innovation and you ll get a chance to see firsthand how we are unlocking value by integrating innovation with our core assets at our investor day next week we have further heightened our focus on cash with increased executive oversight and more direct accountability across the organization and it s reflected in our results we had a strong fourth quarter with free cash flow of 398 million and 1 05 billion of free cash flow for the year we ended the year with 1 1 billion in cash after returning to shareholders 92 of our free cash flow for the year between completing the 300 million balance of our 1 billion share repurchase program that was authorized in 2018 and continuing to pay our quarterly dividends we expect to return at least 50 of our free cash flow to shareholders in 2019 also our board authorized an incremental 1 billion share repurchase program the flexibility afforded by this additional authorization our current cash position and our cash flow expectations for 2019 will allow us to opportunistically use our cash to maximize irr we are executing against our strategic initiatives and beginning to see measurable results which positions us well to accelerate our transformation in 2019 i will now turn it over to bill to review in more detail our financial results for the quarter william f osbourn jr executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you john overall we were very pleased with how we finished the year driven by strong margin expansion cash flow above our expectations and growth and adjusted earnings per share of over 10 year over year in line with our expectations revenue declined and faced anticipated headwinds however we more than offset this impact to deliver our best results of the year i will now begin with a review of the income statement in total revenue declined 6 1 at constant currency and 7 8 at actual currency broadly in line with expectations and the directional commentary we gave last quarter total revenue was impacted by almost 1 point from the significant oem declines we ve highlighted in recent quarters as well as headwinds from the benefits in the prior year from the launch of the connectkey portfolio and higher licensing revenue 20 million year over year impact i ll spend more time on the revenue dynamics in the quarter in a moment when i review the revenue slide turning to profitability adjusted operating margin is 16 1 improved to 180 basis points year over year as the decline in revenues was more than offset by cost reductions and productivity improvements the improvement came from a significant 130 basis point improvement in our sag ratio driven by our project own it actions as well as a lower annual performance incentive compensation accrual rd e also contributed 20 basis points to year over year margin expansion we captured cost savings and overhead and within mature product sustaining engineering that more than offset increases in spend within our research centers and incubation programs in support of our innovation growth areas gross margin of 40 was lower by 30 basis points year over year a good result considering the prior year included an approximate 100 basis point combined benefit from the higher licensing revenue and the change in consumables usage estimate also contributing to the improvement in margin with higher equity income which increased 18 million year over year on an adjusted basis drivers of the equity income improvement included benefits to fuji xerox from the recent costs actions turning to the below the line items adjusted other expenses net of 32 million was 3 million worse year over year driven by higher currency losses adjusted tax rate of 27 9 increased 1 8 points year over year resulting in a negative approximate 0 02 impact to eps overall adjusted eps of 1 14 was up 0 11 from the fourth quarter of 2017 on a gaap basis we had 0 56 of earnings per share which was up 1 34 as the prior year included a 400 million charge associated with enactment of the us tax act a partial offset to the tax act charge from a year over year compare perspective was a 43 million charge we took this quarter associated with early termination of an unfavorable it services arrangement the difference between gaap and adjust eps also includes our normal adjustments around restructuring and related costs including those for fuji xerox non service retirement related costs and amortization of intangible assets moving on to revenue in q4 as anticipated we faced revenue headwinds associated with a challenging compare as most will recall the prior year benefited from the full impact of the connectkey product rollout so while the 6 1 constant currency decline was worse in trend it was in line with our expectations i will now break down in more detail the revenue drivers looking first at the geographic sales channels north america revenues were down 4 9 at constant currency driven by weakness in large enterprise accounts and high end sales that were partially offset by growth in xerox business solutions formerly gis as well as indirect channel equipment sales growth international revenue declined 3 2 at constant currency within that europe s decline rate improve driven by equipment revenue while developing markets grew total revenue for the 10th quarter in a row on a year over year basis although equipment revenue was pressured reflecting in part a very challenging compare our highest area of decline was in other driven by the oem business which as highlighted had almost 1 point negative impact to total revenue turning now to a closer look at equipment revenue our equipment revenue declined 7 7 at constant currency with a negative 3 point impact from oem as we indicated last quarter we anticipated a more challenging equipment revenue comparing q4 given the strength we saw in q4 of 2017 when equipment revenue grew 1 5 driven by the connectkey launch in a strong year end within the high end area from an product perspective entry equipment revenue made up 11 of equipment in q4 and was up to 0 2 at constant currency driven by growth in europe and us indirect channels for the full year entry grew 2 at constant currency driven by connectkey products this compared to a decline in 2017 of 0 4 mid range equipment revenue comprised 66 of equipment revenue and declined 1 2 in constant currency mid range equipment sale have been an area of strength the past two quarters as reflected in the 3 points of year over year equipment revenue share gain we realized in both q2 and q3 and for the full year mid range grew 1 1 constant currency this compared to a decline in 2017 of 8 1 mid range or a3 is a key leadership segment for xerox and we are pleased with the relative strength we ve seen in the segment during 2018 lastly our results in the high end were pressured high end equipment revenue made up 22 of total equipment revenue and declined 14 7 at constant currency and for the full year was down 10 5 at constant currency we continue to see strong demand for our new iridesse press especially in europe were 48 of installs for either a new business or competitive tradings as well as initial good traction from an upgrade announced in october to our brenva press that included a 50 speed improvement and resulted in our highest quarterly brenva installs to date this growth however was not enough to offset declines in other portions of the portfolio including our igen family we are actively working plans to turnaround the high end including building on strong momentum and differentiate capabilities of iridesse and the recently upgraded brenva as well as making sales covers investments and leveraging more effectively unique features and products like igen with it s white dry ink turning now to post sale post sale revenue comprised 75 of total revenue and declined 5 5 at constant currency or down 4 6 excluding the prior year licensing revenue discussed earlier which is largely consistent with a 4 8 september year to date constant currency decline as mentioned before it will take time to turnaround the post sale revenue which tends to move in smaller increments as it is less transactional in nature and thus will rely on us rebuilding our population of devices including through penetrating more underrepresented areas such as smb and by expanding our client offerings to close out our revenue discussion managed document services comprised 35 of total revenue and declined 1 7 at constant currency driven by declines in equipment revenue reflecting lower signings in recent periods positives include continued growth in partner print services to the smb market as well as a sequential improvement in the renewal rate to 85 this quarter this represented the best renewal rate of the past few quarters and above the 2017 average of 84 so a good result important to note that despite the better renewal rate we had two factors it drove lower signings in the quarter first a lower renewal opportunity even if we had signed 100 of all deals renewal signings would still have been down 6 year over year in the quarter this reflects in part greater controls we have put in place around not prematurely pushing early renewals second within the us we saw a handful of deals with decision delays that result in them rolling into 2019 signings overall are becoming less meaningful measure as mds growth shifts to the indirect channels and as we transition more territories to xbs formerly gis where they have different measurement factors a week from today at our investor day we will provide details on the revenue initiatives we are deploying in 2019 to improve the top line however it is important to note that we have realistic expectations about the path to improvement and our eps and cash flow guidance in 2019 does not rely on better revenue trends turning now for a closer look at xerox s profitability performance adjusted operating margin of 16 1 increased 180 basis points year over year while adjusted eps of 1 14 increased 0 11 year over year both very positive results the point to the progress we re making and beginning to simplify our operations and reengineer our cost base looking at the profitability walk year over year within our operations we were able to more than offset the impact of revenue declines as well as a more challenging compare given the prior year included an approximate 100 basis point margin and 0 09 eps benefit from one time items associated with a licensing deal and a consumables usage estimate change that i called out earlier so significant margin expansion driven by our second half project own it actions that john covered the remaining 70 basis points of margin improvement came from the increase in equity income this resulted in approximate 0 07 benefit to eps i would like to note when i go through the 2019 guidance you will see that we will be changing for 2019 our definition of adjusted operating margin to no longer include equity income we believe this change will give a more accurate view of our operations performance and will be more analogous to how others calculate operating margin in terms of unique factors impacting adjusted eps there were two worth calling out a year over year negative impact of approximately 0 04 coming from a higher adjusted tax rate of 27 9 versus 26 1 in q4 of 2017 and a slightly higher adjusted other net driven by exchange losses more than offsetting this was an approximate 0 07 benefit from lower shares driven by the 700 million of share repurchases we did in the second half of 2018 so very positive results on profitability that i will share in a moment give us confidence going into 2019 turning out the cash flow operating cash flow was a source of 415 million in the quarter and as john shared that put us at 1 14 billion for the full year of 2018 a growth of 168 million on an adjusted basis year over year and above our full year guidance of between 1 billion and 1 1 billion likewise free cash flow of 1 05 billion for the full year of 2018 increased 183 million on an adjusted basis year over year and was above our guidance of 900 million to 1 billion to note the adjustments referenced are to give an accurate year over year compare the 2017 cash flow was significantly impacted by a number of factors including incremental voluntary pension contributions and determination of certain accounts receivable sale programs that resulted in negative full year cash flow on a reported basis in 2017 we have a reconciliation in the non gaap section of our materials that shows these adjustments so strong 2018 cash flow driven by our second half performance on cash flow i believe it s best to view performance on a full year basis given timing factors key drivers in 2018 were benefits of working capital from inventory improvements that on an absolute basis were more than offset by lower approvals related to headcount reductions lower annual performance incentive compensation and retiree health despite this negative 85 million year over year accrual impact working capital still improved and was less of a use by 13 million versus 2017 restructuring payments of 170 million which was lower by 50 million from the prior year s 220 million driven by geographic mix of actions as well as changes to our restructuring policy and benefits pension contributions of 144 million significantly lower than the prior year when we made incremental voluntary contribution of 500 million we believe this year s contribution level is more indicative of what we would anticipate in the future finance receivables were source of 166 million roughly in line with 2017 and reflects lower originations and the move we have seen over time of sales to channels with lower internal financing penetration we anticipate finance receivables will continue to be a source of cash flow of approximately 125 million in 2019 lastly capex for the year was 90 million 15 million lower year over year reflecting in part a temporary pause in some investments as new management redirects resources to implement its new strategic direction we do anticipate higher capex in 2019 associated with our project own it implementation as well as revenue initiatives that we will outline in more detail at our investor day next week if we turn to the next slide i ll speak to our capital structure we ended the fourth quarter with 5 2 billion of debt and 1 1 billion of cash on the balance sheet we breakdown debt between finance and core by first calculating the financing debt by applying 7 to 1 leverage to our financing assets finance receivables and equipment on operating leases with the remaining debt assumed to be in support of our core business in q4 this calculation results in assumed financing debt of 3 4 billion and core debt of 1 8 billion as the debt ladder shows we have two maturities in 2019 one in march of approximately 400 million and one in december of approximately 600 million our core net debt was 700 million as of year end and we target to maintain our core leverage at approximately 2 times free cash flow we are under that level now and thus do not see any immediate requirement to reduce our debt levels we have access to a number of capital sources as well as ample liquidity to handle upcoming maturities another important element of our capital structure is our pension assets and liabilities as of december 31 2018 our net unfunded position was 1 2 billion which compares to 1 4 billion as of the end of 2017 and 2 2 billion as of the end of 2016 and it includes approximately 775 million of unfunded pension liabilities which by design do not get funded from a funding perspective we believe we are well positioned to have a stable level of pension contributions over time if we move to the next slide i will review our financial guidance for 2019 as john indicated we made good progress at the end of 2018 on our strategic initiatives and we are well positioned to drive improvement in our business in 2019 let me quickly take you through the numbers for revenue our guidance is a decline of approximately 5 at constant currency with an approximate 1 point of currency headwinds i want to be clear we are targeting to do better than the 4 9 decline in 2018 however we have built our guidance on the assumption that 2019 will be in the same range as 2018 for adjusted operating margin we expect benefits for project own it will drive 100 basis points to 150 basis points of margin expansion to put us in the range of 12 6 and 13 1 from the 11 6 adjusted operating margin in 2018 as indicated earlier these fingers reflect the new definition of adjusted operating margin we are adopting in 2019 that will exclude equity income to more clearly reflect our operational performance for adjusted eps we are guiding to be between 3 70 and 3 80 which at the minimum is a growth of 7 year over year on a gaap basis we expect eps of at least 2 60 and 2 70 the difference between gaap and adjust eps includes our normal adjustments around restructuring and related costs including those of fuji xerox non service retirement related costs and amortization of intangibles we continue to expect strong free cash flow and are guiding free cash flow to be in the range of 1 billion to 1 1 billion which assumes approximately 150 million of capex from a capital allocation perspective we remain committed to return at least 50 of our free cash flow back to shareholders as such we are planning for approximately 250 million in dividends which assumes no change to our quarterly common dividend of 0 25 per share and for at least 300 million in share repurchases we also announced today an increase of 1 billion to our repurchase authorization which gives us flexibility to opportunistically increase our share repurchases as we said before the time and pace of repurchases will be dictated by an evaluation of relative returns which leaves between 450 million and 550 million of unallocated free cash flow the use of which we will evaluate opportunistically as we go through 2019 we will provide further context around all of these guide figures during our investor day in a week as well as our three year 2019 to 2021 financial expectations i will now hand it back to john for some closing comments before we go into q a john visentin vice chairman and chief executive officer thanks bill to wrap up we close the year strong growing adjusted eps 10 expanding adjusted operating margin 180 basis points and delivering over 1 05 billion in free cash flow 92 of which we returned to shareholders we ve laid a good foundation for 2019 and we look forward to our investor day on february 5th where we can share more details on our strategy on longer term financial plans we will now open the line for questions jennifer jennifer horsley vice president investor relations thanks john before we get to the q a with john and bill i will point out that we have posted on our xerox investor relations website a full set of earnings materials as well as supplemental schedules to provide you with an overview of our fourth quarter earnings operator please open the line for questions now questions and answers operator thank you ma am operator instructions and our first question will come from the line of ananda baruah with loop capital your line is now open ananda baruah loop capital analyst hi good morning guys thanks for taking the question and thanks for all the information i guess a few for me if i could at least a couple i m trying to say because it will take too long but could you guys just quickly go through what you saw at the marketplace with regards to impact ph on impact from macro it sounds like bill you hinted that there may have been some push outs and then just would love to get your context on what the competitive marketplace looks like as well just to start off and i have some specific xerox specific questions thanks william f osbourn jr executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah thanks ananda just a couple of points we did point to there were a few large new business signings that were pushed out in the q1 we expect those to still be signed within q1 from an overall marketplace perspective one thing about terms the impact of the government shutdown for the 30 plus days has some impact on us obviously from our government accounts about of third of our government accounts were impacted we estimate that the post sale revenues under our management services consumables et cetera was about would be about 4 million a month on post sales so it s a number not a big number but it would have had some impact but overall we gave our guidance and expectations as far as what s going into 2019 our revenues guidance being down mid single digits are 5 at constant currency and our other guidance measures are not dependent upon a significant improvement in revenue year over year ananda baruah loop capital analyst and with the deals that got pushed out were those a3 deals will those include high end deals as well of the high end portfolio as well william f osbourn jr executive vice president and chief financial officer both the ones i was primarily referring to were large managed print services deals that include significant amount of a3s and i mean like so we fully expect those to be signed in q4 i mean q1 sorry q1 2019 ananda baruah loop capital analyst okay great appreciate it and then i ll just deal with one follow up here just could you i know you re going to talk about this next week but just to kind of set us up for a with own it could you just kind of give us some context around the order of operations for the various kind of transformational initiatives how should we expect you guys i know you re already under way but like how are you layering into it kind of combination of revenue initiatives and cost initiated supply chain and which will come sort of more toward the front end here and which will be the ones that you ll get to kind of as you go to it later on thanks a lot john visentin vice chairman and chief executive officer ananda we ll ananda it s john so we ll detail it next week and we ll show you the whole project own it on all the different areas of how we re redesigning all our different layers all our different organizations and what you re going to see next week is what the outcome will be not only for 2019 but also for 2020 and 2021 so you ll get a lot more in detail next week at our investor day ananda baruah loop capital analyst okay great appreciate it thank you jennifer horsley vice president investor relations thanks ananda operator can we have the next question operator our next question will come from line of shannon cross of cross research your line is now open shannon cross cross research analyst thank you very much i guess my first question john is can you talk a bit about your thoughts on cash usage and not necessarily just 2019 i know we re asking all these questions you re going to address next week but we have to try so when you look at the cash flow obviously xerox is a high cash flowing business it doesn t appear that you need to spend that much in terms of restructuring next year i think it was like 225 million at least in terms of the eps bridge so are you looking to acquisitions are you looking for a way to sort of reverse the revenue decline inorganically as well as organically i guess i m just trying to figure out you can squeeze for so long on the cost side but then how do you sort of ride the ship in terms of the top line john visentin vice chairman and chief executive officer yes so what i would say shannon is what you ll see next week is not just the cost side but also where we will be making investments and clearly cash is one of our clear focuses and we ve already signalled that we will be over 1 billion in 2019 and you ll see our 2020 and 2021 guidance as well and look we re going to use our cash on what gives us the best irr and we re looking at all the different options and next week we re going to detail on our revenue where we will be doing investments and where we see revenue in terms of growth and all that in the next three years so shannon cross cross research analyst okay and then can you talk a bit about the leasing business i don t know bill if you want to take that but just in terms of your thoughts on leasing how core it is i know you ve been sort of looking at options around it it looks like there s going to be some finance receivable run off that benefits cash flow this year so i m just curious as to keep it solid expand it how you re thinking about it william f osbourn jr executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so we don t specifically comment on anything regarding strategic alternatives but the leasing business in particular we re very pleased with it s a profitable business for us it s integrated as part of our offerings to customers even though we were downgraded below investment grade we re still able to operate the business efficiently and profitably and overall we re very pleased with it shannon cross cross research analyst okay thank you look forward technical difficulty next week john visentin vice chairman and chief executive officer thanks shannon jennifer horsley vice president investor relations thanks shannon operator next question operator thank you our next question will come from line of jim suva with citi your line is now open jim suva citigroup analyst thanks very much thus far the call and the slide you talked a lot about project own it which sounds quite compelling a lot of focus and maybe it s just my hearing was more on the cost side and then even if it was on the revenue side when we look at the revenues it looks like there is literally no stabilization from the past two years by your actions so can you help us understand about why the focus isn t on revenues or any improvement at all on revenues john visentin vice chairman and chief executive officer yeah i would say jim first and foremost we have a full court press on driving revenue before 2019 guidance we re not relying on revenue to actually guide on the eps and the cash flow and in the margins and the other numbers that said what you re going to see next week is a detailed strategic plan on revenue and revenue growth and how do we get there and what are the plans we ve put in place project own it well project own it allowed us to do is not just simplify our business but it also allowed us to have the space to reinvest in areas that can help us with driving revenue and growth and we re going to take you through all that in detail next week william f osbourn jr executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i would only add that jim clearly we want to improve the revenue trajectory on the constant currency basis the last 2017 and 2018 and our guidance for 2019 in the zone of the 4 5 to 5 range so it s stabilized at that 4 5 to 5 down at constant currency but it s clearly we want to change that trajectory going forward jim suva citigroup analyst great thanks so much for the details jennifer horsley vice president investor relations thanks jim operator next question operator thank you our next question will come from the line of katy huberty with morgan stanley your line is open katy huberty morgan stanley analyst thank you good morning if you included the indirect channel what would signings have been in the quarter in terms of rate of decline and how should we think about the weaker signings in 2018 translating into a revenue trend for that business this year and then i have a follow up william f osbourn jr executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah thanks katy so the indirect channel it s actually hard to get accurate data on that especially when you re dealing with partners we have some internal measures that we get it s not we re not comfortable enough in disclosing that on a regular basis but that s part of the reason why we look at signings as a meaningful number going forward to continue disclosing it primarily represents our enterprise business which is the more mature part of the managed print services which has been declining but from our internal measures the smb part which includes a lot of mps business through indirect channels is growing upwards of low double digits in recent quarters katy huberty morgan stanley analyst okay thank you and then just a couple of clarifications on the eps guide it looks like you re not assuming a share count reduction in the eps range is that because 300 million of spend just offsets dilution or should we expect that ultimately share counts should come down in the year end that just as a follow up same line of questioning what are you assuming in terms of debt pay down and any interest expense reduction in the eps guidance if anything william f osbourn jr executive vice president and chief financial officer share repurchase couple of things so we will have the flow through effect of the 700 million of share repurchases done in the second half of 18 and the benefit of that flowing through to 2019 and you are correct that at least 300 million that we said we would do as part of our proposed capital allocation at 2019 we did not include that benefit in the adjusted eps guidance as you know the timing of it the amounts could be lumpy it could be weighted toward the back end so we did not include that potential benefit in our eps guidance for 2019 as far as the debt we will be refinancing the 1 billion of debt that s coming due during 2019 400 million in march and other 600 million in december our liquidity that we have whether it s a cash on balance sheet the 1 8 billion revolver allows us flexibility in timing as far as interest expense with the downgrade from investment grade we ve estimated that probably specifically because we had one debt issuance that had coupon steps in it and also it causes our undrawn upon revolver to cost more to be about 5 million or so more on a full year basis of debt cost katy huberty morgan stanley analyst that s perfect thank you jennifer horsley vice president investor relations great thanks katy operator is there any other questions operator ma am that was our last question i m sorry we actually just had paul coster from jp morgan queue up jennifer horsley vice president investor relations thank you operator you re welcome paul your line is now open chung j p morgan securities analyst hi this is chung ph on for coster thanks for taking my questions on the mid range you had a tough comp there but it performed pretty well what s driving the momentum there and then on the high end same thing but did you see more push outs in that segment relative to others and then are you seeing more competition on the high end william f osbourn jr executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah hey paul it s bill so yeah on the mid range is we are very pleased with our market share and we ve increased by 3 points each of the last couple of quarters and significant market share improvement really since the connectkey launch that occurred in the second half of 2017 so we re very pleased there on the high end we are still the market leader our market leader there in market share and we re very pleased with that but it s an area that we clearly believe there are parts we can improve upon we do have some products enhancements that are going to be announced later in the year that we believe will help and specifically iridesse has done really well for us but it s just has not been enough to offset other parts of the high end portfolio chung j p morgan securities analyst okay and then my follow up is on restructuring charges it looks like they re on track for 200 million again for the fourth consecutive year so when can we expect the drop off on these kind of recurring charges longer term thank you william f osbourn jr executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so a couple of comments on restructuring charges first of all going back to 2018 it was around 170 million which was a decline from 2017 but a couple of things if you look into in the restructuring charges we actually given the geographies and the change in our restructuring severance policies et cetera that we were able to do more for the lower dollar amounts in 2018 there is a fair amount plan deficiencies that we have coming forward so we ve estimated continued 200 million will go out to the outer years and we ll talk about that further at investor day next week but 200 million is our best estimate at this point for 2019 jennifer horsley vice president investor relations thanks paul john do you have any last comments to close john visentin vice chairman and chief executive officer yes well thank you everybody and look at our investor day next week you ll hear more about our overall strategy our long term financial outlook and our plan to stabilize and grow revenue in new and existing markets you ll also see firsthand some of the innovations that will enable us to expand beyond our core technology so i look forward to hosting you at the event next week thank you operator ladies and gentlemen thank you

by independenttrader insiders run off the market during the last decade we have experienced many market manipulations in order to inflate share prices of mostly large companies one of these suspicious activities are buybacks which volume rises year by year starting from 2009 within last 12 months the so called share repurchases reached their all time high the reason behind that was mainly due to the corporate tax reform where corporate tax and tax on foreign income were decreased significantly it is worth recalling that the buyback is the process where a company buys its own outstanding shares to reduce the number of shares available on the market after repurchase the shares are usually canceled according to the companies quarterly filings in the first 3 quarters of 2018 s p 500 companies bought back shares amounting to 583 4 billion dollars giving 52 6 growth in compare to the same period in 2017 as a result of that process the number of shares in turnover decreased at least by 4 in 18 of s p 500 companies which also inflated prices of those shares in 2019 buybacks are expected to reach roughly 770 800 billion dollars this process has a huge influence on stock prices which is clearly showed on the graph below red line represents s p 500 index blue and green bars represent buybacks and dividends of s p 500 companies respectively this chart illustrates strong correlation between s p 500 and buybacks beginning from 2003 in the recent years the most active in buybacks were tech companies during the first 3 quarters of 2018 companies known for having the largest amount of cash apple alphabet microsoft oracle and cisco burned more than 115 billion dollars which is almost 20 of all us buybacks furthermore the pace of share repurchasing is expected to increase in 2019 to as much as 940 billion dollars which would be a 22 growth relative to 2018 apple as clear example of wasting capital apple is known as the most aggresive purchaser of its own shares it is even more evident since the us corporate tax reform came into play in first 3 quarters of 2018 they spent 62 9 billion dollars for share repurchases averagely quoted 222 07 dollars near the peak now when we write this article the stock price of apple is around 155 dollars which gives more than 10 billion completely wasted dollars on buybacks this irrational activitivty seems to be impossible to explain but this is not a coincidence within many us companies it is well known behaviour in order to help insiders get rid of overvalued stocks they first initiate extremely huge buybacks in order to inflate the share price and in the meantime they sell their own shares on premium it hasn t to be mentioned how much it adversely affects on shareholders and companies in the long run the above graph explains insider moves of apple during the last 3 years it is clearly showed that no one of apple employees bought companies shares they rather massively sell them good example is ceo of apple tim cook who received a bonus of 560 thousands apple shares after a few days of receiving them he sold them all getting 121 5 million dollars as we mentioned before many companies act in that way here we have more examples 1 apple in the second and third quarter of 2018 bought back shares worth 41 3 billion dollars during this time insiders sold shares worth 199 million dollars 2 oracle in the second and third quarter of 2018 bought back shares worth 15 3 billion dollars during this time insiders sold shares worth 128 million dollars 3 the unitedhealth group in the second and third quarter of 2018 bought back shares worth 3 7 billion dollars during this time insiders sold shares worth 44 5 million dollars it is worth noting that these huge amounts of money reached only narrow group of people the so called high level management of the companies sad truth about buybacks despite of the highly overvalued stock prices insiders still use buybacks sometimes this happens due to availability of the cheap credit which is later used for share repurchases instead of using cash herbalife is a great example the company was issuing debt in order to buy back their shares which almost resulted in a bankruptcy of course insiders motives to do that are strong insiders remunerations are linked to the share prices so when the prices go up they are happy however when the share price is falling management is not opting for buybacks anymore in this case no one wants to explain before the ceo why did he risk companies money for buying back shares when the price could fall more instead of investing in research and development or mergers and acquisitions in reality in order to care about shareholders and to keep sustainable long term growth they should not trigger buybacks after a few years of price improvement they should do that after significant drop in price and in the best case 1 5 years since the beginning of the bear market unfortunately this is usually not the case greed and the lust for money is always directing investors and management behaviour which is adversely affecting companies in the long term the example below perfectly shows this this graph illustrates in which months of the year over the last decade the companies repurchased their shares to the largest extent the sum of all months is 100 it shows that august and november are the most intense periods when it comes to buybacks we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us the next chart depicts u s corporate insiders stock sales in 2017 and 2018 the above data explains that managers sold the most stocks in november 2017 and august 2018 in each month reaching 10 billion dollars this is an average of 450 milion dollars a day do you see any relationship between both charts in august 2018 buybacks were triggered by the record share prices and the influence of buybacks on share prices helped to sell the stocks for insiders at the fastest pace since a dozen of months insiders know their companies like no other and ususally when something is wrong or the stock prices are overvalued they get rid of them they were right again later on as we know stock markets experienced from 10 to 20 drops in prices another proof of the disruptive behavior of insiders is the study of robert j jackson jr a former law professor member of the security exchange commision sec in the first quarter of 2018 he examined 385 listed companies of the s p 500 index which in 2017 have announced buybacks two main conclusions based on his work are as follows 1 the percentage of insiders selling their shares doubled immediately after the company announced buybacks in turn the daily value of shares sold by insiders increased from 100 thousands dollars a day before the announcement of buybacks to 500 thousands dollars after the company announced the buybacks they ve made 75 million dollars more than they would have earned if they sold the shares before the buybacks were announced in the case of 32 of companies surveyed by jackson at least one of the insiders sold their shares within the first 10 days after the company announced the buybacks 2 in the days preceding the announcement of buybacks by the companies their stock prices were lower than s p 500 by 1 4 on average however within 30 days after the announcement of buybacks share prices were higher than s p 500 by 2 5 on average conclusion management greed led them to spent huge amount of savings from the corporate tax reform on buybacks nowadays this is a typical form of increasing the managment wealth with only temporary benefits to shareholders management remuneration is strongly linked to the share price in a direct or indirect way they own stocks or options on stocks however share repurchases help to sell the stocks for insiders in the way that no one may notice this also affects the wealth of the rest of society mostly the middle class the above chart shows distribution of household wealth in the us since 1917 orange line represents share of 90 bottom and blue line illustrates share of top 0 1 in 70s when the gold standard was abandoned there was a huge difference between both groups since then it all started to change and in 2015 both had the same share in us wealth you will probably look for a relation between the article and the chart namely most insiders which increase their wealth on buybacks are the part of the top 0 1 group those from the bottom 90 rather does not own stocks thus considering the intensity of buybacks nowadays the top 0 1 group for sure has more wealth than the bottom 90 therefore we can conclude 1 expansionary monetary policy of central banks and capital expenditure on buybacks instead of investments by corporates lead to increase wealth of those who owns financial assets like bonds and stocks in such a way the share of wealth of the richest is rising incredibly fast 2 this is a process of fooling dumb money to let them buying stocks let s put it on the table american german and many other economies give signs of a becoming slowdown management is aware what is going on and run off the market in this environment when buybacks supports the share prices they give a sign that everything is ok and this is a good time to buy shares in such a way it will be impossible to solve the problems regarding the wealth inequality in our opinion one potential solution could be a tax reform which encourage companies to increase their capital expenditure on investments throughout more expansion reaching new markets will allow to increase real employment which will lead to increase in real wages the average person will receive more money and will spend more part of his salary on goods and services instead of letting insiders gain on artificially inflated share prices in that case the velocity of money will actually improve however there is a problem which could slow the mechanism mentioned above which is high debt to maintain balances in the economy sometimes inefficient companies have to go bankrupt this is an integral part of capitalism but this natural mechanism cannot work with the existence of large stimulus from central banks like quantitative easing which does not allow the economy to regulate itself independent trader team

leading priority of our administration is economic growth and expansion jobs and opportunity we are making considerable progress but there is still much work to do we will be relentless in boosting growth jobs and opportunity according to the latest estimates by the international monetary fund the bahamas is projected to score annual growth to the tune of 2 3 percent for 2018 in 2019 the imf estimates growth of 2 1 percent this is the first time in 12 years and the first time since the great recession of 2008 that the bahamas has enjoyed projected growth of more than 2 0 percent for two consecutive years this is a milestone but we need even more robust growth to bring down unemployment across the board expanding our economy is a key to growth i fully understand the economic anxieties of so many bahamians tonight i want to provide you with more details on our aggressive growth and opportunity agenda while the unemployment rate increased from 10 percent to 10 7 percent from may to november 2018 the country is making progress this is seen in the fact that the number of discouraged workers decreased by 6 7 percent this indicates that more bahamians have confidence in the countryâ s economic recovery more people are actively looking for work overall employment has increased by 2 305 jobs i am pleased that the jobless rates in grand bahama and abaco have improved the jobless rate in grand bahama is down from 12 4 percent to 11 9 percent this is the first time since 2008 the year of the great recession that the employment rate is below 12 percent the number of discouraged workers also fell in grand bahama to a rate of 9 8 percent while this is very good news the jobless rate in grand bahama is still way too high it must come down even more we have a comprehensive and aggressive agenda to boost growth and jobs in grand bahama including transforming the island into a technology hub the jobless rate in abaco has come down from 10 7 percent to 7 7 percent this is considerable progress we are also focusing on boosting growth and employment throughout our family islands this includes more infrastructure on a number of islands including aviation infrastructure improvements and new airports to be developed on north eleuthera exuma and long island new providenceâ s unemployment rate increased from 10 percent to 11 percent we still have lots of work to do on new providence as more people are entering and reentering the job market while youth unemployment decreased from 24 1 percent in may to 23 1 percent in november this is still a major and persistent problem fellow bahamians and residents tourism remains by far our leading economic sector growth and economic expansion requires diversification generally including more diversification within the tourism sector some years ago a leading hotelier operating in the bahamas was at a conference in another caribbean country where there was concern about what the opening of cuba would mean for the region his reply wait till the bahamas really opens up and see what that will mean for tourism in the bahamas his point was that the bahamas has considerable untapped potential it is important for us to understand the many strategic advantages and the tremendous bounty and resources which make up the islands of the bahamas canadian astronaut chris hadfield once noted â from space the bahamas is the most beautiful place on earth â to offer you some geographical perspective the bahamas archipelago encompasses an area of over 100 000 square miles and extends over 500 miles from north to south with over 700 islands and thousands of cays and rocks we have a land area of approximately 5 382 square miles and approximately 2 200 miles of coastline our far flung archipelago with a number of major islands and many hundreds of cays and islands extends from north to south approximately the same geographic length from the northern to the southern end of great britain our great challenge and even greater opportunity is the sustainable development of our entire archipelago with multiple and diverse tourism enterprises and experiences across the bahamas toward this end our tourism numbers including the more lucrative stopover market are improving air arrivals increased by 16 5 for the year through september 2018 as the upward trend in international arrivals since october 2017 continued through 2018 preliminary stopover numbers for the year through october 2018 stood at 1 33m a 10 4 increase over the same period in the previous year with an average length of stay of 6 7 nights expedia reported a 32 increase in room night sales for the bahamas and a 22 increase in gross hotel bookings year on year for the period january through november 2018 arrivals from the us which continue to be the destinationâ s largest source market grew by 10 7 year on year for the period january through october the outlook remains favourable for continued growth in air arrivals with bookings for the first quarter of 2019 forecast to be ahead by 10 3 for international arrivals international airlift capacity increased by almost 9 8 in december with air seat capacity from the usa and canada scheduled to increase by 21 0 and 19 9 respectively in the first quarter of this year i also note that in order to boost tourism from china the ministry of tourism conducted a very successful outreach mission to china the ministry of tourism will launch a new branding campaign this year the first in six years to take advantage of our untapped potential in tourism there are new hotel and resort projects under development throughout the bahamas on new providence these include a 100 room condominium hotel and marina at the pointe by margaritaville and a 118 unit condo hotel project by the wynn group at gold blossom on west bay street tourism developmental projects that are expected to come on stream on new providence are the sterling hurricane hole community resort and marina and the rose island community resort and marina the sterling hurricane hole community resort and marina is a 250 million mixed use development which will include residential retail and professional office space and a renovated marina over the next five years the development is projected to provide 3 000 construction jobs there are also a number of large scale new providence based bahamian owned tourism projects which include paradise island lighthouse and beach club athol island entertainment facility and the heritage tourism project the owners of the heritage tourism project are a group of bahamian businessmen their objective is upgrading and operating several historical sites transforming them into major attractions for the bahamians and the international tourism market this represents greater bahamian ownership in the tourism sector this promises to be a significant advancement in promoting bahamian culture and heritage as a part of our enhanced visitor experience and tourism product through a new tourism development corporation we will provide incentives for bahamians in heritage tourism through the corporation we will also help in the development of a broad variety of tourism products and services a significant development that will help to expand and to grow the economy in new providence is the proposed public private partnership for the management upgrade and expansion of the port of nassau which has gone to tender the ambitious project aims to provide for the development of expanded berthing capacity a new arrivals terminal and associated harbor front facilities improvements this major undertaking will tie in to the long awaited and ongoing redevelopment of downtown nassau in the redevelopment of prince george wharf the government will continue to own the wharf but taxpayer dollars will not be used in its transformation the redevelopment of downtown nassau must go from east to west and from north to south the old main post office building will be demolished to make way for new supreme court complex and supporting officers which will help in the revitalization of downtown the new central bank will be constructed on the old victoria property just as with other urban centers around the world the long term revitalization of downtown nassau will require residential properties for bahamians and residents which is necessary for the growth of other businesses such as restaurants shops convenience stores and other commercial enterprises but in the short and medium term i have directed the ministry of tourism and aviation and the ministry of works and other agencies to present a plan as soon as possible to begin to immediately beautify and clean up bay street in addition to my personal observances many bahamians have reported to me how appalled they are by the state of downtown i will have more to say on this on another occasion fellow bahamians and residents the recent bilateral meeting i had in brussels on financial services with european commission officials was very constructive accompanying me were several industry members the meeting provided the bahamas with a significant opportunity to ensure the commission fully understands the scope of the efforts we are taking to adhere to global standards the government is doing everything it can in cooperation with industry stakeholders and in keeping with our national interests to protect this important industry as the industry continues to evolve in light of external circumstances we will work with the financial services sector to identify those areas of specialization for which the bahamas can place its stamp on the world fellow bahamians and residents our growth and expansion agenda includes a dynamic mix of bahamian and foreign direct investment since mid 2017 our government has approved an estimated 3 7 billion of foreign investment projects many of these projects once approved immediately contracted bahamian firms for legal accounting project management engineering environmental architectural consulting and other professional services the success in foreign direct investment is due in part to the increase of information communication technology enterprises and boutique financial services investments as companies look to make the bahamas their regional headquarters for the caribbean new providence received 55 percent of the inward flows of foreign direct investment since 2017 this includes the approval of a number financial services companies and a number of back office administrative firms approved including baptist health international services citgo petroleum and the disargo group of companies to increase bahamian and international partnerships and foreign direct investment we will restructure the bahamas investment authority by establishing a promotional arm of the authority this promotional arm will be critical for economic expansion and growth it will facilitate investment promotion tours with participation of both private and public stakeholders fellow bahamians and residents i travel to the family islands every chance i get our archipelago of islands is a major strategic economic advantage which require enormous investments in terms of infrastructure including air and marine transport networks we must have a broad and compelling vision for economic and national development let me give you an example of the bounty and breadth of our archipelago of possibilities in some ways we are as much a region as we are a country great inagua in terms of square miles is larger than the islands of dominica st kitts and antigua combined andros is one of the largest islands in the caribbean if you fly in a jet from grand bahama to inagua your trip will take one hour and 35 minutes it is a distance of approximately 500 miles by comparison the distance from nassau to jamaica is 450 miles that flight would be 15 minutes shorter at one hour and twenty minutes eighty percent of our tourism activity and 70 percent of our population is found on the two percent of our land that of new providence and paradise island the other 98 percent of our far flung archipelago have all of these same fundamental assets but remain largely underdeveloped with this abundance of gifts government alone cannot develop our archipelago in the diversity of sectors required for economic growth and expansion the role of government is to help provide the bahamian people and international partners with the incentives to develop the islands of the bahamas to expand and grow our economy now and for a better future for all bahamians will require the sustainable development of our family of islands and cays toward this end i wish to note a number of developments we are actively exploring the opportunity to establish a transshipment port in mayaguana in the southern bahamas which will only make the port in grand bahama even stronger the owners of the highly successful bahamas stripping group of companies which got its start through incentives by a previous fnm administration will develop poultry farms and processing plants on north andros and eleuthera and through a distribution center on new providence we will promote family island and rural development with the same intensity and focus that have been historically applied to new providence and grand bahama this year we will roll out several key agriculture investment projects in this sector on several islands especially andros eleuthera and grand bahama we will invest in strengthening agricultural infrastructure inclusive of farm feed roads and facilitating access to power and water in farming areas we are equally committed to developing an integrated agriculture eco system where farmers will have access to insurance and access to cost effective inter island transportation inclusive of refrigeration as a matter of urgency we will increase access to credit and additional funding to bahamians in this sector while increasing the access of producers to local and international markets in terms of international investment the family islands are attracting tens of millions of dollars and significant projects to energize their economies at long last after so many years and fits and starts eleuthera the island named for â freedomâ is set for growth investments for eleuthera include the philautia boutique resort hotel project in governorâ s harbour disney cruise linesâ low density cruise port destination at the lighthouse beach in bannerman town windermere island north community resort jackâ s bay community resort and davis harbour marine south of rock sound and the 4 million dollar harbour island marina and community resort the latter two projects were recently approved for expansion of developments that were approved previously and are currently underway i note again that the land that disney is developing on eleuthera was privately owned disney was not sold crown land for this development some of the core elements of the disney cruise lines island development include the integration of bahamian cultural and artistic expression into the design of the site and experiences offered and the restoration of various historical and cultural sites the development will create approximately 150 new jobs and an array of entrepreneurial opportunities for residents of eleuthera and bahamians in general disney will convey approximately 190 acres of the land purchased from the private seller to the government of the bahamas for conservation and a national park abaco island and the abaco cays will receive significant new investments these include the proposed tyrsoz family 580 million investment in south abaco for the development of a 5 star residential resort and marina which will involve the upgrade and expansion of the sandy point airstrip the development of sandy point ferry dock as a cargo transshipment port and construction area and the extension of queen s highway in south abaco on andros we have approved a bahamian joint venture partnership arrangement for the development of the blue hole marina and lodge in fresh creek consisting of a 12 room lodge and an 80 slip marina including a bulk fuel facility long island will experience growth to its economy with the development of the pinderâ s bay 5 million dollar 28 bungalow community development project at lower harbour this project will hire about 30 bahamians during construction and nine bahamians to operate and maintain the residential community also in the works for long island is a new five star eco resort by star resort with 515 luxury residences the berry islands bimini and the exumas experienced their share of investments with the expansion of existing properties and green field tourism projects fellow bahamians and residents grand bahama is vital for the overall growth and economic expansion of the bahamas while unemployment has gone down in grand bahama there is still a long way to go we are making progress on the bahama bay resort and residential development the former ginn sur mer this development will include 173 condo hotel units a marina and the development of a smart city we are on track to sell the grand lucayan the temporary purchase of which was absolutely necessary for the economy of grand bahama thankfully the economy of grand bahama is recovering through new tourism projects and our ambitious program to establish the island as a technology hub the island has attracted several high tech and back office firms employing grand bahamians chiefly as a result of the commercial enterprises act 2017 among the new and diverse businesses on grand bahama is the carnival cruise linesâ ocean medallion project ocean medallion is a wearable device that enables a personal digital concierge for passengers eliminating long check in lines cabin keys and credit cards a team of eight bahamians currently on the project underwent training to learn to install the ocean medallion hardware and software on cruise ships and they continue to monitor those systems another tech firm is gibc digital â a digital transformation facilitator helps organizations automate their manual processes to reduce cost and errors use their data to make better decisions faster and prevent cyber security threats â other companies approved under the commercial enterprise act on grand bahama include globe united â a european based medical call center and administrative office g b biopharma a company engaged in biomedical services devdigital bahamas limited â a bahamian joint venture web development company agriculture enterprises development limited a bahamian joint venture farming company that will engage in a pilot fruit and nut farm producing coconut castor and palm oil for the local market and for export and another bahamian joint venture company bahamas golden harvest limited was approved to establish a chicken hatchery produce eggs chicken feed cash crops and citrus on east end grand bahama fellow bahamians and residents despite our small population of under 400 000 the bahamas is a big ocean nation in terms of the number of islands islets reefs coral reefs and cays the bahamas is one of the larger archipelagos in the world how can we take better sustainable advantage of our waters our blue economy initiative is on our priority list of growth measures the blue economy initiative is a part of our vision for growth diversification and economic expansion and opportunity for current and future generations the initiative is an evolving concept that highlights the need to capitalize on the extensive economic potential that can be found in the ocean including economic activity that uses the sea as an input either directly or indirectly the blue economy initiative will include fisheries maritime transport and coastal tourism activity it will also enable us to diversify into many new and emerging ocean based activities such as marine aquaculture seabed mining maritime safety and surveillance marine biotechnology marine security and other areas the government has already secured a non reimbursable grant from the idb of 500 000 to finance a three year technical co operation project that focuses on the blue economy and the digital economy we are planning for short medium and long term growth and diversification fellow bahamians and residents economic growth must be inclusive economic growth and activity must be felt all across the country for all bahamians one key element of this is to do more â much more â to support bahamian entrepreneurs and small businesses last january i foreshadowed the launch of the small business development centre the sbdc i committed our administration to an investment of 25 million toward small business support over five years the sbdc is up and running so far approximately 500 bahamian entrepreneurs have had consultations or participated in seminars through the centre for this fiscal year the government has pledged support in the amount of 5 5 million for loans grants and equity injections into bahamian small businesses together with private sector partners the total level of support will come to just under 7 million in funding directly to bahamian entrepreneurs and small businesses of this amount i am most pleased that some 450 000 will be spent to provide grants to young underprivileged bahamians from throughout the country â from poor neighborhoods and poor families â to support their business aspirations so far through the sbdc seven companies have been approved for funding to either begin or to expand their businesses for a collective total of 1 5 million with more credit to be extended once these small businesses are provided with capital they can contribute to the fabric of the economy by providing new businesses by bahamian entrepreneurs and jobs for bahamians moreover my government has committed to enhanced training for aspiring entrepreneurs through btvi and the university of the bahamas the â be your own boss byob â scholarship offers 1 000 in tuition support to students between the ages of 18 and 25 who will enroll full time in preparatory certificate diploma and associate degree programs which will train them with the requisite technical and vocational skills needed to start a business or to secure employment equipping our students with these types of opportunities will create both jobs and products to help grow the economy we anticipate expanding this initiative in the upcoming budget fellow bahamians and residents to help new business startups the ministry of finance recently announced the roll out of a provisional business license which is expected to be implemented by the department of inland revenue in the first quarter of this year this provisional business license will allow individuals wishing to start a new low risk business to do so in five days or less once granted the provisional licenseâ which will be valid for 90 daysâ businesses will be allowed to be up and running while they work to complete the full business license process by obtaining all of the necessary documents for completion in addition the fee for starting a new business has also been waived and instead of business persons having to go to more than one agency to submit different applications they now are able to apply for the various approvals through one consolidated application form on the department of inland revenueâ s website this has made the process much easier for those wishing to launch a new business we will ensure that we continue to refine this process even more i have pressed my ministers to address the unacceptable amount of time it takes for bahamians and foreigners alike to open a bank account yes the know your customer rules are important but just as important is that bahamians should be able to go to a bank and open up a bank account with little hassle once they have proper identification to prove who they are instead of finding excuses as to why it cannot happen i want the central bank the ministry of finance the commercial banks and the private sector to tell me how it will happen fellow bahamians and residents our country is making economic progress our economy is growing we are out of recession there is more opportunity but there is still much work to do to boost jobs especially among young bahamians we must expand even more and do all we can to secure our middle class and to move more bahamians out of poverty we have a plan to tackle electricity and energy costs which i will outline in a subsequent report to the bahamian people along with combatting crime we will be relentless in attacking joblessness and in expanding our economy i ask for your continued support as we transform our country by building a more prosperous fairer and just society which promotes the common good of all bahamians i am sustained by the prayers and good wishes of so many of you please continue to pray for all of your leaders including those of the official opposition may god bless each and every one of you and your family and loved ones and may the god of new beginnings bless our commonwealth at the beginning of 2019 thank you and good night copyright 2019 by thebahamasweekly com top of page
