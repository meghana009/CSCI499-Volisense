expenditures for full year 2019 were 1 105 2 million compared with 1 043 4 million for 2018 primarily due to increased spending on projects at bald mountain fort knox and round mountain partially offset by lower spending at tasiast capital expenditures were within the company s guidance balance sheet as of december 31 2019 kinross had cash and cash equivalents of 575 1 million compared with 349 0 million at december 31 2018 the increase was primarily due to net operating cash flow inflows partially offset by capital expenditures at the company s development projects the company has available credit of 1 453 1 million as of year end 2019 for total liquidity of 2 028 2 million operating results mine by mine summaries for 2019 fourth quarter and full year operating results may be found on pages 11 and 15 of this news release highlights include the following americas paracatu had an outstanding year in 2019 achieving record annual production of 619 563 au eq oz while lowering costs the strong performance was mainly due to an asset optimization program started in 2018 which resulted in improved mill efficiencies and an enhanced understanding of the orebody full year production increased approximately 98 000 au eq oz or 19 compared with 2018 as both throughput and recoveries improved full year cost of sales per ounce sold decreased by approximately 19 compared with 2018 mainly due to operational efficiencies lower power costs and favourable foreign exchange movements during q4 2019 cost of sales per ounce sold increased versus q3 2019 mainly due to higher maintenance costs as the crusher was repaired during the quarter quarterly production was slightly lower compared with q3 2019 mainly due to lower throughput round mountain performed well for full year 2019 while there was a slight year over year reduction in annual production q4 2019 production increased 26 compared with q3 2019 mainly due to strong performance from the heap leach pads as a result of the phase w project full year cost of sales per ounce sold was lower versus 2018 primarily due to lower operating waste cost of sales per ounce sold in q4 2019 was largely in line quarter over quarter at bald mountain full year production was lower compared with 2018 mainly due to a slower than anticipated ramp up at the vantage complex project and unfavourable weather conditions at the site early in the year as expected production was significantly higher in q4 2019 increasing by 95 compared with q3 2019 as more ounces were recovered from the vantage complex cost of sales per ounce sold for 2019 was higher compared with 2018 mostly due to lower production cost of sales per ounce sold decreased during q4 2019 compared with q3 2019 primarily due an increase in production at fort knox production for 2019 was lower compared with 2018 mainly due to a decrease in mill throughput while 2019 cost of sales per ounce sold increased compared with the previous year mainly due to lower production and higher maintenance costs production and cost of sales per ounce sold for q4 2019 were largely in line with the previous quarter maricunga delivered higher than expected annual production from the rinsing of materials placed on the heap leach pads prior to the suspension of mining activities full year cost of sales per ounce sold were largely in line with 2018 the mine has now transitioned into care and maintenance with final production occurring in q4 2019 for tax planning purposes the sale of residual gold ounces are expected to continue during 2020 russia the russia region continued its strong and consistent performance in 2019 combined full year production at kupol and dvoinoye was 8 higher compared with 2018 primarily due to higher grade ore processed from kupol s northeast extension and moroshka deposits production quarter over quarter was lower primarily due to planned lower mill grades at kupol full year cost of sales per ounce sold was higher compared with 2018 primarily due to an increase in operating waste mined and was largely in line quarter over quarter west africa tasiast outperformed in 2019 achieving record production and a record low cost of sales per ounce sold as the mine continued to benefit from the phase one expansion and the mill s strong performance during 2019 production increased by approximately 140 000 au eq oz or 56 while cost of sales decreased by 374 per ounce sold or 38 compared with 2018 tasiast finished the year strongly achieving a record quarterly production of 102 973 au eq oz at a cost of sales of 494 per ounce sold the lowest in its history the mine also achieved a record average throughput of 15 000 tonnes per day during the quarter higher grades operational efficiencies and lower operating waste during q4 2019 also contributed to a decrease in costs compared with the same period in 2018 at chirano full year production decreased slightly compared with 2018 mainly due to lower grades production for q4 2019 was higher compared with the previous quarter primarily as a result of improved mill throughput cost of sales per ounce sold was higher for full year 2019 mainly due to an increase in operating waste mined associated with the return to open pit mining and was largely in line quarter over quarter 2020 outlook the following section of the news release represents forward looking information and users are cautioned that actual results may vary we refer to the risks and assumptions contained in the cautionary statement on forward looking information on page 21 of this news release in 2020 kinross expects to produce 2 4 million au eq oz 5 from its operations in 2021 annual production is expected to be at or above 2019 levels and is expected to remain at the 2 5 million au eq oz level for 2022 the slight forecast decrease compared to full year 2019 production is primarily due to maricunga transitioning to care and maintenance and expected lower production at paracatu following its record year partially offset by an expected production increase at tasiast and fort knox production is expected to be relatively flat quarter over quarter throughout 2020 with a slight increase in the fourth quarter tasiast is expected to have higher production in the first half of the year mainly as a result of higher grade ore paracatu and round mountain are expected to have higher production in the second half of the year mainly due to anticipated higher grades at paracatu and more ounces recovered at round mountain as the benefits of phase w continue to be realized production cost of sales is expected to be 720 per au eq oz 5 for 2020 the company expects all in sustaining cost to be 970 5 per ounce sold on both a gold equivalent and by product basis for 2020 which is lower than full year 2019 all in sustaining cost per ounce mainly due to the expected lower cost of sales per ounce sold and capital expenditures for 2020 all in sustaining cost per ounce is

of non gaap financial measures the company has included certain non gaap financial measures in this document these measures are not defined under ifrs and should not be considered in isolation the company believes that these measures together with measures determined in accordance with ifrs provide investors with an improved ability to evaluate the underlying performance of the company the inclusion of these measures is meant to provide additional information and should not be used as a substitute for performance measures prepared in accordance with ifrs these measures are not necessarily standard and therefore may not be comparable to other issuers adjusted net earnings attributable to common shareholders and adjusted net earnings per share are non gaap measures which determine the performance of the company excluding certain impacts which the company believes are not reflective of the company s underlying performance for the reporting period such as the impact of foreign exchange gains and losses reassessment of prior year taxes and or taxes otherwise not related to the current period impairment charges reversals gains and losses and other one time costs related to acquisitions dispositions and other transactions and non hedge derivative gains and losses although some of the items are recurring the company believes that they are not reflective of the underlying operating performance of its current business and are not necessarily indicative of future operating results management believes that these measures which are used internally to assess

the company makes reference to a non gaap measure for adjusted operating cash flow adjusted operating cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations excluding certain impacts which the company believes are not reflective of the company s regular operating cash flow and excluding changes in working capital working capital can be volatile due to numerous factors including the timing of tax payments and in the case of kupol a build up of inventory due to transportation logistics the company uses adjusted operating cash flow internally as a measure of the underlying operating cash flow

all in sustaining costs and all in costs to address how the costs associated with leases after a company s adoption of ifrs 16 should be treated the wgc is a market development organization for the gold industry and is an association whose membership comprises leading gold mining companies including kinross although the wgc is not a mining industry regulatory organization it worked closely with its member companies to develop these non gaap measures adoption of the all in sustaining cost and all in cost metrics is voluntary and not necessarily standard and therefore these measures presented by the company may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers the company believes that the all in sustaining cost and all in cost measures complement existing measures reported by kinross all in sustaining cost includes both operating and capital costs required to sustain gold production on an ongoing basis the value of silver sold is deducted from the total production cost of sales as it is considered residual production sustaining operating costs represent expenditures incurred at current operations that are considered necessary to maintain current production sustaining capital represents capital expenditures at existing operations comprising mine development costs and ongoing replacement of mine equipment and other capital facilities and does not include capital expenditures for major growth projects or enhancement capital for significant infrastructure improvements at existing operations all in cost is comprised of all in sustaining cost as well as

activities are classified as non sustaining 6 reclamation and remediation sustaining is calculated as current period accretion related to reclamation and remediation obligations plus current period amortization of the corresponding reclamation and remediation assets and is intended to reflect the periodic cost of reclamation and remediation for currently operating mines reclamation and

kingsley moghalu background the ford foundation tbwa and c f porter novelli in partnership with nnewi chamber of commerce have begun a great and necessary initiative by sponsoring and organizing the first nnewi investment summit to develop a pathway to the revitalization of nnewi a major manufacturing hub in nigeria and africa i am honored to have been asked to serve as the keynote speaker for this event although i happen to be a son of the soil as an indigene of nnewi i was just as impressed by the sponsors organizers of this summit the representative of the presidency dr jumoke oduwole special adviser to the president on ease on doing business and the representatives of the anambra state government by the creativity and drive of nnewi manufacturers against all odds i must say as we visited and toured various factories yesterday the first day of this event nnewi has been a famous commercial town since the 1920s mainly for the generations of the lorry bus transportation business ojukwu transport ekene dilichukwu chidi ebere ekesons transport etc and the auto and motorcycle spare parts trade nnewi indigenes also have a strong reputation for shrewdness and business savvy hence the popular phrase in eastern nigerian society nnewi sense in the 1970s and 1980s nnewi businessmen began a process of backward integration a shift from trade mainly in motorcycle and auto spare parts into industrial manufacturing while this was partly forward looking business sense it was also a response to government policy challenges especially politically associated difficulties with access to foreign exchange for importation in the early 1980s when oil prices were depressed and nigeria s economy was still largely a statist command one the situation today with forex access should leave us with a sense of deja vu but i ll get to that later on four decades later alas the promise and potential of manufacturing in nnewi africa s taiwan has not been fulfilled several industries are still standing notably innoson vehicle manufacturing ivm cutix plc electric cables and electric switch gears ibeto group synthetic marble brake pads and linings intercontinental feed mills animal feed tummy tummy noodles chicason industries and ngobros industries but many other industries have shut down several manufacturers have resorted to importation mainly from china in order to survive as going concerns these stresses are largely due to macroeconomic headwinds crony capitalist favoritism by successive nigerian governments and the absence of a policy prioritization of nnewi s manufacturing potential why manufacturing still matters nigeria has made the consistent policy error of focusing largely on economic growth but not enough effort has been made to achieve real human development and structural economic transformation these are three different but interrelated concepts and all three of them economic growth human development and structural transformation are necessary to achieve broad based national prosperity economic growth is the annual growth of the gross domestic product gdp the total sum of goods and services produced in a country in a given year human development is measured by factors such as access to quality healthcare education and human capital skills availability of potable drinking water and average life expectancy structural economic transformation means the diversification of an economy away from reliance on subsistence agriculture and raw natural resources such as crude oil and minerals to one in which complex value added manufacturing and competitive export of such products makes a significant contribution to national output and to global manufacturing africa has 70 of the world s strategic minerals but contributes only 1 of global manufacturing more than 50 of world trade is based on manufactured products while just 7 is based on agriculture the strength of manufacturing as a component of the economy is measured partly by the ratio of manufacturing to gdp but also by the quantum of economic output of whatever manufacturing takes place in a given economy the nature of other economic activities that contribute to gdp e g services tourism and others and by the percentage of global manufacturing such national manufacturing constitutes nigeria has a manufacturing to gdp ratio of only 10 despite the efforts by the government to support manufacturing which has been largely ineffective for reasons we will discuss shortly this is a low score in our national context because agriculture makes up about 30 of gdp our agriculture is mostly subsistence agriculture and not innovation and value added agriculture besides nigeria s contribution to global manufacturing is statistically non existent it would have been for better if our manufacturing made up 30 of our gdp and agriculture made up 10 china is the world s leader in manufacturing output 2 trillion as of 2015 statistics with manufacturing making up 27 of the country s overall national output and china has 20 of global manufacturing the united states with a manufacturing output of 1 8trillion has manufacturing as 12 of its total national output and that 12 of its national output is 18 of global manufacturing south korea with 372 in manufacturing output roughly nigeria s total gdp has that manufacturing output as 29 of its total economic output and 4 of global manufacturing manufacturing matters it has mattered for centuries of global economic history it will continue to matter even with the rise of digital economies we can therefore ignore the conventional wisdom that african countries should now skip aspiring to industrialization on the assumption that its relative importance is declining and jump to the post industrial economy speaking realistically we are not yet competing with the already most industrialized countries but rather are seeking to build a sustainable and sophisticated industrial economy relative to our current stages of growth in that context we must has an industrial economy before we can have a post industrial one we therefore need effective industrial policy to promote manufacturing in places such as nnewi a populous country like nigeria with millions of jobless youth also cannot afford not to have a strong manufacturing component in its economy with special attention to the efficient productivity of labour as mordi englama and adebusuyi have argued in the changing structure of the nigerian economy 2010 industrialization tends to propel economic growth and quicken the achievement of structural transformation and diversification of economies it enables a country utilize fully its factor endowments and to depend less on the external sector for its growth and subsistence through industrial development an economy gains the versatility and resilience that would enable it raise the standards of its people and cope with internal stress and strains there is a general debate today about the pros and cons of industrial policy government intervention in an organized manner to guide the economy by supporting investment in manufacturing and in targeted industries governments tend to utilize taxes subsidies and investment incentives to do so several industrialized countries in europe and asia such as germany france sweden and japan as well as the tiger economies of south korea singapore and taiwan made use of industrial policy despite frequent market failures and concerns today in some western intellectual circles about how compatible industrial policy can be with the ideological purity of market capitalism industrial policy broadly worked for the western economies at a certain stage of their growth nigeria should be cautious about policy arguments by some western economists to kick away the ladder to borrow the cambridge university economist ha jun chang s famous phrase after climbing with it there is no question my mind that nigeria needs an effective industrial policy and a comprehensive one public policy mis steps and nnewi s industrial decline against the backdrop of the arguments above i believe that nigerian government policy and its inadequacies have affected nnewi negatively as a manufacturing hub in the following ways in discussing these policy missteps that require correction we should divide this matter into first those that are predominantly political in nature and second those that are more of a failure of the technical public policy political factors manufacturing in nnewi has suffered from nigeria s constitutional structure as a federation that is in reality more unitary than federal power and decision making including economic decision making in the federal government under the 1999 constitution is over centralized it has therefore sucked up policy space for states in terms of potential policy approaches to manufacturing our constitutional structure also has led to politically driven economic policy that focuses on the sharing of oil rents and created commodity dependency rather than a policy focus on creating a productive economy driven by manufacturing industrial policy to the extent it exists is thus half hearted in reality lots of lip service but little success in economic diversification over several decades the land use act while serving as exception to extreme centralization of economic decision making power because it vests authority for land in state governors nevertheless remains a complicating factor because it still vests all land in the hands of the government this limits the efficient use of a major factor of production land by the private sector there has been a tendency by the state governments to encourage the use of land for agriculture less so for manufacturing nnewi s manufacturing has in the past been neglected by the federal government and even state governments but economic decisions that affect the viability of manufacturing in particular rail and ports infrastructure and the possibility of creating economic zones are in abuja s hands the federal government has consistently focused almost exclusively on lagos in this context e g the creation of the lekki free trade zone ports policy etc and by passed nnewi africa s taiwan there is as well room for greater patronage of nnewi manufacturers such as innoson vehicle manufacturing by both the federal governments and state governments in nnewi some manufacturers appear to be more loved and favoured by the federal government than others this has resulted in a crony capitalist approach to industrial policy in which waivers and access to foreign exchange in the past were given to specific business corporations rather than general policies for specific sectors which would create a more level playing field this is a politically induced policy failure nnewi manufacturers have been political orphans for far too long policy perspectives there has been a generalised failure in public policy that affects prospects for the manufacturing industry in nigeria generally and in nnewi in particular that failure is the tendency to make economic policy in silos rather than in a comprehensive joined up manner that considers linkages between various parts of the economy such as trade and fiscal policy and infrastructure provision economic policy making in nigeria is also often ad hoc in its approach and lacks philosophical and intellectual depth realistic measurable targets and effective monitoring and evaluation capacity nigerian economic management places a misplaced priority on attracting foreign investment instead of supporting local investors such as nnewi manufacturers the benefits realised through foreign investment in nigeria however have not been structural and thus not optimal our investment environment lacks structural location factors such as adequate infrastructure and skills our environment is also marked by high levels of political risk insecurity and weak rule of law a policy focus on import substitution represented by banns on forex allocation for import and protectionism that lacks strategic focus and is haphazardly implemented has prevented nigeria from building a competitive manufacturing export sector it has more often than not created virtual monopolies for favored businessmen and women and their companies closely coupled with this is the fundamental matter of how the naira and its value are managed in relation to foreign currencies as things stand today the subsidies on the value of the naira by the central bank of nigeria s pump action injections of forex into the forex market which has steeply deeply depleted nigeria s external reserves will only continue to encourage an import dependent economy rather than a competitive manufactured goods export one that would favour nnewi manufacturers amongst others this keeps the forex market on steroids the performance of that market is therefore artificial just like that of an athlete taking performance enhancing drugs this policy focus is misplaced because it directly feeds into the structural imbalance of our national economy where the middle class can purchase relatively cheap dollars to train their children in schools abroad there is little incentive for this class which is where many of the policy makers belong to fix nigeria s educational system at home observations from other economies there are five factors that drive successful manufacturing economies these are a innovation based on research and development r d b costs c investments in skilled workforces d infrastructure and e industrial financing innovation innovation is the secret of wealth of nations the discovery of new inventions that improve the quality of life and new ways of doing things that are more efficient coupled with the mass productions of inventions is what has created the wealth of the industrialized world fortunately nnewi is well known for innovation in certain areas especially in the area of vehicle parts but this attribute has not been harnessed through systematic research and development by manufacturing companies in nnewi because they struggle with an oppressive macroeconomic environment it also requires stronger protections for intellectual property costs the efficiency of production or otherwise makes a fundamental difference to the profitability of manufacturing companies while much of the costs in manufacturing in nnewi come from weak infrastructure environments in particular electricity a focus on a use of innovation and production process efficiencies can help reduce costs workforce investments manufacturing companies in competitive economies invest heavily in the technical capabilities of their workforce this creates a competitive edge because skilled workforces increase the productivity of labour for any organization constant training of the workforce is therefore imperative infrastructure infrastructure support contributes directly to efficient production this is a major cost factor that affects the viability of manufacturing in nnewi industrial financing industrialisation in east asia was boosted by favourable financing subsidies linked with appropriate control measures such as proof of valid export orders before companies could benefit from subsidized finance china china s industrialization began in the 1950s following the establishment of communist china in 1949 it was driven by state policy in its various phases first the great leap forward driven by mao zedong six thousand advisors were brought into china from the soviet union to oversee 156 industrial projects the explicit policy goal was to shift from an agrarian economy to agriculturization and then industrialization although the great leap forward was considered a failure because of large scale famine the members of chinese employed in agriculture dropped while those employed by industry grew in 1978 a decision by the central working committee of the chinese communist party under the leadership of deng xiaoping began a cautious shift to capitalist production the focus was on export expansion economic development zones were established in 14 of the largest coastal cities foreign capital was allowed into the country in 1977 and price controls were removed in the mid 80s today china is the world s leading manufacturer and the second largest economy south korea in the early 1960s the south korean government adopted an outward looking strategy with labour intensive manufactured exports in which the country had competitive advantage there was a six year heavy and chemical industries hci policy push to move into steel non ferrous metals and petrochemicals processing this policy was supported by subsidies on inputs and discounted credit to participating firms but not by outright protectionism such as import bans south korea s chaebols supported by government policy created a supply chain economy for their smaller supplies these smaller companies thrive because of the large conglomerates ethiopia the ethiopian government s economic management is based on a very conscious focus on industrial policy ethiopia has a conscious strategy to become an industrialized country and africa s manufacturing hub ethiopian strategy is based on agriculture led industrialization similar to china in which the country leverages its agrarian economy into industrialization beginning with agriculture based value added manufacturing the policy is also heavily export market driven ethiopia s infrastructure plan prioritizes road and other infrastructure construction to serve its industrial production economic zones the country is also investing heavily in workforce skill development ethiopia s industrialisation has faced significant challenges but nonetheless is making progress when we consider the fact that industrialization takes time lessons learned a strong manufacturing economy requires competent government policy intervention even if driven by the private sector these policy interventions must be targeted executed in phases and economic outcomes must be constantly monitored as noted above industrialization that changes the structure of a national economy takes time practically 15 20 years at the very minimum but the benefits are long lasting because successful industrialization will break the back of poverty south korea has been one of the fastest countries to achieve this outcome it takes more than statements of intentions to create a successful manufacturing hub and the private sector alone cannot achieve it while all industrialisation drives in the west and asia have been export driven nigeria has a large domestic market for manufactured goods in practice the profit margins in the supplying domestic markets in nigeria have been more profitable than exports but exports of manufactured goods remain essential to bring in foreign exchange that is necessary for inputs that may not be locally available as well as for the stability of the forex market successful industrial policy requires an administratively and technically competent state to develop and drive it this has been the case in all countries that have industrialized specific knowledge understanding and specialization in industrial policy and economic complexity as a sub set of economic policy is often necessary for effective policy development and to meet challenges in implementation main policy recommendations there is manufacturing potential beyond lagos the fgn should make nnewi a full and specific economic zone with infrastructure to make it viable mainly electricity roads and water as well as a seaport in onitsha taking advantage of the 2nd niger bridge the cbn should more strategically target proven commercially viable centers such as nnewi with its msme development fund repayments rates will be better and higher with communities such as nnewi that have a track record of manufacturing and overall business success a state business relations council should be established as a permanent mechanism for government business interaction with the organised private sector but with regional representation from nnewi onitsha and aba among other areas of the country this will provide a more comprehensive framework that is policy focused to support the private sector rather than a more limited doing business environment rankings approach or committees dominated by lagos based corporate captains fgn and anambra state government should bring intellectual and policy competence into policy making in the government in the area of industrial policy there is abundance of this knowledge with nigerians in diaspora industrial policy is a very specific area of economic policy the tendency to appoint politicians or business leaders to oversee industrial policy has proved inadequate a joined up policy making approach is essential industrial growth trade and fiscal forex policy are linked the cbn should formulate a forex policy that promotes industrialization and incentivises export competitiveness in nigeria in the immediate medium and longer term the bank should float the naira the fgn should move away from import substitution competiveness that enables manufacturers in nnewi and other locations in nigeria produces value added components that enter the global supply chain of the goods of globalization should be our industrial ambition in a globalized world this achievement is the secret behind the rise of east asian countries such as malaysia singapore south korea taiwan and thailand with nigeria having joined the african continental free trade area afcta import substitution as a policy approach will increasingly be unviable the federal and state governments in nigeria and private sector companies should invest in innovation research and development and then link those activities directly to large scale manufacturing invest in manufacturing workforce development should be increased significantly through the establishment of vocational training and other institutes that will train our young men and women in skills required for efficient manufacturing this is an area in which development partners can support the government and the private sector trade facilitation reforms are essential the nightmare in nigeria s port at apapa must end i recommend a wholesale concession of the apapa port to port management companies in singapore or other economic jurisdictions that have achieved best in class performance in ports management the nigerian ports authority should become a strictly regulatory body only moreover as noted earlier the diversification of port infrastructure including to onitsha to serve the southeast region will greatly improve cost management efficiency and the contribution of manufacturing to nigerian and global economic output prof moghalu delivered the keynote address at the 2020 nnewi

tigrayan people s liberation front tplf the tplf s diminishing influence at the national level increases the risk of contracts being altered or cancelled within the tigray region following the legislative elections the cabinet reshuffle removes the tplf s ability to influence policymaking within central government but it likely can still protect its commercial interests within tigray region at least until the legislative elections however the central government likely will gain influence within tigray region if tigrayan opposition parties control more seats in the legislature which would increase the scope for altering or cancelling tplf affiliated projects the continued appointment of commercial and political elites from the amhara region very likely strengthens an alliance between the two largest parties prime minister ahmed s oromo democratic party odp and the amhara democratic party adp that merged into the newly created prosperity party pp the appointment of melaku alebel

the success of birchcliff s capital program which resulted in incremental production from new horizontal oil wells brought on production in gordondale and horizontal condensate rich natural gas wells in pouce coupe partially offset by natural production declines liquids accounted for approximately 22 of birchcliff s total production in q4 2019 12 light oil and condensate and 10 ngls as compared to approximately 21 in q4 2018 12 light oil and condensate and 9 ngls with total liquids production increasing by 9 from q4 2018 for the full year 2019 liquids accounted for approximately 22 of birchcliff s total production 13 light oil and condensate and 9 ngls as compared to approximately 20 in 2018 11 light oil and condensate and 9 ngls in line with its guidance of 22 liquids total liquids production for the full year 2019 increased by 14 from 2018 the change in the commodity production mix was primarily due to the addition of condensate rich natural gas wells in pouce coupe and an increase in c3 extracted from the natural gas stream at the corporation s 100 owned and operated natural gas processing plant in pouce coupe the pouce coupe gas plant adjusted funds flow birchcliff s adjusted funds flow for q4 2019 was 80 9 million or 0 30 per basic common share a 1 decrease and a 3 decrease respectively from 81 5 million and 0 31 per basic common share in q4 2018 the decrease was primarily due to a realized loss on financial instruments and an increase in transportation and other expense as a result of birchcliff s increased dawn and aeco firm service partially offset by higher reported revenue and lower operating expense revenue received by the corporation was higher primarily due to an increase in total liquids production and a higher average realized liquids sales price partially offset by a lower average realized natural gas sales price birchcliff s full year 2019 adjusted funds flow was 334 5 million or 1 26 per basic common share each a 7 increase from 312 9 million and 1 18 per basic common share in 2018 in line with its guidance of 335 million the increases were primarily due to lower operating and royalty expenses and a realized gain on financial instruments as compared to a realized loss on financial instruments in 2018 partially offset by lower reported revenue and an increase in transportation and other expense as a result of birchcliff s increased dawn and aeco firm service revenue received by the corporation was lower primarily due to a lower average realized liquids sales price partially offset by higher total liquids production net loss to common shareholders birchcliff recorded a net loss to common shareholders of 19 0 million or 0 07 per basic common share in q4 2019 as compared to net income to common shareholders of 70 9 million and 0 27 per basic common share in q4 2018 the change from a net income to a net loss position was primarily due to a 46 6 million unrealized mark to market loss on financial instruments recorded in q4 2019 as compared to a 77 4 million unrealized mark to market gain on financial instruments in q4 2018 resulting in a period over period change of 124 0 million or 91 1 million on an after tax basis see risk management birchcliff recorded a net loss to common shareholders of 59 6 million or 0 22 per basic common share in 2019 as compared to net income to common shareholders of 98 0 million and 0 37 per basic common share in 2018 the change from a net income to a net loss position was primarily due to a 192 8 million unrealized mark to market loss on financial instruments recorded in 2019 as compared to a 64 2 million unrealized mark to market gain on financial instruments in 2018 resulting in a year over year change of 257 0 million or 188 9 million on an after tax basis partially offset by higher adjusted funds flow see risk management operating expense the corporation remained focused on reducing its operating costs in 2019 resulting in a quarterly operating expense of 3 06 boe in q4 2019 a 13 decrease from 3 51 boe in q4 2018 and record low operating expense for the full year 2019 of 3 09 boe a 12 decrease from 3 52 boe in 2018 birchcliff s full year annual operating expense was better than its guidance of 3 15 boe to 3 35 boe the decreases were primarily due to i a step down reduction in natural gas processing fees which became effective january 1 2019 at altagas deep cut sour gas processing facility in gordondale ii reduced take or pay processing commitments in pouce coupe beginning in november 2018 which resulted in natural gas being redirected from third party facilities to the pouce coupe gas plant and iii increased operating efficiencies resulting from expanded liquids handling capabilities in pouce coupe operating netback birchcliff s operating netback was 14 25 boe in q4 2019 a 6 increase from 13 47 boe in q4 2018 birchcliff s full year 2019 operating netback was 13 07 boe a 3 decrease from 13 52 boe in 2018 the increase in q4 2019 was primarily due to a higher average realized commodity sales price and lower per boe operating expense partially offset by higher per boe royalty and transportation and other expenses the decrease in the full year 2019 was primarily due to a lower average realized commodity sales price and higher per boe transportation and other expense partially offset by lower per boe royalty and operating expenses total cash costs birchcliff s total cash costs were 10 80 boe in q4 2019 a 1 increase from 10 68 boe in q4 2018 birchcliff s full year 2019 total cash costs were 10 31 boe a 1 decrease from 10 42 boe in 2018 the reasons for the changes in total cash costs are consistent with the explanation for operating netback and include higher per boe g a expense partially offset by lower per boe interest expense in both periods pouce coupe gas plant netbacks during 2019 birchcliff processed approximately 72 of its total corporate natural gas production and 62 of its

dividing the operating netback for the period by the petroleum and natural gas revenue for the period birchcliff s liquids to gas ratio increased by 73 as compared to 2018 primarily due to i specifically targeted condensate rich natural gas wells that were brought on production in pouce coupe in 2019 and ii the re configuration of phases v and vi of the pouce coupe gas plant in q4 2018 which provided for shallow cut capability allowing birchcliff to extract c3 from the natural gas stream the amount of condensate from montney horizontal natural gas wells being produced to the pouce

birchcliff realized a cash gain on financial instruments of 13 7 million as compared to a realized cash loss of 15 8 million in 2018 the realized cash gain and loss reported in the full year 2019 and q4 2019 periods respectively were primarily due to the settlement of financial nymex aeco basis swap contracts that were outstanding in the periods birchcliff recorded an unrealized non cash loss on financial instruments of 46 6 million in q4 2019 and an unrealized non cash loss on financial instruments of 192 8 million in the full year 2019 the unrealized non cash losses on financial instruments reported in the 2019 periods were primarily due to the decrease in the fair value of the corporation s financial instruments to a liability position of 132 6 million at december 31 2019 the fair value of the liability is the estimated discounted value to settle outstanding financial contracts at a point in time the decrease in the fair value of birchcliff s financial instruments during 2019 was primarily attributable to i the decrease in the forward basis spread between nymex hh and aeco 7a for contracts outstanding at december 31 2019 as compared to the fair value previously assessed at september 30 2019 and december 31 2018 and ii the settlement of financial nymex aeco basis swap contracts in 2019 the unrealized gains and losses on financial nymex hh basis contracts can fluctuate materially from period to period due to movement in the forward nymex hh and aeco 7a strip prices unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments do not impact adjusted funds flow and may differ

was focused on the drilling of high value light oil wells in gordondale and condensate rich and low cost natural gas wells in pouce coupe in addition the 2019 capital program advanced the corporation s 20 000 bbls d 50 condensate 50 water inlet liquids handling facility at the pouce coupe gas plant the inlet liquids handling facility and directed funds towards other infrastructure enhancement projects the 2019 capital program was strategically front end loaded resulting in a more efficient capital spending and production profile during the year this allowed birchcliff to realize numerous capital cost savings and bring new wells on production relatively early in the year optimizing producing days in the year for the capital spent during 2019 birchcliff drilled 30 30 0 net horizontal wells 7 7 0 net of which were drilled in q4 2019 to help ensure the efficient execution of the corporation s 2020 capital program of these 5 5 0 net were condensate rich natural gas wells in pouce coupe and 2 2 0 net were oil wells in gordondale the corporation brought on production 33 33 0 net wells during 2019 including 9 9 0 net wells that were drilled in q4 2018 and 1 of the 7 wells drilled in q4 2019 the remaining 6 of which will be brought on production in q1 and q2 2020 all wells drilled in 2019 were drilled on multi well pads which allows birchcliff to reduce its per well costs and

expenditures of 256 4 million as compared to birchcliff s guidance of 283 0 million and 242 0 million respectively total capital expenditures were 58 1 million in q4 2019 pouce coupe key focus areas for pouce coupe in 2019 were the drilling of condensate rich natural gas wells and the further exploitation and delineation of condensate rich trends in the montney d1 d2 and c intervals in 2019 the corporation drilled 16 16 0 net wells and brought on production 17 17 0 net wells birchcliff has been encouraged with the results of the wells brought on production in 2019 with strong condensate rates and the benefits from improved prices at aeco in q4 2019 for details regarding birchcliff s drilling results see its updated corporate presentation available on its website at www birchcliffenergy com investors corporate presentation birchcliff also initiated the construction of the inlet liquids handling facility in 2019 in order to handle increased condensate volumes in the area once completed this facility will give birchcliff the ability to increase its condensate production in the pouce coupe area to approximately 10 000 bbls d 2019 3 801 bbls d fabrication of the various components and site preparation are underway the facility is anticipated to be online in q3 2020 on january 3 2019 birchcliff completed the acquisition of 18 gross 15 1 net contiguous sections of montney land located between its existing pouce coupe and gordondale properties the acquisition demonstrates the highly functional integrated teams working together at birchcliff the acquisition was directly related to the learnings from the offsetting 2018 science and technology pad which led to the evaluation and acquisition of these lands that in turn allowed birchcliff s operations team to quickly and efficiently drill complete and bring on production 6 wells on the acquired lands in early 2019 targeting condensate rich natural gas the wells were drilled in three different intervals 4 in the montney d1 1 in the montney d2 and 1 in the montney c and have shown strong production results including high condensate to gas ratios with the positive results of the first 6 wells on the acquired lands specifically in the new montney d2 and c drilling intervals birchcliff returned to this pad in q4 2019 to drill an additional 6 6 0 net wells 3 montney d2 and 3 montney c wells 2 of which were drilled by year end 2019 these 6 wells will be brought on production in q2 2020 gordondale key focus areas for gordondale in 2019 were the drilling of crude oil wells and the further exploitation and delineation of oil in the montney d1 and d2 intervals specifically in the southeastern part of the gordondale field birchcliff drilled 14 14 0 net horizontal wells and brought 16 16 0 net wells on production in gordondale in 2019 due to the corporation s success in the southeastern part of the gordondale field and the targeted activity expected in 2020 birchcliff commenced the engineering and procurement for the addition of natural gas compression at both of its 100 owned and operated oil batteries in gordondale in 2019 the corporation also initiated the construction of a significant trunk line to transport oil natural gas and water to these batteries from the southeastern portion of the field both projects are expected to be completed in q2 2020 in conjunction with the bringing on production of 10 wells in the southeastern part of the field for details regarding birchcliff s drilling results see its updated corporate presentation available on its website at www

mainly result of i improved performance of the existing c3 recoveries at phases v and vi of the pouce coupe gas plant ii increased condensate from the producing wells and future locations in pouce coupe and iii additional c3 extraction assumed for phases i to iv of the pouce coupe gas plant acquisitions changes were the result of the acquisition which occurred in january 2019 as well as various other minor acquisitions birchcliff completed in the gordondale and pouce coupe areas in 2019 dispositions changes were the result of various non core dispositions birchcliff completed in 2019 economic factors the forecast prices for each product type were lower in the 2019 iqre price forecast than the 2018 deloitte price forecast which resulted in the economic limit at the end of a well s life being achieved earlier and therefore a reduction of the reserves volumes in all reserves categories the reduced price forecast also resulted in the loss of reserves for 4 gross 2 5 net proved

this press release are estimates only in general estimates of economically recoverable oil natural gas and ngls reserves and the future net revenue therefrom are based upon a number of variable factors and assumptions such as historical production from the properties production rates ultimate reserves recovery the timing and amount of capital expenditures marketability of oil natural gas and ngls royalty rates the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies and future operating costs all of which may vary materially from actual results for these reasons estimates of the economically recoverable oil natural gas and ngls reserves attributable to any particular group of properties the classification of such reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net revenue associated with reserves prepared by different engineers or by the same engineer at different times may vary birchcliff s actual production revenue taxes and development and operating expenditures with respect to its reserves will vary from estimates thereof and such variations could be material it should not be assumed that the undiscounted or discounted net present value of

ratio of 6 mcf 1 bbl and an mcfe conversion ratio of 1 bbl 6 mcf is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6 1 utilizing a conversion on a

the 2019 consolidated reserves report that have proved and or probable reserves as applicable attributed to them in the 2019 consolidated reserves report unbooked locations are internal estimates based on birchcliff s prospective acreage and an assumption as to the number of wells that can be drilled per section based on industry practice and internal technical analysis review unbooked locations have been identified by management as an estimate of birchcliff s multi year drilling activities based on evaluation of applicable geologic seismic engineering production and reserves information unbooked locations do not have proved or probable reserves attributed to them in the 2019 consolidated reserves report birchcliff s ability to drill and develop these locations and the drilling locations on which birchcliff actually drills wells depends on a number of uncertainties and factors including but not limited to the availability of capital equipment and personnel oil and natural gas prices costs inclement weather seasonal restrictions drilling results additional geological geophysical and reservoir information that is obtained production rate recovery gathering system and transportation constraints the net price received for commodities produced regulatory approvals and regulatory changes as a result of these uncertainties there can be no assurance that the potential future drilling locations that birchcliff has identified will ever be drilled and if drilled that such locations will result in additional oil ngls or natural gas production and in the case of unbooked locations additional reserves as such birchcliff s actual drilling activities may differ materially from those presently identified which could adversely affect birchcliff s business while certain of the unbooked drilling locations have been de risked by drilling existing wells in relatively close proximity to such unbooked drilling locations some of the other unbooked drilling locations are farther away from existing wells where management has less information about the characteristics of the reservoir and there is therefore more uncertainty whether wells will be drilled in such locations and if drilled there is more uncertainty that such wells will result in additional proved or probable reserves resources or production production with respect to the disclosure of

on to produce its wells and that any transportation service curtailments or unplanned outages that occur will be short in duration or otherwise insignificant the construction of new infrastructure meets timing and operational expectations existing wells continue to meet production expectations and future wells scheduled to come on production meet timing production and capital expenditure expectations birchcliff s production guidance may be affected by acquisition and disposition activity with respect to statements of future wells to be drilled and brought on production and estimates of potential future drilling locations and opportunities the key assumptions are the continuing validity of the geological and other technical interpretations performed by birchcliff s technical staff which indicate that commercially economic volumes can be recovered from birchcliff s lands as a result of drilling future wells and that commodity prices and general economic conditions will warrant proceeding with the drilling of such wells with respect to statements regarding the future potential and prospectivity of properties and assets such statements assume the continuing validity of the geological and other technical interpretations determined by birchcliff s technical staff with respect to such properties and that over the long term commodity prices and general economic conditions will warrant proceeding with the exploration and development of such properties with respect to estimates of reserves volumes and the net present values of future net revenue associated with birchcliff s reserves the key assumption is the validity of the data used by deloitte and mcdaniel in their independent reserves evaluations birchcliff s actual results performance or achievements could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of both known and unknown risks and uncertainties including but not limited to general economic market and business conditions which will among other things impact the demand for and market prices of birchcliff s products and birchcliff s access to capital volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices

the values and ratios presented are based on the carrying value of the respective asset categories generally the carrying values for invested assets are equal to their fair values however our mortgages and loans are generally carried at amortized cost for invested assets supporting insurance contracts in the event of default if the amounts recovered are insufficient to satisfy the related insurance contract liability cash flows that the assets are intended to support credit exposure may be greater than the carrying value of the assets 1 debt securities our debt securities portfolio is actively managed through a regular program of purchases and sales aimed at optimizing yield quality and liquidity while ensuring that it remains well diversified and duration matched to insurance contract liabilities with the exception of certain countries where we have business operations including canada the united states the united kingdom and the philippines our exposure to debt securities

respectively compared with 1 4 billion and 0 2 billion respectively as at december 31 2018 the decrease in gross unrealized losses was largely due to the impact from declining interest rates and the

mortgages compared to 16 4 billion as at december 31 2018 our mortgage portfolio consists entirely of commercial mortgages including retail office multi family industrial and land properties as at december 31 2019 35 of our commercial mortgage portfolio consisted of multi family residential mortgages there are no single family residential mortgages our uninsured commercial portfolio had a weighted average loan to value ratio of approximately 55 as at december 31 2019 consistent with december 31 2018 while we generally limit the maximum loan to value ratio to 75 at issuance we may invest in mortgages with a higher loan to value ratio in canada if the mortgage is insured by the canada mortgage and housing corporation cmhc the estimated weighted average debt service coverage for our uninsured commercial portfolio is 1 76 times of the 3 9 billion of multi family residential mortgages in the canadian commercial mortgage portfolio 93 were insured by the cmhc as at december 31 2019 we held 32 0 billion of loans compared to 30 4 billion as at december 31 2018 private placement loans provide diversification by type of loan industry segment and borrower credit quality the private placement loan portfolio consists of senior secured and unsecured loans to large and mid market sized corporate borrowers securitized lease loan obligations secured by a variety of assets and project finance loans in sectors such as power and infrastructure the growth in the portfolio is consistent with our strategy to increase our investments in private placement loans mortgages and loans

equivalent amount 1 17 15 1 amounts presented are net of collateral received the net fair value of derivatives was a liability of 492 million as at december 31 2019 compared to a liability of 1 183 million as at december 31 2018 the change in net fair value was primarily due to the impact from changes in foreign exchange rates and swap curves the total notional amount of our derivatives increased to 62 1 billion as at december 31 2019 from 59 2 billion as at december 31 2018 the change in notional amount is mainly attributable to an increase of 5 6 billion in foreign exchange contracts used for hedging foreign currency assets an increase of 1 3 billion in equity contracts to hedge equity price fluctuations partially offset by a decrease of 4 0 billion in interest rate contracts primarily due to a reduction in interest rate exposed assets 4 asset default provision we make provisions for possible future credit events in the determination of our insurance contract liabilities the amount of the provision for asset default included in insurance contract liabilities is based on possible reductions in future investment yields that vary by factors such as type of asset asset credit quality rating duration and country of origin to the extent that an asset is written off or disposed of any amounts that were set aside in our insurance contract liabilities for possible future asset defaults in respect of that asset are released our asset default provision reflects the provision relating to future credit events for fixed income assets currently held by the company that support our insurance contract liabilities our asset default provision as at december 31 2019 was 2 637 million compared to 2 389 million as at december 31 2018 the increase of 248 million was primarily due to increases in the provisions for assets purchased net of dispositions partially offset by the release of provisions on fixed income assets supporting our insurance contract liabilities and the impacts of foreign exchange translation h risk management the company has established a risk management framework to assist in identifying measuring managing monitoring and reporting risks the risk management framework covers all risks and these have been grouped into six major categories market insurance credit business and strategic operational and liquidity risks through our enterprise risk management processes we oversee the various risk factors identified in the risk management framework and provide reports to senior management and to the board committees at least quarterly our enterprise risk management processes and risk factors are described in our annual md a and aif when referring to segregated funds in this section it is inclusive of segregated fund guarantees variable annuities and investment products and includes run off reinsurance in our corporate business segment 1 market risk sensitivities our net income 1 is affected by the determination of policyholder obligations under our annuity and insurance contracts these amounts are determined using internal valuation models and are recorded in our annual consolidated financial statements primarily as insurance contract liabilities the determination of these obligations requires management to make assumptions about the future level of equity market performance interest rates credit and swap spreads and other factors over the life of our products differences between our actual experience and our best estimate assumptions are reflected in our annual consolidated financial statements refer to additional cautionary language and key assumptions related to sensitivities in this section for important additional information regarding these estimates the market value of our investments in fixed income and equity securities fluctuates based on movements in interest rates and equity markets the market value of fixed income assets designated as afs that are held primarily in our surplus segment increases with declining interest rates and decreases with rising interest rates the market value of equities designated as afs and held primarily in our surplus segment increases with rising equity markets and decreases with declining equity markets changes in the market value of afs assets flow through other comprehensive income oci and are only recognized in net income when realized upon sale or when considered impaired the amount of realized gains losses recorded in net income in any period is equal to the unrealized gains losses or oci position at the start of the period plus the change in market value during the current period up to the point of sale for those securities that were sold during the period the sale or impairment of afs assets held in surplus can therefore have the effect of modifying our net income sensitivity we realized 64 million pre tax in net gains on the sale of afs assets during the fourth quarter of 2019 and 167 million in 2019 25 million pre tax in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 121 million in 2018 the net unrealized losses gains or oci position on afs fixed income and equity assets were 251 million and 62 million respectively after tax as at december 31 2019 98 million and 43 million respectively after tax as at december 31 2018 equity market sensitivities the following table sets out the estimated immediate impact on or

factors realized sensitivities may differ significantly from those illustrated above sensitivities include the impact of re balancing equity hedges for dynamic hedging programs at 2 intervals for 10 changes in equity markets and at 5 intervals for 25 changes in equity markets 2 the market risk sensitivities include the estimated mitigation impact of our hedging programs in effect as at december

section h risk management in this document refers to common shareholders net income sun life assurance s licat ratio generally decreases with rising interest rates and increases with declining interest rates which is opposite to our net income sensitivity increases to interest rates will reduce the value of our assets and margins in our actuarial liabilities resulting in a lower licat ratio while decreases to interest rates will increase the value of our assets and margins in our actuarial liabilities however our sensitivity to interest rates may be non linear and can change due to the interrelationships between market rates actuarial assumptions and licat calculations in particular changes to market conditions can shift the interest rate scenario applied in the licat formula causing a discontinuity where capital requirements change materially millions unless otherwise noted as at december 31 2019 as at december 31 2018 change in interest rates 1 50 basis point decrease 50

nearest 50 million the sensitivities exclude the market impacts on the income from our joint ventures and associates which we account for on an equity basis 4 the majority of interest rate sensitivity after hedging is attributed to individual insurance products we also have interest rate sensitivity after hedging from our fixed annuity and segregated funds products 5 the licat sensitivities illustrate the impact on sun life assurance as at december 31 2019 and december 31 2018 licat ratios are rounded to the nearest 0 5 the above sensitivities were determined using a 50 basis point change in interest rates and a 10 change in our equity markets because we believe that these market shocks were reasonably possible as at december 31 2019 we have also disclosed the impact of a 25 change in equity markets to illustrate that significant changes in equity market levels may result in other than proportionate impacts on our sensitivities 2 credit spread and swap spread sensitivities we have estimated the immediate impact or sensitivity of our net income attributable to certain instantaneous changes in credit and swap spreads the credit spread sensitivities reflect the impact of changes in credit spreads on our asset and liability valuations including non sovereign fixed income assets provincial governments corporate bonds and other fixed income assets the swap spread sensitivities reflect the impact of changes in swap spreads on swap based derivative positions and liability valuations millions unless otherwise noted credit spread sensitivities 1 swap spread

and may not be proportional across all reporting segments refer to additional cautionary language and key assumptions related to sensitivities in this section for important additional information regarding these estimates 3 general account insurance and annuity products most of our expected sensitivity to changes in interest rates and about two thirds of our expected sensitivity to changes in equity markets are derived from our general account insurance and annuity products we have implemented market risk management strategies to mitigate a portion of the market risk related to our general account insurance and annuity products individual insurance products include universal life and other long term life and health insurance products major sources of market risk exposure for individual insurance products include the reinvestment risk related to future premiums on regular premium policies asset reinvestment risk on both regular premium and single premium policies and the guaranteed cost of insurance interest rate risk for individual insurance products is typically managed on a duration basis within tolerance ranges set out in the applicable investment policy or guidelines targets and limits are established so that the level of residual exposure is commensurate with our risk appetite exposures are monitored frequently and assets are re balanced as necessary to maintain compliance within policy limits using a combination of assets and derivative instruments a portion of the longer term cash flows are backed with equities and real estate for participating insurance products and other insurance products with adjustability features the investment strategy objective is to provide a total rate of return given a constant risk profile over the long term fixed annuity products generally provide the policyholder with a guaranteed investment return or crediting rate interest rate risk for these products is typically managed on a duration basis within tolerance ranges set out in the applicable investment guidelines targets and limits are established such that the level of residual exposure is commensurate with our risk appetite exposures are monitored frequently and are re balanced as necessary to maintain compliance within prescribed tolerances using a combination of fixed income assets and derivative instruments certain insurance and annuity products contain minimum interest rate guarantees market risk management strategies are implemented to limit potential financial loss due to reductions in asset earned rates relative to contract guarantees these typically involve the use of hedging strategies utilizing interest rate derivatives such as interest rate floors swaps and swaptions certain insurance and annuity products contain features which allow the policyholders to surrender their policy at book value market risk management strategies are implemented to limit the potential financial loss due to changes in interest rate levels and policyholder behaviour these typically involve the use of hedging strategies such as dynamic option replication and the purchase of interest rate swaptions certain products have guaranteed minimum annuitization rates market risk management strategies are implemented to limit the potential financial loss and typically involve the use of fixed income assets interest rate swaps and swaptions 4 segregated fund guarantees approximately one third of our equity market sensitivity and a small amount of interest rate risk sensitivity as at december 31 2019 are derived from segregated fund products these products provide benefit guarantees which are linked to underlying fund performance and may be triggered upon death maturity withdrawal or annuitization the cost of providing these guarantees is uncertain and depends upon a number of factors including general capital market conditions our hedging strategies policyholder behaviour and mortality experience each of which may result in negative impacts on net income and capital the following table provides information with respect to the guarantees provided for our segregated fund products by business group as at december 31 2019

the amount at risk is not currently payable as the guarantees are only payable upon death maturity withdrawal or annuitization if fund values remain below guaranteed values 2 for guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefits the value of guarantees is calculated as the present value of the maximum future withdrawals assuming market conditions remain unchanged from current levels for all other benefits the value of guarantees is determined assuming 100 of the claims are made at the valuation date 3 the insurance contract liabilities represent management s provision for future costs associated with these guarantees and include a provision for adverse deviation in accordance with canadian actuarial standards of practice 4 corporate includes run off reinsurance a closed block of reinsurance the run off reinsurance business includes risks assumed through reinsurance of variable annuity products issued by various north american insurance companies between 1997 and 2001 the movement of the items in the table above from december 31 2018 to december 31 2019 primarily resulted from the following factors i the total fund values increased due to an increase in equity markets which was partially offset by net redemptions from products closed to new business ii the total amount at risk decreased due to an increase in equity markets and net redemptions from products closed to new business iii the total value of guarantees decreased due to net redemptions from products closed to new business and the weakening of the u s dollar against the canadian dollar and iv the total insurance contract liabilities decreased due to an increase in equity markets which was partially offset by a decrease in interest rates 5 segregated fund hedging our hedging programs use derivative instruments to mitigate the interest and equity related exposure of our segregated fund contracts as at december 31 2019 over 90 of our segregated fund contracts as measured by associated fund values were included in a hedging program while a large percentage of contracts are included in the hedging program not all of our market risk exposure related to these contracts is hedged for those segregated fund contracts included in the hedging program we generally hedge the value of expected future net claims costs and associated margins the following table illustrates the impact of our hedging program related to our sensitivity to a 50 basis point decrease in interest rates and a 10 and 25 decrease in equity markets for segregated fund contracts as at december 31 2019 and december 31 2018 impact of segregated fund hedging december 31 2019 millions changes in interest rates 3 changes in equity markets 4 net income sensitivity 1 2 50 basis point decrease 10 decrease 25 decrease

value of benefits being hedged will generally differ from the financial statement value due to different valuation methods and the inclusion of valuation margins in respect of financial statement values this will result in residual volatility to interest rate and equity market shocks in net income and capital the general availability and cost of these hedging instruments may be adversely impacted by a number of factors including volatile and declining equity and interest rate market conditions 3 represents a parallel shift in assumed interest rates across the entire yield curve as at december 31 2019 and december 31 2018 with no change to the asb promulgated urr variations in realized yields based on factors such as different terms to maturity and geographies may result in

business on 10 february 2020 the company s nav had increased by 6 3 since the year end during the year under review the ongoing u s china trade tensions and geopolitical frictions became key drivers of the u s economy and markets the trade war and associated uncertainty led to businesses becoming more cautious and holding back on capital expenditure similarly earnings and jobs growth slowed however the record long u s economic expansion was supported by healthy household spending and monetary policy easing by central banks sustained the expansion revenue earnings and dividends the company s revenue earnings per share eps based on the weighted average number of shares in issue for the year amounted to 5 96p which compares with 5 16p per share for the previous year an increase of 15 5 based on the final number of shares in issue at the year end the eps was 5 53p an increase of 7 2 in line with the statement set out in the annual report for the year ending 31 october 2018 quarterly interim dividends of 2 00p per share were paid on 12 april 2019 28 june 2019 1 october 2019 and 3 january 2020 this is in line with the payments made in the previous financial year your board considers that it remains appropriate to continue with the current dividend policy for the new financial year the dividend paid represents a yield of 4 3 on the share price at the year end the board continues to believe that this dividend policy provides an attractive option for current and prospective shareholders who wish to achieve exposure to the u s equity market whilst at the same time receiving a competitive dividend distribution some of which has been met from reserves discount control and share issues the company s shares have enjoyed a premium rating over the financial year and the uncertain market background has not prevented strong share issuance in light of the continuing demand for shares a general meeting was held on 28 august 2019 to renew the directors authority to allot additional shares and or sell shares out of treasury on a non pre emptive basis during the year the company reissued 9 525 000 shares from treasury at a premium to nav for a total gross consideration of 17 252 000 since the year end and up to the date of this report the company has reissued a further 2 805 000 shares at an average price of 189 86p per share and an average premium to the estimated nav of 1 7 the shares were trading at a premium of 0 9 to nav as at close of business on 10 february 2020 and the market capitalisation of the company was 156 9 million the directors have authority from shareholders to reissue up to 10 of the company s issued ordinary share capital and to buy back up to 14 99 of the company s issued ordinary share capital excluding any shares held in treasury the authorities to reissue and buy back shares expire at the conclusion of the 2020 annual general meeting and resolutions will be put to shareholders seeking a renewal of these powers corporate governance in february 2019 the association of investment companies aic published the 2019 code of corporate governance the aic code which was endorsed by the financial reporting council frc as being appropriate for investment companies the aic code applies to accounting periods beginning on or after 1 january 2019 the board has determined that effective from the company s new financial year it will comply with the recommendations of the 2019 aic code this in most material respects is the same as the uk code of corporate governance published in july 2018 save that there is greater flexibility regarding the tenure of office of the chairman and membership of the audit committee outlook the surge in protectionism and geopolitical tensions remain as ongoing risks however even as global uncertainties mount including the disruption caused by the coronavirus consumer spending and the housing market should continue to support u s economic growth during 2020 which importantly is also an election year for the u s president your portfolio managers remain positive on u s equities given reasonable valuations and the concentration of high quality companies in the portfolio their views are set out in more detail in the investment manager s report below annual general meeting the annual general meeting of the company will be held at blackrock s offices at 12 throgmorton avenue

by the s p 500 index advanced by 14 3 in u s dollar terms the s p 500 index concluded calendar year 2018 in a different manner than the previous nine calendar years with negative returns throughout the majority of 2018 equity market optimism had been supported by broadly positive economic fundamentals and continued strength in corporate earnings equity market strength had persisted through the start of 2018 but a number of underlying factors contributed to a different experience through the final quarter of the year and the first two months of the company s financial year while u s economic fundamentals continued to confirm the narrative of a healthy and expanding domestic economy investors struggled to weigh a constructive economic environment against a growing list of headline risks after broad based sell offs in october and december stocks regained their footing at the start of 2019 before may and august presented a risk off environment for u s equities although the u s equity market ended the calendar year having produced very strong returns 2019 has not been the smooth ride that investors experienced earlier in this cycle macro influences such as monetary fiscal and trade policy have dominated recent financial news we reject the short termism embedded within the 24 hour news cycle and the resulting ebb and flow of investor sentiment disciplined fundamental research continues to be the driving force used to inform our world view and portfolio construction decisions our base case for 2020 remains unchanged and on track positive albeit slowing u s growth with the trajectory of corporate earnings being a key litmus test for the durability of this business cycle we remain risk on but believe higher valuations and an economic cycle approaching late stage argue for a focus on quality and selectivity in pursuit of portfolio resilience trade tensions and a looming u s election cycle are two factors we anticipate contributing to bouts of higher volatility in the months ahead portfolio overview the portfolio generated relative outperformance in six out of eleven gics global industry classification standard sectors during the year but narrowly underperformed the benchmark at the sector level the primary detractor from relative performance was a combination of stock selection and allocation decisions in utilities notably selection decisions in the electric utilities industry proved to be costly as was an underweight exposure to multi utilities underweight exposure to the real estate sector also detracted from relative returns we continue to avoid exposure to the real estate sector given our belief that valuations are unattractive at today s levels in communication services stock selection among diversified telecom services providers proved detrimental and in materials selection among chemicals firms hampered relative results the largest contributor to relative performance was a combination of stock selection and allocation decisions in the energy sector stock selection among companies in oil gas and consumable fuels names drove relative performance within the sector as did underweight exposure to the energy equipment and services industry in consumer discretionary stock selection among multiline retail firms contributed to relative performance and our overweight exposure to the household durables industry proved beneficial stock selection decisions in the health care sector also boosted relative returns notably selection in the pharmaceuticals industry contributed to relative results overweight exposure to information technology specifically the software industry proved a tailwind to relative performance as did stock selection in both the financials and industrials sectors writing covered call options in an equity environment that was at times volatile contributed modestly to performance during the year as designed the company s option overwrite component enhanced the portfolio s income during the period below is a comprehensive overview of our allocations in sterling as at 31 october 2019 by the end of the year the portfolio s cash position was 9 2 which would have dampened performance

the portfolio secular growth opportunities in health care are a by product of demographic trends older populations spend more on health care than younger populations in the united states a combination of greater demand for health care services and rising costs drive a need for increased efficiency within the health care ecosystem we believe innovation and strong cost control can work hand in hand to address this need and companies that can contribute in this regard may be poised to benefit on the innovation front there is a need for newer and more effective medicines and therapies the food and drug administration has made this a priority by increasing the volume and speed of drug approvals which bodes well for pharmaceutical manufacturers that can deliver new drugs to the market from an investment standpoint we prefer pharmaceutical companies with a proven ability to generate high research and development productivity versus those that focus on one or two key drugs and rely upon raising their prices to drive growth from a cost perspective health maintenance organisations hmos have an economic incentive to drive down costs as they provide health insurance coverage to constituents the hmos have demonstrated a strong ability to manage costs by leveraging their scale and technology to drive efficiencies governments in turn are increasingly outsourcing to hmos as a way to lower costs and balance their budgets we prefer hmos with diversified business units exposure to faster growing areas of government including medicare and medicaid and opportunities to enhance their profitability through controlling costs information technology it 2 5 overweight 8 6 of the portfolio in the technology sector buzzwords such as artificial intelligence big data and disruption are increasingly utilised to describe growth opportunities and the overall operating environment of course a portion of it still incubates companies similar to the nascent high flying and cash poor innovators that ushered the u s equity market into the sharp rise and eventual tumble that is known as the dot com bubble however the fundamental identity of the typical technology company is also changing an increasing number of constituents in the it sector are what we refer to as industrial tech these firms are competitively insulated from disruptors well positioned to take advantage of long term secular tailwinds and exhibit growth in earnings and free cash flow a swelling number of companies in the sector have also adopted dividend payments to shareholders as a viable use of cash rejecting the notion that it firms can only add value to investors via their growth potential we believe this trend is poised to continue as many mature it companies are flush with cash and shareholders are increasingly willing to reward management teams for return of capital energy 1 1 overweight 9 2 of the portfolio the portfolio maintains a modest overweight to the energy sector within the sector we prefer exposure to large cap integrated oil and independent oil gas producers from a quality standpoint we seek to own companies with experienced management teams disciplined capex spending plans and exposure to lower cost resource assets from a valuation standpoint we seek to own companies with free cash flow generation and margin capture stories that are underappreciated by the street in summary we believe companies with strong balance sheets and cash flows production growth visibility operating specialisation and pricing power at the industry level remain most desirable from an investment perspective financials 0 9 overweight 24 6 of the portfolio financials represent the company s largest sector allocation and we remain particularly bullish on the u s banks insurers and insurance brokers we believe the u s banks are safer and sounder investments today than before the financial crisis they have stronger balance sheets i e higher capital levels revamped company cost structures and disciplined loan underwriting has contributed to benign credit trends bank valuations are compelling relative to other cyclical sectors i e industrials and potential tailwinds from deregulation and investor friendly capital return policies also bode well for investors in our view with regard to insurers and insurance brokers we like these companies for their attractive valuations and relatively stable business models over the last year insurers and brokers have benefited from strong pricing power pricing power is reflective of low u s interest rates two straight years of larger than expected catastrophe losses and large institutions i e american international taking capacity out of the market consumer discretionary 0 1 overweight 6 1 of the portfolio the balance sheet for u s consumers has improved in recent years aided by a recovering domestic housing market strong jobs growth and accelerating wages these factors have also contributed to an increase in consumer confidence we remain selective within the sector however as changing consumer preferences technological innovation and new competitors threaten traditional business models we believe these disruptive forces are best avoided through identifying stock specific investment opportunities that in our view are 1 trading at discounted valuations or 2 somewhat insulated from these disruptive pressures for example we are positive on retailers dollar general dollar store and lowe s companies home improvement as well as auto manufacturer general motors industrials 1 6 underweight 8 0 of the portfolio we are underweight to the industrials sector our selection is driven by relative valuations which we view as expensive in many cases versus other cyclical segments of the u s equity market notable portfolio positions in the sector include lockheed martin fedex and northrop grumman we continue to maintain meaningful exposure to the aerospace defence industry from a fundamental and operating model standpoint we continue to like the profiles of the large cap aerospace defence firms many of these companies have strong balance sheets good visibility into sales and earnings and historically have demonstrated shareholder friendly capital return policies further the three year outlook for defence spending looks strong thanks to the recently passed 2018 2019 department of defense budget communication services 1 6 underweight 6 6 of the portfolio we are underweight to communication services within the sector the portfolio is overweight to the diversified telecom services industry with our allocation concentrated in bellwether verizon communications the portfolio is underweight to the entertainment industry 0 exposure and modestly overweight to the media industry within media we hold positions in comcast and fox corp we view comcast as a steady earnings compounder driven by a strong competitive position and structural growth in broadband internet while fox corp boasts pricing power in its cable news segment that is in our view significantly underappreciated consumer staples 2 1 underweight 6 9 of the portfolio the consumer staples sector is a common destination for the conservative equity income investor historically many of these companies have offered investors recognisable brands diverse revenue streams exposure to growing end markets and the ability to garner pricing power these characteristics in turn have translated into strong and often stable free cash flow and growing dividends for shareholders in recent years some of these secular advantages have become challenged in our view due to changing consumer preferences greater end market competition from local brands and disruption from the rapid adoption of online shopping these challenges combined with higher than historical valuations have facilitated our underweight positioning in the sector notably we prefer ownership of companies with underappreciated growth profiles sticky customer bases and the ability to cut costs and or improve profit margins materials 2 5 underweight 1 8 of the portfolio our exposure to the materials sector consists of three chemicals stocks one building materials company and one packaging firm corteva dow dupont de nemours crh and international paper longer term secular trends in global population growth can potentially benefit well positioned companies in the agricultural chemical space further we like crh due to ageing european and u s infrastructure and the potential for acceleration in construction and infrastructure spending over time utilities 4 5 underweight 2 4 of the portfolio strong investor demand for equity income in recent years has resulted in elevated valuations for many high dividend yielding stocks including utilities companies despite rich valuations at the sector level we are finding pockets of opportunity in u s regulated utilities such as public service enterprise group peg nextera energy nee and firstenergy fe peg and nee add a level of stability and defensiveness to the portfolio through their durable dividend profiles and healthy earnings growth potential alternatively fe offers us exposure to a company with a good underlying regulated franchise with some near term uncertainties i e merchant business bankruptcy this uncertainty in our view creates opportunity for patient long term investors that are willing and capable of doing deep analysis on complex investment issues real estate 5 5 underweight 0 0 of the portfolio the real estate sector is our largest underweight position in the portfolio we maintain a 0 weighting in the sector due to our view that valuations are unattractive at current levels positioning and outlook our read on market fundamentals is a story in two parts the u s consumer remains a bright spot we expect the positive tone to continue the household savings rate is well above the pre crisis level seen in 2007 and jobs and wages are growing but not at an untenable pace the industrial side meanwhile is showing hints of recession purchasing managers indices are slowing globally partly as a result of the trade war north american industrial demand figures are softening with some categories recording negative growth for the first time since the last industrial recession in 2015 to 2016 in hindsight 2016 was a classic mid cycle slowdown today shows many parallels and we believe stocks can grind on supported by a strong u s consumer we concede this time could be riskier however as the cycle is older and the economy has less slack to offer a buffer our largest exposures are in the financials health care and energy sectors in recent months notable portfolio changes included increasing our allocation to the industrials and consumer discretionary sectors and reducing our exposure to the information technology and consumer staples sectors as always the strategy continues to emphasise investment in quality dividend paying companies with consideration toward balancing capital appreciation and current income over time tony despirito franco tapia and david zhao blackrock investment management llc 12

investment trust company within the meaning of section 1158 of the corporation tax act 2010 the company was incorporated on 30 august 2012 and this is the seventh annual report 2 accounting policies the principal accounting policies adopted by the company have been applied consistently other than where new policies have been adopted and are set out below a basis of preparation the financial statements have been prepared under the historic cost convention modified by the revaluation of financial assets and financial liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss and in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs as adopted by the european union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the companies act 2006 all of the company s operations are of a continuing nature insofar as the statement of recommended practice sorp for investment trust companies and venture capital trusts issued by the association of investment companies aic in november 2014 and updated in february 2018 is compatible with ifrs the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the guidance set out in the sorp substantially all of the assets of the company consist of securities that are readily realisable and accordingly the directors believe that the company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future consequently the directors have determined that it is appropriate for the financial statements to be prepared on a going concern basis the company s financial statements are presented in sterling which is the functional currency of the company and the currency of the primary economic environment in which the company operates all values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds 000 except where otherwise indicated a number of new standards amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for the annual periods beginning on or after 1 january 2019 and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements major changes and new standards issued are detailed below as these are not expected to have any effect on the measurement of the amounts recognised in the financial statements of the company ifrs standards that have yet to be adopted ifrs 16 leases effective 1 january 2019 specifies accounting for leases and removes the distinction between operating and finance leases this standard is not applicable to the company as it has no leases ifric 23 uncertainty over income tax treatments seeks to provide clarity on how to account for uncertainty over income tax treatments and specifies that an entity must consider whether it is probable that the relevant tax authority will accept each tax treatment or group of tax treatments that it plans to use in its income tax filing the interpretation also requires companies to reassess the judgements and estimates applied if facts and circumstances change the interpretation is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 january 2019 the interpretation would require the company to recognise uncertain tax positions which are more than probable within its financial statements the interpretation is unlikely to have any impact on the financial statements of the company adoption of new and amended standards and interpretations ifrs 9 financial instruments the classification and measurement requirements of ifrs 9 have been adopted retrospectively as of the date of initial application on 1 november 2018 however the company has chosen to take advantage of the option not to restate comparatives therefore the 2018 comparative figures are presented and measured under ias 39 all financial assets previously held at fair value continue to be measured at fair value and accordingly there has been no impact as a result of the adoption of ifrs 9 all financial assets that were classified as loans and receivables and measured at amortised cost continue to be so and there was no material impact of expected credit losses on financial assets and financial liabilities measured at amortised cost ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers the company adopted ifrs 15 as of the date of initial application of 1 november 2018 ifrs 15 replaces ias 18 revenue and establishes a five step model to account for revenue arising from contracts with customers in addition guidance on interest and dividend income has been moved from ias 18 to ifrs 9 without significant changes to the requirements therefore there was no impact of adopting ifrs 15 for the company b presentation of the statement of comprehensive income in order to better reflect the activities of an investment trust company and in accordance with guidance issued by the aic supplementary information which analyses the statement of comprehensive income between items of a revenue and a capital nature has been presented alongside the statement of comprehensive income c segmental reporting the directors are of the opinion that the company is engaged in a single segment of business being investment business d income dividends receivable on equity shares are recognised as revenue for the year on an ex dividend basis where no ex dividend date is available dividends receivable on or before the year end are treated as revenue for the year provision is made for any dividends not expected to be received special dividends if any are treated as a capital or a revenue receipt depending on the facts or circumstances of each dividend the return on a debt security is recognised on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective yield on the debt security options may be purchased or written over securities held in the portfolio for generating or protecting capital returns or for generating or maintaining revenue returns where the purpose of the option is the generation of income the premium is treated as a revenue item where the purpose of the option is the maintenance of capital the premium is treated as a capital item option premium income is recognised as revenue evenly over the life of the option contract and included in the revenue column of the statement of comprehensive income unless the option has been written for the maintenance and enhancement of the company s investment portfolio and represents an incidental part of a larger capital transaction in which case any premia arising are allocated to the capital column of the statement of comprehensive income deposit interest receivable is accounted for on an accruals basis where the company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash the cash equivalent of the dividend is recognised as revenue any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in capital e expenses all expenses including finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis expenses have been charged wholly to the revenue column of the statement of comprehensive income except as follows expenses which are incidental to the acquisition or sale of an investment are charged to the capital column of the statement of comprehensive income details of transaction costs on the purchases and sales of investments are disclosed within note 9 to the financial statements contained within the company s annual report for the year ended 31 october 2019 expenses are treated as capital where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated the investment management fee and finance costs have been allocated 75 to the capital column and 25 to the revenue column of the statement of comprehensive income in line with the board s expectations of the long term split of returns in the form of capital gains and income respectively from the investment portfolio f taxation the tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax the tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expenses that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible the company s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that were applicable at the balance sheet date where expenses are allocated between capital and revenue any tax relief in respect of expenses is allocated between capital and revenue returns on the marginal basis using the company s effective rate of corporation tax for the accounting period deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all temporary differences that have originated but not reversed at the financial reporting date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the financial reporting date this is subject to deferred tax assets only being recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the temporary differences can be deducted deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the rates applicable to the legal jurisdictions in which they arise g investments held at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with ifrs 9 the company classifies its investments at initial recognition as held at fair value through profit or loss and are managed and evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with its investment strategy and business model all investments are measured initially and subsequently at fair value through profit or loss purchases of investments are recognised on a trade date basis sales of investments are recognised at the trade date of the disposal the fair value of the financial investments is based on their quoted bid price at the financial reporting date without deduction for the estimated selling costs this policy applies to all current and non current asset investments held by the company changes in the value of investments held at fair value through profit or loss and gains and losses on disposal are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as profits or losses on investments held at fair value through profit or loss also included within the heading are transaction costs in relation to the purchase or sale of investments for all financial instruments not traded in an active market the fair value is determined by using various valuation techniques valuation techniques include market approach i e using recent arm s length market transactions adjusted as necessary and reference to the current market value of another instrument that is substantially the same and the income approach e g discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing models making use of available and supportable market data as possible h options options are held at fair value through profit or loss based on the bid offer prices of the options written to which the company is exposed the value of the option is subsequently marked to market to reflect the fair value through profit or loss of the option based on traded prices where the premium is taken to revenue an appropriate amount is shown as capital return such that the total return reflects the overall change in the fair value of the option when an option is exercised the gain or loss is accounted for as a capital gain or loss any cost on closing out an option is transferred to revenue along with any remaining unamortised premium i other receivables and other payables other receivables and other payables do not carry any interest and are short term in nature and are accordingly stated on an amortised cost basis j dividends payable under ifrs final dividends should not be accrued in the financial statements unless they have been approved by shareholders before the financial reporting date interim dividends should not be accrued in the financial statements unless they have been paid dividends payable to equity shareholders are recognised in the statement of changes in equity k foreign currency translation transactions involving foreign currencies are converted at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities and non monetary assets held at fair value are translated into sterling at the rate ruling on the financial reporting date foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as a revenue or capital item depending on the income or expense to which they relate for investment transactions and investments held at the year end denominated in a foreign currency the resulting gains or losses are included in the profit loss on investments held at fair value through profit or loss in the statement of comprehensive income l cash and cash equivalents cash comprises cash in hand and on demand deposits cash equivalents are short term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value m bank borrowings bank overdrafts are recorded as the proceeds received finance charges are accounted for on an accruals basis in the statement of comprehensive income using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the instruments to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise n share repurchases and reissues shares repurchased and subsequently cancelled share capital is reduced by the nominal value of the shares repurchased and the capital redemption reserve is correspondingly increased in accordance with section 733 of the companies act 2006 the full cost of the repurchase is charged to the special reserve shares repurchased and held in treasury the full cost of the repurchase is charged to the special reserve where treasury shares are subsequently reissued amounts received to the extent of the repurchase price are credited to the special reserve and any surplus received in excess of the repurchase price is taken to the share premium account o critical accounting estimates and judgements the company makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future the resulting accounting estimates and assumptions will by definition seldom equal the related actual results estimates and judgements are regularly evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the directors do not believe that any accounting judgements or estimates have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year 3 income 2019 000 2018 000 investment income uk dividends 312

year ended december 31 2019 acadian delivered another year of solid operating and financial performance weighted average prices and harvesting costs remained stable year over year and operating results benefited from lower year end harvested log inventories and decreased administrative costs commented erika reilly interim chief executive officer of acadian the company s adjusted ebitda1 totaled 23 6 million in 2019 compared to 22 1 million during 2018 and the adjusted ebitda1 margin climbed to 24 from 22 in 2018 key factors contributing to the year over year improvement in adjusted ebitda1 include lower management and performance fees due to the termination of the management agreement with brookfield timberlands management lp announced in the third quarter of this year and the benefit of reduced year end inventory levels compared to the prior year as the inventory management program with one of acadian s customers that was in place during the fourth quarter of 2018 was not in place this year acadian declared dividends to its shareholders of 1 16 per share during the year representing a payout ratio1 of 103 which is above our long term target but in line with expectations given the 3 increase in our quarterly dividend per share announced in february 2019 we anticipate that over the long term we will revert to a payout ratio consistent with our target level during the fourth quarter acadian signed a term sheet with metlife investment management llc to refinance its credit facilities under essentially the same terms as the existing facilities but with slightly more favourable interest rates and with maturity dates ranging from 5 to 10 years from the date of closing acadian expects to complete this refinancing during the first quarter of 2020

prior year the company benefited from a 3 increase in sales volume excluding biomass due to improved demand for softwood pulpwood but this was partially offset by lower biomass sales and a modest decrease in timber services activity acadian s weighted average selling price excluding biomass was almost unchanged year over year with softwood sawlog and pulpwood price improvements of 2 and 13 respectively offset by a greater proportion of relatively lower valued softwood pulpwood in the mix of products sold operating costs of 77 8 million in 2019 were down 1 from 78 8 million in the prior year due to lower harvest volumes and administrative costs acadian generated adjusted ebitda of 23 6 million during 2019 compared to 22 1 million in the prior year while the adjusted ebitda margin for 2019 increased to 24 from 22 in 2018 the net income for the year ended december 31 2019 totaled 17 3 million or 1 04 per share compared to net income of 26 3 million or 1 57 per share in 2018 the variance from the prior year is primarily due to fees related to the termination of the management agreement with brookfield timberlands management lp that was announced in the third quarter of this year which after income tax reduced net income by 12 8 million or 0 77 per share this was partially offset by an operating earnings improvement of 1 2 million for the reasons discussed above and lower income tax expense of 2 8 million after adjusting for the effect of the termination fee the effect of an unrealized foreign exchange gain on the revaluation of u s dollar denominated long term debt of 4 7 million compared to an unrealized loss in the prior year of 7 5 million was almost entirely offset by a smaller fair value revaluation of timber assets compared to the prior year segment

compared to 74 8 million in 2018 the sales volume excluding biomass increased 2 over the prior year primarily due to lower inventory levels at the end of 2019 and improved demand for softwood pulpwood the biomass sales volume fell 34 as a customer who utilized biomass to generate electricity ceased operations during the year and a portion of the harvesting during the year was changed to a system that is more cost effective but generates less biomass material the weighted average selling price excluding biomass was 1 higher than in the prior year as prices improved for softwood sawlogs and pulpwood but the product mix was more heavily weighted to softwood pulpwood revenues from timber services and other sales fell 4 due to lower operating activity than in the prior year operating costs for the year were 56 2 million compared to 58 5 million during 2018 due to lower harvest volumes variable harvest costs per m3 excluding biomass were unchanged year over year adjusted ebitda for the year ended december 31 2019 was 18 6 million compared to 16 6 million during 2018 and the adjusted ebitda margin for the year increased to 25 from 22 in the prior year reflecting the benefit of lower management and performance fees due to the termination of the management agreement and reduced year end inventory levels compared to the prior year as the inventory management program with one of the operation s customers that was in place during the fourth quarter of 2018 was not in place this year for the year ended december 31 2019 new brunswick timberlands experienced no recordable safety

adjusted ebitda margin 26 27 year ended december 31 2019 sales for the year ended december 31 2019 totaled 25 9 million for maine timberlands compared to 25 1 million during the prior year the sales volume excluding biomass increased 6 year over year reflecting improved demand for softwood pulpwood however this heavier weighting to pulpwood contributed to the weighted average selling price excluding biomass falling 2 the weighted average selling price excluding biomass in u s dollar terms decreased 5 year over year as the benefit of improved prices for softwood and hardwood pulpwood was more than offset by a decrease in softwood sawlog prices due to pricing pressure resulting from weakness in lumber prices in north america and a greater percentage of softwood pulpwood in the mix of products sold operating costs for the year were 19 9 million compared to 19 0 million during 2018 reflecting the increase in softwood harvest volumes as well variable harvest costs per m3 excluding biomass increased 2 compared with the prior year due to modest increases in harvesting and hauling contractor rates adjusted ebitda for the year ended december 31 2019 was 6 7 million almost unchanged from 6 8 million during the prior year with the benefit of increased sales volumes offset by lower per m3 margins adjusted ebitda margin slipped to 26 from 27 in the prior year period for the year ended december 31 2019 maine timberlands experienced no recordable safety incidents among employees and contractors market outlook the following contains forward looking information about acadian timber corp s market outlook for the remainder of 2020 reference should be made to the section entitled cautionary statement regarding forward looking information and statements section of this news release for a description of material factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements in the following please see the risk factors section of our management s discussion and analysis of acadian s most recent annual report and annual information form available on our website at www acadiantimber com or filed with sedar at www sedar com the outlook for acadian s key products softwood sawlogs and hardwood pulpwood is for demand and pricing to remain stable in the near term the softwood lumber market the end use market for our softwood sawlogs is expected to benefit from slightly stronger u s housing starts in 2020 while the u s repair and remodeling sector is expected to hold flat at its 2019 level according to fastmarkets risi the consensus forecast is for 1 31 million u s housing starts in 2020 compared to 1 29 million total starts in 2019 with growth driven by the single family sector a low supply of existing homes low mortgage rates and a strong labour market support the improved outlook for u s home building however supply side factors including increased wood supply from central europe and reduced north american exports to china as well as builders focus on smaller more affordable homes which contain less wood may mute some of the benefits of this more positive u s housing outlook demand and pricing for our hardwood pulpwood is expected to remain stable with our largest hardwood pulpwood customers operating at full capacity we expect hardwood pulpwood supply coming from other major landowners in the region to decrease as they reduce their harvest levels which should tighten the regional market for this product over time the outlook for acadian s other products is mixed acadian s hardwood sawlog sales in the u s are coming under pressure as an indirect result of chinese duties on u s exports however hardwood sawlog sales to acadian s canadian customers remain stable as they are focused on species such as hard maple and yellow birch and on industrial lumber products including railway ties pallets and flooring that have not been as impacted by the u s china trade war demand for softwood pulpwood from our new brunswick timberlands remains steady however markets for softwood pulpwood in maine have recently weakened with high regional softwood pulpwood inventories due to the slower than anticipated startup of a pulp mill in the region once this mill reaches full operating capacity demand for this product is expected to improve finally while the biomass markets in maine remain weak without any significant changes in sight the new brunswick biomass market continues to be supported by steady demand at attractive prices we have been successful in developing relationships with new customers to replace volume to customers that have reduced or closed their operations which is improving the outlook for 2020 management team changes acadian announced today that mr adam sheparski has

india s narendra modi led bharatiya janata party bjp government has presented a 30 4 trillion rupee us 425 billion budget for the 2020 21 fiscal year that provides modest sops for big business and the well to do and increased austerity for working people presented to parliament by finance minister nirmala sitharaman on february 1 the budget was unveiled five months after the government announced a slew of impromptu pro big business measures including a massive corporate tax cut and accelerated privatization drive in the name of boosting flagging economic growth however in the interim india s economy continued to falter due to steep declines in consumer demand and business investment and the reluctance of banks weighed down by unpaid corporate loans to extend credit in the third quarter of 2019 economic growth fell to a more than six year low of 4 5 percent even as inflation rose sharply india prime minister narendra modi speaks in houston ap photo michael wyke citing an economic slowdown in india that has surprised everyone the international monetary fund imf recently cut its global growth projection for 2020 the imf now anticipates india will record 4 8 percent real gdp growth in 2019 as compared with the 6 1 percent it projected as recently as october it has also slashed its projection for 2020 to 5 8 percent down almost a full percentage point from its previous forecast with both big and small businesses slashing jobs india s unemployment rate has soared reaching almost ten percent in urban areas whereas some economists had spoken in recent years of india experiencing jobless growth a recent article in the economic and political weekly argued india has now transitioned from jobless to job loss growth in ruling class circles there is growing apprehension that the ongoing nationwide protests against the bjp s anti muslim citizenship amendment act will intersect with mounting popular anger over the jobs crisis endemic poverty and ever deepening social inequality and trigger a social explosion in the run up to the second budget of their second term modi and the bjp faced conflicting demands from domestic big business and the mouthpieces of international finance capital such as the imf indian business was pressing for the government to kick start the economy by providing fiscal stimulus i e by boosting government spending on infrastructure projects useful to business such as building or improving roads ports and electricity supply and by implementing further tax cuts the imf on the other hand sternly warned the indian government that it needed to maintain fiscal discipline and resume its stalled effort to reduce the annual budget deficit in a recent report the imf complained that india s state debt at 68 5 percent of gdp is among the highest in emerging markets it urged the modi government to eschew new infrastructure projects saying that to generate the revenue needed to get them off the ground india s debt must be reduced and to instead focus on structural reforms that is according to the imf it should concentrate on eliminating all remaining restrictions on the layoff of workers further accelerate the privatization of state owned enterprises make it easier for enterprises to assemble large parcels of land and otherwise ease the regulatory burden on business in the end modi and sitharaman resisted the calls for large scale fiscal stimulus and pressed forward with social spending austerity the finance minister subsequently defended this claiming india s economy will soon be on the mend and avowing the bjp would not repeat the mistakes of the splurging an apparent reference to the tens of billions of dollars the previous congress party led government spent to stimulate demand during the post 2008 slump but the reality is the indian capitalist elite and its government have little room for maneuver in preparing the budget the bjp found itself caught between the anvil of a 42 billion shortfall in projected tax revenue and the hammer of increased debt financing costs the budget has projected a deficit equivalent to 3 8 percent of india s gdp for fiscal year 2019 20 up 0 5 percentage points from what the government promised in last july s budget and a 3 5 percent deficit in 2020 21 however many analysts believe these figures are based on rosy projections of growth tax revenue and privatization receipts at us 425 billion india s total budget is less than 40 percent of that of the united kingdom although the latter s population of 67 million is only a tiny fraction of india s 1 37 billion out of this interest payments on the government debt represent rs 7 1 trillion 100 billion or about 23 5 percent of all state expenditure when combined with india s 66 billion military budget the world s third largest some 40 percent of the budget is already accounted for leaving just 18 2 trillion rupees 257 billion for all other spending attacking the most vulnerable the bjp budget inflicts its cruellest cuts on the most vulnerable sections of the rural poor with 1 3 billion being slashed from the mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee program mgnregp a program that literally determines whether tens of millions of rural poor eat or not mgnregp statutorily guarantees 100 days per year of menial minimum wage work such as digging ditches although the program has repeatedly been oversubscribed with many more seeking mcnregp work than available jobs the bjp has slashed the program s budget from an already meager rs 710 billion 10 billion to a mere rs 615 billion 8 66 billion to discourage impoverished rural workers from availing themselves of even this skimpy benefit the modi government has repeatedly held up the release of the funds that pay their wages the budget provides a minuscule rs 675 billion 9 5 billion for health care which translates to 7 30 rs 519 per person over the course of the entire year education spending is just rs 993 billion 14 billion or some 10 billion less than the education budget of the city of new york to boost consumption and also no doubt placate its middle class supporters the bjp announced a 5 6 billion per year tax cut that targets the 98 million or so indians who earn regular wages or salaries in the formal or organized sector of the economy the finance minister loudly proclaimed a decrease of income tax rates of between 5 and 10 percent for persons earning less than rs 1 5 million 21 000 per year however to benefit from the cuts people must forego their current exemptions and deductions given that 72 percent of regular workers earn less than rs 216 000 3 040 per year to begin with this will hardly provide a major boost to consumer demand the finance minister handed corporations one of their main demands she announced the elimination of the dividend distribution tax ddt which corporations used to pay directly to the government when they distributed dividends to stockholders these taxes are now to be paid by the people who receive the dividend meaning in many if not most cases the taxation rate will be lower last september sitharaman announced a major reduction in corporate tax rates that according to the recently released economic survey es 2019 20 has mostly benefited india s largest corporations despite the cash windfall from the reduction in their taxes estimated by the es as a gain of between 18 5 to 27 3 percent of existing tax liability corporations have used the funds to shore up their balance sheets not re invest in this month s budget sitharaman also announced a gargantuan privatization drive for the coming fiscal year to the tune of rs 2 1 trillion 30 billion double the 2019 20 goal this includes selling off a portion of the giant wholly government owned life insurance corporation of india and the national airline air india this adds to last november s announcement that the government is selling off its entire 53 3 percent stake in the highly profitable bharat petroleum bpcl its 64 percent share of the shipping corporation of india which owns india s biggest ocean fleet and its 31 8 percent share of the container corporation of india on january 8 tens of millions of workers across india joined a one day general strike to protest the modi government s five and a half year assault on indian workers of which the handing over of public assets to big business is a key component even while the modi government proclaims one of its major goals is to transform india into a production chain hub for world capital rivalling china india has increasingly resorted to protectionist measures as have the us and other major capitalist powers the budget sharply increased tariffs on many goods including footwear refrigerators furniture toys and mobile phone parts not coincidentally china is a major exporter to india of many of the affected goods the modi government has garnered a justifiably notorious reputation for fudging and inflating budget numbers despite the economy being mired in a long term crisis it has based many of its budget calculations on an exaggerated growth rate projection of 6 to 6 5 percent for 2020 21 this is so it can inflate revenue figures and produce as a result a smaller and entirely fictitious fiscal deficit estimate from sitharaman s rambling close to three hour budget speech one would hardly get any sense that the modi government is presiding over a socioeconomic disaster that has pushed hundreds of millions to the brink of hunger and starvation according to the finance minister fundamentals of the economy are strong and that has ensured macroeconomic stability inflation has been well contained india s stock market reflecting the sentiments of foreign and domestic speculators gave a decided thumbs down with the two major stock market indices falling by about 2 5 percent in the hours following the budget speech this was due both to apprehensions about the prospects for the indian economy and concerns that the markets may not be liquid enough to support the government s massive privatization drive in other words there are fears private businesses may not be able to raise sufficient capital from financial markets as the government sucks up funds with its selloffs of lic air india and other assets the author also recommends bjp to table indian budget amid mounting economic crisis

organization we are advancing growth initiatives in each of our platforms and at the same time we continue to take actions to address and mitigate macroeconomic challenges let me turn to our fourth quarter results for the quarter global net sales delivered modest growth absent 55 million of negative foreign exchange impacts net sales were up 4 versus our prior year adjusted operating income for the quarter was down 5 year over year however up 1 absent foreign exchange translation impacts for the full year our global net sales were down 1 absent 292 million of negative foreign currency impacts net sales were up 4 versus the prior year adjusted operating income was down 8 versus prior year and down 2 absent foreign exchange translation impacts this year we progressed our driving growth road map by advancing on trend specialty growth platforms in our specialties portfolio now represents 30 of our total net sales specialty growth was led primarily by the starch based texturizers as well as sugar reduction and specialty sweeteners starch based texturizers delivered low single digit net sales growth driven by contributions from our tapioca and potato starch portfolios as well as the acquisition and integration of our western polymer as for our sugar reduction and specialty sweetener platform we delivered high single digit net sales growth during the quarter driven by greater consumer demand for non gmo sweeteners and sugar reduction ingredients in november we opened our allulose facility in mexico and have already generated our first allulose sales throughout 2019 we made significant investments in plant based proteins to meet growing customer demand we are now well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity and are on schedule for 2020 production we are leveraging our broadened ingredient portfolio and formulation capabilities to advance our approach to customer co creation we ve now operationalized design thinking and speed to market principles to accelerate the innovation process and are engaged with select customers who most value this close form of collaboration throughout this year our team did a tremendous job streamlining our organization and redefining the way we work we achieved significant improvements in operational efficiencies and delivered nearly 75 million of run rate savings well in excess of our 30 million to 40 million cost smart savings target for 2019 we have broadened and accelerated our transformation efforts and as a result are increasing our three year savings target to 150 million in 2021 now let s move to discuss the highlights of each region s performance in north america sales were up slightly for the quarter versus prior year favorable price mix offset the planned stockton volume shed of high fructose corn syrup and industrial starch operating income was 113 million down 1 year over year improved price mix versus the prior year and cost smart savings benefits were more than offset by higher corn costs for the year sales were down slightly primarily due to the planned stockton volume shed which was partially offset by favorable price mix and specialties growth operating income was 522 million down 4 for the year the region faced higher net costs as a result of depressed co product values and a late harvest in 2019 we added western polymer expanding our specialty potato starch manufacturing capacity and broadening our customer base which is at the heart of our growth strategy in north america turning to south america we had very strong performance in the region with sales up 7 during the quarter this was led by strong price mix and volume growth across the region partially offset by currency weakness we are particularly pleased that this is south america s second consecutive quarter of profitable growth up 13 in the fourth quarter this improvement was driven by favorable pricing actions in argentina and higher volumes also as part of cost smart we began implementation of a transformational reorganization which delivered benefits in the quarter and i m very proud of the team in south america as they have effectively managed and continue to navigate a very volatile business environment for the year south america s sales were down 3 the region experienced 200 million of foreign currency weakness partially offset by 151 million of pricing actions south america s operating income was down 3 for the year foreign exchange impact and higher corn costs were partially offset by pricing specialties volume growth and cost smart savings in asia pacific sales for the quarter were down 4 due to unfavorable price mix operating income was down 7 million partially driven by increased corn costs in australia asia pacific results were also pressured in the continued macroeconomic weakness across northern asia for the year sales were down 2 due to unfavorable currency impact primarily in korea operating income was down 17 million for the year driven by weakness across northern asian economies which were impacted by trade disputes and higher input costs we also experienced increased corn costs in australia as part of cost smart which includes network optimization we made the decision to close our lane cove facility in australia due to persistent corn cost increases from water scarcity we expect to realize input cost benefits over the next three years i d like to pause for a moment and share that we are monitoring the developments and impact to date of this coronavirus first and foremost we have taken actions to minimize the risk to our employees in china and across the region as well as address business continuity concerns for our customers we are not impacted financially in the quarter and it is premature to speculate on the extent of the 2020 impact we remain close to the situation as we keep our employees health and safety and our customers need top of mind now moving to emea our sales were slightly down for the quarter absent foreign exchange impacts which occurred primarily in europe net sales for the region were up 7 operating income was down 2 million driven by higher input costs primarily in europe for the year net sales were down 2 primarily driven by this foreign currency weakness in pakistan operating income was down 17 million for the year driven by higher corn costs and foreign exchange impacts in both pakistan and europe in pakistan the team worked very hard to largely mitigate the weakness in the rupee through strong pricing actions now let me turn it over to jim gray who ll review the financial results in more detail jim gray executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you jim net sales of 1 549 million were up 1 for the quarter versus prior year gross profit margin was flat as favorable price mix offset higher input costs and foreign exchange impacts reported and adjusted operating incomes were 170 million and 168 million respectively reported operating income was slightly higher resulting from a 22 million benefit from indirect tax credits recorded in brazil partially offset by 16 million of restructuring charges associated with cost smart and 4 million of integration and other costs our reported net adjusted earnings per share were both 1 61 fourth quarter net sales of 1 549 million was up 1 versus prior year unfavorable fx of 56 million was primarily attributable to weaker currency valuations volume was flat while favorable price mix accounted for 68 million of net sales increase in north america net sales were up slightly versus prior year price mix was up 3 as a result of product mix and price pass through of higher corn costs this was partially offset by volume as we see wet milling at our stockton facility in november 2018 in south america net sales were up 7 with volume up 9 across the region price mix was up 16 as our teams took price increases to recapture the foreign exchange impacts felt in argentina brazil and colombia apac net sales declined 4 due to lower sales primarily in aseani as customers benefited from the pass through of lower tapioca root cost emea net sales declined 1 due to the foreign exchange rate impacts partially offset by favorable pricing actions in pakistan for the quarter reported and adjusted operating income increased 12 million and decreased 9 million respectively the decrease in adjusted operating income was due to asia pacific factors that jim has previously highlighted corporate costs increased by 3 million versus the prior year due to lapping of adjustments and continued investments to drive innovation and streamline global processes i ll wrap up fourth quarter with a discussion of our earnings bridge on the left side of the page here you can see the reconciliation from reported to adjusted on the right side operationally we saw a decrease of 0 10 per share for the quarter driven by foreign exchange impacts other income and margin of a negative 0 12 negative 0 06 and negative 0 03 per share respectively volume improvements had a positive contribution of 0 11 per share moving to our nonoperational items we saw an increase of 0 10 per share for the quarter driven by a lower tax rate in lower average shares outstanding which contributed a benefit of 0 07 per share and 0 04 per share respectively turning to our full year results we delivered 6 2 billion of net sales which was slightly down versus prior year reported and adjusted operating incomes were 664 million and 705 million respectively reported operating income was lower than adjusted operating income by 41 million as 57 million of restructuring charges related to the cost smart of 6 million of integration and other costs were partially offset by 22 million benefit from indirect tax credits recorded in brazil our reported and adjusted earnings per share was 6 13 and 6 65 respectively as just mentioned full year net sales of 6 2 billion was slightly down unfavorable foreign exchange of 292 million was partially offset by the favorable price mix of 264 million volume was slightly down due to planned stockton volume shed in north america net sales were down slightly versus prior year as a result of planned stockton shed which was partially offset by price mix in south america net sales were down 3 due to unfavorable foreign currency impacts which were partially offset by price increases of 15 and volume increases of 2 apac net sales declined 2 due to foreign exchange while volume and price mix remained flat emea net sales declined 2 driven by foreign exchange impacts primarily in pakistan partially offset by price mix increases of 7 and volume growth of 2 full year reported and adjusted operating incomes were 664 million and 705 million a decrease of 39 million in a decrease of 62 million respectively south america operating income decreased slightly versus prior year as the region overcame significant first half foreign exchange impacts and demonstrated strong price mix and volume gains in the second half north america operating income was challenged primarily by higher net corn costs throughout the year asia pacific operating income was down 16 versus prior year as the region faced weakness across the northern asian economies impacted by trade disputes and higher corn costs in the region and higher operating costs in australia emea operating income performance was primarily impacted by challenging business conditions in europe higher corn costs and foreign currency weakness were the largest drivers now we ll shift to the full year eps bridge and on the left side of the page you can see the reconciliation from reported to adjusted on the right side operationally we saw a decrease of 0 65 per share for the full year driven by foreign exchange impacts margin and other income of negative 0 49 0 25 and 0 10 per share respectively volume improvements had a favorable impact of 0 19 per share moving to our nonoperational items we saw an increase of 0 38 per share for the full year now primarily driven by lower average shares outstanding which contributed a benefit of 0 41 per share our financing costs are a net result of a benefit from favorable lap of exchange losses from the prior year partially offset by current year increase in hyperinflation adjustments of 0 10 per share moving to cash flow 2019 cash provided by our operations was 680 million capital expenditures were 328 million down 22 million from the prior year however full year 2019 capital commitments were 347 million as we continue to invest in our growth platforms acquisitions and investments were 52 million reflecting investments in western polymer and other ventures and we have returned 174 million in dividends to investors turning to our income statement outlook we anticipate 2020 adjusted earnings per share in the range of 6 60 and 7 20 this excludes acquisition related integration and restructuring costs as well as any potential impairment costs we expect net sales and adjusted operating income to be up versus last year we anticipate foreign exchange impact to be negative in 2020 with unfavorable impact of negative 0 10 to negative 0 20 per share corporate expenses are expected to be up 15 to 20 year over year partially due to the centralization of both regional costs to support center led growth initiatives and technology investments we anticipate increasing our cumulative end of year run rate cost smart savings from 74 million in 2019 to 90 million to 100 million by the end of 2020 financing costs for 2020 are expected to be in the range of 80 million to 85 million this also includes an expectation of more than a 10 million negative impact due to hyperinflation our adjusted effective annual tax rate is expected to be 26 to 27 we are assuming total diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the range of 67 million to 68 million for the year in north america 2020 net sales and operating incomes are expected to be up supported by specialty volume growth as sales momentum builds for plant based proteins and allulose we also expect a favorable impact from cost smart savings now moving to south america full year net sales and adjusted operating income are expected to be up volumes are expected to be up asia pacific net sales are expected to be up and operating income is expected to be modestly up as we mentioned we are closely monitoring the impact of the coronavirus and we ll provide an update in our first quarter call emea net sales are expected to be up and operating income is expected to be modestly up we expect that cash from operations to be in the range of 640 million to 710 million we also expect to invest between 285 million and 305 million in capital expenditures as we continue to invest in our specialty growth platforms in closing we continued making investments to grow our specialty platforms while further optimizing our core business and which produced more stable results this year despite an even greater foreign exchange impact we continue to generate substantial cash from our operations and remain committed to returning value to shareholders with that let me hand back to jim jim zallie president and chief executive officer thanks jim 2019 was a year in which we made meaningful progress positioning the company for improved performance and profitability we advanced the five growth platforms and our driving growth road map and continue to increase the share of our specialty net sales as a percentage of the total cost portfolio across our markets our specialty investments are aligned with consumer trends and our strong relationships with customers are creating new opportunities and greater demand further positioning us for growth we could not have achieved this without the hard work commitment and focus of our 11 000 employees around the world that bring their best to the company each and every day for the 11th consecutive year we were recognized by fortune magazine as one of the world s most admired companies we are also proud to have been included in the bloomberg s gender equality index for the third consecutive year these distinctions are a testament to our purpose driven culture of bringing together the potential of people nature and technology to make life better we will be presenting at cagny next week on february 18th and we look forward to discussing our driving growth agenda in more detail thank you and now let s open the call for questions questions answers operator our first question comes from ben bienvenu with stephens inc ben bienvenu stephens inc analyst hey thanks good morning jim zallie president and chief executive officer hey ben jim gray executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning ben ben bienvenu stephens inc analyst i wanted to start asking about kind of a tough one because i know it s open ended and a moving target but coronavirus if you could talk about what you have seen to the extent you ve seen anything so far in 1q whether it s any demand destruction or the logistical challenges that are impacting costs directly on our business and then indirectly obviously we ve seen the impact on soybean meal and soybean oil prices which impact the co product values but if you could just talk about as it stands right now kind of what the direct and indirect impacts are on your business as it relates to coronavirus jim zallie president and chief executive officer yes so jim let me take that and you can add any commentary yes so first of all we have two manufacturing facilities in china both of those facilities are respectively about 850 kilometers from wuhan in different provinces the impact so far that we have seen is like most of the companies a delay mandated by the government for employees that went away for chinese new year to return back and then in some cases some mixed signals around quarantine time periods that being said one of our factories has been operating uninterrupted the other factory has been operating one line only with an abbreviated staff and it has been delayed in its production by approximately two weeks all of our employees are safe none of our employees thus far that we know of have contracted coronavirus and the office has a protocol in place in regards to how to operate the sales office and which has been operating each and every day with reduced staff jim as far as the impact do you want to make that jim gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yes right now it s and so i think it s hard to speculate because really we just have a delay in some of our people coming back to work we have sufficient inventories it s really about what the delay in demand for shipping might turn out to be so that s really where we kind of we just have to see kind of every two weeks how it plays out throughout q1 jim zallie president and chief executive officer there clearly will be a slowdown in demand from our customers as well as their operations are equally impacted and i think that that s something that we can anticipate but yet at this point cannot quantify so we are monitoring the situation obviously very closely and depending on how long this situation drags on the impacts to the supply chain down the road in the future is something that we have to watch in the near term we have ample inventory for customers again one of our factories is operating unrestricted and another one line is operating and the other line should be operating here by the end of the week actually jim gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yes and then maybe so ben the second part of your question was do you see soybean demand backing up and what are the ramifications on some of the co products that we sell i think if you witnessed over the last month to two months at least the soybean oil corn oil palm oil have all been significantly up due to some constraints in those marketplaces and we ve seen some softening of corn gluten meal prices again we are going to watch how much anticipated demand i think can back up on soy and on whether or not there s decisions to crush that and whether or not that impacts the availability of both soy meal as well as soy oil but right now it seems like a lot of the crushing is going toward to produce more soy oil because and that s the better part of the arbitrage ben bienvenu stephens inc analyst fair enough and so as it relates to the guidance you have a bit wider range you guys gave a wide range last year is that uncertainty around coronavirus contemplated in the guidance at all as we look toward the lower end of the guidance range then more question on guidance generally your outlook for net corn costs that s incorporated into the guidance for 2020 jim gray executive vice president and chief financial officer do you want me i ll take that jim zallie president and chief executive officer yes sure jim gray executive vice president and chief financial officer so i think with our guidance when we were obviously assembling that and pulling that together corona was not kind of a factor on the horizon so generally it does not include any kind of significant or delayed impacts if those will even materialize as jim mentioned we are up and running in one of the facilities and the other facility has at least one production line running with regard to more of our outlook for co product values as it relates to our cost of corn i assume that the scope of that we really kind of more around north america or u s canada when we pull together our estimates we are really doing that kind of more back in december in november december when those prices are in place and we see the run up in some of the co product values very recently we are waiting to see if those have a kind of an enduring longevity throughout the year so that s really not our guidance really on the co products and is really more kind of based on what we might see as kind of more than three year average during our fourth quarter ben bienvenu stephens inc analyst ok perfect thanks a lot jim zallie president and chief executive officer i do think it s important to point out regarding china that it s between 2 and 2 5 of our sales overall as one company so just to help put it in perspective ben bienvenu stephens inc analyst yes perfect thanks guys jim zallie president and chief executive officer sure operator our next question comes from heather jones with heather jones research heather jones heather jones research analyst good morning thanks for the question just as a follow up on ben s question so i just wanted to sort of condense what you guys said so there s no impact from coronavirus built into your guidance because you pulled it together prior to that becoming a bigger factor but it would need to spill over given the relative size of china to your business we will need to see the spillover impact into europe south america etc for it to be meaningful in your opinion am i understanding your commentary correctly jim zallie president and chief executive officer i think given the fact that we are having the call today and we finalized everything in prep for this call that it doesn t as jim said take into account any significant or meaningful impact of the coronavirus but it does take into account what we know as we sit here today as we have provided guidance which does take into effect some impact as i just described in relationship to the operations for example so that s what i would say about how we view coronavirus and again china is about 2 to 2 5 of our overall sales as a company so hopefully that helps with this answer and it s just too early right now to fully assess the total impact heather jones heather jones research analyst that is helpful moving to north america which is obviously the big driver of your business i was wondering if you could give us a sense of the visibility you have into our guidance there you mentioned that it will my takeaway from your comments was that your guidance doesn t give effect to the recent very recent run we ve seen in veg oil prices but more like a q4 average so just what could yield upside and downside risk to your north american business based upon what you know about the contracting season what you know about your positioning on corn costs and can you just highlight the biggest risk upside or downside to that north american outlook jim zallie president and chief executive officer sure well let me start and i ll let jim make some comments so first of all we are seeing low single digit average price increases across north america and flat to now low single digit change in the cost of corn and thus margins are flat to slightly expansive we expect high fructose corn syrup sweetener volumes to be down in line with their historical norm of trending down between 1 and 2 flat to slightly positive volume growth across the rest of the north america business and continued mid single digit volume growth for specialties we anticipate that corn basis but will continue to be elevated during the first half of the year until expectations for the new corn crop emerge and clearly as it relates to risks we are assuming a return to an average corn crop with normal planting on time planting et cetera i would say volumes are always a risk in north america to our business but we are right now and assuming taking into account what i just talked about in relationship to the volume trends that we are seeing so jim i m going to turn it over to you to add any additional color commentary perhaps on co products or co product recoveries jim gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i mean i think as we thought about that you were expecting very modest co product value recoveries as we do not see any trade flows between the u s and china resuming with any kind of positive effect quickly throughout the year heather jones heather jones research analyst ok and i just i don t want to belabor that point but i just want to see what you guys are seeing versus what i may be seeing and you made the point that corn gluten meal value to have traded down some but there s been a very sizable rally in veg oil values and so looking at cash corn which does have elevated basics in it but relative to cash byproduct values there s been a pretty nice recovery in that rate of recovery from call it early q4 to the present is there something that s limiting you guys from seeing draft or are you just being conservative in assuming that may not continue for the rest of the year just help me to understand how you all are thinking about it jim gray executive vice president and chief financial officer well i think obviously there s 12 months in a year and just necessarily with the january rise and two of the values doesn t make kind of for the full year forecast part of the run up in corn oil has been due to a little bit of a constrained supply so i think that that has potentially some of this temporal effect to it at least in the u s meal prices are have come up but there is an abundance and we ll see a list of soy meal in the marketplace and so we are kind of we are measured in our outlook for that value and feed values usually follow corn so corn has been trading in a pretty tight range with regard to kind of the outlook for the layout of corn for 2020 so we are not we don t see necessarily something where we all see of the co product values all rising because of continued tightness in the market or higher demand so we are just looking out as i said we expect kind of modest co product value recoveries because we don t see a lot of the big moves yet from demand pulling from china heather jones heather jones research analyst right ok and my final question is just wondering if you could give us your updated thoughts on what you are seeing in the brazilian economy the currency has been incredibly weak of late but that it could be attributable to just a risk off attitude in all but like what are you seeing on the ground as far as the trends there jim zallie president and chief executive officer yes let me comment so for south america in general i mean we expect low single digit volume growth in brazil and basically on the ground there we are seeing very strong specialties growth and we highlighted that for quarter 4 and so we are seeing a lot of activity by customers that are formulating very much on trend ingredient with on trend ingredients that we supply cater to the latest trends and so we are seeing i guess i would say strong economic activity or a pickup in economic activity in brazil and we kind of expect that operating income to be up in the region primarily driven by brazil volumes and lower net corn costs as well as benefits of cost smart across this region heather jones heather jones research analyst ok perfect that was very helpful thank you jim zallie president and chief executive officer thanks heather operator our next question comes from brett hundley with seaport global brett hundley seaport global securities llc analyst hey good morning guys thanks for taking my questions my questions are going to focus on the specialty part of your portfolio zallie i think you said in your prepared remarks that during q4 texture grew low single digits thanks for those comments by the way if that is the case and i thought texture might be growing a little bit more than that and so i just wanted to revisit that comment with you and see if there was anything during the period that might have have weighed on that and just get your continued outlook for the texture specifically jim zallie president and chief executive officer yes no i don t think there s anything weighing on it per se i think that texture will be made up by our starch based texturizer portfolio our clean and simple ingredients and our approach to customer co creation and food systems so all of those customer engagements continue to go very very well and one of our areas of focus is to diversify beyond corn and so we really are seeing growth in our tapioca franchise as well as our potato starch franchise and i m also pleased to say one of the things that we didn t really highlight explicitly in the prepared comments was that our rice investment in thailand will also be commissioning in quarter 2 of this year so those are all very strategic purposeful investments to diversify beyond corn which is the main staple but with trends toward grain free for example we see increased demand for those ingredients and they also provide different functionalities complementary functionalities for products like snacks and snacking and which is growing and so we feel very good about our starch based texturizers portfolio as well as the hydrocolloids that we have now in our portfolio to complement starch based and we are very excited obviously by what protein is going to offer also as it relates to rounding out texture additionally with protein fortification as well brett hundley seaport global securities llc analyst ok and staying on the topic of texture we ve talked to some other sorry we talked to some other what i call adjacent ingredient peers of yours it does sound like more participants are interested in entering or expanding on their texture capabilities and i m not necessarily asking this question from a competitive threat standpoint but i am interested in understanding if you believe that texture capabilities are becoming sought after in the by broader ingredient space as a whole jim zallie president and chief executive officer well i think that one of the things that the as an ingredient supplier you want to be in a position to do is be a problem solver and to do that with speed so texture is one of the most important qualities and attributes for the overall sensorial experience of a food product and so we feel very good about who we are in the space of texture being the broadest and deepest in our world of specialty starches and in addition having now capabilities in hydrocolloids as well with a very purposeful focus on customer co creation which is all about working with select customers in a very concentrated period to go from concept to the shelf and we are being perceived as a more complete formulation and solutions provider in that regard and so texture will continue to be a hallmark of our value proposition that we can bring to customers brett hundley seaport global securities llc analyst and then just one more on specialty this has more of a regional focus but we aim to derive your regional specialty performance based in part on core and specialty performance from some of your peers but we back in the strong specialty performance for ingredion in latin america similarly to what you announced this morning and then we also back in the solid growth and the solid performance in asia and europe in north america more recently we are backing in the like low single digit growth for your specialty and i wanted you to weigh in on whether we are in the right ballpark there and whether or not you can go into more detail and describe the state of your specialty portfolio in north america today so how do these dynamics might change in coming periods as you place investment in adjacent areas jim zallie president and chief executive officer so just going back to a comment i made earlier we indicated that for north america we are seeing continued mid single digit volume growth for specialties in our guidance as it relates to north america one of the things we are most excited about our new plant based protein capacity expansion and commissioning of the facility in nebraska which will be available in the second half of the year and we expect to see incremental net sales and contributions beginning to cover the start up cost of that facility in the second half of this year we are seeing very very strong customer interest and customer engagement as this new ingredion platform comes to market and so we are very excited about the specialties prospects for protein isolates as well as flowers and concentrates again the complementing formulation capabilities that provide to our customers in north america jim gray executive vice president and chief financial officer i mean i d also add that within north america it s our largest specialty book of business as well as the and we haven t talked much toward food systems that and of itself just how we look at gums as it s a growing part of the business as well as sugar reduction jim zallie president and chief executive officer we also had a very strong color in mexico for specialties growth which is included in our north america business and so if that gives you even a little bit more color in relationship to overall north america s specialties brett hundley seaport global securities llc analyst that s great thank you guys jim zallie president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from ken zaslow with bank of montreal ken zaslow bank of montreal analyst hey good morning guys jim zallie president and chief executive officer hey ken ken zaslow bank of montreal analyst a couple of questions one is last quarter your fx were aligned with your price or your pricing i m sorry more aligned with your fx and you offset more this one there seem to be a widening spread i would have thought that it would have been continuing to narrow can you talk about at what point do you expect pricing to overtake the fx headwinds and how do you think about that jim zallie president and chief executive officer well this and i mean this quarter to highlight price mix was in q4 was 68 million to the positive fx was a headwind of 56 million so we did see some price in q4 that was greater than the fx headwind i think what you are seeing is that in south america we are seeing local inflation and pricing kind of ahead of that which is catching up with that past fx weakness where you ve had some newer i think some newer fx softening would have been in some of the asia pac countries and as we noted ken we are trying to gain back price on weakness in the korea 1 is quite challenging and that will take time as one example ken zaslow bank of montreal analyst ok i excluded i am sorry i excluded north americas but ok but do you think that there will be a point in time that the excluding north america the fx the pricing will more offset because history has shown that that s what you do so i m just i just want to make sure that things have not changed or do you think things have really gotten a little bit more complicated with south korea as well as the eu that maybe not see that as much but that is what i would expect over time is that fair jim zallie president and chief executive officer yes so let me just take that and again i just want to draw you back to my comments south america really represented the biggest challenge for us as it relates to pricing to offset foreign currency weakness and i want to remind you that that region experienced 200 million of foreign currency rate weakness in the year which was offset by 151 million of pricing actions now one of the things that i think we all observed is the steep devaluation of the argentine peso so we have been in catch up up there but i also called out the efforts of our team who have done a fantastic job of moving price there and we are seeing very good progress in relationship to their pricing actions to offset that just when we thought the brazilian real based on everything you read and are observing in relationship to the economy and political stability and pension reform and fiscal reform getting passed yet we have been somewhat surprised to see some continued weakness in the real and so again pricing is the lever that we pull and we are confident that we are going to continue to make progress in south america and i call out south america because again it represented 200 million of that 292 million in the year and i think our team has done actually a very very good job the problem is it s been unabated in relationship to the foreign exchange headwinds that we faced and in fact jim called out i believe in our guidance that we anticipate that foreign exchange weakness which is factored into our guidance of an additional 30 million to 50 million of to the impact of net sales so hopefully that helps ken ken zaslow bank of montreal analyst it does it does the second question i have is when i think about your capital projects that coming online in 2020 can you talk about the incremental ebitda that s associated with that that we could think about in 2020 and 2021 and beyond how do we think about that jim gray executive vice president and chief financial officer do you want me to jim zallie president and chief executive officer yes sure if you could take that jim gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so ken as jim had mentioned that let s take plant based proteins in north america as an example so we are completing the production lines right now we are running product through and we are commissioning that commissioning timetable can take six months three months in six months there s at least a period in there where we have product that does need to be approved by various government regulatory agencies and then also customers are doing their own kind of audits of the plan and of the product quality so right now we have the full cost of running those we are running our south facility and will hit our p l in 2020 we ll start to see sales more in the second half and the contribution from those sales will start to contribute to the incremental ebitda that you are questioning so right now it s actually a cost impact to the p l when we are in the commissioning mode as we move more toward 2021 and sales build as we move through and fill our capacity then we ll see the contribution margins offset so we get kind of a swing impact on the p l but more toward 2021 jim zallie president and chief executive officer yes i would say just to answer it in kind of totality it s certainly plant based proteins is a major investment for us but there is the allulose investment that there is the rice investment there are other investments that we ve made across the global specialties network and i would say that because those investments are commissioning in quarter 2 for the most part and we ve been pretty modest i guess in our ebitda contribution in calendar year 2020 but certainly we expect additional contribution significant contribution in 2021 ken zaslow bank of montreal analyst in 2021 like what would you expect a return on invested capital with north of 15 20 or as it kind of builds would you expect that to be just still modest and to just kind of frame that and then i just have one last question i m sorry just if you can jim gray executive vice president and chief financial officer as we we explained to a lot of folks so when we have this capacity generally our capacity takes anywhere as short as three years and as long as five years to fill so we are looking usually at a run rate over 20 to 40 60 of the capacity filling because we ve added capacity ahead of this market demand and our sales teams are working with customers to design and highly functional product that s coming off of our new capacity so we generally see kind of hitting roic or paybacks on some of these projects somewhere around year 3 year 4 when we have between 60 and 80 of our capacity filled so that s pretty typical of kind of larger capital investments that we are putting in to expand their texturizers portfolio so i think in the case of plant based proteins that might be more broad that might be shortened in terms of that ken zaslow bank of montreal analyst and then just a point of clarification somebody asked it i just didn t understand the answer the difference between the low end and the high end of the guidance what are the key factors and then i ll leave it there jim gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so i think the high end of the guidance would be that we see still kind of modest volume but we would see kind of continued co product strength right as i said kind of the center cut of our guidance is that we really just see very modest co product value recoveries in the north america if that s if the values of the co products continue throughout the year evidence that i think that would lean a little bit more toward upside in our guidance i think if we have a little bit more feeling of the capacity in some of our specialty investments faster than what we ve and what the horizon i just described i think that would end itself to upside and then we really are not seeing any kind of in south america with respect to argentina right now we have an assumption for a weakening argentina peso as i mentioned we have greater than 10 million expected from hyperinflation accounting that lands in our financing costs it s the revalue of the net assets in argentina to u s dollars and so under hyperinflation accounting that does impact us in our and on our income statement so right now we are seeing at least some weakening of the peso i think of the peso on the in the government took different actions that really really collapse the peso than we d have and that would be more downside risk jim zallie president and chief executive officer and then coronavirus i guess on the downside also would be factored into the low end of the guidance jim gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yes yes ken zaslow bank of montreal analyst great i really appreciate it thank you guys jim zallie president and chief executive officer thank you operator the next question comes from robert moskow with credit suisse robert moskow credit suisse analyst hi a couple of more questions on the guidance i think in the first half of 2019 you had some weather related costs in north america that should set up a pretty easy comparison i would think for 2020 especially if your pricing is rolling though rather quickly can you give us an estimate to what those costs were in 19 and is it fair to say therefore that your earnings growth in 2020 would be front half loaded jim gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i ll take that jim zallie president and chief executive officer yes sure jim gray executive vice president and chief financial officer rob with regards to north america when we did have a little bit of weather related it wasn t significant as much and i think it was more because we had some rail lines freezing and some delays in terms of putting product through i mean it was nothing and anywhere close to 2014 or some more significant years you are correct in that it does set up for a slightly easier lab i think more importantly with regard to north america would have been where the co product values were and kind of what the cost of corn was relative to pricing so it looks like so as we anticipate in 2020 slightly higher gross corn and basis and we ve priced to really kind of capture that back we are really kind of seeing margins really flat maybe just slightly expansive in north america so i don t think it s a significant bump up in the first half but we will continue to see kind of modest growth in north america for the first half robert moskow credit suisse analyst ok and in sweeteners you are expecting the normal 1 to 2 annual decline in demand i would argue that pricing power this year was enabled by the fact that you closed down stockton that if 1 to 2 declines persist how does that set up for pricing to be going forward for 2021 2022 how close are we to stability right now in supply demand for sweeteners in north america industry wise jim zallie president and chief executive officer well so first of all the decline that i referred to was specifically to hf not for total sweeteners as far as that decline so i think that the actions that we took with stockton has certainly tightened our network to very high capacity utilization so we feel very good about where we are at for 2020 and it s obviously hard to predict what s going to happen going forward in 2021 and beyond related to where sweeteners have declined over the last decade and where that will go going forward it s just hard to predict i think we just feel very good about where we are at right now with the network that in our capacity utilization based on the actions that we have taken robert moskow credit suisse analyst i ll follow up one more time i mean i don t think ingredion has provided a broader sweetener volume kind of growth estimate for the industry or i don t think internally either so hf is declining 1 to 2 is it fair to say that broader sweeteners are i don t know flat is it better than that over the past several years is there a way to really know jim gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i think that broader sweeteners as it relates to glucose syrup for example are growing in line with gdp growth maybe 1 to 2 per year depending on the application jim zallie president and chief executive officer yes maybe lower it s right around the it really depends on pop growth and per capita and which country you are in but you definitely see glucose and you see dextrose as sweeteners some of those lend themselves to kind of unique segments and some of them also lend themselves to kind of building back bulk or some texture roles so we do see those kind of anywhere but flattish to modestly up depends on really which country you are in robert moskow credit suisse analyst good that s helpful thank you jim zallie president and chief executive officer ok operator our next question comes from adam samuelson with goldman sachs adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst yes thanks good morning everyone jim zallie president and chief executive officer hey adam jim gray executive vice president and chief financial officer hey adam adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst so our groundsmen have been covered i just had a few clarification questions around the guidance first the increase in corporate expense 15 million to 20 million or so and how much of that is actual investment in the business versus earnings coming out of costs coming out of the segments just can you break those two out please jim gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yes sure about i think it s about a third of cost moving from segments into center about a third is specific investments in enhancing digital and driving some of our go to market efforts centrally and then a third is kind of merit and inflation and kind of bonus reset normal wage costs comp change adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst ok that s helpful and then in and whether it s the total company or by region specifically in north america what are assumed net cost smart kind of earnings contribution for 2020 jim gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so right now we are not necessarily going through and disclosing by region kind of where cost smart savings are we have we do have targets we have targets specifically for both the sg a or the operating expense side as well as the cost of sales side and obviously what we are doing is each initiative each project has a bit of a life of its own in terms of getting to the hypothesis from hypothesis to implementation to action and so we just want to be thoughtful as we roll each of those out so adam i ll choose to defer on answering that question adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst ok and then i guess the last one just the guidance on cash flow from operations i mean one you exceeded the cash from ops guidance for 2019 but then so if i look at the 2020 guidance you are actually guiding cash from ops potentially down at the lower end versus the net income guidance which is functionally flat at the low end can you also just bridge between the changes in net income and cash from ops jim gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so essentially it s and i think as we closed out 2019 i think we had some favorability in accounts payables which then we were anticipating that accounts payable would impact working capital to a greater degree as we look forward to 2020 we are very much focused as a team on our working capital change and we see still some so we very much want to tighten working capital but as we grow revenue we are going to have more obligations with customers in the form of accounts receivable as well as inventories and so while that change in working capital will be a drain on cash from ops because the on the top line is higher we are still trying to reduce the rate of that change and that s what s impacting basically our guidance as we think about cash from ops obviously we are reducing capital commitment year over year though which we highlighted on the call adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst yes all right good thanks very much jim gray executive vice president and chief financial officer ok operator i m not showing any further questions at this time i d like to turn the call back over to our host jim zallie president and chief executive officer ok well i would like to thank you for your time today and jim and i hope to see many of you at cagny next week in boca raton and with that that concludes our call today thanks very much operator duration 64 minutes call participants tiffany willis vice president investor

defi made its debut in 2019 and achieved huge user growth in blockchain industry yet defi is still far from being widely accepted and therefore has great development potential this article intends to help readers get acquainted with defi by introducing its concept status quo and future what is defi 1 1 basic concepts defi short for decentralized finance which is also known as distributed finance or open finance in china is a financial business environment without any central endorsement body investors can clearly see the fund status and track the status moreover defi cannot be tampered with due to technical consensus we also see some new technical and business features that defi brings to the table first the funds of lending and business transaction are placed on a verified smart contract or address which effectively implements transparent supervision of the fund pool similarly fund flow records are distributed on a unified geographically dispersed ledger that can be universally accessed this is effective in guarding against technical financial and geographic risk second defi doesn t need to conduct background checks and due diligence on borrowers financiers which is time consuming and costly in traditional financial industry similarly there is no need for fund provider to know the specific information of counterparties the pledge of digital assets token can automatically trigger settlement and guarantee lending rights third defi runs automatically in contract code through algorithms adopts artificial intelligence methods to process core financial logic and collects market data to form high liquidity capital markets and financial service markets therefore defi system can create a more transparent and credible more fair and equitable credit market financial interest rate is no longer determined unilaterally by central bank or authoritative financial institutions but by algorithms which truly reflects market supply and demand these algorithms can implement basic financial logic for example if fund supply decreases interest rate will rise to raise loan costs and if fund supply increases interest rate will drop to make loan cheaper in traditional finance there is a huge gap between regions in fund supply and demand fund is getting cheaper in developed countries while becomes more expensive in developing countries with increasing loan demand in developing countries the price gap will increase besides the collateral of defi is more than cryptocurrency but all valuable assets in theory any valuable asset could be posted to a smart contract and be used as collateral to obtain financing when an overdue default occurs the smart contract will automatically transfer ownership it s true that the realization of all these defi concepts still have long ways to go for an example before we can collateral to obtain finance a process is needed to be available for the asset to be link to ownership at present some defi concepts have achieved a proof of concept we will introduce them later 1 2 defi is the financial extension of blockchain 1 0 blockchain 1 0 refers to encrypted digital currency applications represented by bitcoin which realize the issue payment and point to point circulation of currency through technologies such as distributed ledgers chain data and consensus algorithm its core concepts include absolute decentralization high transparency operation no real name authentication blockchian 1 0 innovatively realizes decentralized issue anonymous payment or transfer and anonymous custody of digital currency based on blockchain technology and the principle of free currency economics however it does not realize the issue of financial lending business and financial derivatives business which is indispensable and essential to the financial market despite the analogy between bitcoin and gold there is no denying that bitcoin itself is a kind of electronic currency that is different from traditional currency system and its original intention is to realize a kind of currency rather than assets in a stable environment since bitcoin is a kind of currency it can certainly be used in payment deposit lending and derivatives financial operations from this perspective it is clear that defi business focused on cryptocurrencies is the financial monetary extension of blockchain 1 0 currently most defi is based on mortgage lending and has huge development potential defi obviously does not violate the blockchain 1 0 in its core essence decentralization high transparency and no real name authentication are still its theoretical foundations this has opened up another pole of financial services that echoes payment and circulation 1 3 defi is a relative concept echoing traditional finance traditional finance is built on trust while defi is built on technical code throughout the history of human financial development trust is the core the lending relationship between people was built on trust at the very beginning lending relationship first occurs only between acquaintances then between indirect acquaintances subsequently professional institutions such as pawnshop come into being which gradually play a role in the financial business after the establishment and popularization of modern company system such lending relationship gradually occurs between enterprises and individuals enterprises and enterprises multiple parties to multiple parties and single party to single party however trust is still the premise of lending directly or indirectly with the popularization of electronic technology and information system data based analysis and evaluation of the credit of the subject company or individual plays an increasingly important role but this is only an upgrade of trust evaluation system after the advent of blockchain technology defi breaks the conventional wisdom the lending relationship and process become completely transparent smart contract code can recognize the triggering rules of default rules and trigger automatic delivery thereby achieving zero human intervention in financial business in defi mainstream digital currency mortgage business there is actually no traditional credit and trust relationship but only consensus and rules codes and procedures their objectivity has replaced trust the foundation of traditional financial business defi has replaced credit subject in fact traditional financial system still depends on strength stability authority and credibility of large financial institutions and regulators the failure or default of large financial institutions credit subjects large banks governments etc can lead to the collapse of the entire system in contrast defi financial system depends on the strength of its protocols cryptography and smart contracts network scale decides the stability of system the larger the network is the more stable the system will be from this perspective defi is an upgraded version of traditional financial system defi is fundamentally different in the mode of credit assessment of business participants in traditional financial system enterprise size is one of the most common credit evaluation indicators hard financial indicators block out a large number of customers with actual financial needs on the other hand defi allows some relatively weak small participants to participate equally some complex financial services rely on third party rating agencies these agencies have their advantages such as being more professional and more comprehensive in collecting data however it is unavoidable that rating agencies themselves are centralized institutions therefore it is impossible to avoid unfair situations such as manipulation and favoritism in defi rating and automatic settlement are expected to be based on completely open and fair data we are not sure how long this process of universal access will take but we know that at least the trend is clear theoretically cross regional restrictions peer to peer lending and peer to peer micropayment which are limited in traditional financial system can be solved in defi decentralized financial encrypted wallet is actually the equivalent of banknote wallet autonomous control is entirely in the hands of the owner the only difference is that one is electronic wallet controlled by public private key pair and the other is physical wallet 1 4 defi interprets the direction of new financial system defi brings challenges to existing financial system but it also calls for some deep thinking about existing economic and financial system 1 4 1 should intervention be appropriately reduced the original intention of official intervention is to promote the development of the entire economic and financial system but when government authority intervenes too frequently in financial and economic development the reality often goes against expectations and even leads to financial suppression the so called financial suppression refers to government s excessive intervention in financial activities and system that inhibits the development of financial system financial system lags behind and then hinders economic development leading to a vicious circle of financial repression and economic backwardness this phenomenon is not uncommon there are lots of human intervention methods in existing financial system such as financial policies and financial instruments including interest rates and exchange rates in fact economic development is the premise and foundation of financial development and financial development should only be an auxiliary power and tool for economic development obviously excessive intervention brings no good to financial development but indirectly brings a negative inhibitory effect on the economy defi financial system like bitcoin encrypted digital currency is in a non intervention state although it develops too fast to be accepted and it cannot be updated quickly in the short term it points out a clear direction defi tells us that maybe the new financial system should have less human intervention and more rule based autonomy and adapt financial instruments to the market not the other way around 1 4 2 should financial business granularity be finer for various reasons traditional financial services have a coarse granularity of business services financial institutions such as banks generally value large customers and large fund businesses while ignoring small medium and micro customers the reasons include the preference of executive agencies and the restrictions of macro policies for bank clerks in charge of lending business they prefer large and reputable enterprises such as central enterprises and state owned enterprises those enterprises have large amount transactions strong risk control capabilities yet its operation cost is no higher than smaller customers therefore clerks cannot be motivated to serve smaller customers another example policies stipulate a threshold for a qualified investor this is to protect small and micro investors this will undoubtedly block out many small and micro investors with financial needs but limited assets from this point of view the granularity of financial services is still not fine enough at both business end and consumer end as a result small business and small consumer cannot enjoy the same financial services and rights with the increasing awareness of civil rights financial services rights will become increasingly important and this trend is irreversible at the national level one of the real problems in providing better services for small medium and micro enterprises may be the granularity of financial business services in defi financial services granularity can be fine enough that people can invest even 1 00 or less and the corresponding small asset holder can theoretically borrow the same amount of funds that he holds 1 5 mainstream form of defi defi mainly includes decentralized lending decentralized exchanges stablecoins payments assets and other decentralized derivatives from a traditional financial perspective lending business and derivatives actually play the role of commercial bank decentralized exchange plays the role of stock exchange financial asset exchange and stablecoin business is much like a business of traditional central bank 1 5 1 mortgage lending decentralized lending is an attempt to free financial services from relying on centralized institutions and to achieve a highly fair and transparent financial lending relationship fundamentally it is a type of decentralized application at present mortgage lending is still the main form of defi lending mortgage lending makes up for some of the shortcomings of traditional finance for example investment limit can be set without a lower limit funding provider requirement is less stringent the entire business process is more open the boundaries are clearer and centralized supply and demand matching is provided we can make a brief analysis of makerdao the financial leader of defi and the most well known project on ethereum to understand the principle and logic of lending business in the decentralized world release media by playing the role of traditional central bank makerdao has issued stablecoin dai and anchored it to the us dollar at 1 1 so that there is a unified exchange medium makerdao actually acts as a bank in the decentralized world user application when a user needs to borrow money makerdao doesn t check the user s credit history like what traditional finance does in fact defi also cannot check offline credit because user information in application record as it is only an address therefore makerdao will let users mortgage blockchain assets such as the most commonly used eth ethereum token if the user has eth worth us 150 000 estimated based on the current market price user can mortgage it to makerdao through smart contracts makerdao will give user up to 100 000 dai worth us 100 000 because maker dao stipulates that the value of the collateral is at least 1 5 times the lending amount mandatory redemption if the market declines after user borrowing the money the value of user s mortgage of 150 000 us dollars will also fall if collateral value is close to dai 100 000 makerdao will force the sale of user s eth to repay his loan this is also a self protection measure in defi business these conditions are all triggered by smart contracts and can be monitored by users contract lending the platform lends money to users through dai after holding dai users can freely exchange circulate and use it user repayment when users repay they must also obtain dai through exchange circulation or other methods then return dai to makerdao and pay interest to redeem the previously mortgaged eth assets 1 5 2 decentralized exchange decentralized exchanges allow users to trade digital assets such as bitcoin and ethereum decentralized exchanges are created to solve the problems of artificial manipulation in centralized exchanges in centralized exchanges users do not own their own private keys so they cannot control their own property in decentralized exchange there are issues with efficiency a hybrid of exchange modes concerning these two propositions have been generated they are not quite the same i will briefly introduce the principle from two commonly used modes on chain orderbook mode this is the most classic and a relatively decentralized mode in which user recharge maker taker settlement and withdrawal are all completed on the chain the decentralized exchange etherdelta is a representative of this mode a brief process is described as follows maker and taker recharge assets into smart contracts user assets are managed by smart contracts and contract administrators cannot arbitrarily manipulate user assets maker places an order on blockchain usually public chain taker selects the order that he wants to trade and initiates a transaction the smart contract will match the needs of maker and taker and transaction will be settled on the chain offline orderbook mode this mode takes into account both the security of decentralized exchange and the efficiency of centralized off chain matching mechanism at present the ethereum decentralized exchange idex is the representative of this mode a brief process is described as follows user recharges digital assets into platform s smart contract through private key signature authorization the platform does not have access to user s private key and assets for security issues off chain server processes user s maker and taker operation which ensures that the transaction experience is basically consistent with that of centralized exchange uncompleted maker will not cause loss of gas costs and save the cost of on chain invalid orders ledger synchronization ledger processed by off chain server and successfully matched result information will be sent to on chain ledger and finally store transaction information on the chain 1 5 3 stablecoin payment media are the prerequisites for defi business the value of digital currencies fluctuates greatly while fiat currencies face various regulatory and policy issues and are not suitable as payment tools in defi field therefore stablecoin is the best choice for defi stablecoin is the product of digital currency transactions fiat currency cannot directly serve as pricing unit due to various reasons but in reality the popularization of digital currency including defi business cannot be separated from fiat currency pricing so it is important to possess digital assets with stable price transaction media bookkeeping units and value storage all need such kind of currency with blockchain attributes stablecoin is a blockchain linked currency with stable price it bridges the gap between fiat currency and digital currency for example makerdao has issued dai stablecoin for defi business settlement and transactions libra which is scheduled to be launched in 2020 is a typical stablecoin and its volume is also considerable the essence of libra is a stablecoin issued by bind assets which consist of a package of fiat currencies multiple countries to carry out related business in different countries regions therefore we see that stablecoin also has different modes and three main modes are as follows fiat currency asset mortgage mode it is bound in a single fiat currency such as us dollar or multiple currencies and is usually issued at 1 1 ratio other assets with stable value attributes such as gold also fall into the category of mortgages the stablecoin under this mode is the one with the best stability but it has a fatal problem in preventing false issue usdt is a good example digital asset mortgage mode it uses a single digital asset currency or multiple digital asset currencies as the anchor asset the biggest uncertainty of this mode is the fluctuation of digital asset value and the risk of failure algorithm mode currency value is calculated through market asset comprehensive automatic assessment this mode is the most complex one yet it is the most independent with no reliance on external credit at all the stablecoin itself also has business profit modes such as exchange rates and holding income once it is popularized and gains public consensus its business scale will be unlimited for instance usdt the pioneer of stablecoin besides there are currently thousands of defi projects in addition to the above three mainstream modes there are also decentralized wallets insurance platforms identity authentication kyc aml market analysis quantitative transactions and so on these modes are not that typical so this article will not have further discussion 2 development status 2 1 overview of defi market development 2 1 1 lending business we can also see the trend of eth based defi financial business locked position from defi pulse the three major platforms maker synthetix and compound are in a leading position especially maker which until now january 2020 still occupies half of the market shares total locked market value is worth up to us 682 million data statistics as of january 12 2020 back to the beginning of 2019 makerdao led the defi trend almost dominating the defi market in terms of user number locked value and business mode after one year of development defi market becomes more competitive more and more people participate in this emerging market the anchor currency has also evolved from eth to eth dai and eos dai is a stable digital currency derived from makerdao project in accordance with market mechanisms and dai usd keeps 1 1 maker is one of the earliest decentralized autonomous organizations dao and smart contract systems on ethereum platform the maker platform provides stable basic currency dai thus dai is regarded as one of the basic currencies secured by digital assets if you re interested in it find more details at as of now 2020 01 12 total value locked in defi market has reached us 928 07 million maker eos rex and edgeware account for more than 70 of the total it is not difficult to find from locked value trend that the past year is defi s fastest growing year it is not difficult to find that after 19 years of development defi is no longer the sole market of maker and eth is no longer the only currency defi ecosystem has basically formed a new situation of multi subject competition from the perspective of the project nuo network a lending platform on ethereum and derivative platform augur and bancor all perform well and are worthy of attention but a few such as veil fail to survive fortunately in addition to eth and eos ecosystem layer 2 lightning network a bitcoin related project also expands defi business through massive nodes the locked value in the network climbs to 862 56 bitcoins which is about us 6 25 million 2 1 2 decentralized exchange decentralized exchange is currently dominated by uniswap accounting for more than half of the transaction volume followed by ddex eth2dai and idex here are the transaction and user statistics from dapp total it is not difficult to see that the development of dex cannot be separated from the development of overall macro currency market environment and bear market users and transaction volume have decreased significantly but the daily transaction volume still exceeds 20 000 eth per day which cannot be underestimated at present no more than 3 000 users join the market every day therefore it is still a niche market 2 1 3 stablecoin at present the total value of stablecoin market is as high as us 5 7 billion of which usdt accounts for about 83 and it is an absolute leader in stablecoin market data as of 2020 01 12 according to dapptotal dai accounts for about 8 of the market share of emerging currency market in 2020 libra is estimated to be the biggest shock to stablecoin market libra is expected to go online in the first half of 2020 once launched it will certainly seize some of the original stablecoin market shares judging from the financing situation of the entire defi ecosystem the total scale of financing in the past year 2019 has exceeded us 70 million most of which focus on lending business participating parties include top venture capital firms such as sequoia and they are mainly based in america with more than 60 of investment funds coming from us funds and vcs such as a16z coinbaseventures polychain paradigm etc among them makerdao has raised over us 27 5 million in two rounds of financing compound also performs well ranking second with a financing amount of us 25 million acinq one of the lightning network development teams also successfully raised up to us 8 million in general defi business mode has been verified and promoted to a certain scale in 2019 and the product ecosystem is also growing what s more follow up projects such as public chains polkadot and traditional mainstream currencies such as bitcoin will be gradually integrated into defi ecosystem 2020 will be a year worth looking forward to 2 2 development bottlenecks and fields to break through 2 2 1 cognitive threshold compared with traditional financial service institutions defi does have many advantages such as decentralization high transparency low fees etc but its current popularity rate still has much room for improvement defi is strongly related to blockchain technology defi is currently like the blockchain technology in mid 2016 only a minority of people are aware of it the reason for this is largely determined by technical threshold many people do not even understand blockchain technology let alone defi a subset of blockchain with relatively high cognitive threshold and technical and business complexity to put it another way defi s current innovative products have not reached the level of general participation of ordinary people and investors most ordinary investors focus on whether the product is profitable and the proportion of profits rather than on technological innovation on the other hand defi practitioners cognition also has room for improvement as defi is still a technology driven emerging industry practitioners are still subject to technical personnel generally these technical personnel are good at technology and blockchain but still have ways to go in understanding financial services especially compliance and other related fields 2 2 2 performance bottleneck public network performance restrictions lending business itself is carried out on its own chains currently on ethereum and eos eth only has one block every 15s and the main network tps does not exceed 100 this is a huge gap for financial business systems if 10 000 users are concurrent then the performance gap is 100 times greater in fact in china s domestic centralized trading exchanges it is very common to have more than 10 000 concurrent consumer end users decentralized exchange product experience also has a direct dependence on main network so we see that there are two basic categories on chain mode and off chain mode in theory the on chain mode is the real decentralized transaction users manage their private keys the platform does not have access to users assets the entire process is safe and transparent the core of exchanges is to play the function of transaction matching centralized transaction itself also requires a certain transaction depth to help improve liquidity therefore this means high frequency operations are required each maker cancellation and transaction operations are all triggered by smart contract or happened on the chain which is undoubtedly a great test for defi practitioners and related institutions product experience issue blockchain confirmation requires the participation of several blocks as a result there will be asynchronous confirmation of business operations users will not get immediate response yet the results of centralized applications will be given without delay therefore bring some problems to decentralized applications and decentralized finance at the basic level and need for further development at present several decentralized exchanges and lending dapp on the market are not that user friendly and are complex to operate this will have a fatal impact on financial applications especially on inclusive finance as most people may give up using because of the high cognition threshold transaction cost issue since each business operation is submitted to public network for verification there also exists a gas cost problem that is in addition to the traditional fee for each financial business another gas cost will be incurred through at least one usually multiple blockchain confirmation process and increases transaction cost it seems that the cost of a single transaction does not increase much but when this cost is multiplied by the transaction volume it will be too high to be affordable based on this in order to solve the problems of high cost and low efficiency of complete on chain transactions the industry has also pioneered the development of fund pool mode and off chain mode in exchange for part of product experience at the cost of losing independence but it still falls short of the requirement of universal application the performance of blockchain micro technology is still a subject to be studied continuously 2 2 3 fund efficiency from the perspective of financial business fund utilization rate in defi s current lending business is not high due to the platform s risk control requirements the value of required mortgage assets must be higher than the financing amount otherwise zero risk cannot be achieved for example the makerdao mentioned above requires users to deposit 1 5 times the eth price to establish a mortgage debt warehouse that supports dai moreover some platforms require 2 times and 3 times the mortgage assets which undoubtedly greatly reduces the efficiency of fund asset utilization in contrast traditional financial mortgage evaluation is more effective and in addition to mortgage loan there are many types of credit products that do not require collateral such as credit loan in terms of improving the efficiency of fund utilization and the design of financial products defi still has a lot of room for development 2 2 4 systemic risk system associated risk defi projects can be nested with each other in terms of eth defi ecosystem makerdao plays a similar role as central bank the adjustment of its strategy will directly affect the operation status of secondary lending products such as compound compound uniswap and other secondary defi products have enriched the product types of eth defi ecosystem and are beneficial to the entire ecological development but they are too closely linked the entire eth defi system is more likely to crash when a single product or protocol being attacked in addition it should be noted that there exists homogeneity in defi s own business products mortgage assets may have a long effect at present there is no complete post lending detection technology to eliminate the risk of multi purpose mortgage assets at present defi post lending management is not as good as traditional finance as fund usage is not tracked i learn that a wide range of defi users borrow money mainly for coin stock that is to go back and invest in mortgage currencies for example eth holders borrow stablecoin dai by pledging eth and then reinvest buy and hold eth via dai exchange creating a leverage amplification effect users of course benefit when the current market goes up once market goes down however users will lose their money when exchange scale is enlarged it is very likely to bring lots of users financial losses that beyond their risk tolerance resulting in sever consequences and huge impacts 3 future directions judging from the development of blockchain and related ecology in recent years finance and gaming are the first two industries that implement blockchain technology and have the most relevant dapps however the current gaming industry is actually not successful and its future is not that bright at present some of the more active gaming industry are those with financial attributes and some even have the risk of breaking the law so the key lies in financial field after a year of development defi is very likely to witness explosive growth in 2020 in general several points of defi s future development are worthy of concern 3 1 subject to supervision supervision is an unavoidable topic for financial industry financial business and defi is no exception financial innovators tend to underestimate the value of existing systems and supervision mechanisms it is important to know that existing business modes and supervision policies are shaped by economic and political environment in blockchain industry both systems and systems are the object of criticism but from the perspective of technological and social changes when innovation is in growth stage or transition period it is often necessary to follow the existing system first then break it and promote changes in policies and systems faster innovation and greater span often bring greater resistance even libra which is directly promoted by the globally recognized internet giant facebook may be in trouble right now in mark zuckerberg s recent speech about facebook s 10 year vision he did not mention libra and this is perhaps the best illustration of the current supervision dilemma theoretically a trusted distributed computing network allows defi to build financial services on a globally auditable digital ledger and the business logic is automatically executed on the contract code to the greatest extent these features can improve the level of automatic risk management and supervision capacity which is extremely beneficial to the development of global financial business cross border risk control capabilities and consensus rules can better integrate financial services across regions and promote more efficient transparent and flexible financial systems and this is the essence of defi specifically taking china as an example defi currently needs to be consistent with the blockchain empowerment advocated by the policy drives business innovation with technological innovation and empowers financial institutions and small and medium sized enterprises at present domestic cross border e commerce cross border logistics and multilateral trade all need this technology to drive the development of innovative financial modes and empower the entire social and economic development 3 2 closer integration with traditional finance if defi needs to develop on a larger scale it will inevitably need to further integrate with traditional finance in addition to machine learning and artificial intelligence fintech financial technology which is currently popular has already embraced blockchain technology to help strengthen trust in traditional financial systems improve data quality and make better risk prediction and judgment the core of fintech is creditability defi can be considered to have no creditability no offline review or 100 creditability completely based on mortgage defi hopes that all assets can be tokenized to form the basis of defi mortgage lending this is fully consistent with the current trend policy of traditional finance and policies at present the government is advocating the digitalization of assets and the authentication transaction of digital assets after the assets being digitized they can theoretically be traded and circulated globally therefore digital assets and defi are similar in many places the only difference lies in the way of networking alliance chain vs public chain how to integrate the two is an important issue facing the industry take mortgage loan as an example under the current scheme of alliance chain traditional asset evaluation is put on the chain to increase credit and then goes online and offline however if we lift regional restrictions and do cross border capital asset docking such as inflow of foreign fund then it will theoretically be a defi form that is compliant and fully integrated with traditional financial services in addition the dcep digital currency electronic payment issued by the people s bank of china is expected to be launched in 2020 experts predict that dcep may partially replace cash which is likely to become a bridge between defi and traditional financial services and accelerate the integration of defi and traditional financial services 3 3 defi currency will be diversified 3 3 1 btc at present defi ecological anchoring asset is still dominated by eth while assets like bitcoin that actually has both currency gold attributes have not been widely adopted this is a gold mine that has been forgotten by defi bitcoin is fully qualified as a collateral in terms of recognized value liquidity asset size etc and it is even better than eth and eos in terms of value stability some countries have already qualified bitcoin as asset rather than security which is more acceptable at regulatory level at present btc s defi only has some simple attempts such as packaging btc into imbtc and xbtc in erc20 format and defi platform money on chain which imitates makerdao mode and is based on bitcoin sidechain rsk there will probably be more defi projects focused on btc 3 3 2 libra libra is expected to be launched in 2020 it is promoted by the global internet giant facebook and is dedicated to making banking services available to people without bank accounts libra is an encrypted digital currency that does not pursue stability against the exchange rate of the us dollar but pursues relatively stable actual purchasing power as libra naturally has more than 2 billion facebook users it will undoubtedly have a great impact on world wide financial landscape i believe that libra will not be overlooked in defi field although there are still some uncertainties about libra it is undeniable that the mode and trend it brings are inevitable once libra goes online and is accepted by influential countries regions internet finance industry will meet great changes and defi will be combined with libra to form a global financial instrument market which will rapidly promote a more balanced supply and demand of funds in addition to new stablecoins like libra there are existing stablecoins such as usdt and some defi lending projects have begun to talk about usdt but in general from my point of view usdt has been discredited due to issuance and will gradually go downhill and will not have a decisive impact in conclusion defi makes finance more democratic transparent and fair defi is building new financial system defi is leading the future of finance

global demand both are down roughly 20 per cent from highs seen in january last week concerns over weaker demand as a result of the virus pushed the crude market into contango where near term

those concerns copper as well as oil rallied yesterday on account of the decline in the fear surrounding china cmc markets david madden said the commodities suffered greatly in the last few weeks

cash strapped lebanon is set to request technical assistance from the international monetary fund imf on thursday according to a senior political source the source told reuters on wednesday that the formal request will be sent in the coming hours for advice on how to help stabilise the country s nose diving economy and potentially restructure its debt lebanon has a 1 2bn eurobond maturing on 9 march and is apparently seeking advice on whether to pay it local newspaper annahar quoted nabih berri speaker of parliament as saying we need to send a message to the world perhaps to the americans in particular given that they re the most influential and active factor in the international monetary fund stipulating that lebanon needs the fund s technical help for a rescue plan berri made it clear though that lebanon would not seek an imf rescue package as argentina did in 2018 because the lebanese public would not accept the conditions that the fund would likely impose stay informed with mee s newsletters sign up to get the latest alerts insights and analysis starting with turkey unpacked politicians have said that such a package from the imf would require lebanon to float its pegged currency and raise taxes lebanon wakes up to trashed banks and un rebuke of its failing politicians read more mohamad faour postdoctoral research fellow in banking and finance at university college dublin told middle east eye that imf technical assistance would be narrow and likely focus on the banking crisis and debt management rather than push for overarching policy changes right now it s all very vague because the nature of the technical assistance depends on the agreed upon scope which is still a grey area said faour what they might do is help the government in drafting an economic and fiscal programme that would be deemed credible by creditors lebanon currently has one of the highest debt to gdp ratios in the world at 150 percent politicians are divided over repaying a total of about 6bn of eurobond principal and coupon payments due this year some think the government should engage with bondholders to restructure its debt and save what is left of its reserves to support imports of essential goods others including prime minister hassan diab argue that the country should pay and preserve its reputation in the international market lebanon has never defaulted on its debt courtesy meeting reports of lebanon reaching out to the imf for financial support have surfaced in recent months as nationwide protests which began on 17 october continue just a day after diab formed a cabinet last month senior mp alain aoun of the free patriotic movement told reuters that imf support was an option depending on the conditions finance minister ghazi wazni held a meeting with the imf a few days later but the talks were quickly dismissed as a courtesy meeting former prime minister saad hariri who resigned in late october had called for close cooperation with the imf and world bank in the days leading to the formation of diab s cabinet the imf thus far has only issued a series of recommendations following consultations with lebanon that ended in september last year and were published the following month in a copy obtained by mee their recommendations included raising lebanon s value added tax from 11 percent to 15 20 percent end subsidies to the notoriously inefficient and ineffective electricité du liban and increase the price of gasoline faour said that should lebanon seek support from the imf there might be some changes considering how much worse the economy has deteriorated since with dollar shortages forcing the devaluation of the local currency and price hikes that would be dependent on the competence of the government s team that would be working with the imf on drafting an economic rescue plan he said three staged recovery plan diab s government received a vote of confidence in parliament on tuesday despite boycotts and protestors attempts to block lawmakers from arriving the demonstrators are demanding the complete removal of the country s ruling elite and an end to corruption syria s economy goes from very bad to worse as lebanon s crisis hits read more as the session opened diab said his government would draft an emergency plan before the end of the month to address looming repayments and challenges facing the country the prime minister s policy statement which was approved last week addresses lebanon s laundry list of economic and structural problems and says that they will be resolved in a three staged recovery plan spanning up to three years the plan includes addressing issues with electricité du liban which has notoriously failed to provide electricity to lebanese homes without daily power cuts while the promises somewhat fall in line with some of the imf s recommendations last october they also are in tandem with conditions for lebanon to unlock a pledged 11 1bn in soft loans and grants by international donors at the cedre conference in paris in april 2018 the loans would be used for development projects aimed at rehabilitating lebanon s ailing infrastructure and create jobs in the process painful measures however the consequences of the economic crisis on ordinary lebanese people have been severe in addition to hiking prices currency devaluation and bank withdrawal limits as low as 100 per week lebanon has struggled to import basic necessities including medicine wheat and fuel doctors and human rights watch have warned that as a result hospitals may soon be unable to provide life saving medicine and surgeries in december the government urged numerous countries to provide import credit to help alleviate the issue but to no avail informal fundraisers and charity drives for medical costs food and housing have become more common however some of the proposed reforms by the diab government which faour says are generally in line with imf recommendations could be detrimental to ordinary people according to faour the imf is anyway very predictable when it comes to their policy recommendations he told mee it s almost always a combination of austerity privatizations revisiting the currency regime diab s policy statement hinted at austerity measures saying that some of the measures needed to revive the economy would be painful while promising to try to mitigate adverse effects on families with limited incomes he also explicitly promoted eventual privatization through public private partnerships despite high government spending faour told mee social spending and public investment is almost non existent by the government the consequences of these policies are very likely to be adverse for ordinary people

this blog post is from a volume by the aspen strategy group on the struggle for power u s china relations in the 21st century the chapters in this book deal with issues ranging from the military and technological rise of china and how to compete effectively to how to engage u s allies amidst this new great power rivalry keeping in mind two central questions about the u s china relationship is our analysis correct about the challenges china poses to our future and do we have the right balance between cooperation and competition with beijing in the chapter below authors anja manuel pavneet singh and thompson paine explore the tools that are available for the u s to win the technology race with china read the full collection of papers on the china challenge here www asgbooks org summary china systematically extracts advanced technology from the west it does so legally by mining open source databases investing in our most advanced companies and compelling technology transfer as a condition for doing business in china as well as illicitly through cybertheft and industrial espionage how we choose to react will define the united states as the leader or laggard in the development of critical technologies previous u s presidents of both parties were unable to shape china s behavior so far the trump administration has focused on trade negotiations and on defensive measures tightening foreign investment restrictions and export controls and slowing cross border collaboration 1 but these defensive measures alone will not be enough the u s must have an affirmative strategy that includes deepening our engagement with allies competing with china where we must and in some cases finding ways to collaborate this paper is designed to give congress and current and future administrations a firm grasp of the tools that are available to win the technology race with china it proposes a three pronged approach to addressing china s rise contest compete and collaborate with concrete policy actions we support continued engagement with china that engagement cannot succeed if china pays no costs for bad behavior we outline a narrowly tailored set of defensive measures below offensively we must augment the u s innovation system so that we can compete with china or other challengers we propose doing so by increasing investment in talent and r d and engaging in diplomacy to proactively set the international norms and standards that govern technology development finally where possible we should collaborate with china on technologies that do not implicate u s national security and where technical advancements would help humanity as a whole the challenge there is nothing wrong with china s desire to grow and in fact the u s and its allies should welcome the contributions china can make to future technological innovations but china often does not play fair chinese mercantilism undermines the norms and basic trust that support the global economic order if the united states does not act we risk ceding technological leadership and influence to set the norms values and standards for technology with four potentially disastrous consequences first and most clearly is the role foundational technologies play in spurring economic growth a second and closely related issue is that the chinese military will have direct seamless access to the frontier technologies through china s military civil fusion such a direct transfer will provide the people s liberation army pla with a military edge in future conflicts and destabilize the asia pacific region third the spread of china s orwellian ai enabled social control and surveillance systems to other countries will strengthen copycat authoritarian regimes finally if the u s does not lead in setting global technological standards and as cyber attacks become more common the world risks a minor digital conflict becoming a major kinetic one to recommend effective solutions we must first understand china s goals and how china is pursuing leadership in cutting edge technologies that will underpin the world s economy how china acquires technology through licit and illicit means china engages in aggressive behaviors to acquire advanced technologies including 2 compelling some chinese students and researchers at s universities to spy on the state s behalf 3 engaging in protectionism that blocks american internet firms from the chinese market thus insulating chinese national champions like tencent and baidu from competition and sponsoring economic espionage of private and public sector intellectual property ip which the ip commission estimates costs s companies 180 billion to 540 billion a year 4 simultaneously china employs legal means that additionally pose challenges to america s technological leadership including state subsidies to develop competitors in strategic technology sectors 5 forcing western companies to transfer their technology as a condition of doing business in the chinese market investments in and acquisitions of s companies with strategic technologies real innovation by chinese companies that have scale capital and excellent researchers such as tencent huawei or dji a chinese drone company mining western open source databases especially in ai 6 research partnerships with companies like baidu in silicon valley and microsoft in china and until recently with universities like berkeley and mit 7 and and recruiting s talent and enticing many chinese students and researchers in the united states to come back to china 8 9 critical technologies china is focused on while made in china 2025 identifies ten priority sectors we believe that if china dominates the following three critical technology sectors it could have an enormous negative impact on our military and economic security artificial intelligence ai is a general purpose technology akin to the steam engine or electricity with the potential to revolutionize a wide range of sectors china has a whole of government approach to achieve dominance in ai investing in key areas of talent data and hardware and ensuring its top ai firms do not compete with each other while also sharing their innovations with the government it further provides regulatory support including loose privacy and data protection regulations 10 semiconductors semiconductors are the most crucial building block of the information economy and the u s currently leads in global semiconductor production china consumes one half of the world s semiconductors but currently produces only about 3 percent 11 its goal is to produce 70 percent of domestic demand in china by 2025 12 china has massive public private funding vehicles espionage efforts directed at leading american companies like micron and strategic partnerships with leaders like intel 13 5g 5g will be the backbone of the new economy providing the antennas and routing infrastructure on which everything from cellphones to the entire internet of things will rely including electricity grids smart cities and autonomous vehicles our economy will grow highly dependent on 5g and thus will be more vulnerable to sabotage 14 china has an advantage and is several years ahead in deploying 5g because its national champion huawei is both genuinely innovative and has benefited tremendously from state subsidies and industrial espionage against western companies 15 huawei is building 5g networks in many countries at an equivalent quality to ericsson and nokia but for 35 percent less 16 and is gaining valuable know how along the way other technologies in addition to ai semiconductors and 5g china s internet plus and made in china 2025 call for the government to invest in and push innovation in sectors including robotics aerospace autonomous vehicles cleantech quantum computing and biomedicine in some of these sectors the u s and china could usefully cooperate while in others the potential for dual use military applications is too great the proposal this paper outlines a three pronged approach of contesting defense competing with offense and collaborating with china to ensure the u s maintains its leadership position in global technology the proposal aims to reduce the severity of china s illicit behaviors compel china s adherence to norms and rules in the development and trade of technology and ensure america s continued leadership in next generation technologies defensive measures contesting chinese efforts defensive measures are a crucial way to protect the united states from cyber espionage and other leakage of key technology secrets thus far congress and the trump administration reformed the committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius in 2018 proposed the tightening of export controls scrutinized and slowed cross border collaboration and publicly aired the possibility of restricting chinese student visas however the administration has not articulated a clear strategic vision for which technologies it wants to protect and why this paper proposes a clear purposeful application of these tools to reduce china s transgressions prevent ip leaks via foreign transactions investment m a joint ventures and partnerships in 2018 congress substantially reformed the law that governs foreign investment to make it more difficult for foreign companies to invest in cutting edge technology in the united states this was a commendable start but it needs to be refined and strengthened over time currently cfius through firrma foreign investment risk review modernization act provides only a vague list of critical technologies and requires reviews of investment into the united states by all countries even nato allies that do not present security concerns draft regulations published in october 2019 began to fix some of these problems we believe that the current administration should additionally create a scientific and private sector advisory panel that defines on an ongoing basis which critical technologies we need to protect this panel can help strike the right balance between ensuring security while not stifling innovation exact costs for transgressions chinese firms should incur consequences when they break the rules in addition to pursuing world trade organization wto actions against china the united states should narrowly exercise available executive investigative and sanctioning powers as appropriate under the international emergency economic powers act ieepa the entity list of the commerce department s bureau of industry and security bis and section 337 1930 tariff act actions to punish specific chinese firms or industry sectors for forced technology transfer economic espionage and market protectionism 17 the trump administration has used the entity list to punish firms like zte and huawei the entity list is a powerful tool that can generate unintended consequences however and we believe it should be used in a narrowly tailored and measured way for example when huawei was listed in may 2019 it lost access not just to the u s 5g market which is a legitimate concern but also to intel s chips and google s android operating system which arguably does not implicate national security and harms u s companies in the process don t go it alone defensive actions will carry even more weight if we do them jointly with like minded nations this will encourage the norms of behavior the united states and its allies expect in a global technology economy moving forward please see our proposal for the tech 10 below sanction support for china s techno authoritarianism the united states should take a clear stand against china s increasingly brazen use of technology to create an advanced surveillance state that abuses human rights 18 the uyghurs a turkic muslim group of chinese citizens have suffered the most under this system and china has shown a willingness to export its methods to other authoritarian states 19 the united states could at the very least use the global magnitsky act to sanction implicated chinese officials and add to the entity list firms that materially support these abuses as it did in october 2019 the senate s uyghur human rights policy act of 2019 s 178 is a good start 20 offensive measures competing with china while we must take basic precautions to protect our technology pulling up the drawbridge and digging a moat around u s technology is impossible and will not alone help us win this high stakes race instead we must once again set global norms and values for technology and reinforce our own ability to innovate global diplomacy shape the global norms for technology after world war ii the u s led the creation of the international order as we know it today including multilateral institutions like the wto international monetary fund and the international atomic energy agency to establish norms for peaceful economic relations and technology standards it was an enormous effort and it paid off it is time for a comparable effort to form a robust international innovation ecosystem among countries that share the same values in tech development a proposal we call the tech 10 the tech 10 would join the united states with other technology powers with shared values to coordinate national postures on technology development use and access the inaugural members would include the united states the united kingdom australia canada france germany india israel japan and south korea others could apply to join as long as they agree to adhere to the same high standards regular coordination and working group meetings would occur through respective ministries of defense intelligence and trade with the input of academic and private institutions from the defensive perspective these countries should share information and coordinate on narrowly tailored export controls investment restrictions and cybersecurity the tech 10 would share best practices and intelligence and shape shared perspectives and norms related to deterrence policy tools e g cfius export controls supply chain security and investment in and licensing of critical infrastructure and dual use technologies among other relevant topics the tech 10 could further coordinate research and pool resources and talent to tackle key opportunities in advanced ai semiconductor research and quantum computing members could also form working groups with other stakeholders in particular the private sector and academia to begin to define norms to govern safe uses of ai and other advanced technology u s government actions federal r d many of the fundamental breakthroughs underlying the u s economy today benefited from federally sponsored research through the military national labs or corporate labs these breakthroughs include the transistor microprocessor sequencing the human genome the internet gps and many others 21 federally funded research increased rapidly in the 1950s and early 1960s reaching a peak of almost 2 percent of gdp in 1964 22 today that figure has declined to 0 7 percent 23 to foster the breakthroughs needed for tomorrow s economy the united states must commit to a generational national investment in science and technology over time we believe the u s should aspire to grow federal r d to 1 percent of gdp or more an increase to approximately 200 billion 24 this approach could include increasing funding at advanced research projects agency energy arpa e defense advanced research projects agency darpa national laboratories universities and federally funded research and development centers through competitive grant frameworks coordinating this increase in funding with strategic national priorities for innovation funding research in areas where the venture capital market is not investing so that more capital intensive and riskier ideas can be pursued reorienting the small business innovation research program so that federal agencies provide more money for seed and pre seed ideas with a streamlined application process forming a s government investment fund that matches funds invested by private capital going into sectors of national interest that are under funded such as semiconductors and 5g and identifying a handful of moonshots for public private cooperation and providing economic incentives for academic institutions labs and private firms to partner and strive toward ambitious goals talent and workforce development science and technology talent are the foundations of america s success and we are falling behind the united states must make a generational investment in the nation s technological talent base by improving the science technology engineering and math stem education system recruiting more tech savvy talent into the federal government and reforming our immigration policy stem education in the recent organization for economic co operation and development s oecd programme for international student assessment worldwide ranking of student math science and reading scores in 2015 2016 china ranked tenth while the u s was thirty first 25 the united states must reverse this trend by building the pipeline of stem talent starting in k 12 the federal government should provide funding for school districts that establish computer science cs as a core non elective curriculum offering and provide loan forgiveness for cs graduates who teach k 12 cs courses technical chops in government service we need more competence among u s policy makers on issues of technology congressional questioning of mark zuckerberg at hearings in april 2018 showed that some members of congress are woefully unprepared to govern on issues of advanced technology the federal government should support technologists who want to do less lucrative but invaluable service in the government through fellowship programs expanding loan forgiveness supporting tech companies efforts to place employees in short secondments in government or even rotc like programs to recruit students with stem training into public service 26 finally we should reestablish the office of technology assessment ota as a neutral research agency within the u s congress staffed by scientists and technologists ota used to provide nonpartisan advice to members of congress on science and technology issues it was unwisely defunded during the gingrich revolution in 1994 attract and retain the best global talent the united states must embrace perhaps our deepest advantage over china that the best and brightest international stem talents aspire to study at american universities and work for u s companies as of 2017 the united states had twenty six of the top fifty universities in the world compared to china s two and eight of the ten top technology companies 27 expanding the u s educational advantage could include increasing the annual allocation of h1 b visas and extending post graduate work visas to foreign graduates the united states should not block chinese students from studying or working in the u s technology sector not only is china a leading contributor of top ai talent to american companies but data suggests most want to stay in the united states 28 29 to protect against espionage the united states should set narrowly tailored federal guidelines on research topics that students from countries of concern may not participate in strictly punish students or employees caught spying and proactively educate chinese students and employees on china s blackmail efforts targeting overseas chinese public private sector collaboration in addition to the federal r d investments listed above this paper proposes enhancing channels of information sharing regarding resources and opportunities for funding and collaboration including 1 building a web based data driven ip map outlining strategic sectors for prioritized investment and collaboration 2 developing sophisticated roadshows to demonstrate federally funded technology to investors and 3 establishing competent interagency outposts in innovation centers in silicon valley boston austin new york etc collaborate opportunities to work with china although china is a serious strategic competitor the united states should continue to seek trade and economic cooperation with china as long as the playing field is fair if we identify and capitalize on opportunities to build trust we can increase the odds of better behavior from china in the long term private capital turning away all chinese capital would be short sighted and harmful to u s competitiveness china invested 49 billion in the united states in 2016 though that figure was down approximately 90 percent by 2018 30 as long as private chinese capital meets the standards and accepts the restrictions set by cfius u s companies should welcome the financial support for our economy problems of the global commons a range of technologies can help mitigate international threats such as climate change nuclear non proliferation and intellectual property theft the united states should continue to engage china in addressing such problems including by sharing non critical technologies to facilitate those efforts non critical technologies there are areas of chinese technological investment where the united states should leverage china s success for example china s investment in solar panels has reduced the cost of solar deployment in the united states accelerating our shift to a clean energy economy 31 conclusion china s technological rise is a real challenge to the united states and the international system to respond effectively the u s with its allies must clarify what lines cannot be crossed such as industrial espionage and forced technology transfer amid china s otherwise legitimate efforts and promptly enforce those rules by exacting costs for transgressions however defense alone will not be sufficient we must reinvest in america s own ability to compete and lead in innovation including talent development and federal r d and strengthen our global alliances in order to lead the norms rules and institutions that will govern technological innovation for the coming century china views technological supremacy as a core driver of the economic and military dominance in the world they aspire to so too should the united states such focus will help us out compete china in this strategic contest and secure american leadership for the twenty first century a longer version of this proposal was first developed for the

mexico s president aml obrador begins construction of 2 700 branches of a government owned bank by ellen brown al jazeerah ccun february 12 2020 mexican president am lopez obrador february 8 2020 while u s advocates and local politicians struggle to get their first public banks chartered mexico s new president has begun construction on 2 700 branches of a government owned bank to be completed in 2021 when it will be the largest bank in the country at a press conference on jan 6 he said the neoliberal model had failed private banks were not serving the poor and people outside the cities so the government had to step in andrés manuel lópez obrador known as amlo has been compared to the united kingdom s left wing opposition leader jeremy corbyn with one notable difference amlo is now in power he and his left wing coalition won by a landslide in mexico s 2018 general election overturning the institutional revolutionary party pri that had ruled the country for much of the past century called mexico s first full fledged left wing experiment amlo s election marks a dramatic change in the political direction of the country amlo wrote in his 2018 book a new hope for mexico in mexico the governing class constitutes a gang of plunderers mexico will not grow strong if our public institutions remain at the service of the wealthy elites the new president has held to his campaign promises in 2019 his first year in office he did what donald trump pledged to do drain the swamp purging the government of technocrats and institutions he considered corrupt profligate or impeding the transformation of mexico after 36 years of failed market focused neoliberal policies other accomplishments have included substantially increasing the minimum wage while cutting top government salaries and oversize pensions making small loans and grants directly to farmers guaranteeing crop prices for key agricultural crops launching programs to benefit youth the disabled and the elderly and initiating a 44 billion infrastructure plan lópez obrador s goal he says is to construct a new paradigm in economic policy that improves human welfare not just increases gross domestic product the end of the neoliberal era to deliver on that promise in july 2019 amlo converted the publicly owned federal savings bank bansefi into a bank of the poor banco del bienestar or welfare bank he said on jan 6 that the neoliberal era had eliminated all the state owned banks but one which he had gotten approval to expand with 2 700 new branches added to the existing 538 branches of the former bansefi that will bring the total in two years to 3 238 branches far outstripping any other bank in the country banco azteca currently the largest by number of branches has 1 860 digital banking will also be developed speaking to a local group in december amlo said his goal was for the bank of the poor to reach 13 000 branches more than all the private banks in the country combined at a news conference on jan 8 he explained why this new bank was needed there are more than 1 000 municipalities that don t have a bank branch we re dispersing resources but we don t have a way to do it people have to go to branches that are two three hours away if we don t bring these services close to the people we re not going to bring development to the people they re already building i ll invite you within two months three at the most to the inauguration of the first branches because they re already working they re getting the land because we have to do it quickly the president said the 10 billion pesos 530 4 million needed to build the new branches would come from government savings and that 5 million had already been transferred to the banco del bienestar which would pass the funds to the secretariat of defense whose engineers were responsible for construction the military will also be used to transport physical funds to the branches for welfare payments amlo added they are helping me they are propping me up the military has behaved very well and they don t back down at all they always tell me yes you can yes we do go to concerns that the government owned bank would draw deposits away from commercial banks and might compete in other ways such as making interest free loans to small businesses amlo countered there s no reason to be complaining about us building these branches f private banks want to build branches they have every right to go to the towns and build their branches but as they won t because they believe that it s not business we have to do it it s our social responsibility the state can t shirk its social responsibility issues with the central bank while the legislature has approved the new bank mexico s central bank can still block it if bank regulations are breached ricardo delfín who works at the international accounting firm kpmg told the newspaper la razón that if the money to fund the bank comes from a loan from the federal government rather than from capital it will adversely affect the bank s capitalization ratio but amlo contends that the bank will be self sufficient funding for construction will come from federal savings from other programs and the bank s operating expenses will be covered by small commissions paid on each transaction by customers most of whom are welfare recipients branches will be built on land owned by the government or donated and software companies have offered to advise for free about the central bank he said we re going to speak with those from the bank of méxico respecting the autonomy of the bank of méxico we have to educate them because for them this is an anachronism even sacrilege because they have other ideas but we ve arrived here after telling the people that the neoliberal economic policy was going to change there shouldn t be obstacles how is the bank of méxico going to stop us from having a branch that disperses resources in favor of the people what damage does that do whom does it harm amlo has repeatedly promised not to interfere in the business of the central bank which has been autonomous for the past quarter of a century but he has also said that he would like its mandate expanded from just preserving the value of the peso by fighting inflation to include fostering growth the concern according to the financial times is that he might use the central bank to fund government programs following in the footsteps of argentina s former president cristina fernández de kirchner whose heterodox policies led to high inflation and many economists believe the country s current crisis mark weisbrot counters in the new york times that argentina s problems were caused not by printing money to fund domestic development but by a massive foreign debt hyperinflation actually happened under fernández de kirchner s successor president mauricio macri who replaced her in 2015 the public debt grew from 53 to more than 86 of gdp inflation soared from 18 to 54 short term interest rates shot up to 75 and poverty increased from 27 to 40 in an upset election in august 2019 the outraged argentinian public re elected fernández de kirchner as vice president and her former head of the cabinet of ministers as president restoring the 12 year kirchner legacy begun by her husband nestor kirchner in 2003 and considered by weisbrot to be among the most successful presidencies in the western hemisphere more appropriate than argentina as a model for what can be achieved by a government working in partnership with its central bank is that of japan where prime minister shinzo abe has funded his stimulus programs by selling government bonds directly to the bank of japan the boj now holds nearly 50 of the government s debt yet consumer price inflation remains low so low that the boj cannot get the figure up even to its 2 target other funding options amlo is unlikely to go that route because he has vowed not to interfere with the central bank but analysts say he needs to introduce some sort of economic stimulus because mexico s gdp has slipped in the last year the mexican president has criticized gdp as the ultimate standard advocating instead for a model of development that incorporates wealth distribution and access to education health housing and culture into its measurements but as kurt hackbarth warned in jacobin in december to fully unfurl program without simply ransacking other line items to pay for it will require doing something amlo has up to now categorically ruled out raising taxes on the rich and large corporations which not surprisingly make out like utter bandits in mexico s rigged financial system amlo has continually vowed however not to raise taxes on the rich instead he has enlisted mexico s business magnates as investors in public private partnerships allowing him to avoid the tequila trap that brought down argentina and mexico itself in earlier years getting locked into debt to foreign investors and the international monetary fund mexico s business leaders seem happy to invest in the country despite some slippage in gdp as noted by carlos slim mexico s wealthiest man debt didn t go up there is no fiscal deficit and inflation came down in november 2019 the economy secretariat reported that foreign direct investment showed a 7 8 increase in the first nine months of that year compared with the same period in 2018 reaching its second highest level ever and at the end of 2019 the peso was up around 4 stocks also rose 4 5 and inflation dropped from 4 8 to 3 partnering with local businessleaders is politically expedient but public private partnerships can be expensive and as u k professor richard werner points out tapping up private investors merely recirculates existing money in the economy better would be to borrow directly from banks which create new bank money when they lend as the bank of england has confirmed this new money then circulates in the economy stimulating productivity today the best model for that approach is china which funds infrastructure by borrowing from its own state owned banks like all banks they create loans as bank credit on their books which is then repaid with the proceeds of the projects created with the loans there is no need to tap up the central bank or rich investors or the tax base government banks can create money on their books just as central banks and private banks do for mexico however using its public banks as china does would be something for the future if at all meanwhile amlo has been a trailblazer in showing how a national public banking system can be initiated quickly and efficiently the key it seems is just to have the political will along with massive support from the public the legislature local business leaders and the military _______________________ this article was first posted on truthdig com ellen brown chairs the public banking institute and has written thirteen books including her latest

collective agreement reached with the usw we look forward to bringing people back to work following the completion of the ratification process the company generated revenue of 80 1 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 as compared to 284 8 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 141 6 million in the third quarter of 2019 the company partially mitigated the impacts of the strike by selling unencumbered lumber and log inventories during the fourth quarter of 2019 for the year ended december 31 2019 western generated annual revenue of 807 7 million as compared to annual revenue of 1 196 7 million in 2018 western reported negative adjusted ebitda of 1 5 million as compared to 143 5 million in 2018 summary of fourth quarter 2019 results fourth quarter results were significantly impacted by the strike as all of our timberlands and most of our bc based manufacturing operations were curtailed we took steps to mitigate the strike s impact on our customers business and cash flows by selling the majority of our remaining unencumbered lumber inventory processing certain unencumbered logs at custom cut facilities drawing down working capital and deferring certain expenditures adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter of 2019 was negative 18 1 million as compared to positive ebitda of 18 0 million from the same period last year operating loss prior to restructuring and other items was 29 6 million as compared to operating income of 7 7 million in the same period last year sales lumber and log sales volume and revenue were impacted by the strike lumber revenue in the fourth quarter was 66 1 million a decrease of 71 4 from the same period last year lumber shipment volumes were 80 3 lower than the same period last year due to the strike as most of our manufacturing operations were shutdown in the fourth quarter of 2019 we sold the majority of our remaining unencumbered lumber inventory processed certain unencumbered logs at custom cut facilities and continued to execute on our wholesale lumber program to service our customers and help mitigate the impact of the strike our united states us based columbia vista division continued to perform in line with our expectations and has been a positive addition to our business and product mix our average realized lumber pricing increased 45 1 as the result of an improved specialty product mix which was partially offset by a stronger canadian dollar cad to united states dollar usd specialty lumber represented 79 1 of fourth quarter shipments compared to 49 5 in the same period last year as we leveraged our wholesale lumber business and custom cut production to supply our customers log revenue was 12 1 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 a decrease of 66 6 from the same period last year to mitigate the impact of the strike on our business we sold certain unencumbered log inventory to help manage cash flow and reduce working capital levels by product revenue was 1 9 million a decrease of 89 3 as compared to the same period last year as most of our bc coastal operations were shut down due to the strike operations to support our selected customers during the strike we continued to redirect available inventory to active divisions we operated on a sub optimal basis resulting in higher transportation and operating costs operating expenses included 16 7 million arising from curtailed operations and related operating inefficiencies as a result of the strike leading up to the strike we drew down inventory at usw certified operations to supply our remanufacturing and custom cut operations however as certain inventory was encumbered by the strike and degraded over the fourth quarter of 2019 we expensed an additional 2 4 million provision against this restricted inventory lumber production of 34 million board feet was 83 0 lower than the same period last year incremental production from our us based columbia vista division acquired in 2019 and volumes from our custom cut program was more than offset by the curtailment of our bc operations due to the strike we produced 21 000 cubic meters of logs from our bc coastal operations in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to production of 1 135 000 cubic metres in the same quarter of last year fourth quarter log production in 2019 was sourced from joint ventures and limited partnerships as all our usw certified timberlands operations were curtailed due to the strike bc coastal saw log purchases were 34 000 cubic metres an 84 0 decrease from the same period last year weaker markets and government policy decisions led to a significant decline in coastal log harvest that reduced market log availability we sourced our saw log purchases from pre existing purchase commitments and our joint venture arrangements freight expense decreased by 19 3 million from the same period last year due to lower shipment volumes fourth quarter adjusted ebitda and operating income included 3 4 million of countervailing duty cvd and anti dumping duty ad as compared to 10 1 million in the same period last year duty expense declined as a result of reduced us destined lumber shipment volumes selling and administration expense fourth quarter selling and administration expense was 8 0 million in 2019 as compared to 7 6 million in the same period last year incremental legal expenses relating to the strike more than offset cost mitigation savings finance costs finance costs were 2 2 million compared to 0 7 million in the same period last year this was primarily due to a higher average outstanding debt balance and higher average interest rates in 2019 as at december 31 2019 the company had drawn 114 1 million on its credit facility net income loss net loss for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 29

million during the same period last year sales lumber revenue was 628 3 million a decrease of 34 1 from the same period last year primarily due to the strike and more challenging market conditions despite the decline in market pricing our average lumber price realizations increased benefitting from a higher specialty product mix and a weaker cad to usd specialty lumber represented 58 3 of 2019 annual shipments compared to 49 9 last year despite a more challenging year we were successful in more than doubling our wholesale lumber volume to service our customers and help mitigate the impact of the strike log revenue was 144 0 million a decrease of 10 0 compared to the same period last year log revenue benefited from the resumption of our export log sales program in the second quarter of 2019 but was offset by the impact of the strike in the third and fourth quarters of 2019 by products revenue decreased to 35 4 million from 83 8 million last year primarily due to lower production and shipments as a result of the strike other factors included declining bc coastal chip prices and lower chip purchase and resale volume operations lumber production of 491 million board feet was 43 2 lower than the same period last year market related sawmill curtailments and the strike led to lower production which more than offset the inclusion of results from our us based columbia vista division log production was 2 214 000 cubic metres 48 8 lower than the same period last year primarily due to the strike in the second half of 2019 bc coastal saw log purchases were 564 000 cubic metres a 42 4 decrease from the same period last year as we managed log purchases to available capacity to support customer needs freight expense decreased by 26 5 million as compared to last year primarily due to lower shipment volumes as a result of the strike adjusted ebitda and operating income included 27 8 million of cvd and ad expense as compared to 43 0 million in 2018 duty expense declined as a result of reduced us destined lumber shipment volumes due to the strike selling and administration expense selling and administration expense was 31 1 million as compared to 32 0 million during the same period last year we took steps to reduce and manage expenses in order to mitigate increased legal expense and operating losses resulting from the strike finance costs finance costs were 7 8 million compared to 2 7 million in 2018 primarily due to comparatively higher average outstanding debt and higher average interest rate in 2019 as a result of adopting ifrs 16 leases on january 1 2019 we recognized 0 8 million of finance costs on lease payments in 2019 in comparative periods leasing finance costs were recognized in operating income net income loss net loss for 2019 was 46 7 million as compared to net income of 69 2 million last year net income for the year was lower due to the strike which largely curtailed operations in the second half of 2019 columbia vista asset acquisition on february 1 2019 we completed the asset acquisition of vancouver washington based columbia vista corporation and related entities this acquisition is consistent with our strategy of pursuing margin focused business opportunities that complement our position in selected markets bringing western and columbia vista together provides us the opportunity to expand our douglas fir specialty product offerings particularly in japan which will support our bc based hemlock programs the combination of columbia vista and western makes us more meaningful to our selected customers and creates a stronger company for all our employees sale of ownership interest in port alberni forest operations on march 29 2019 we completed the sale of a 7 interest in our newly formed tfl 44 limited partnership tfl 44 lp to the huumiis ventures limited partnership a limited partnership beneficially owned by the huu ay aht first nations hvlp for gross proceeds of 7 3 million as part of the agreement hvlp may acquire an additional interest in the tfl 44 lp which may include a majority interest subject to further negotiations tfl 44 lp s assets consist of tfl 44 and certain other associated assets and liabilities of our port alberni forest operation we will continue to source fibre from tfl 44 lp to support our bc manufacturing facilities arlington operation during 2019 we completed infrastructure and equipment upgrades and commenced secondary processing however the expected ramp up of production at the facility has been partially impacted by the strike and a lack of wholesale lumber supply due to market conditions our arlington facility is currently operating on a reduced basis due to a lack of lumber supply resulting from the strike operating restructuring items we incurred 3 5 million of operating restructuring costs in 2019 including 1 4 million of non operating costs incurred due to the indefinite curtailment of the company s somass sawmill in 2017 during the fourth quarter of 2019 we incurred 2 1 million in severance and related expenses due to a reduction of approximately 10 in salaried employees as a cost mitigation initiative to limit losses arising from the strike operating restructuring costs were 4 8 million in 2018 due primarily to the indefinite curtailment of our somass sawmill business optimization initiatives and closure of the englewood train income taxes lower operating earnings led to an income tax recovery of 16 7 million being recognized in 2019 as compared to income tax expense of 25 6 million in 2018 at december 31 2019 the company and its subsidiaries had unused non capital loss carry forwards totalling approximately 24 1 million in canada and 5 2 million in the us which can be used to reduce taxable income in addition the company has unused capital losses carried forward of approximately 87 9 million in canada which are available indefinitely labour relations update western began negotiations with the usw the union representing approximately 1 500 of our hourly employees and 1 500 employees working for our timberland contractors in bc in april 2019 for a new collective agreement to replace our prior agreement which expired mid june 2019 the usw served seventy two hours notice of strike action on the company and some of its contractors on june 28 2019 on july 1 2019 the usw commenced a strike the strike is ongoing for all of our usw certified manufacturing and timberlands operations the strike is also indirectly impacting certain non usw certified manufacturing operations including our ladysmith sawmill due to insufficient log supply and our value added remanufacturing facility due to a lack of lumber supply our us based arlington and columbia vista divisions continue to operate although our arlington facility is operating on a reduced basis due to a lack of lumber supply caused by the strike upon receiving strike notice from the usw we commenced our work stoppage contingency plan with a goal to protect our balance sheet while mitigating the impact of the strike on our company customers and business partners on september 13 2019 the company and the usw commenced mediation with independent mediators vince ready and amanda rodgers however the usw withdrew from mediation with the company and independent mediators after several hours of talks the company and usw subsequently met with the independent mediators on several occasions to resume talks but on december 17 2019 negotiations reached an impasse on february 6 2020 the bc minster of labour appointed vince ready and amanda rogers as special mediators to work with the company and usw for a period of 10 days to determine if a negotiated settlement could be reached on february 10 2020 the company announced that terms of a tentative collective agreement had been reached the tentative agreement is subject to a ratification vote by usw membership the usw bargaining committee has advised that they will be recommending its members accept the agreement the usw has advised its members that the ratification voting will occur shortly despite terms of a tentative collective agreement being reached the strike is expected to have a negative impact on our first quarter results in 2020 compared to the same period last year but we are unable to determine the magnitude of that impact at this time bc government forest policies in 2018 the bc provincial government the province introduced a coastal revitalization initiative and further policy initiatives that will affect the bc forest sector regulatory framework on january 17 2019 the premier announced the province s commitment to make changes to bc s log export policies and rules bill 13 and waste policies with the intent to increase domestic and value added manufacturing in bc on april 1 2019 the province announced the creation of fibre recovery zones which are intended to increase the supply of residual fibre from primary harvesting for secondary users western estimates that approximately 70 of our timberland operations will be impacted with the creation of fibre recovery zones the impacts to our business include the potential for higher costs and lower log harvest volumes the province has been clear that they do not want to see unintended consequences from the policy implementation we continue to collaboratively engage with the province and other stakeholders to ensure that the desired outcome of the policy less fibre waste and more fibre for domestic manufacturing and pulp production is met without the unintended consequences of higher costs and less harvest volume for timberland operators on april 11 2019 the province announced bill 22 forest amendment act 2019 which came into force on may 30 2019 the amendments to the forest act will require tenure holders to receive approval from the minister before disposing or transferring a tenure agreement to a third party these amendments will enable the minister to refuse to approve or place conditions on the approval of a disposition or transfer if it is deemed not to be in the public interest or detrimental to competition in the buying or selling of timber or residuals on may 16 2019 bill 21 forest and range practices amendment act 2019 designed to increase opportunities for public input improve information sharing on forest planning strengthen the minister s ability to manage forest activity expand the definition of wildlife to help protect at risk species and improve and streamline range use planning was put into force on july 10 2019 the province announced the application of a targeted fee in lieu of manufacturing for exported logs harvested from bc timber sales as a step towards ensuring that more logs are processed in bc on july 17 2019 the province announced that a two person panel had been appointed to lead an old growth strategic review and provide a report to the minister of forests lands natural resource operations and rural development the mflnrord the panel will report back to government in spring 2020 with recommendations that are expected to inform a new approach to old growth management for bc on november 28 2019 bill 41 declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples act the act came into force the act is intended to guide the implementation of the principles of the united nations declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples undrip and makes bc the first province in canada to legally implement undrip the act requires the province to align all laws with undrip to develop an action plan to achieve this and regularly report to the legislature to monitor progress the current federal government has also pledged to implement undrip and the calls to action of the truth and reconciliation commission significant expectation has been raised among aboriginal groups in bc and across the country as to the impact that this act and the federal government s commitments may have on efforts to achieve true reconciliation with aboriginal groups at this time the company is unable to predict the outcome of the act and the implementation of these commitments on western s ongoing operations or on any sale of its non core assets and private lands in december 2019 the mflnrord indicated that there would be a delay in expanding the fee in lieu payment for raw log exports to all cutting permits on the bc coast by six months and that the province would be shrinking the penalties and zones for fibre recovery zones specific details of these policies changes have not been disclosed on january 21 2020 the province announced changes to the manufactured forest products regulation effective july 1 2020 to ensure more accessibility to fibre for local manufacturers the regulation amendments require lumber that is made from western red cedar wrc or cypress yellow cedar to be fully manufactured to be eligible for export fully manufactured is defined as lumber that will not be kiln dried planed or re sawn at a facility outside of bc the impact these policy initiatives may have on our operations cannot be determined at this time separately on december 20 2019 the company was notified by the mflnrord that an alternative method of scale would apply for all the company s timber that was cut prior to july 1 2019 and had not been scaled the company is required to compile and submit a report of all the timber to mflnrord which will result in stumpage expense becoming payable shortly thereafter the company has requested clarification from mflnrord and cannot determine the financial impact at this time we have not accrued for any incremental stumpage expense that may become payable under this alternative scaling method as at december 31 2019 sawmill and remanufacturing curtailments due to market conditions in 2019 our cowichan bay sawmill was temporarily curtailed for a two week period beginning march 25 2019 and our alberni pacific sawmill was temporarily curtailed for a four week period beginning march 18 2019 our ladysmith sawmill was temporary curtailed for a two week period beginning may 6 2019 due to constrained log supply on june 6 2019 we announced temporary production curtailments at three of our sawmills to align production volumes to customer demand we curtailed our duke point sawmill for two weeks and our saltair sawmill for one week in june we reduced operating levels at our chemainus sawmill from 120 hours per week to 80 hours per week on july 24 2019 we announced an additional temporary curtailment at our ladysmith sawmill due to illegal strike action taken by the usw which impeded log supply to the mill subsequent to this announcement the labour relations board confirmed their earlier ruling that the usw tactics were illegal and ordered the usw to refrain from impeding log delivery to the mill the ladysmith sawmill continued to operate until it was curtailed on august 23 2019 due to limited log supply on september 6 2019 our bc value added remanufacturing facility was curtailed in response to limited lumber supply as a result of the strike the facility restarted during the fourth quarter of 2019 but its operations were limited due to limited lumber volumes from our suppliers our arlington remanufacturing facility in washington state operated sporadically in the second half of 2019 strategy and outlook western s long term business objective is to create superior value for shareholders by building a margin focused log and lumber business of scale to compete successfully in global softwood markets we believe this will be achieved by maximizing the sustainable utilization of our forest tenures operating safe efficient low cost manufacturing facilities and augmenting our sales of targeted high value specialty products for selected global customers with a lumber wholesale program we seek to manage our business with a focus on operating cash flow and maximizing value through the production and sales cycle we routinely evaluate our performance using the measure of return on capital employed continuing to guide our actions are the strategic initiatives presented below with selected accomplishments strengthen the foundation through our focused capital investments we have positioned western as the only company on the coast of bc capable of consuming the complete profile of the coastal forest and competitively manufacturing a diverse product mix our strategic capital investments have allowed us to increase the production of targeted products and supported the optimization of our coastal operations we have invested in our people and systems to create a platform for pursuing margin focused growth opportunities we continue to pursue long term relationships with coastal first nations to create mutually beneficial opportunities in 2019 we completed the sale of an ownership interest in our port alberni forest operation to hvlp aligning our interests and introducing an opportunity to potentially involve other first nations in a shared vision for forestry grow the base we optimized our operations and invested in our sawmills and timberlands to improve margins and position ourselves for growth we continue to look for opportunities to further optimize our operations to enhance profit margins we implemented multiple non capital margin improvement programs to improve our cost structure and optimize our supply chain the success of our business relationships with first nations has and continues to drive incremental log volume and enabled western to grow specialty lumber production in recent years we are executing on our sales and marketing strategy driving the production and sale of targeted high margin products of scale to selected customers that value our product offerings explore opportunities in 2018 we acquired our arlington distribution and processing facility the facility allows the company to increase the production of targeted finished products while also providing a centralized warehousing and distribution centre to more effectively service our selected us customers in 2019 we acquired the assets of columbia vista in vancouver washington enabling us to offer a broader array of douglas fir specialty products to our selected customers in both the us and japan we launched a new wholesale business which will provide complementary products to our industry leading specialty product offerings and enhance our return on capital employed we continue to evaluate opportunities to grow our business and long term shareholder value sales marketing strategy update we continue to progress with the execution of our sales and marketing strategy which focuses on the production and sale of targeted high margin products of scale to selected customers we supplement our key product offerings with purchased lumber to deliver the suite of products our customers require our columbia vista division continues to perform in line with our expectations and has been a positive addition to our business and product mix during 2019 we continued to develop and evaluate growth opportunities for our wholesale lumber business including more than doubling our shipments to 34 million board feet market outlook our long term view of market fundamentals remains unchanged in north america rising lumber consumption will be driven by increased new home construction a robust repair and renovation sector and growth of mass timber building technologies growing demand and reduced supply due to north american sawmill curtailments is expected to improve market fundamentals and benefit the industry long term despite positive long term growth drivers lumber markets were challenged in 2019 as north american weather events skilled labour constraints and higher mortgage rates stalled us new home construction and muted growth in repair and renovation spending in response to weak demand temporary and permanent production curtailments were announced in the forestry sector the supply impacts of these announcements are expected to support lumber pricing in 2020 we are encouraged by the positive market sentiment regarding wrc products heading into the spring building season low in market inventories and recent bc coastal cedar manufacturing closures should benefit wrc product pricing going forward in japan we expect steady demand for our douglas fir products however increased competition from european engineered wood products may pressure pricing we expect market share erosion and weaker pricing for bc coastal hemlock lumber in japan due to the supply shortages as a result of the strike and increased competition from japanese government subsidized domestic species the strike has resulted in certain japanese hemlock lumber customers switching to competing products we plan to leverage columbia vista s strong and loyal douglas fir customer base as well as develop marketing strategies to help regain our japanese hemlock lumber market share we anticipate demand for appearance niche products to improve resulting in modest price gains in addition we expect steady demand in north america for timbers and industrial products due to large scale industrial oil and gas projects currently underway in canada commodity lumber markets in north america are likely to benefit from previously announced temporary and permanent production curtailments but we expect any pricing gains to be modest the chinese log market continues to be influenced by increased supply of lower priced beetle impacted logs from europe we expect the log market in china to remain competitive over the near term in the short term the coronavirus could result in a temporary slow down of log and lumber imports to china however a government commitment to housing and continued positive economic growth should support long term demand for logs and lumber in china we expect domestic saw log prices to increase in response to reduced log availability and improving lumber markets log supply on the bc coast is expected to remain constrained as recent government initiates that have increased harvest costs are expected to challenge harvest economics we expect modest improvements in pulp log and chip pricing in 2020 due to limited supply strategic capital program our strategic capital program is focused on the installation of technology that will deliver top quartile performance and improve our ability to manufacture targeted products that yield the best margin in addition to investments in our manufacturing assets we also allocate capital to strategic high return projects involving our information systems timberlands assets and forest inventories given the challenging operating environment on the bc coast in part due to the uncertainty around bc government policies we have scaled back our capital investment plans until there is an improved operating environment or greater clarity on the impact of bc government policies the company has reduced strategic capital investment in bc we will continue to evaluate opportunities to invest strategic capital in jurisdictions that create opportunity to grow long term shareholder value softwood lumber dispute and us market update the us application of duties continues a long standing pattern of us protectionist action against canadian lumber producers we disagree with the inclusion of specialty lumber products particularly wrc and yellow cedar products in this commodity lumber focused dispute as duties paid are determined on the value of lumber exported and as our shipments to the us market are predominantly high value appearance grade lumber we are disproportionately impacted by these duties western expensed 27 8 million of export duties in 2019 comprised of cvd and ad at a combined rate of 20 23 on all lumber it sold into the us on february 3 2020 the us department of commerce doc issued preliminary revised rates in the cvd and ad first administrative review of shipments for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2018 the combined preliminary revised rates were 8 37 for 2017 and 8 21 for 2018 the doc may revise these rates between preliminary and the final determination expected in august 2020 cash deposits continue at the current rate of 20 23 until the final determinations are published at which time the 2018 rate will apply to us destined lumber sales at december 31 2019 western had 90 9 million of cash on deposit with the us department of treasury in respect of these softwood lumber duties including wholesale lumber shipments our sales to the us market represent approximately 27 of our total revenue in 2019 our distribution and processing centre in arlington washington and our columbia vista division in vancouver washington are expected to partially mitigate the damaging effects of duties on our products destined for the us market we intend to leverage our flexible operating platform to continue to partially mitigate any

to operating restructuring items and other income plus amortization of property plant equipment and intangible assets impairment adjustments and changes in fair value of biological assets adjusted ebitda margin is ebitda presented as a proportion of revenue western uses adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin as benchmark measurements of our own operating results and as benchmarks relative to our competitors we consider adjusted ebitda to be a meaningful supplement to operating income as a performance measure primarily because amortization expense impairment adjustments and changes in the fair value of biological assets are non cash costs and vary widely from company to company in a manner that we consider largely independent of the underlying cost efficiency of their operating facilities further the inclusion of operating restructuring items which are unpredictable in nature and timing may make comparisons of our operating results between periods more difficult we also believe adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are commonly used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties to evaluate our financial performance adjusted ebitda does not represent cash generated from operations as defined by international financial reporting standards ifrs and it is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs furthermore adjusted ebitda does not reflect the impact of a number of items that affect our net income adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are not measures of financial performance under ifrs and should not be considered as alternatives to measure performance under ifrs moreover because all companies do not calculate adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin in the same manner these measures as calculated by western may differ from similar measures as calculated by other companies a reconciliation between the company s net income as reported in accordance with ifrs and adjusted ebitda is included in the company s management s discussion analysis for the year ended december 31 2019 which is available under the company s profile on sedar at www sedar com also in this press release management uses key performance indicators such as net debt net debt to capitalization and current assets to current liabilities net debt is defined as long term debt less cash and cash equivalents net debt to capitalization is a ratio defined as net debt divided by capitalization with capitalization being the sum of net debt and equity current assets to current liabilities is defined as total current assets divided by total current liabilities these key performance indicators are non gaap financial measures that do not have a standardized meaning and may not be comparable to similar measures used by other issuers they are not recognized by ifrs however they are meaningful in that they indicate the company s ability to meet their obligations on an ongoing basis and indicate whether the company is more or less leveraged than the prior year western is an integrated forest products company building a margin focused log and lumber business to compete successfully in global softwood markets with

funds flow and operating earnings loss are non gaap measures see advisory 3 includes oil and natural gas liquids ngls financial highlights in 2019 cenovus increased cash from operating activities to approximately 3 3 billion from 2 2 billion the previous year and adjusted funds flow to about 3 7 billion from 1 7 billion in 2018 cenovus had free funds flow of approximately 2 5 billion in 2019 an eight fold increase from a year earlier driven by higher adjusted funds flow and disciplined capital spending fourth quarter free funds flow was 361 million compared with a shortfall of 312 million in the same period of 2018 the company s full year upstream results benefited from a 52 narrowing of the differential between west texas intermediate wti and western canadian select wcs crude oil prices in 2019 compared with 2018 as well as increased sales at locations outside of alberta where the company was able to achieve higher realized prices refining margins were lower compared with 2018 primarily due to reduced realized crack spreads with our low cost structure continued focus on capital discipline and our diversified transportation portfolio to get more of our product to u s markets we were able to generate very strong free funds flow in 2019 said pourbaix and we put that cash to good use further deleveraging our balance sheet and increasing our dividend in the fourth quarter of the year operating earnings from continuing operations were 456 million in 2019 compared with an operating loss from continuing operations of nearly 2 8 billion in 2018 the year ago results included a significant realized hedging loss as well as a number of significant non cash items full year 2019 net earnings from continuing operations were approximately 2 2 billion compared with a net loss from continuing operations of 2 9 billion a year earlier the year over year increase in net earnings was driven by higher operating earnings relative to 2018 non operating foreign exchange gains of 787 million in 2019 compared with losses of 593 million in 2018 and a deferred income tax recovery in 2019 including 671 million related to the reduction of alberta s corporate income tax rate and 387

included in its 2019 management discussion analysis md a available in the investors section at cenovus com balance sheet strength and capital discipline cenovus continued to make significant progress on its deleveraging plans through the past year repaying approximately us 1 8 billion of its unsecured notes and reducing net debt to 6 5 billion by year end compared with net debt of approximately 8 4 billion at the start of 2019 cenovus s net debt to adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda ratio was 1 6 times at the end of 2019 down from 1 9 times at the end of the third quarter and 5 9 times at the end of 2018 deleveraging remains a top priority for cenovus as the company continues to pursue its net debt target of 5 billion at net debt of 5 billion cenovus anticipates being in a position to maintain a target ratio of less than two times net debt to adjusted ebitda at bottom of the cycle commodity prices during the fourth quarter of 2019 moody s investors service affirmed cenovus s ba1 credit rating and improved its outlook from stable to positive citing the significant amount of debt reduction the company has achieved in addition to making progress towards re establishing an investment grade credit rating at moody s cenovus remains committed to maintaining its investment grade credit ratings at s p global ratings dbrs limited and fitch ratings market access and integration cenovus successfully ramped up its crude by rail shipping capacity in 2019 and in december exceeded its target by achieving average rail loading volumes of nearly 106 000 bbls d while pipelines remain the cornerstone of cenovus s transportation strategy rail continues to be an important option to bridge the gap until expansion pipelines are completed pipelines and rail are part of the company s integrated business model designed to maximize exposure to global oil prices and mitigate pipeline congestion through a range of options to increase margins and reduce cash flow volatility production curtailment cenovus s 2019 oil sands production averaged 354 257 bbls d approximately 2 lower than in 2018 primarily due to the government of alberta s mandated curtailment program fourth quarter oil sands volumes averaged 374 132 bbls d 15 higher than the same quarter in 2018 in december 2019 the alberta government introduced the special production allowance spa program which allows crude oil producers to exceed mandated curtailment levels if those volumes are transported using incremental crude by rail capacity in the fourth quarter of 2018 volumes were impacted by cenovus s voluntary decision to restrict oil sands production rates in response to pipeline constraints and wide light heavy oil differentials cenovus anticipates higher oil production levels overall this year compared with 2019 due to the return to unconstrained production with the spa program and the ramp up of christina lake phase g over the next six to 12 months while mandatory curtailment reduced our overall production volumes in 2019 it helped keep light heavy oil price differentials from reaching the record highs we saw at the end of 2018 contributing to a significant overall benefit for the province and for our industry said pourbaix compared with 2018 our royalty payments to the province of alberta increased significantly more than doubling to 1 1 billion in 2019 sustainability cenovus continues to deliver equally strong operational financial and environmental social and governance esg performance with a continued focus on being an esg leader within its industry in january cenovus announced its four esg focus areas and set bold targets to guide its performance related to climate and greenhouse gas ghg emissions indigenous engagement land and wildlife and water stewardship the company also announced last month it plans to invest 10 million per year for at least five years to build much needed new homes in six indigenous communities near cenovus s oil sands operations in northern alberta as part of its commitment to strong esg performance cenovus is committed to rigorous governance practices and industry leading safety performance in 2019 the company s overall health and safety performance improved from the previous year due to cenovus s focus on risk management and asset integrity the company also achieved the second lowest recordable injury frequency in its history operating highlights oil sands fourth quarter oil sands production at cenovus s christina lake and foster creek oil sands projects was more than 374 000 bbls d up from 355 000 bbls d in the third quarter of 2019 mainly driven by the easing of mandatory curtailment levels full year 2019 production declined slightly from a year earlier primarily due to curtailment as a result of the spa program and increased rail shipping capacity cenovus has returned to unconstrained production and the company expects to ramp up its christina lake phase g expansion over the next six to 12 months fourth quarter oil sands operating costs were 8 06 per barrel bbl essentially flat with the same period a year earlier full year oil sands operating costs were 8 15 bbl up 7 from 7 65 bbl in 2018 primarily due to lower volumes as a result of mandated curtailment per barrel oil sands operating costs also increased as a result of higher repairs and maintenance activity and related costs due to a turnaround at christina lake during the second quarter and higher fuel costs fuel costs increased year over year due to higher natural gas prices and fuel consumption as cenovus maintained normal steam injection rates at its oil sands operations while reducing production volumes to meet mandated curtailment levels cenovus continued to achieve further reductions in its oil sands sustaining capital costs in 2019 which declined 10 to 567 million or approximately 4 00 per barrel of capacity from the previous year at christina lake the steam to oil ratio sor was 2 0 in 2019 compared with 1 9 in 2018 at foster creek the sor was unchanged at 2 8 from a year earlier full year 2019 oil sands operating margin increased more than three fold year over year to approximately 3 5 billion due to higher average realized sales prices decreased transportation and blending costs and realized risk management losses of 23 million compared with losses of approximately 1 6 billion in 2018 partially offset by lower sales volumes and higher royalties deep basin cenovus has largely completed work to optimize its deep basin operating model to reduce costs improve efficiency and maximize value the company continues to take a disciplined approach in the deep basin and is driving the business to be resilient at bottom of the cycle commodity prices of us 45 bbl wti and alberta energy company aeco pricing of 1 50 per gigajoule the deep basin generated operating margin in excess of capital investment of 64 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 up 45 from the same period a year earlier operating margin in excess of capital investment was 189 million for the full year deep basin production averaged 97 423 barrels of oil equivalent per day boe d in 2019 a 19 decrease from 2018 levels due to natural declines from lower sustaining capital investment the divestiture of cenovus s pipestone partnership in 2018 and temporary well shut ins in response to low natural gas prices total deep basin operating costs decreased 16 in 2019 compared with the previous year as a result of the pipestone divestiture lower third party processing costs due to lower throughput and cenovus focusing on optimizing operations this optimization work included well interventions repair and maintenance activities and leveraging the company s processing infrastructure to lower the cost structure despite the 2019 year over year production decrease on a full year basis operating costs increased a modest 2 to 8 79 boe from 8 58 boe in 2018 refining and marketing cenovus s wood river illinois and borger texas refineries which are co owned with the operator phillips 66 had solid operational performance in 2019 crude oil runs and refined product output in 2019 were consistent with the previous year refining and marketing operating margin for the fourth quarter was 109 million compared with 251 million in the same quarter of 2018 full year refining and marketing operating margin was 737 million compared with operating margin of 996 million in the year earlier period the year over year decrease was primarily due to reduced crude cost advantage as heavy and medium sour crude oil differentials narrowed effective january 2020 the wood river refinery was re rated to reflect higher processing capacity of 346 000 gross bbls d an increase of 13 000 bbls d from 2019 cenovus s refining operating margin is calculated on a first in first out fifo inventory accounting basis using the last in first out lifo accounting method employed by most u s refiners operating margin from refining and marketing would have been 140 million lower in 2019 compared with 118 million higher in 2018 reserves cenovus s proved and probable reserves are evaluated each year by independent qualified reserves evaluators iqres at the end of 2019 cenovus had total proved reserves of approximately 5 1 billion boe essentially unchanged from 2018 while total proved plus probable reserves decreased 2 to about 6 9 billion boe proved bitumen reserves were approximately 4 8 billion barrels while proved plus probable bitumen reserves were about 6 4 billion barrels both relatively unchanged from 2018 cenovus s reserve life index rli for proved reserves is in excess of 30 years with proved plus probable reserves having an rli in excess of 40 years cenovus s 2019 proved reserves finding and development f d costs were 7 57 boe excluding changes in future development costs up 74 from 2018 reflecting lower proved reserves additions partially offset by decreased capital spending three year average proved reserves f d costs were 5 97 boe excluding changes in future development costs cenovus which primarily holds long life bitumen reserves believes another meaningful measure of efficiency is f d costs for proved developed reserves excluding changes in future development costs for 2019 cenovus s bitumen proved developed reserves f d costs were 2 49 bbl excluding changes in future development costs a decrease of more than 50 from 2018 mainly as a result of lower capital expenditure on christina lake phase g deferral of oil sands sustaining capital expenditure and the

presentation cenovus reports financial results in canadian dollars and presents production volumes on a net to cenovus before royalties basis unless otherwise stated cenovus prepares its financial statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs barrels of oil equivalent natural gas volumes have been converted to barrels of oil equivalent boe on the basis of six thousand cubic feet mcf to one barrel bbl boe may be misleading particularly if used in isolation a conversion ratio of one bbl to six mcf is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent value equivalency at the wellhead given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil compared with natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency conversion ratio of 6 1 utilizing a conversion on a 6 1 basis is not an accurate reflection of value finding and development costs finding and development f d costs are calculated by dividing the sum of total exploration and development costs incurred in 2019 in respect of the relevant product types by the sum of total additions and revisions for the

on jan 7 tesla inc became the most highly valued automobile manufacturer in u s history a nearly fourfold increase since july brought its stock to 471 carrying its market cap 85 billion far beyond those of general motors 50 billion and ford 37 billion since then tesla has surged past volkswagen ag to trail only toyota as the world s most highly valued automaker its stock rose past 900 last week and has at this writing retreated to the high 700s still an unprecedented valuation for a 15 year old company that has never turned an undisputed profit investors who bought tesla shares on the rise are undoubtedly ecstatic those who shorted tesla shares are likely depressed technophiles and true believers are enthusiastically trumpeting elon musk s vision of the future the cautious who invest based on economic fundaments are shaking their heads but with a certain degree of grudging amazement national security professionals should be afraid a bubble is building my purpose is not to denounce tesla but to point out that it is providing national security professionals with a case study in the making the company has both a reputation as one of america s most innovative companies and a valuation reminiscent of some public corporations of the late 1920s last year tesla lost 1 billion in what was ostensibly its most profitable year despite a whole variety of subsidies environmental tax credits expired or gradually expiring and what can only be called creative accounting techniques such as charging warranty expenses to good will it has lost money every year of its existence even as it has piled up increasing billions in corporate debt on an aggregated basis it loses 3 000 on every car it sells some might claim this representation is simplistic it is that the figure counts costs associated with other corporate activity it does and that such losses can be turned around through an inevitable increase in sales volume or through the much promised development of autonomous driving that is until they recognize that every other auto manufacturer in the world is developing electric vehicles others are also very publicly working on autonomy and that it is thoroughly improbable that tesla will increase or even maintain its market share against companies that produce ten times the number of cars in short based on all rational measurements it is unlikely that tesla ever have earnings that justify its valuation ok so tesla might be a risky stock it might crash but has that to do with national security everything the crash which will also affect other high valuation stocks will hurt defense industry the u s dollar and add weight to the building wave of deglobalization what s the problem before we discuss national security directly let us take another look at immediate financial and political effects even if one accepts the technophile claim that tesla is a technology company not a car company although cars are over 90 percent of its business the economics of the situation does not look good as barron s recently put it it makes no sense the company s stock crash would not be a mere wall street adjustment a hard landing is a foregone conclusion in any supply and demand situation what goes up must eventually come down at a certain point investors will determine there is little prospect in more gains then they stop buying if nobody buys the stock its value falls investors bail and those who bought near the top end of the rise particularly those who leveraged their investment i e owe money will sustain severe losses if it sounds like musical chairs it s only because it is but tesla will not go down alone this is a company valued beyond companies ten times its size that earn steady year after year profits it is the most talked about most hyped and most praised most damned company in the world only google apple or microsoft can compete for media headlines and they all make an actual profit in what can understatedly termed a correction the losers particularly if they are politically connected investment banks the too big to fail crowd will call for some form of governmental offset a so shocked media a sweating congress populists who decry the dominance of wall street over main street progressives who see the market as symbolizing all the greed and exploitation of rich white males albeit not necessarily anglo saxon and protestant are going to make the current political division of america even greater than it is today there s the potential political effect what drove the stock to dizzying heights social media the celebrity of the ceo the perceived environmentalism of its product and the gradual loosening of basic accounting requirements are all viable reasons however the greater reality is that with interest rates held artificially low by the fed and national banks everywhere there is simply so much too much money available to invest large and institutional investors are willing to make wild risks in the competitive search to turn the highest profits so again what is the national security problem if one astronomically overvalued stock fails and wall street has a very bad year what does that have to do with defense bubbles and the defense industry there are four such problems first bubbles depress investment in defense companies second is the increased cost of the u s government deficit third is the effect on the u s dollar as world reserve currency finally and perhaps more importantly it brings us deeper into the growing cycle of deglobalization the effect on defense industry is under the radar but cumulative the greater the attraction of the bubble the less investors are willing to back the staid companies dependent of continuous capital reinvestment that includes practically all defense companies even those specializing in software and ai their profits are long term not short they do not provide the instant gratification that chasing a stock bubble and beating the market can provide as a defense industry ceo said at a recent conference when i need more capital to modernize plant infrastructure not only do i have to persuade my board that the modernization is needed for us to adapt to emerging technologies but also that the company can make more profit that way than by putting its free capital into the market if chasing a tesla like stock symbolic of chasing an overall market bubble provides instant gratification why invest in a capital and labor intensive industry like shipbuilding under the enduring principle that bad money drives out good too much money available for investment does not mean that the money is being invested in long term improvements in corporate infrastructure in fact it has the opposite effect because investment managers must prove they can get profits faster than their financial competitors capital investment in defense industries seems less appealing in that situation effect on the deficit the u s government manages its deficit in revenues effectively by borrowing money at low rates this it does by selling and buying its own treasury bonds the question is do interest rates remain low when a stock bubble bursts in theory they should remain low or even get lower since investors those who still have money are expected to jump out of the stocks and into bonds this would drive up the price of bonds and drive down the rate of interest that the companies issuing bonds are required to pay investors to entice them to loan them the money but what if the bursting bubble spooks investors and they prefer to sit on cash or invest in tangible assets such as gold the bursting of a big enough bubble with fear fueled by a stock market fixated media might drive investors out of bonds as well as stocks interest rates rise the deficit gets more expensive government spending in discretionary spending must be cut defense spending is viewed as discretionary particularly if china and russia mute their public reactions and restrain themselves from adventurous activities while this happens even worse might be the long range effects if investors pour into bonds interest rates go lower the federal government gets comfortable in borrowing more money and then has to face the day when interest rates have to go up what if the government decides it is obliged to bail out the losing too big to fail investors where will that money come from in any of these cases the consequences for the defense budget will inevitable be negative steady growth in the economy allows for growth in the defense budget bursting bubbles do not why should the dollar remain king global finance presents more and more options particularly as the economies of china and india potentially the world s largest and most valuable markets have increased why should global investors be so tied to wall street and u s securities if it is prone to such a bubble and the u s government is unable or unwilling to stop absurd speculation why not invest in other stock exchanges valued in other currencies particularly where other governments are more likely to step in to ensure stability in an insidious way beijing styled managed capitalism is actually more attracted to institutional investors who seek stability more than anything else if investment flees u s financial markets because of their irresponsibility and finds stability elsewhere the justification for the u s dollar remaining the world s reserve currency becomes ever weaker particularly with china and russia pushing to topple it if the dollar is no longer the world s reserve currency what guarantees are there that the u s government can still borrow money at low enough rates to fund deficits and its defense budgets if the u s dollar is no longer the world reserve currency the resulting economic waves will crash against the alliance structure we have built over eight decades hastening the slide when will the correction happen that is the great unknown but when it happens the repercussions will be felt in u s national security not just in the economy the effects cascade the ultimate result will be increasing fear for financial security throughout america and those nations most influenced by america post cold war optimism notwithstanding neither democratization nor continued globalization are inevitable contrary events particularly bad choices or good choices managed badly routinely knock perceived trends off course globalization has been more than knocked sideways by the rise of populism concerns about immigration and emigration ethic aspirations trade disputes and the resurrection of authoritarian governments its parabolic cycle has started sliding down the downslope my research indicates that there are five stages to deglobalization they consist of 1 a growing fear for economic and personal security 2 an increasing sense of disillusionment with the promises and overall value of globalization and a globalized society which might occur even while economic indicators are generally positive 3 economic downturns fueled by sporadic but increasingly frequent periods of fear and distrust of current economic conditions or practices that manifest themselves as financial bubbles 4 the rise of increasingly demagogic political leaders claiming to provide relatively quick and often radical solutions to deteriorating conditions and 5 international conflicts that eventually lead to a system changing war that ends or greatly reduces the physical and social structure on which the era of globalization was built at that point the imperative for cooperative globalization is replaced by national economic self sufficiency referred to as autarky or rival regional groupings the stages do not necessarily begin sequentially but they increase in momentum in that relative order what stage are we at in deglobalization now i would argue that the first two have already started according to mainstream thought the initial financial bubbles of the third including the recent tech bubble and housing bubble are supposedly behind us but i argue that they will reoccur my assessment is that tesla s current defiance of fiscal gravity will lead to another and sharper burst economists might call my concerns simplistic yet strategists learn that simple plans generally work while convoluted plans often fail the starting point of all analysis is to state a problem in its simplest form the coming stock bubble burst is a problem the ripple effects will act like an electric vehicle charging station for deglobalization in a democracy if you cannot afford butter you cannot afford guns this may not be a problem in authoritarian states under this contrast whose military capabilities will grow in relative terms probably not ours goodbye lingering global primacy goodbye credibility goodbye firm alliance structure i m afraid

one thing many people forget about the 2016 election is that as a candidate donald trump promised to be a different kind of republican unlike the mainstream of his party he declared he would raise taxes on the rich and wouldn t cut programs like social security medicare and medicaid that ordinary americans rely on at the same time he would invest large sums in rebuilding america s infrastructure he was lying trump s only major legislative achievement the 2017 tax cut and jobs act was absolutely standard modern republicanism huge tax cuts for corporations plus tax breaks that overwhelmingly benefited the wealthy the only unconventional aspect of the legislation was the variety of new tax scams it made possible like the benefits for investors in opportunity zones which were supposed to help poor communities but have actually enriched billionaire real estate developers trump also came very close to passing a health care reform that would have imposed savage cuts on medicaid eliminated protections for those with pre existing conditions and taken away health insurance from more than 30 million americans and there has of course been no infrastructure bill in fact the trump administration s repeated proclamations of infrastructure week have become a running joke policy wonks are still poring over the latest trump budget released monday but there was no hiding the same reverse robin hoodism as in previous budgets taking from the poor and middle class while giving to the rich in other words trump in practice as opposed to trump in pretense has turned out to be every bit as committed to trickle down economics as republicans in congress have been for decades people often say that trump has captured the gop which is true as far as things like rule of law and support for democracy are concerned but it s equally true that the gop has captured trump when it comes to domestic policy the only difference between trumpism and the proposals of paul ryan in his heyday is that the trump administration having blown up the budget deficit from less than 600 billion to more than 1 trillion has pretty much given up even claiming to care about government debt back in the day ryan called debt an existential threat a few days ago vice president mike pence told cnbc that rising deficits aren t a concern as long as they help boost the economy the economic good news of recent years not as good as trump claims but the economy has indeed been strong largely reflects the reality that after hobbling the economy with fiscal austerity under president barack obama republicans have embraced runaway deficit spending under trump but while trump is willing to run trillion dollar deficits to give giant tax breaks to corporations and the wealthy he s as determined as the rest of his party to make life harder for the less fortunate the grand plan to repeal obamacare fell just short but the administration is supporting a court challenge that could declare the affordable care act unconstitutional it is also supporting things like work requirements for food stamps and block grants that would de facto lead to major cuts in medicaid compared with current law but why has trump turned out to be such a conventional republican my sense is that he doesn t really care about policy aside from protectionism which i ll get to in a minute and he certainly doesn t feel any empathy for less fortunate americans or actually anyone so he was happy to make what amounts to an implicit deal with the republican establishment you get to implement your usual policy agenda and i get a free pass on my corruption and abuse of power the one place where trump has deviated from conservative orthodoxy is his trade war but why is he a self proclaimed tariff man the supposed reason was that he wanted to bring back u s manufacturing if that were really his motivation he failed amid a generally strong economy we re experiencing a manufacturing recession and estimates from the federal reserve suggest that trump s tariffs which have raised business costs have actually reduced manufacturing employment my guess however is that trump s trade policy has been motivated less by any substantive goals than by the desire to look like a tough guy and while establishment republicans headed off any important changes in nafta which would have been really bad for business trump basically took the existing agreement and stuck his name on it they have been willing to indulge his posturing on other less critical fronts the question now is whether trump will pay any price for betraying all his promises democrats took the house in 2018 largely because of the popular backlash against his attempt to destroy obamacare but there s a real danger that democrats will blow the election by making it a referendum on ambitious ideas like so called medicare for all that are unlikely to become reality rather than on trump s ongoing efforts to destroy programs americans

shipping capacity in 2019 and in december exceeded its target by achieving average rail loading volumes of nearly 106 000 bbls d while pipelines remain the cornerstone of cenovus s transportation strategy rail continues to be an important option to bridge the gap until expansion pipelines are completed pipelines and rail are part of the company s integrated business model designed to maximize exposure to global oil prices and mitigate pipeline congestion through a range of options to increase margins and reduce cash flow volatility production curtailment cenovus s 2019 oil sands production averaged 354 257 bbls d approximately 2 lower than in 2018 primarily due to the government of alberta s mandated curtailment program fourth quarter oil sands volumes averaged 374 132 bbls d 15 higher than the same quarter in 2018 in december 2019 the alberta government introduced the special production allowance spa program which allows crude oil producers to exceed mandated curtailment levels if those volumes are transported using incremental crude by rail capacity in the fourth quarter of 2018 volumes were impacted by cenovus s voluntary decision to restrict oil sands production rates in response to pipeline constraints and wide light heavy oil differentials cenovus anticipates higher oil production levels overall this year compared with 2019 due to the return to unconstrained production with the spa program and the ramp up of christina lake phase g over the next six to 12 months while mandatory curtailment reduced our overall production volumes in 2019 it helped keep light heavy oil price differentials from reaching the record highs we saw at the end of 2018 contributing to a significant overall benefit for the province and for our industry said pourbaix compared with 2018 our royalty payments to the province of alberta increased significantly more than doubling to 1 1 billion in 2019 sustainability cenovus continues to deliver equally strong operational financial and environmental social and governance esg performance with a continued focus on being an esg leader within its industry in january cenovus announced its four esg focus areas and set bold targets to guide its performance related to climate and greenhouse gas ghg emissions indigenous engagement land and wildlife and water stewardship the company also announced last month it plans to invest 10 million per year for at least five years to build much needed new homes in six indigenous communities near cenovus s oil sands operations in northern alberta as part of its commitment to strong esg performance cenovus is committed to rigorous governance practices and industry leading safety performance in 2019 the company s overall health and safety performance improved from the previous year due to cenovus s focus on risk management and asset integrity the company also achieved the second lowest recordable injury frequency in its history operating highlights oil sands fourth quarter oil sands production at cenovus s christina lake and foster creek oil sands projects was more than 374 000 bbls d up from 355 000 bbls d in the third quarter of 2019 mainly driven by the easing of mandatory curtailment levels full year 2019 production declined slightly from a year earlier primarily due to curtailment as a result of the spa program and increased rail shipping capacity cenovus has returned to unconstrained production and the company expects to ramp up its christina lake phase g expansion over the next six to 12 months fourth quarter oil sands operating costs were 8 06 per barrel bbl essentially flat with the same period a year earlier full year oil sands operating costs were 8 15 bbl up 7 from 7 65 bbl in 2018 primarily due to lower volumes as a result of mandated curtailment per barrel oil sands operating costs also increased as a result of higher repairs and maintenance activity and related costs due to a turnaround at christina lake during the second quarter and higher fuel costs fuel costs increased year over year due to higher natural gas prices and fuel consumption as cenovus maintained normal steam injection rates at its oil sands operations while reducing production volumes to meet mandated curtailment levels cenovus continued to achieve further reductions in its oil sands sustaining capital costs in 2019 which declined 10 to 567 million or approximately 4 00 per barrel of capacity from the previous year at christina lake the steam to oil ratio sor was 2 0 in 2019 compared with 1 9 in 2018 at foster creek the sor was unchanged at 2 8 from a year earlier full year 2019 oil sands operating margin increased more than three fold year over year to approximately 3 5 billion due to higher average realized sales prices decreased transportation and blending costs and realized risk management losses of 23 million compared with losses of approximately 1 6 billion in 2018 partially offset by lower sales volumes and higher royalties deep basin cenovus has largely completed work to optimize its deep basin operating model to reduce costs improve efficiency and maximize value the company continues to take a disciplined approach in the deep basin and is driving the business to be resilient at bottom of the cycle commodity prices of us 45 bbl wti and alberta energy company aeco pricing of 1 50 per gigajoule the deep basin generated operating margin in excess of capital investment of 64 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 up 45 from the same period a year earlier operating margin in excess of capital investment was 189 million for the full year deep basin production averaged 97 423 barrels of oil equivalent per day boe d in 2019 a 19 decrease from 2018 levels due to natural declines from lower sustaining capital investment the divestiture of cenovus s pipestone partnership in 2018 and temporary well shut ins in response to low natural gas prices total deep basin operating costs decreased 16 in 2019 compared with the previous year as a result of the pipestone divestiture lower third party processing costs due to lower throughput and cenovus focusing on optimizing operations this optimization work included well interventions repair and maintenance activities and leveraging the company s processing infrastructure to lower the cost structure despite the 2019 year over year production decrease on a full year basis operating costs increased a modest 2 to 8 79 boe from 8 58 boe in 2018 refining and marketing cenovus s wood river illinois and borger texas refineries which are co owned with the operator phillips 66 had solid operational performance in 2019 crude oil runs and refined product output in 2019 were consistent with the previous year refining and marketing operating margin for the fourth quarter was 109 million compared with 251 million in the same quarter of 2018 full year refining and marketing operating margin was 737 million compared with operating margin of 996 million in the year earlier period the year over year decrease was primarily due to reduced crude cost advantage as heavy and medium sour crude oil differentials narrowed effective january 2020 the wood river refinery was re rated to reflect higher processing capacity of 346 000 gross bbls d an increase of 13 000 bbls d from 2019 cenovus s refining operating margin is calculated on a first in first out fifo inventory accounting basis using the last in first out lifo accounting method employed by most u s refiners operating margin from refining and marketing would have been 140 million lower in 2019 compared with 118 million higher in 2018 reserves cenovus s proved and probable reserves are evaluated each year by independent qualified reserves evaluators iqres at the end of 2019 cenovus had total proved reserves of approximately 5 1 billion boe essentially unchanged from 2018 while total proved plus probable reserves decreased 2 to about 6 9 billion boe proved bitumen reserves were approximately 4 8 billion barrels while proved plus probable bitumen reserves were about 6 4 billion barrels both relatively unchanged from 2018 cenovus s reserve life index rli for proved reserves is

future development costs for 2019 cenovus s bitumen proved developed reserves f d costs were 2 49 bbl excluding changes in future development costs a decrease of more than 50 from 2018 mainly as a

barrels of oil equivalent natural gas volumes have been converted to barrels of oil equivalent boe on the basis of six thousand cubic feet mcf to one barrel bbl boe may be misleading particularly if used in isolation a conversion ratio of one bbl to six mcf is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent value equivalency at the wellhead given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil compared with natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency conversion ratio of 6 1 utilizing a conversion on a 6 1 basis is not an accurate reflection of value finding and development costs finding and development f d costs are calculated by dividing the sum of total exploration and development

dear editor economists at the american farm bureau estimated that the trans pacific partnership tpp would have provided american producers over 4 billion annually in increased sales but trump withdrew the u s from the agreement the 11 remaining countries formed a new tpp without the united states this allowed canada and australia to sell wheat and beef to japan on more favorable terms than the united states trump had lost markets for u s producers and desperately needed to negotiate an agreement with japan to fill the hole he had created however the u s japan agreement does not completely cover what the u s had gained in the original tpp and we lost short term and potentially long term markets to canada and australia during the two years we were negotiating with japan thus trump was only able to partially fill the hole he had created the north america free trade agreement s nafta biggest flaw was the lack of a requirement for mexico to raise its labor standards this error has impacted immigration and moved u s jobs to mexico over the last 25 years trump s negotiated united states mexico canada agreement usmca did not correct this error house speaker nancy pelosi and richard neal s nine member committee negotiated an increase in mexico s labor standards the success of those negotiations resulted in a dramatically improved usmca nancy s usmca moved the three countries toward fair trade with improved labor standards for mexico additional environmental commitments decreased power for multinational corporations and increased benefits for the middle class in all three countries the u s china phase 1 agreement culminates two devastating years for american producers trump had to use 28 billion in taxpayer dollars to prevent a complete wreck in the agricultural economy due to lost markets in china even with 28 billion from the u s taxpayers american agriculture is still experiencing record bankruptcies and suicides not seen since the devastating 1980s grain prices were on the low end of the price cycle when trump slapped tariffs on china and they retaliated in kind against american agriculture however we generally move from the low end of the price cycle to the high end when two major weather disasters occur and supply is reduced the drought in australia and the very wet spring in the u s would have moved us to higher prices but the increased supply due to lack of demand from china prevented that from happening trump substituted two very bad years in regards to price for what could have been two years of decent prices what did we gain from this tremendous sacrifice trump emphasizes that the phase 1 agreement states that china will buy 40 billion in ag products for each of the next two years much more than they have ever bought before china emphasizes that per the agreement they will buy to fill their market needs at global competitive prices as required by the world trade organization wto during the two years of the tariff war with the united states china has diversified their sourcing of agricultural products and has assured these sources that they will continue to buy from them it appears highly unlikely that china will buy 40 billion per year in ag products from the u s in the next two years to enforce the 40 billion per year trump would have to increase tariffs on china this would likely lead to a decline in the stock market prior to the election which trump does not want to occur thus after two devastating years we are right back where we were before tariffs with china buying to fulfill their market needs at competitive prices once again trump s rash actions dug a hole for american producers and this time trump claimed victory by simply stopping the digging of course he could start digging again if he attempts to enforce the agreement with additional tariffs sincerely ron de yong de yong was director of agriculture for montana for over nine years taught agricultural policy and economics at cal poly state university for seven years and operated a family farm in kalispell for over 30 years

representatives elected by district approved a 1 9 billion budget allocated across affordable housing social services public health parks and greenways and charlotte mecklenburg schools among other initiatives many of those budget priorities seem under funded according to more than 3 000 residents who responded to a recent mecklenburg county budget survey for fiscal year 2021 commissioners had adopted their budget representing a 160 million increase from the previous fiscal year following the 2019 county property tax hike the eight at large candidates are advertisement advertisement scarborough and stevenson did not respond to a charlotte observer survey for this story affordable housing crisis there s an estimated deficit of 34 000 affordable housing units in the charlotte area while all candidates recognize the urgent need to aid lower income residents they disagree on possible solutions namely a combination of physical housing stock comprehensive social services and shared resources with the city mckinnon said mecklenburg will not build its way out of this crisis especially with steep population growth ray mckinnon one option mckinnon suggested is to assuage the costs developers encounter within the affordable housing market advertisement advertisement where we can offer relief or incentives to effectively reduce property taxes on developers who are building affordable units specifically for those at or below thirty percent of the area median income must be considered mckinnon wrote in response to the survey but if there are tax relief incentives we must have a claw back if those affordable units aren t kept affordable for at least a decade cotham said the county must do a better job of identifying root causes and then proactively preventing problems such as financial literacy mental well being and eviction policies rental subsidies are so helpful to neighbors who have worked to get into safe housing cotham wrote data shows that if a person or family is in stable housing the result is less need for services and a higher standard of living and more success for their children leigh altman but tera long said she believes that rental subsidies represent a temporary solution to a long term problem advertisement advertisement the county commissioners should carefully analyze how other successful places including large cities are addressing it

scher alongside other candidates advocated for increased collaboration with city and nonprofit partners to combat the affordable housing crisis leigh altman a political newcomer who substantially outraised her opponents said commissioners should focus on increasing residents household wealth and purchasing power the county should significantly scale up efforts to train and connect adults who

candidates are divided over mecklenburg s responsibility to support the arts after the failed quarter cent sales tax last november advertisement advertisement some candidates say taxpayers shouldn t bear the burden for the arts arguing that a number of county services are also under financial strain given the county s responsibility for critical safety net social services cms funding our long neglected parks as well as other essential priorities solving the long term financial plan for our arts community may require a deeper commitment from both the business community and the city altman wrote but other challengers counter that without a vibrant arts and cultural scene and the county s backing residents will suffer from associated benefits including economic growth cotham is a proponent of giving funds to specific arts groups a framework that would give the county better oversight and control of taxpayer dollars she said advertisement advertisement adding small grants for smaller groups would benefit them so much cotham wrote there are many ways we could make a difference without spending 20m a year as the tax would have done mecklenburg county commissioner pat cotham mckinnon has a similar philosophy that stops short of fully funding local arts organizations the county and other municipalities should offer funds to help private non profits meet any funding gaps mckinnon said the county must also ensure that smaller organizations which are local artist led have access to public funds long said she does not favor raising taxes on our hard working citizens but long said she would support creating county funded meeting spaces tera long such spaces could provide a community gathering place where local artists could promote and sell their work long wrote in her survey response advertisement advertisement scher said a strong arts and parks community is critical for making the charlotte region sustainable and livable he said that a future sales tax referendum must be transparent to voters we need to go back to the voters of mecklenburg and this time outline exactly where the money will be spent scher wrote it is imperative we rebuild the public

read an explanation to his or her answer what should be the role of the county which allocates 22 million for affordable housing in closing the affordable housing gap and promoting other initiatives such as rental subsidies lloyd scher advertisement advertisement we need to work closely with the city of charlotte and create safe and affordable housing there are nonprofit organizations like crisis assistance ministry that can help by providing the costs of deposits and the first and second months rent to help individuals obtain housing i am familiar with the old section 8 program and if it is still available we should work with the federal government to provide help with our citizens i am not sure if those programs are still available with the federal government if not we should be looking into creating a similar program in mecklenburg patricia since being elected in 2012 i realize that issues are more complicated than they seem i have long advocated for the county to become more involved with housing as the current situation is dire and i do not believe the city can do it alone we must help often we react to problems but i think we need to also try to prevent problems our health department through the village heartbeat program is doing a great job preventing chronic health problems we need a comparable program for housing we have a dire need in housing our neighbors who earn 30 of the area medium income ami we have 27k in that category in a perfect world it might make sense to build housing with different financial levels but we have an enormous amount of people at the lowest level and we are not responding aggressively enough i think we can do many things first we can donate funds to help the city with their funding we have done that and we need to continue but we also need to identify root causes and increase our efforts to prevent evictions and other serious matters leading to homelessness we need to talk more to the state to get them to change policies on evictions and leasing that unfairly hurt low income residents we need more classes on budgeting financial literacy and caring for a home apartment rental subsidies are so helpful to neighbors who have worked to get into safe housing data shows that if a person or family is in stable housing the result is less need for services and a higher standard of living and more success for their children too many of our people are so stressed about housing and lack thereof we have to attack this problem from many different angles social workers also need to be able to identify mental health issues that also add to the securing of stable housing finally we should not blame developers it happens too often they are in business to make money they are not social workers but many want to help we need to help them make the numbers work by assigning them special inspectors who show up quickly to save them funding on the project many faith communities want to help in different ways and we need someone to engage them for better results this is an all hand on deck project we can do it george dunlap it is the responsibility of the county commission to support families providing all of the supportive services we provide won t mean much if the families are not in a stable environment affordable housing is a community problem and one way we can help improve the condition of our community is by helping to close the affordable housing gap to include providing rental subsidies setting an affordable tax rate offering tax breaks to seniors along with other initiatives that support homelessness cade lee the mecklenburg board of county commissioners bocc must be proactive in affordable housing and economic mobility opportunities rather than being reactive once residents are homeless we must strengthen our economic mobility programs and job opportunities guarantee legitimately affordable housing options and invest in community development to end the cycle of homelessness and economic disparities we must continue the expansion of rental subsidies and affordable housing vouchers while taking a comprehensive approach to work with cms and community partners to end youth homelessness provide adequate funding to end school lunch debt and let families send their kids to school without obstacles and ensure proper funding and opportunities for our elderly residents such as expansion of aging in place to reach veterans families single parents and a broader age range we cannot look at affordable housing without talking about economic mobility as residents do not become homeless or impoverished spontaneously the bocc must work with the community and private partners to guarantee affordable housing options for residents earning under 30 ami an end to predatory real estate and developer behaviors that lead to gentrification and equitable economic development and commercial development across mecklenburg to ensure job and financial security to all residents when elected i will form partnerships with businesses and developers dedicated to growing communities not those growing their bank accounts to the detriment of low income communities we must invest in environmentally sustainable housing with companies like icast which reduces our carbon footprint the environmental impact of multi family housing and provides green jobs by investing in solar green housing and multi family housing we reduce economic mobility gaps provide for traditionally underserved communities and we show our commitment to people and the planet over profits leigh altman the lack of affordable housing is one of voters top priorities across the county although affordable housing historically has been in the wheelhouse of the city this current county commission has made new investments in shelters home repair programs and the establishment of a rental subsidy program i strongly support this and i believe the county should use every opportunity to increase affordable housing stock that being said the county remains responsible for public health mental health welfare education and the environment these are core functions for which the county is chiefly responsible at the local level and we have some severe gaps in funding for these critical priorities in the housing crisis in addition to working to increase affordable housing units i think it is also important to focus on ways to increase the household wealth of our residents and their purchasing power the county should significantly scale up efforts to train and connect adults who are ready to work to good paying jobs in tech skilled trades and healthcare among other hiring industries with labor shortages in our region ray shawn mckinnon the reality is that we will not build our way out of this crisis while our population has grown by 22 from 2007 2017 according to a study by uncc new units only increased by 14 we aren t building even as fast as our population growth we are growing faster than we can even build units this doesn t even take into account the other factors which contribute to the housing crisis namely wages in the purview of the commission it is important to constantly consider the trickle down costs of fees associated with development and permitting where we can offer relief or incentives to effectively reduce property taxes on developers who are building affordable units specifically for those at or below 30 of the area median income must be considered but if there are tax relief incentives we must have a claw back if those affordable units aren t kept affordable for at least a decade tera crumbley the county should assume a leadership role and form an intergovernmental committee including bocc the city council and legislators grassroots organizers and businesses should be given a seat at the table they need to discuss the problems the people face holistically consider all pooled resources available discuss all working models and analyze their success lack of quality public transportation for example makes it more difficult for many to access affordable housing carefully analyze how other successful places including large cities are addressing it and develop a master plan of execution what s clear is that the market alone won t solve this growing problem and local government must incentivize the building of low cost housing on the other hand i am convinced that rental subsidies represent a temporary solution to a long term problem one creative idea that has been raised to specifically address homelessness is to convert vacant facilities into sustainable long term housing i am also impressed with the model that the men s shelter utilizes men live at the shelter for a while and then can move into an apartment style building the men are required to pay in 30 of their income concerned people in our community have found some good working solutions in our city but it just is not enough finally we need to incentivize teachers and develop and provide world class education broadly so we can build strong middle class instead of just leaving people behind and scrambling to survive in light of recent developments at charlotte mecklenburg schools including a change in top leadership and scrutiny over a faulty security system what responsibility do commissioners have in overseeing how county taxpayer money is used within the school district lloyd scher when i was a county commissioner i was able to create an earmark to provide teachers with increase in their summer supplement i would like to study if we can do something similar to make sure the money goes to budget request by the school board i would like to review each line item of the school board s budget request like we do the county budget i would like to arrange quarterly meetings reviewing how the money given by the county is being properly spent we can no longer just give money to the school board as a blank check without making sure it is being spent correctly it is like the bond money we have given them in the past and it is not used to build the schools which was requested and then we learned the bond money was shifted to another project we have a fiduciary responsibility to the public to make sure the money is being spent wisely and for the purpose it was intended patricia since 2012 i have heard commissioners complain that the state does not give us authority to oversee where our cms funding is applied and whether it was diverted from their budget requests it would help build trust if we knew exactly how the funds of the people are used i think it is unfortunate that cms must do their budget before they know what funds they will receive from the state i wish the county and cms would do our budgets like the state every two years with minor tweaks in the other year then we would be on the same page with funding it would also result in less finger pointing and more collaborative solutions george dunlap there have been changes in both the leadership of the school system and leadership on the school board both boards are working together to improve the relationship between the two boards as well as improve accountability the county commission has no direct supervision of the school board which is directly accountable to the citizens just as the county commission is we are a funder of the school system therefore it is in the best interest of both boards to have a good working relationship so that collectively we can address the educational concerns of our community cade lee for too long mecklenburg residents have tolerated a lack of accountability and lack of transparency in regards to the county budget including the largest recipient of county funds charlotte mecklenburg schools cms the mecklenburg county commissioners can no longer sign over a 690 9 million check to cms without discretion oversight and proper public input the board of county commissioners bocc must engage in a transparent and accountable budget process unlike what was done in 2019 for the fy 2020 budget the district 3 incumbent and chairman broke the nc open meetings law by cutting the public out of the process and facilitating secretive emails and closed door meetings in regards to the cms budget commissioners must implement a series of requirements for cms and the budget requests prior to signing off on a multimillion dollar budget the bocc must be proactive in protecting our children teachers and staff of all charlotte mecklenburg schools we must invest in easy to use door barricade mechanisms for every classroom door as detoledo high school in west hills ca did we must strengthen partnerships with cmpd the sheriff s department and school administrators to guarantee consistent school security plans as district 3 county commissioner i will pursue partnerships with reproductive healthcare facilities to implement sexual health and well being centers in cms schools as l a county schools have done to better facilitate mental and reproductive healthcare access programs like these provide contraceptives std screenings and sexual health education to students who might not normally have access as a county commission we must guarantee increased teacher pay and teacher supplements funding support and resources for our existing public schools equity accessibility and parent district cooperation for all students with special needs or disabilities and equitable course offerings support systems and opportunities for every student no matter their zip code i know far too many parents of disabled children who have not had the support they deserve from cms all of the problems with equity accountability and transparency with cms begin with the check the bocc writes during each budget process i refuse to sign off on a budget for cms without a detailed plan provided to the bocc and the public which explains budget priorities equity plans school safety improvements and resource allocations if cms wants the next bocc to sign off on a budget of more than 690 9 million residents must know the budget priorities of cms and must be provided with an end of year report of where the money actually went leigh altman all of our governmental bodies must be transparent and accountable to our residents for policy decisions and taxpayer expenditures i have high hopes that the new superintendent will correct the mistakes of his predecessor and we need to give him a chance to do that equally important residents need a school board city council and county commission operating in close collaboration with interlocking services a child cannot succeed if she does not have access to high quality education in our county schools a school board function but even if she has a good school her trajectory will be curtailed if her parent or guardian cannot access employment due to lack of housing or a decent transportation system to get to work a city function if her family has no access to healthcare mental health services parks recreation and a range of supportive services for adults children and at risk populations her caregiver may not be able to maintain the job or keep the house which keeps her in her school a county function in short the three legs of local government the school board the city and the county must work closely and collaboratively for our residents to prosper ray shawn mckinnon the county commissioners have a responsibility to ensure that every dollar is spent is done so properly it is vital that the commissioners and the members of the school board meet regularly and mutually respect the jobs of the other just as commissioners are elected by the citizens of mecklenburg county the members of the school board are too the county commissioners also allocate a considerable amount of money to the sheriff and the da folks who are also directly elected by citizens of mecklenburg county while i think we must faithfully and diligently ensure that the public s funds are properly spent i am reluctant to get in the position of dictating to any colleague who is also duly elected by the citizens how to govern the bodies over which the citizens have given them charge in saying all of these things however it is the responsibility of the commission to ensure that they ensure that tax payer dollars are spent well that doesn t however mean they then become the policymakers and governing board over those boards tera crumbley it is my understanding that many commissioners are frustrated that they direct so much money to cms but see little progress if commissioners want to hold the boe accountable they must be willing to use their position to provide oversight apply public pressure as needed and even hold town hall meetings they must be forthright in making all the information public and work to create greater awareness then the public can begin to hold them accountable public pressure from the bocc citizens and media are powerful tools the boe needs to do a better job showing how they are spending tax dollars it may be that current policy does not require sufficient disclosure and could require a rewrite closer oversight of all county programs is an area where we could improve with the park system in charlotte mecklenburg ranked no 96 out 100 cities by the trust for public land how can commissioners improve and prioritize accessibility to parks for all residents lloyd scher in 1992 the mecklenburg county commissioners worked with the city to merge the charlotte and mecklenburg county police department the county took over the city parks and we spent millions repairing and updating city parks the city took funds from the park recreation department for years to help balance the city budget it appears the county is following in their footsteps by cutting funds to our mecklenburg county parks department parks are a very important part of our community it helps provide and a livable part of our community we need to make sure we stop cutting funds to our parks department to provide recreation and help with a sustainable community patricia that same report said we are second nationally in park size with nashville being first we have increased funding for parks and have two 110 000 square foot recreation centers being built we have expanded greenways and updated park facilities including swimming pools gold courses and splash pads for adults and children we have also won national awards we are the largest county but the state has not built any state parks here but other counties near raleigh have benefitted greatly from the state spending on parks i have never had any resident talk to me about needing to walk to a park to make their life better our community is more diverse and residents like different things i think there is more to the story when it comes to this ranking of 96 i am proud of our park and rec department and our park advisory board another partnership partners for parks also does amazing work the state park and recreation association honored me and another former commissioner with an award for our advocacy for greenways in 2018 george dunlap when you consider that there are more than 3 500 counties across the united states and that only 100 counties chose to participate when you understand that many of the amenities afforded to mecklenburg county residents are not measured in the rankings when you consider that just a few years ago mecklenburg county parks were the best in the nation i am less concerned about what the trust for public land says than i am about what the citizens of mecklenburg county say can we do more for our residence yes and we will continue to improve our recreational services along with our parks and greenways we are in the mist of our 10 year capital planning process which will be the road map to getting us to where we need to be and making sure that all residence have access to park and recreational amenities cade lee it is vital to understand that there is no easy solution to the environmental and climate crises facing mecklenburg we are more than 200 miles behind our greenway mileage goal and we ve been behind for decades greenway and park development is geographically inequitable and centered around communities who have the privilege to advocate for the expansions the first step for commissioners to improve and prioritize accessibility to parks and greenways for all residents is to begin large scale land acquisition for greenway and parkland the idealistic goal of having every mecklenburg resident within a few minutes walk to a greenway or park is no longer attainable because we have tolerated a group of leaders who have not prioritized equity access and an end to local environmental degradation as the next district 3 county commissioner i am dedicated to emphasizing access to neighborhood parks and greenways that reach areas of mecklenburg not only must we prioritize access to parks and greenways and begin large scale land acquisition but we must guarantee equitable access to these parks and our greenway system keep our environment clean and free of pollution and provide adequate funding for the upkeep and restoration of our existing parks and greenways our air quality and environmental pollution are worsening every day and asthma rates are skyrocketing in children because of our failures to protect our environment as a county commission we must address disparate health issues impacting at risk populations such as communities of color children and pregnant women the elderly disabled individuals and low income communities by prioritizing at risk communities most affected by the climate crisis we make progress at closing socioeconomic disparities across the county we must pass a climate emergency ordinance for mecklenburg county to develop a path to sustainability environmental restoration and access to green space for every resident no matter their zip code leigh altman i m the mother of three school age kids and i believe it is disgraceful how we have failed to ensure a clean and green future for our children parks demand a serious commitment from the county including a focus on environmental equity for all our neighborhoods parks are critical for air quality rejuvenation and healthy bodies equally we must protect and expand green spaces within our increasingly densely urbanized county they are a critical part of a larger green commitment to walkability and connectivity via greenways sidewalks and pathways which ensures all our residents can safely access public transportation ray shawn mckinnon as is true in many instances so much can happen when we first listen we have an incredibly able and hard working board of parks commissioners we must utilize those incredible volunteers and experts in this field and take our leads from them these citizens some of whom i have had informative and illuminating conversations have incredible recommendations which should be heard and heeded that commissions is reported to have suggested that we have over 1b of unmet needs to get our parks to par but specifically from conversations that i have had with parks commissioners we need focus on these four areas land acquisition removal of barriers to access capital improvements and staffing growth obviously there is a need to balance all of the pressing needs of the county and find ways to meet these ends while under the constraints of limited revenue tera crumbley there are at least two places we may find additional funds for public parks first we need to reexamine the issue of debt financing and service fees there is real money to be found there secondly as the daughter of a man who spent a lifetime of service at the chamber of commerce nobody recognizes the importance of attracting business to charlotte more than i that being said i also understand that we need to look at those deals closely as investments through the lens of the job creation and effective economic development some of the deals cost too much and help too few charloteans as one of the fastest growing cities in the country we can be more discerning last year voters rejected a quarter cent sales tax that would have helped pay for local arts and parks what do you think the county should do if anything to preserve and support local arts organizations lloyd scher we need to go back to the voters of mecklenburg and this time outline exactly where the money will be spent the public wants details how the bond money will be spent too many times they have been burned by funds being mover from one area to another it is imperative we rebuild the public trust to help get bonds past for the betterment of the county as stated in the section on parks we need both parks and a strong arts community to help attract businesses and at the same time provide parks and an arts development to make charlotte mecklenburg an attraction to new businesses and help with create a sustainable and livable community for people to enjoy as a commissioner i will encourage to go back to the voters for the park and arts bond to make sure the citizens understand how and where the money will be spent patricia adding small grants for smaller groups would benefit them so much there are many ways we could make a difference without spending 20 million a year as the tax would have done i think we should increase our funding but with some strings attached on specific programs that reflect our priorities many schools resist school trips uptown because of the end of grade testing could we have summer programs for children and teenagers maybe an expansion of studio 345 that include snacks lunch the sheriff has started some programs in the detention center maybe we could supplement their programs which would be therapeutic programs for veterans and seniors could possibly be developed to be more inclusive i attended senior culture block with music from the 50s and 60s and seniors exercised to it from chairs i would like to see more of that with the remodeling of spirit square many small groups will be in need of space maybe we could find somewhere outside of uptown for them to continue to thrive at a minimal cost adding small grants for smaller groups would benefit them so much there are many ways we could make a difference without spending 20 million a year as the tax would have done george dunlap the arts are a critical piece to the fabric of our community the arts are not just for the rich as some would have you believe millions of dollars in economic development are generated in this community as a result of the arts the number of jobs created and other services are provided provided because of the arts the educational benefits provided to the community and the upward mobility it provides to some who are less fortunate warrants additional financial support from the county cade lee first it is important to point out that the quarter cent sales tax referendum was a misleading campaign that sought to provide millions of dollars to a private arts organization and an incomplete plan for parks and education i along with many other members in the community stood strongly against the quarter cent sales tax referendum due to the huge inequities and misrepresentations within the for campaign the funding for education if equally dispersed across schools could never have covered all of the programs the campaign said it could the land supposedly earmarked for greenways and parks was not guaranteed to be used for land acquisition keeping us far behind our mileage goal the most troubling part was that a restructured private arts organization would be getting 22 million per year with all of that said i am an advocate for public funding of the arts however i want private inequitable organizations out of the process we need an independent committee through mecklenburg county to approve grants and partnerships with local groups not simply funding private groups our investments need to be at the grassroots community public level an example of public funding of the arts is when austin texas city councilors voted to use the hotel tax for arts and cultural funding rather than putting the funding burden on everyday citizens as aforementioned i am a strong advocate for local arts groups and i am aware of the contribution they add to the growing and diverse culture of mecklenburg however we must pursue partnerships public committees and public funding through the annual budget process to allocate funding to the arts using our last sales tax increase for a private arts organization is not a top priority of mecklenburg residents while we must publicly fund the arts and culture programs we must prioritize access to truly affordable housing options job opportunities education and health and human services including gun violence and domestic violence prevention leigh altman we need to have a serious community conversation on how to fund the arts a term which encompasses not only well known programs found in uptown but in music classes across our county s schools as well as in vital programming for adults of all ages throughout mecklenburg this discussion must reflect how important the arts are to the mental and emotional well being of our residents and also to our economic growth indeed our ability to attract businesses and to present charlotte as a world class city is closely tied to our having a robust flourishing and diverse arts scene for this reason i support an increase in the county s budget to nurture arts programs across our county however given the county s responsibility for critical safety net social services cms funding our long neglected parks as well as other essential priorities solving the long term financial plan for our arts community may require a deeper commitment from both the business community and the city which has a revenue stream of tourism dollars at its disposal ray shawn mckinnon i vocally opposed the proposed sales tax increase not because i don t appreciate and acknowledge the benefits of arts and parks but because of the unanswered questions and the reality that an increase at that time would have limited our ability to utilize that tool in the future for any other need including transportation but we do have a role to play in preserving and supporting local arts organizations although i am not in favor of fully funding private non profits the county and other municipalities should offer funds to help private non profits meet any funding gaps the county must also ensure that smaller organizations which are local artist led have access to public funds also tera crumbley fully funding schools means a prominent place for the arts in our classrooms i also favor the creation of county funded meeting spaces such spaces could provide a community gathering place where local artists could promote and sell their work i do not favor of raising taxes on our hard working citizens candidate info lloyd scher email addressls712

province corby ships products to a bonded warehouse that is managed by a government appointed service provider who is responsible for warehousing and distribution into the retail channel other provinces have aspects of both government controlled and private retailing including british columbia saskatchewan and quebec corby s shipment patterns to the lbs will not always exactly match short term consumer purchase patterns however given the importance of monitoring consumer consumption trends over the long term the company stays abreast of consumer purchase patterns in canada through its member affiliation with the association of canadian distillers acd which tabulates and disseminates consumer purchase information it receives from the lbs to its industry members corby refers to this data throughout this md a as retail sales which are measured in volume measured in nine litre case equivalents current retail value information as discussed in this md a is based on available pricing information as provided by the acd and the lbs in addition to a focus on efforts to open new international markets corby s international business is concentrated in the united states us and uk and the company has a different route to market for each for the us market corby manufactures its products in canada and ships to third party us distributors the market in the us operates a three tier distribution system which often requires a much longer and larger inventory pipeline than in other markets resulting in a disconnect between quarterly shipment performance as reported in the financial statements and the true underlying performance of the brands at retail level during the same quarter for the other international markets corby products are distributed by pr affiliates or third parties more information is provided in the related party transactions section of this md a corby s operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations sales are typically strong in the first and second quarters while third quarter sales usually decline after the end of the retail holiday season fourth quarter sales typically increase again with the onset of warmer weather as consumers tend to increase their purchasing levels during the summer season in addition retail sales comparisons can be affected by timing of key holidays and lb reporting calendars strategies and outlook corby s business strategies are designed to maximize sustainable long term value growth and deliver enhanced margin quality and profit while continuing to produce strong and consistent cash flows from operating activities management believes its focused brand prioritization strategy will permit corby to capture market share in the segments and markets that are expected to deliver the most long term value growth brand prioritization requires a consumer insight and data driven assessment of each brand s potential this facilitates resource allocation of corby s marketing and sales efforts ensuring

year comparative information under the modified retrospective approach comparative information continues to be reported under ias 17 and related interpretations in applying ifrs 16 for the first time

consequences of dividends the amendments are to be applied retrospectively for fiscal years beginning on or after january 1 2019 for corby this standard became effective july 1 2019 the new amendment did not have a significant impact on the company s interim condensed consolidated financial statements internal controls over financial reporting the company maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance that all material information relating to the company is gathered and reported to senior management on a timely basis so that appropriate decisions can be made regarding public disclosure in addition the ceo and cfo have designed or caused to be designed under their supervision internal controls over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with ifrs internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be designed effectively can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial reporting and financial statement preparation management with the participation of the ceo and cfo has evaluated the effectiveness of the company s internal controls over financial reporting as at december 31 2019 and has concluded that internal control over financial reporting is designed and operating effectively to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with ifrs management s assessment was based on the framework established in internal control integrated framework 2013 published by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission there were no changes in internal controls over financial reporting during the company s most recent interim period that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company s internal controls over financial reporting risks risk management the company is exposed to a number of risks in the normal course of its business that have the potential to affect its operating and financial performance industry and regulatory the beverage alcohol industry in canada is subject to government policy extensive regulatory requirements and significant rates of taxation at both the federal and provincial levels as a result changes in the government policy regulatory and or taxation environments within the beverage alcohol industry may affect corby s business operations causing changes in market dynamics or changes in consumer consumption patterns in addition the company s provincial lb customers have the ability to mandate changes that can lead to increased costs as well as other factors that may impact financial results additionally as the company becomes more reliant on international product sales in the us uk and other countries exposure to changes in the laws and regulations including on matters such as regulatory requirements import duties and taxation in those countries could also adversely affect the operations financial performance or reputation of the company the company continuously monitors the potential risk associated with any proposed changes to its government policy regulatory and taxation environments and as an industry leader actively participates in trade association discussions relating to new developments consumer consumption patterns beverage alcohol companies are susceptible to risks relating to changes in consumer consumption patterns consumer consumption patterns are affected by many external influences not the least of which is economic outlook and overall consumer confidence in the stability of the economy as a whole additionally the legalization of recreational cannabis in canada could have the potential to impact consumer consumption patterns with respect to beverage alcohol products corby offers a diverse portfolio of products across all major spirits categories and at various price points corby continues to identify and offer new innovations in order to address consumer desires distribution supply chain interruption the company is susceptible to risks relating to distributor and supply chain interruptions distribution in canada is largely accomplished through the government owned provincial lbs and therefore an interruption e g a labour strike for any length of time or a change in business model may have a significant impact on the company s ability to sell its products in a particular province and or market international sales are subject to the variations in distribution systems within each country where the products are sold supply chain interruptions including a manufacturing or inventory disruption could impact product quality and availability the company adheres to a comprehensive suite of quality programmes and proactively manages production and supply chains to mitigate any potential risk to consumer safety or corby s reputation and profitability inherent to producing maturing products there is a potential for shortages or surpluses in future years if demand and supply are materially different from long term forecasts additionally the loss through contamination fire or other natural disaster of the stock of maturing products may result in significant reduction in supply and as a result corby may not be able to meet customer demands the company monitors category trends and regularly reviews maturing inventory levels environmental compliance environmental liabilities may potentially arise when companies are in the business of manufacturing products and thus required to handle potentially hazardous materials as corby largely outsources its production including all of its storage and handling of maturing alcohol the risk of environmental liabilities is considered minimal corby currently has no significant recorded or unrecorded environmental liabilities industry consolidation in recent years the global beverage alcohol industry has continued to experience consolidation industry consolidation can have varying degrees of impact and in some cases may even create exceptional opportunities either way management believes that the company is well positioned to deal with this or other changes to the competitive landscape in canada and other markets in which it carries on business corby s ability to properly complete acquisitions and subsequently integrate them may affect its results corby monitors growth opportunities that may present themselves including by way of acquisitions while we believe that an acquisition may create the opportunity to realize certain benefits achieving these benefits will depend in part on successfully consolidating functions and integrating operations procedures and personnel in an efficient manner as well as our ability to realize any anticipated growth opportunities or costs savings from combining the target s assets and operations with our existing brands and operations integration efforts following any acquisition may require the dedication of substantial management effort time and resources which may divert management s focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and from operational matters during this process in addition corby may be required to assume greater than expected liabilities due to liabilities that are undisclosed at the time of completion of an acquisition a failure to realize in whole or in part the anticipated benefits of an acquisition may have a negative impact on the results or financial position of corby competition the canadian and international beverage alcohol industry is extremely competitive competitors may take actions to establish and sustain a competitive advantage through advertising and promotion and pricing strategies in an effort to maintain market share which may negatively affect our sales revenues and profitability corby constantly monitors the market and adjusts its own advertising promotion and pricing strategies as appropriate competitors may also affect corby s ability to attract and retain high quality employees the company s long heritage attests to corby s strong foundation and successful execution of its strategies its role as a leading canadian beverage alcohol company helps facilitate recruitment efforts credit risk credit risk arises from deposits in cash management pools held with pr via corby s participation in the mirror netting service agreement as previously described in the related party transactions section of this md a as well as credit exposure to customers including outstanding accounts receivable the maximum exposure to credit risk is equal to the carrying value of the company s financial assets the objective of managing counterparty credit risk is to prevent losses in financial assets the company assesses the credit quality of its counterparties taking into account their financial position past experience and other factors as the large majority of corby s accounts receivable balances are collectible from government controlled lbs management believes the company s credit risk relating to accounts receivable is at an acceptably low level exposure to interest rate fluctuations the company does not have any short or long term debt facilities interest rate risk exists as corby earns market rates of interest on its deposits in cash management pools an active risk management programme does not exist as management believes that changes in interest rates would not have a material impact on corby s financial position over the long term exposure to commodity price fluctuations commodity risk exists as the manufacture of corby s products requires the procurement of several known commodities such as grains sugar and natural gas the company strives to partially mitigate this risk through the use of longer term procurement contracts where possible in addition subject to competitive conditions the company may pass on commodity price changes to consumers through pricing over the long term foreign currency exchange risk the company has exposure to foreign currency risk as it conducts business in multiple foreign currencies however its exposure is primarily limited to the us dollar usd and uk pound sterling gbp corby does not utilize derivative instruments to manage this risk subject to competitive conditions changes in foreign currency rates may be passed on to consumers through pricing over the long term usd exposure the company s demand for usd has traditionally outpaced its supply due to usd sourcing of production inputs and advertising promotion expenses exceeding that of the company s usd sales therefore decreases in the value of the canadian dollar cad relative to the usd will have an unfavourable impact on the company s earnings gbp exposure the company s exposure to fluctuations in the value of the gbp relative to the cad was reduced as both sales and cost of production are denominated in gbp while corby s exposure has been minimized increases in the value of the cad relative to the gbp will have an unfavourable impact on the company s earnings third party service providers hwsl which corby manages on behalf of pr provides more than 90 of the company s production requirements among other services including administration and information technology however the company is reliant upon certain third party service providers in respect of certain of its operations it is possible that negative events affecting these third party service providers could in turn negatively impact the company while the company has no direct control over how such third parties are managed it has entered into contractual arrangements to formalize these relationships in order to minimize operating risks the company actively monitors and manages its relationships with its third party service providers renewal of distribution agreements the 2006 agreements and the agreement regarding absolut vodka both described in the related party transactions section of this md a expire on september 29 2021 commissions from the distribution agreements represent approximately 18 of corby s revenue the parties continue to operate under these agreements as well as under the production and administrative services agreements which run until 2026 and are required to negotiate in good faith regarding renewal during the period september 29 2020 to march 29 2021 brand reputation and trademark protection the company promotes nationally branded non proprietary products as well as proprietary products damage to the reputation of any of these brands or to the reputation of any supplier or manufacturer of these brands could negatively impact consumer opinion of the company or the related products which could have an adverse impact on the financial performance of the company the company strives to mitigate such risks by selecting only those products from suppliers that strategically complement corby s existing brand portfolio and by actively monitoring brand advertising and promotion activities additionally although the company registers trademarks as applicable it cannot be certain that trademark registrations will be issued with respect to all the company s applications also while corby constantly watches for and responds to competitive threats as necessary the company cannot predict challenges to or prevent a competitor from challenging the validity of any existing or future trademark issued or licensed to corby information technology and cyber security the company uses technology supplied by third parties both related and non related to support operations and invests in information technology to improve route to market reporting analysis and marketing initiatives issues with availability reliability and security of systems and technology could adversely impact the company s ability to compete resulting in corruption or loss of data regulatory related issues litigation or brand reputation damage with the fast paced changing nature of the technology environment including digital marketing the company works with these third parties to maintain policies processes and procedures to help secure and protect these information systems as well as consumer corporate and employee data valuation of goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets account for a significant amount of the company s total assets goodwill and intangible assets are subject to impairment tests that involve the determination of fair value inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates including but not limited to projected future sales earnings and capital investment discount rates and terminal growth rates these judgments and estimates may change in the future due to uncertain competitive market and general economic conditions or as the company makes changes in its business strategies certain of the aforementioned factors affecting the determination of fair value may be impacted and as a result the company s financial results may be adversely affected the following table summarizes corby s goodwill and intangible assets and details the amounts associated with each brand or basket of brands and market as at december 31 2019 carrying values as at december 31 2019 associated brand associated market goodwill

canada 1 9 1 9 8 7 27 6 36 3 1 the international business for lamb s rum is primarily focused in the uk however the trademarks and licences purchased relate to all international markets outside of canada as corby previously owned the canadian rights 2 the ungava brands include trademarks related to ungava premium canadian gin chic choc spiced rum and cabot trail maple based liqueurs therefore economic factors such as consumer consumption patterns specific to these brands and markets are primary drivers of the risk associated with their respective goodwill and intangible assets valuations employee future benefits the company has certain obligations under its registered and non registered defined benefit pension plans and other post retirement benefit plan there is no assurance that the company s benefit plans will be able to earn the assumed rate of return new regulations and market driven changes may result in changes in the discount rates and other variables which would result in the company being required to make contributions in the future that differ significantly from estimates an extended period of depressed capital markets and low interest rates could require the company to make contributions to these plans in excess of those currently contemplated which in turn could have an adverse impact on the financial performance of the company somewhat mitigating the impact of a potential market decline is the fact that the company monitors its pension plan assets closely and follows strict guidelines to ensure that pension fund investment portfolios are diversified in line

interim condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost model except for certain categories of assets and liabilities which are measured in accordance with other methods provided for by ifrs as described in the most recent annual consolidated financial statements except for recently adopted policies and methods described below historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for assets use of estimates and judgements the preparation of these interim condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with ifrs requires management to make certain judgements estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the interim condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period judgement is commonly used in determining whether a balance or transaction should be recognized in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements and estimates and assumptions are more commonly used in determining the measurement of recognized transactions and balances however judgement and estimates are often interrelated estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant estimates are made on the assumption the company will continue as a going concern and are based on information available at the time of preparation estimates may be revised where the circumstance on which they were based changes or where new information becomes available future outcomes can differ from these estimates estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected management s most critical estimates in determining the value of assets and liabilities and the most critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have a significant risk of causing material adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next year have been described in note 2 of the company s most recent annual consolidated financial statements except for the impact of the adoption of the new and revised standards and interpretations described below seasonality the interim condensed consolidated financial statements should not be taken as indicative of the performance to be expected for the full fiscal year due to the seasonal nature of the spirits business corby s operations are typically subject to seasonal fluctuations in that the retail holiday season generally results in an increase in consumer purchases over the course of october november and december further the summer months traditionally result in higher consumer purchases of spirits as compared to the winter and spring months as a result the company s first and second quarter of each fiscal year tend to reflect the impact of seasonal fluctuations in that more shipments are typically made during those quarters ii adoption of new and revised standards and interpretations recent accounting pronouncements a number of new standards amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for the financial period ended december 31 2019 and accordingly have been applied in preparing these interim condensed consolidated financial statements a leases in january 2016 the iasb issued a new standard ifrs 16 leases ifrs 16 which replaced ias 17 leases ias 17 ifrs 16 specifies how an entity will recognize measure present and disclose leases the standard provides a single lessee accounting model requiring lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying asset has a low value the standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after january 1 2019 and must be applied retrospectively for corby this standard became effective july 1 2019 the guidance permits two methods of adoption retrospectively to each prior reporting period restated full retrospective method or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application modified retrospective method the company adopted this standard using the modified retrospective method the company has elected to set the right of use asset equal to the lease liability on the date of adoption the company has also elected to not restate prior year comparative information under the modified retrospective approach comparative information continues to be reported under ias 17 and related interpretations in applying ifrs 16 for the first time the company used the following practical expedients as permitted by the standard elected to not apply the requirements of ifrs 16 to short term leases and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value elected to set the right of use asset equal to the lease liability on the date of adoption excluded initial direct costs for the measurement of the right of use asset at the date of initial application upon adoption of the standard the company recognized a right of use asset and a lease liability for the present value of the remaining future lease payments discounted using the incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application the adoption of this standard resulted in the recognition of right of use assets and lease liabilities of 6 333 as at july 1 2019 the weighted average lessee s incremental borrowing rate applied to the lease liabilities on the date of initial application was 3 the company will recognize the lease payments associated with these leases on a straight line basis over the lease term under ifrs 16 depreciation expense on the right of use asset and interest expense on

value hierarchy in order to classify the fair value measurements and disclosures related to the company s financial assets and financial liabilities the fair value hierarchy has the following levels level 1 quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 2 inputs other than quoted market prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly as prices or indirectly derived from prices and level 3 unobservable inputs such as inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety the company has no financial instruments carried at fair value on its balance sheet for financial assets and liabilities that are valued at other than fair value on its balance sheets i e deposits in cash management pools accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued liabilities and dividends payable fair value approximates their carrying value at each balance sheet date due to their short term maturities fair value is determined using level 2 inputs level 3 inputs are used to determine the fair value of pension plan assets contained within the infrastructure and real estate

2019 due to a decrease in head grade offset by an increase in tonnes milled in the fourth quarter 388 744 tonnes of ore were mined equivalent to a mining rate of 4 225 tonnes per day compared to 283 136 tonnes of ore equivalent to a mining rate of 3 078 tonnes per day in the comparable period in 2018 in 2019 1 359 403 tonnes of ore were mined equivalent to a mining rate of 3 724 tonnes per day

for losses associated with certain legal proceedings and government investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident our effective tax rate for the three months ended december 31 2018 was a tax benefit of 6 9 the fourth quarter 2018 benefit was a result of adjustments recorded during the quarter to the provisional amounts recorded for the tax act enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017 that more than offset the income tax expense recorded during the quarter our effective tax rate was 9 3 for the twelve months ended december 31 2019 down from 14 0 for the same period in 2018 our effective tax rate is lower for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 2018 due to the operating loss of the company in 2019 and permanent tax differences resulting from the accrual for losses

119 4 million net of tax this financial measure by excluding the impact of acquisition related amortization expense and including a benefit to reflect the significant cash income tax savings resulting from the income tax deductibility of amortization for certain acquired intangibles these financial measures are not prepared in conformity with gaap management believes excluding the impact of amortization expense is useful because excluding acquisition related amortization and other items that are not comparable allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis certain acquired intangibles result in significant cash income tax savings which are not reflected in earnings management believes that including a benefit to reflect the cash income tax savings is useful as it allows investors to better value equifax management makes these adjustments to earnings when measuring profitability evaluating performance trends setting performance

penalties or other resolution of the proceedings and investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident the ultimate amount paid on these actions claims and investigations in excess of the amount already accrued could be material to the company s consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows in future periods management believes excluding this charge from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the three and twelve months ended december 31 2019 since a charge of such an amount is not comparable

the chief economist at standard chartered bank for africa and middle east ms razia khan during her recent visit to nigeria held an interactive session with journalists where she spoke about her expectations from the nigerian economy in 2020 dike onwuamaeze and peter uzoho provide the excerpts africa and nigeria s economic outlook we had taken the view that 2020 might be the first year that while we see a deceleration in global growth we might for the first time in many years see the sub saharan african ssa economy growing a little bit faster than the global growth rate a month into the new year it seems likely that will be the case fortunately for one reason because of the expectation that the global economy might be slowing even faster as previously hold the concern was around the trade tension in the last year between united states and china and its impact multinationals decision about were to be producing from all of these ultimately have dampened the effect of global growth it has been evident for the emerging market for some time the dovish way that we saw with the emerging market last year and monetary authorities trying to add more stimulus was a symptom around this ground of slowing global growth this year with the corona virus in china concerns are more significant we have revised downward our q1 gdp growth for china to 4 5 per cent our concern is that we should not see an escalation of the virus to a level that it might have impact on the oil prices when we were formulating our views on nigeria s gdp growth this was based on a fairly constructive view of foil price the believe was that opec was in control of oil prices owing to the commitment by member countries in its december meeting to produce in line with opec quotas this seemed to be strong support for oil prices since then there has been concern on what might happen to global demand for oil especially aviation fuel as global travels are impacted significantly by the coronavirus for the moment our attention is focused on if the spread of the virus will affect oil demand in any significant way but i think anyone looking at the nigerian economy and looking at the susceptibility of the nigerian economy to external shocks especially a decline in oil prices in particular will have to be concerned about this we have taken the view that a lot of this relative acceleration in the ssa growth in 2020 will be down to the fact that we see growth prospects in the three largest economies if one puts nigerian growth in perspective for much of last year in nigeria we know that growth from q2 to q3 were driven by the oil sector and growth in production and prices but we didn t see the same strength in the non oil sector which accounts for 90 per cent of nigeria s gdp this means that ultimately growth will come to very low level to about 2 4 percent which is below the population growth of 2 7 per cent in fact the income per capita of nigeria has been contracting the risk of course is if we will see a weak oil environment and that will impact activity in nigeria s environment the susceptibility of external influences hover much in place monetary policy and its impact on economy on monetary policy first of all we have seen a lot of efforts by the central bank to encourage banks to lend much more aggressively to ramp up private sector credit creation in the nigerian economy we know that between may last year and the end december in the last economic report there was a n2 trillion rise in private sector credit extension some of that roughly n400 million i believe was credit to manufacturing there is a fair chunk of it that is credit for consumption purposes but with n2 trillion for additional lending stimulation coming into the nigerian economy from a reasonable low base our expectation is that this will help to feed demand in 2020 the other point that we need to take into account is just how fiscal policy has operated in nigeria since the late 2014 collapse of oil prices for a long time fiscal policy was constrained by the authorities which announce big budget with a big capital expenditure intention but what we have been seeing year after year was that the budget cycle ultimately meant that nigerian budget only being signed into law around may or june was subject to significant delay for the first half of the year the country will be operating on the recurrent expenditure budget of the previous year and ultimately we didn t see the benefit of that because of the slowness of the budget cycle and how slowly budgets were actually being signed into law the difference of course in 2020 is that for the first time in many years we have reverted to a more normal budget cycle so even though there is officially a very small material reduction in the amount of planned capital expenditure the very fact that that can be put into operation we think it will add to the economy so two factors are present now that have largely been absent since early 2015 in the nigerian economy the strong impetus to encourage private sector lending one can understand that the immediate aftermath of the oil price collapse there is great risk aversion in terms of the intention to lend it is not exactly the kind of macro environment where financial institutions will have been thinking this is when you will really ramp up lending in the economy things are different now and knowing that there has been n2 trillion of additional private credit extension alongside a more effective budget cycle this really underpins our expectation that gdp growth in nigeria in 2020 will be better just modestly better but still better than what we have become very used to in past years the nigerian economy of course still has the potential to be growing much more significantly but we think this will be an encouraging start and hopefully the return of more positive momentum hoping to attract more private investment into the country again the return of confidence and the ability of the nigerian economy to grow the other thing that underscores our belief that we are going to see this acceleration in sub saharan african growth in 2020 is of course the weakness that we have seen in south africa in recent years for entirely different reasons really driven by domestic political factors right now electricity issue is at the front and center of the weak south africa growth story and whilst a lot of analysts are focused on the problems of the state owned electricity company eskom it has just announced the maintenance schedules that will mean effectively there will be low shedding in place for a lot longer than has previously been believed and that would be growth negative that takes away from growth nonetheless there have been very important developments the government of south africa in response to this crisis has essentially lifted restrictions that had been in place in private companies and their ability to generate renewable energy to meet their own consumption need that we think is really important investment growth in south africa has been weak for a long time if you take away that restriction on at least on the renewable side you will be seeing g a lot more investment and generation capacity by private companies for their own use but ultimately the beginning of an investment cycle that looks a lot healthier so on both nigeria and south africa we are in fact above consensus in terms of our growth expectations and those two economies are over 50 per cent of sub saharan african gdp it has never been the case that the whole region had experienced weak growth the commodity importing countries of east africa did particularly well we saw the delivery of fairly robust growth rate there countries in francophone west africa ivory coast that you see that is still here senegal which you don t but those are countries that gave been experiencing accelerated growth senegal has made the transition to becoming an oil and gas producer growing above six and half per cent every year ivory coast still one of the regional champions even ghana which went through an imf programme normally we think of imf programmes involve fiscal restraints great austerity a slowdown of growth ghana was fortunate enough to be emerging as an oil and gas producer over that time and so growth has not necessarily been that unhealthy southern africa of course if you look at the colour map of africa you can see that that is probably the weakest part in terms of the african story but nonetheless the expectation is that we should see just enough of a turnaround in both south africa and nigeria to lift african average growth increasing china lending to africa another theme that has been especially topical in africa has been what is china doing in the region how much of the debt accumulation is basically happening with respect to china and what we constructed here is a chart of the percentage of external debt that is owed to china in different economies now we sense that as much as there has been a lot of attractiveness to chinese lending typically this is not available necessarily on purely commercial terms it is not quite concessional either but it tends to be available on more attractive terms than would be available from other commercial sources chinese lending also tends to come with a much longer time horizon the maturity of the loans tends to be 15 to 20 years and for borrowing countries it can be very attractive such that that there is an initial grace period typically of around five years before any interest payments are do so if you are an african sovereign or government and you are thinking how do you build infrastructure then borrowing from china starts to look a lot more attractive but we also know that many of these countries have had debt sustainability issues in the recent past zambia is in the process of negotiating with chinese creditors the re profiling of its debts is trying to stand the debt maturities so it has left to pay while it has got its bonds with eurobonds that it also got to think about repaying or refinancing angola and ethiopia have actually had some elements of debt forgiveness from china and this means the behaviour that we have observed of a lot of policy bank lending china policy bank lending in africa in the recent past is that it is no longer the case that china seems to be increasing the amount that it is willing to lend without any consideration for credit risks we think that policy banks are probably focusing on a lot more on credit risks they are looking at the projects that look more sustainable that look as though they can be repaid and it sounds surprising that against this backdrop we have started to see headlines suggesting stepped up engagement between china and nigeria from september last year it seems as though there wasn t a week they went by without there being an announcement of a new project being financed by different chinese banks it is clear that nigeria has been a clear beneficiary of this closer look at credit quality in africa nigeria still considered to be one of the more credit where the economies in the region with good long term prospects and we are still seeing signs of very strong chinese engagement in terms of nigeria we think is a point worth mentioning of course when it comes to foreign exchange and the sustainability of current exchange rate regime an important driver of this is just the amount of foreign ownership of local currency debt securities nigeria s preparation for oil price shock well investors might look at foreign exchange reserves and get a little bit nervous about the sustainability of a stable exchange rate and they might in return therefore demand higher risk premium from nigeria the want to know that they will gather higher return because of the perceived higher risks and this could well emerge as a challenge that the monetary authorities in nigeria will need to look at just broadly speaking in an africa wide basis so far we have a lot of credit deterioration in the sense that when it comes to rating agency decisions on different economies there have been far more credit rating downgrades in the recent past that there have been upgrades there has been far more assigning of a negative outlook to credit ratings than there has been necessarily assigning of a positive outlook which will suggest that the next move may well be an upgrade to the ratings and this is a feature of the macroeconomic cycle that we have seen what we think it will take to change this trend is a return to growth based growth in the region the hope that we would see actual fiscal reforms that revenue mobilisation might start to rise these tend to be important drivers of the ratings perceptions of other african countries and no less so for nigeria on diversification of nigeria s economy the expectation that the collapse in oil prices in 2014 and 2015 would led to more diversification of the nigerian economy has not been a reality the oil export proportion to total export is still around 90 per cent this doesn t mean that there have not been the building blocks there are but what that is needed to move away from oil there need to be more economic debt outside the monthly allocation model that nigeria has had over the decades the question is are we really seeing a new building block to drive a new longer term growth allocation is a challenge faced by many resource economies higher oil prices will effectively lead to higher faac allocations there will be much more liquidity slushing around the economy but when oil prices fall the reverse will be the case the problem with this model is that it creates more importance for the government in the economy if government is spending the private sector will do well and everyone will feel good if government is not spending because oil price is not strong that feel good mood will disappear the nigeria s challenge is to really move away from this model to a one that the 90 per cent of the gdp will become much more resilient and the country less susceptible to external shocks even the cbn has called on the federal government to stop the faac allocation and start building fiscal buffers oil is not a renewable resource it is what you do with the proceeds of the sale that will be important but the question is whether there will be enough liquidity from other sources to compensate for that

with a win in new hampshire a maybe win in iowa last week and a month long surge into second place nationally sen bernie sanders i vt is now in strong position to win the democratic party s presidential nomination it s been a long road for the curmudgeonly man from vermont who spent years toiling on the fringes of official washington of all things the event that ultimately launched him into the democratic party s mainstream turned out to be a binary 2016 primary contest with hillary clinton a match up in which the contrast ultimately benefited him more than her so here we are in february 2020 and a self identified democratic socialist appears poised to be the candidate of the democratic party that could easily change and the party establishment will work hard to ensure it does but let us not take for granted how stunning it is that a man as radically leftist as sanders is the likely nominee as primary season heats up as sanders and his supporters boast he is not a normal democrat candidate he is the most radical member of the senate his platform would make him the furthest left major party nominee in the modern era sanders is a european style ideologue who seeks to radically transform the government and the economy dismantling the system of free enterprise and he s not bashful about that to be sure his success has pushed other candidates left on issues such as health care and higher education but sanders still stands as the most radical candidate which makes him the most appealing to many of his supporters as sanders surges in the nominating contest the sheer extremism of his platform should not be normalized simply because he s earning a decent slice of the democratic primary vote it s in that spirit we present this list which conveys the radicalism on which sanders has built his career and staked his campaign 1 34 trillion socialized health insurance overhaul sanders would ban private insurance and implement single payer government health care under his medicare for all proposal federal spending on health care would still increase by 10 percent of g d p or more than triple what the government spends on the military according to

with brent d griffiths the ticker stocks worldwide are on a hair trigger tied to the latest developments from the coronavirus outbreak but as investors signal they expect the federal reserve to respond and president trump renews pressure on the central bank to cut interest rates fed chair jerome powell says it will take a longer view we ll be watching this carefully powell yesterday told the house financial services committee what will be the effects on the u s economy will they be persistent will they be material that s really the question otherwise he said the u s economy remains in a very good place his appearance came two days after the global death toll from the disease topped that of the sars virus in 2002 and 2003 it now stands at 1 115 with more than 45 000 confirmed cases worldwide advertisement but the chinese economy is four times as big as it was during the sars outbreak magnifying the global impact of an event that grinds down activity there it used to be when the u s got a cold everybody else got the flu and now china may be able to make a similar claim s p global u s chief economist beth ann bovino tells me shrunken trade as a result of the virus is already costing major shipping firms 350 million a week for example and many factories in china remain shuttered or operating at a fraction of their capacity per the wall street journal s costas paris powell named the disruption to global supply chains as just one coronavirus consequence that could darken the economic outlook here among the others the drop off in chinese tourism to the united states diminished u s exports to china and the ongoing convulsions in financial markets the fed chief predicted there will very likely be some effects on u s growth though he was loath to get specific we have to resist the temptation to speculate on this he said advertisement investors nevertheless are doing their best to assess how the fed could adjust monetary policy to soften the blow they see a 42 percent chance of at least one interest rate cut by june double the probability they assigned that move just a month ago according to the cme group s fedwatch tool federal reserve chair jerome h powell said feb 11 the fed is closely monitoring the coronavirus outbreak for its impact on china and the global economy video the washington post many macroeconomic forecasters see the virus running its course by spring at the latest allowing chinese economic activity to make up most of the ground it has lost and leaving an even smaller mark on the u s while the markets are apparently convinced

few tenths off first quarter gdp growth andrew hunter senior u s economist for capital economics writes in a research note yet others are cautioning against jumping to optimistic conclusions bovino says an extended crisis that crimps chinese supply chains for example could derail a fragile u s manufacturing recovery just getting its footing after u s china trade tensions cooled advertisement and david wilcox a macroeconomist who until recently served as the fed s research director tells me at least two dimensions of uncertainty are complicating the task of assessing the disease s threat to u s growth namely the course of the disease itself and the actions authorities take to fight it wilcox now a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics underscored he is not a public health expert but he said the progression of the disease has been pretty rapid and where we are today is pretty different from what i would have expected a month ago and that makes me cautious about saying where we will be in a month for now he says there is not a factual basis for making an adjustment in the stance of monetary policy but the presumption should be that this may have a noticeable effect on economic activity and what will be critical will be to judge just how persistent that effect is advertisement but if the virus is still a fixture of news headlines six months to a year from now which is the horizon that s more relevant for monetary policy we will have a very serious problem on our hands of a magnitude that will make fed interventions irrelevant wilcox says the scale of the human tragedy will be very big market movers powell also warns congress on the deficit the post s heather long writes he told lawmakers that now would be a good time to reduce the federal budget deficit which is expected to top 1 trillion this year putting the federal budget on a sustainable path when the economy is strong would help ensure that policymakers have the space to use fiscal policy to assist in stabilizing the economy during a downturn powell said in testimony to the house financial services committee advertisement in past recessions the fed has played a large role in reviving the economy by sharply cutting interest rates but powell has been warning lawmakers that the central bank won t have much ammunition left to fight the next downturn because interest rates are so low the benchmark rate is just below 1 75 percent far below rates above 5 percent in the past more government spending is likely to be needed to aid the economy in the next recession and he had

the national assembly session on wednesday was adjourned for the day after ppp lawmakers created chaos in the house over energy minister omar ayub s remarks in which he stated that corruption is in the genetic makeup of the ppp and the pml n in a speech laden with criticism the energy minister called out the performance of the previous governments stating that there was an unprecedented price hike during the tenure of the ppp in an apparent reference to former president asif ali zardari he also called out mr 10pc in his speech a photo posted by instagram instagram on mar 22 2015 at 11 21am pdt the ppp took exception to the comments and asked the national assembly deputy speaker qasim khan suri to ask the minister to refrain from making such comments however when ayub continued his tirade against the opposition ppp lawmakers led by agha rafiullah surrounded the energy minister and started tearing copies of the agenda prompting treasury members to step in to prevent an altercation a photo posted by instagram instagram on mar 22 2015 at 11 21am pdt while ayub and rafiullah engaged in a verbal clash treasury members including minister for economic affairs hammad azhar and minister for science and technology fawad chaudhry stepped in to pacify the ppp lawmakers those who went to imf should not criticise govt hafeez shaikh at the start of the session special adviser to the prime minister on finance dr abdul hafeez shaikh said those who had themselves approached the international monetary fund imf should not be criticising the government for doing the same shaikh responded to what he said was undue criticism from opposition benches special adviser to the prime minister on finance dr abdul hafeez shaikh addresses the national assembly on wednesday dawnnewstv shaikh said that the governments that came to power both in 2008 and 2013 had gone to the imf this is a national problem our development isn t at the pace that we don t go to the imf no one goes to the imf happily whether it be the previous governments or the current one the situation compels us he said some people have claimed that in negotiations with the imf individuals from both parties are representatives of the imf the advisor said adding that it was disappointing that people like reza baqir who is the incumbent governor of the state bank of pakistan were being discarded for having worked in the imf earlier we should be proud of reza baqir he went on to study in the best american universities after having completed his initial studies from lahore he went on to join the imf solely on the basis of his capabilities shaikh said adding that those who did not have the credentials to even enter the halls of imf were criticising the sbp governor for having worked there the special assistant to the premier on finance also provided some of the advantages of an imf programme the first he said was that the financing of 6 billion provided was based on easier conditions adding that if this money was obtained commercially it would be more expensive the second point he said was that the whole world was reassured that pakistan was ready to operate with discipline and ready for partnerships with other parts of the world the direct advantage of this is that other countries and other international organisations including world bank and asian development bank also increased their support for pakistan situation inherited by pti govt during his address to the lower house of parliament shaikh explained the economic situation inherited by the pti government summarising the situation that was steering the government the premier s special assistant said there was a loan of rs95bn rs5 000bn to be returned in the next two years highest current account deficit in pakistan s history and nosedived reserves alongside an upward trajectory in the fiscal deficit he said that the other dangerous situation inherited by the government which needs to be focussed on is regarding exports the crisis in pakistan is that our country doesn t have dollars we are going on depleting dollars and increasing our liabilities in dollars and what is happening to exports because there is only one way to increase dollars that is exports shaikh said that over the past five years the rate of growth in exports was zero a system in which the dollar was purposely kept cheap he said adding that imports were growing in the country during this time and this affected industrialisation and exporters were disadvantaged this is an issue we have to think about as a country my main purpose is not to criticise but to present facts this is also a challenge for the government he said that other concerns were the slow rate of development in agriculture as well as the electricity sector we as a country have been unsuccessful in solving this problem and what manifests this is the circular debt in summary shaikh said that when the pti government came to power it could see the country entering into a crisis and no one was ready to give pakistan a loan when people raise questions that you didn t do this or that the fundamental reason for that was that dollars had been depleted and nobody was ready to give us a loan current govt s tasks shaikh said that under all conditions they had to save the country from defaulting why because it was be very dangerous for pakistan he said various allies of pakistan had assisted it and another important step was going to the imf later during his address shaikh shared certain steps the current government had taken to take the country out of the crisis it was in he said that one of the things that was required was to reduce expenses this government has taken some decisions which are historic he said adding that one big decision that was taken was to freeze the budget of the pakistan army has anyone taken such a decision before he asked the premier s special assistant added that the civilian government s budget was also reduced by rs40 billion these are big decisions i have been a part of various governments no one used to take such decisions shaikh said with regards to managing expenditures he said that a strict budget was set i want to tell you that taxes in the first seven months the target was around 2 200 and we achieved around 2 100 sheikh said additionally he said that borrowing from the sbp over the past seven months was at zero as they had decided not to borrow from the state bank because such borrowing tends to be inflationary the premier s special assistant said that when they sat down to make a budget they decided that if they were to spend money on anyone it would be on two groups the weakest segment of society and those who are supporting the government in increasing exports he said that the impact of the measures taken to benefit exporters was that exports had increased after a zero per cent growth in five years in the first seven months exports grew shaikh said adding that this had occurred at a time when countries like bangladesh and vietnam had also been unsuccessful in increasing exports according to shaikh a big danger was the current account deficit which he said had been reduced from rs20bn to rs13bn in the first year he added that there was a primary surplus for the first time in ten years i am not saying anything political i am simply stating the facts he said with regards to fiscal deficit shaikh said that it had also seen a downward trend coming to revenues collected by the government the adviser on finance said non tax revenue had been increased by 170pc he added that the target of non tax revenue was rs1 100bn however he said that it would rs1 500bn sheikh shared that the exchange rate also appeared to be at a stable level pti inherited economy left behind by its predecessors ayub energy minister omar ayub stated that the opposition continue to cry crocodile tears but are forgetting about the ground realities during their tenures reading aloud from a report the minister said the measures and the price situation were so acute that despite the measures outlines above there was a higher rate of inflation in the economy coming to the current situation ayub said that the pml n had also pointed fingers at the government for the current deteriorating economic situation they talk about different things but when it comes to figures in five years there was a 101pc increase in the circulation of currency notes during the pml n government who had to face this imran khan and the pti government what hafeez shaikh had said previously they ran the rupee into the ground miftah ismail started it and we had to face the consequences he said they played with the country and picked up a mountain of debts in the first 60 years of this country s history our debt was rs7 000 bn then came the ppp which took it up to rs15 000 bn the pml n took it one step further by making it soar to rs30 000 bn he explained they are scared because the pti government is moving towards success we will overcome the obstacles they have left behind their workers themselves are coming to us asking how to join the party as their leaders are missing in action he added the policies drafted by the previous governments are like a noose around our neck he said abbasi questions pti performance former prime minister shahid khaqan abbasi responding to shaikh questioned if there was a shortage why didn t the minister for food security enforce wheat emergency in the country former prime minister shahid khaqan abbasi addresses the national assembly on wednesday dawnnewstv he alleged people will not be provided any relief why don t the ministers here apprise us of their performance over the past 1 5 years other than banning plastic bags nothing concrete has been done while the minister has spoken about the national government nobody here has mentioned the role of the punjab government and questioned why this problem was created he added that the problem is not a shortage of wheat and sugar but rather the prices the government should assure the people that prices will be reduced and the mafia will be exposed he added abbasi said that there was an economic meltdown in the country and if the finance minister believed what he was saying then he could only sympathise with shaikh the government and the people of pakistan because none of it was based on facts he claimed that if the pti led government completes its five year term the country s debt will be doubled the senior pml n leader is currently in prison in connection with an lng

hikmet hikmet ersek chief executive officer well thank you brad and good afternoon everyone i am pleased to say that our business delivered solid results in the fourth quarter driven by continued strong performance in our digital offerings fourth quarter revenue increased 3 on an adjusted constant currency basis and adjusted eps was 0 38 for the full year our adjusted results were in line with the financial outlook we provided with third quarter results returning cash to shareholders remained a priority as we returned over 880 million to shareholders in 2019 i am pleased that today we also announced a 13 increase in the quarterly dividend which reflects the strength of our business and strong profit expectations for 2020 and confidence in our new global strategy 2019 was a pivotal year for western union as we made significant progress toward our vision of being the leader in cross border cross currency money movement and payments and delivered strong financial results so i would like to take a moment to review some of the key strategic accomplishments from 2019 first we simplified and created a sharper focus for the business largely completing our exit from noncore operations with the sale of speedpay u s domestic bill payment service and the u s payment mortgage service in the second quarter the 750 million in proceeds funded enhanced cash returns to shareholders with the divestitures and smaller domestic money transfers our business is now primarily focused on cross border services for consumers financial institutions banks and other businesses our focus aligns with our core competencies in foreign exchange cross border settlement compliance and global retail and account payout network second accomplishment in 2019 was we continued to expand our digital business the westernunion com service now accounts for 15 for consumer revenues and cross border revenue increased 26 in the fourth quarter we also began unlocking the value of our leading global physical and digital cross border cross currency platform opening into third party partners for example we added two significant customers among others stc pay and sberbank our total digital money transfer revenues increased 24 reported or 25 constant currency in the fourth quarter today we operate one of the most extensive digital platforms for cross border cross currency money movement whether branded direct offerings like westernunion com or digital offerings that enable our partners like td bank sberbank or stc pay both westernunion com and white label offerings continue to have very strong growth potential we have recently integrated digital services with three of europe s largest postal institutions france s la banque postale italy s postepay and the u k post we also recently announced a new partnership with bharti airtel a global telecommunications company with operations across asia and africa we will soon offer real time payments into millions of airtel payments at bank accounts in india and mobile wallets across 14 countries in africa we have established nonremittance white label payment use cases such as our partnership with amazon for global e commerce payments further expanding our addressable market to consumer to business payments and in business payments we re seeing business solutions continue its growth trend led by a strong performance in the education and financial institution verticals which translated into solid revenue growth of 4 on a constant currency basis for 2019 so it was a quite good year while we made significant progress in 2019 we are not content and we ll continue to drive our business forward in 2020 we laid out our strategic vision at our september investor day and i would like to highlight three key strategic objectives we will focus on in 2020 enhancing our global network driving our digital growth and optimizing our organization we will work to enhance our global payments network improving the cost coverage and quality and further leverage it with additional third party partnership today our vast platform capabilities include both digital and physical money movement networks with over 550 000 locations across more than 200 countries and territories digital send capabilities in over 70 countries and bank account payout capabilities in over 100 markets offering across to billions of accounts we will continue to grow our network and we ll also improve the quality by adding new value added services like real time account payout which we expanded during 2019 we now offer customers the ability to transfer funds into an account in real time in over 20 countries with plans to expand it to over 100 countries this year the value added payout services should help us gain new customer segments such as e commerce and financial institutions we will drive our digital strategy forward to serve consumers whenever wherever and however they desire and expand aggressively over the next few years including large opportunities like the 120 billion outbound market in the gulf states or the 25 billion outbound market in china and india our goal is to evolve in the world s ultimate agnostic network for payments and cross border money movements we are also transitioning our western union branded consumer business from a transaction based model to a lifetime value model optimizing the customer experience and improving retention to achieve this goal we have further developing and applying strong data analytic capabilities to our rich pool of global data over 200 countries allowing us to price dynamically market more precisely and ultimately enhance our ability to drive revenue growth our third strategic objective is to strengthen and optimize our organization western union has tremendous talent building on the foundation of wu way lean capabilities and the transformation office we will leverage internal resources more effectively to improve execution enhance profitability and drive margin expansion in addition to that we will continue to selectively add new team members who can impact our business a great example is the recent addition of shelly swanback our new president of product and platform shelly comes to us as a senior accenture where she was instrumental in building the firm s digital services shelly reports directly to me and play a critical role in enhancing our global platform finally while we will continue to focus on driving shareholder value with strong financial results we will also focus on delivering value for all stakeholders to our environmental social and governance efforts the details of these efforts can be found in our 2018 esg report we plan to issue our 2019 esg report later this spring and one more thing during the past month we have also achieved a significant milestone in our u s joint settlement agreements the term of the deferred prosecution agreement with the department of justice expired on january 19 under the dpa to close out this matter the doj has 90 days from the exploration to file for dismissal of the charges we understand that doj will make a motion to dismiss the dpa promptly we will continue to work to protect our customers and partners by maintaining strong compliance programs which we believe give us a competitive advantage in closing we made significant progress in 2019 and we begin 2020 better positioned than ever before to capitalize on the significant opportunity in the large and growing money transfer and global payments market i am confident in our ability to deliver the 2022 margin and eps targets and our outlook this year reflects our expectations for a strong start to achieve our goals raj will discuss our financial outlook and long term targets in more detail i remain excited about our long term prospects and would like to thank to all our team members for their hard work and commitment and a big thank you to our business partners agents consumers and shareholders from all over the world for your trust and loyalty with that i ll turn the call over to raj raj agrawal executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you hikmet i will focus my comments primarily on the fourth quarter the similar information for the full year can be found in our press release and the attached financial schedules given the impact of the divestiture on prior period comparison and restructuring costs from our productivity program there are a number of puts and takes in our fourth quarter results our adjusted results remove most of the impact of the factors which will not affect our future results fourth quarter revenue of 1 3 billion declined 7 compared to the prior year period while adjusted constant currency revenue which excludes our divested businesses in the prior year period increased 3 currency translation net of the impact of hedges reduced fourth quarter revenue by approximately 42 million compared to the prior year primarily due to the depreciation of the argentine peso the decline in peso negatively impacted reported revenue by 2 while the effect of inflation on our argentina businesses is estimated to have positively impacted both reported and constant currency revenue by approximately 1 in the consumer to consumer segment reported revenue was flat or increased 1 constant currency while transactions declined 1 primarily due to some civil unrest macroeconomic and market specific issues in a few countries total c2c cross border principal increased 1 or 2 on a constant currency basis principal per transaction was flat or increased 1 constant currency the spread between c2c transaction and revenue growth in the quarter was 1 with a negative 1 impact from currency pricing was higher in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year and was largely offset by mix the net impact was positive on revenue in the quarter turning to the regional results north america revenue grew 1 on a reported and constant currency basis while transactions declined 4 revenue growth in the region was led by the u s to mexico corridor and other u s outbound businesses which was partially offset by continued declines in u s domestic money transfer u s dmt trends were similar to last quarter and we expect declines will continue this year as we manage the business for cash flow revenue in the europe and cis region increased 1 or 2 on a constant currency basis driven by spain russia and france transactions in the region increased 5 aided again by the sberbank white label business revenue in the middle east africa and south asia region was flat on both a reported and constant currency basis revenue trends in the region reflected slower growth in saudi arabia and the uae in the quarter civil unrest in lebanon and continued hard currency limitations in certain african markets transactions declined 1 as strong growth in digital transactions was offset by declines in retail sends from the region to india were negatively impacted by cash tax implemented in september that impacted our agents ability to make cash payments it was subsequently removed but it may take some time to return to previous transaction levels we are also making adjustments to marketing pricing and other incentives in the region to improve growth the latin america and caribbean region delivered strong constant currency revenue growth led by chile and mexico outbound despite civil unrest in multiple south american countries revenue in the region declined 2 on a reported basis or increased 6 constant currency while transactions grew 4 in the apac region revenue declined 10 on both a reported and constant currency basis revenue trends improved compared to last quarter s rate partially due to pricing actions in certain markets transactions were down 7 in the region driven primarily by the philippine domestic business which has limited impact on profit digital money transfer revenues increased 25 on a constant currency basis in the quarter including westernunion com and third party white label services westernunion com revenue grew 17 or 18 constant currency wu com now represents 15 of total c2c revenue in the quarter cross border westernunion com revenue increased approximately 26 which was partially offset by declines in domestic money transfer business solutions revenue was flat on a reported basis or increased 1 constant currency and represented 7 of company revenues in the quarter constant currency revenue growth was driven by strong performance in europe as well as strong growth in the education and financial institution verticals which were offset by slower growth in hedging services other revenues which consists primarily of our retail bill payments businesses in the u s and argentina decreased 52 in the quarter which reflects the impact of the speedpay and paymap divestitures in may the pago facil walk in business in argentina posted good increases in transactions and local currency revenue growth other revenues represented 7 of total company revenues in the quarter turning to margins and profitability we will focus on consolidated margins as segment margins are not comparable with the prior year period due to reallocation of corporate costs following the divestiture of the speedpay business we are also providing adjusted metrics to exclude restructuring expenses merger and acquisition costs and related tax effects the consolidated gaap operating margin was 17 3 in the quarter compared to 19 3 in the prior year period the decline was primarily due to higher marketing investment compared to the prior year period the impact of restructuring expenses in the current quarter and the divestiture of the speedpay in may of 2019 we incurred 17 million of restructuring expense in the fourth quarter and 115 million for the full year which was slightly higher than we expected in 2019 due to the timing of some items but we continue to expect a total of approximately 150 million of restructuring expense with the remainder to be incurred this year adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter was 18 7 compared to 19 9 in the prior year period with the decrease primarily due to higher marketing investment and the speedpay divestiture speedpay contributed about 60 basis points to last year s fourth quarter margin while foreign exchange hedges provided a benefit of 7 million in the current quarter and a benefit of 4 million in the prior year period the gaap effective tax rate was 31 4 in the quarter compared to 9 8 in the prior year period while the adjusted tax rate of 24 5 compared to 6 8 in the prior year period the increase in the gaap and adjusted tax rates was primarily due to certain discrete benefits in the prior year period also while we expected the fourth quarter to have the highest tax rate of the year it was further increased by one time settlements in certain geographies the gaap rate also included additional taxes associated with the may 2019 divestitures gaap earnings per share in the quarter was 0 32 compared to 0 48 in the prior year period and adjusted earnings per share in the quarter was 0 38 compared to 0 51 in the prior year the year over year decrease in both gaap and adjusted eps was primarily due to a higher effective tax rate the divestitures and higher marketing investment partially offset by fewer shares outstanding turning to our cash flow and balance sheet gaap cash flow from operating activities was 915 million for the full year which exceeded our outlook primarily due to favorable working capital items adjusted cash flow from operating activities was 1 1 billion in 2019 capital expenditures were approximately 34 million in the quarter and 128 million for the full year at the end of the year we had cash of 1 5 billion and debt of 3 2 billion during the fourth quarter we issued 500 million in 2 85 notes we redeemed 325 million in notes due this year and reduced commercial paper we returned 149 million to shareholders in the fourth quarter including 84 million in dividends and 65 million of share repurchases which represented approximately 2 5 million shares the outstanding share count at quarter end was 418 million shares and we had 1 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization which expires december 2021 as hikmet noted we re off to a good start to deliver on our strategic initiatives and restructuring plans which is reflected in our strong operating margin and eps growth outlook for 2020 our outlook assumes no material change from current macroeconomic conditions we expect gaap revenues for the full year to be a flat to low single digit decline primarily due to the divestiture of speedpay in may 2019 on an adjusted constant currency basis we expect low single digit revenue growth this year which excludes the speedpay revenues and any benefit related to argentina inflation operating margin on a gaap basis is expected to be approximately 20 while adjusted operating margin is expected to be approximately 21 as we continue to focus on generating efficiencies and we will begin to benefit from restructuring savings weighted toward the second half we continue to expect to realize approximately 50 million of annual savings from restructuring in 2020 increasing to 100 million in 2021 in addition to this we expect to realize other efficiency savings of 50 million by 2022 for a total of 150 million of annual savings in 2022 we expect the gaap and adjusted effective tax rate to be in the mid teens range this year gaap eps for the year is expected to be in the range of 1 87 to 1 97 while adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of 1 95 to 2 05 which represents growth in the teens cash flow from operating activities is expected to be approximately 900 million while adjusted cash flow from operating activities is expected to be approximately 1 billion we expect to spend approximately 500 million on share repurchases for the full year in summary we delivered our full year adjusted financial outlook in 2019 we made good progress on our restructuring activities and our new global strategy designed to drive profitability efficiency and long term growth we generated strong cash flow and continue to return significant funds to shareholders we look forward to delivering on our strategy and our long term financial targets of operating margin of approximately 23 in 2022 and a low double digit earnings per share cagr for the three years ending 2022 off of adjusted 2019 eps thanks for joining the call today and operator we are now ready to take your questions questions answers operator and our first question comes from bryan keane of deutsche bank please go ahead korey marcello deutsche bank analyst hey guys this is korey marcello on for bryan keane i wanted to ask i guess first on the guidance i know the three year outlook is calling for 2 to 3 growth in consumer but any color just for next year in terms of how you think business solutions and maybe other revenue will shape up i guess in particular you re going to have some lapping impacts from the divestitures so i didn t know if you had any comments on sort of the quarterly cadence of revenue growth for the year hikmet ersek chief executive officer well raj jump in but let me start look in the fundamentals nothing has changed we really assume that our business will perform especially our digital expansion will perform the digital expansion for us either branded or white labeling will going to go and that you saw the recent numbers on our growth numbers are quite impressive and that s from a different base than the competitors have right we have been investing here for a long time and growing very strong in digital expansion that continues to go the other part is that dropping money on real time on accounts that will going to continue to go and offering retail cash payout and dropping money in real time it s a huge competitive advantage within our capabilities and look we also started the drop money for businesses right i mean we are collecting for amazon from consumer in different countries businesses we are doing transactions for third parties and our business to business has had a good year growing by 4 so generally i would say that nothing has changed from our investors day we are in a good momentum we like our business we like how we are performing especially also our transformational activities and our efficiency activities are very promising and we are still in target with our 2022 goals anyone do you want to add something raj agrawal executive vice president and chief financial officer i think you ve covered it i mean yeah so i think we re good korey marcello deutsche bank analyst ok great i guess just as a follow up you mentioned obviously amazon and third parties there i guess can you give maybe a broader update on kind of what the pipeline looks like for those third parties and in particular maybe the amazon partnership any update there in terms of like plans for the year and market go live and is there anything kind of baked into the guidance from some of this stuff that you ve called out as more longer term i guess for next year thanks hikmet ersek chief executive officer yeah i think as you said it s a longer term we started in a very good stronger digital growth definitely our partnership helps on our strong growth right look we go to market we are talking and in some countries we re offering our dot com business in some countries on our digital white labeling part depending on our partner depending on the legal environment depending on the consumer relationship but the good news is that the partners are choosing our capabilities to move cross border cross currency money and that capability having two countries and capable of operating in 200 countries is unique and so i mean it s still small but growing very very strong and has good potential and we will definitely update with additional partners i mean we recently signed three big postal offices like the la banque postale u k post and the italy post italy post is for instance having access to 7 million consumers italian consumers with their mobile phones right and they do transaction cross border by using our platform so it s quite impressive and we drop money in real time for them and that s going to continue it depends really on the partnership how they choose if they choose western union brand or being a partner like amazon which amazon uses their own codes we are for them a service provider to collect money for their online services korey marcello deutsche bank analyst all right thanks guys hikmet ersek chief executive officer thanks korey raj agrawal executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator our next question comes from darrin peller of wolfe research please go ahead andrew bauch wolfe research analyst hey guys this is andrew on behalf of darrin i want to drill into north america for a little bit it looks like the delta between transactions and revenues was relatively stable over the last couple of quarters and widened a little bit this quarter i was wondering is there any impact of the digital transactions in that number is that largely all domestic and if you can provide any other additional color on what you saw on domestic in the quarter and further into the outlook for 2020 raj agrawal executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah north america i would say that one of the key driver was really declines in our domestic money transfer transactions in the u s we also have a very small philippine intrabusiness that has a heavy number of transactions which was also declining so that has an impact on overall mix the u s to mexico market also was just softer from a market standpoint although we continue to gain share there and then we also put new principal limits in place for u s to cuba so some of these things had an impact in the quarter but overall i would say the digital part of the business if you look at the cross border part of wu com again which north america is a contributor there obviously that grew at 26 so the digital part continues to do well the domestic part of digital certainly was a little bit worse in the quarter than it was in the previous quarter andrew bauch wolfe research analyst and then that new metric the digital revenues that you called out how should we think about that mix across all the different regions that you have i mean i think it s the first time that you ve really been able to separate them like that so maybe just letting us get a better sense of how we should think about that across segments thanks raj agrawal executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean right now the digital which grew 25 in the quarter includes wu com and as well as the digital white label partners and we only have a handful of those right now and the two primary ones are saudi telecom in saudi arabia and sberbank in russia so those are the two primary ones that are driving a lot of the additional growth so there s not much to cut in terms of where it is globally it s in those two regions if you will in the middle east as well as in europe and certainly we want to sign more partners and more opportunities we really look at the total digital as being one type of offering with branded and nonbranded offerings and they re both leveraging our platform capabilities right hikmet ersek chief executive officer and they basically use our same platform you go to market and it s the partner s decision if they use their brand in that case in saudi arabia for saudi telecom did use but it s the westernunion com platform and our platform western union platform and our network we drop money over our network so it s really a digital transaction with different brands andrew bauch wolfe research analyst all right thanks guys hikmet ersek chief executive officer yeah thank you operator our next question comes from ramsey el assal of barclays please go ahead ben budish barclays analyst hey guys this is actually ben budish on for ramsey i wanted to kind of follow up on the white label wallets you guys talked about and just kind of looking at the growth in europe versus the middle east i know you called out some one time factors impacting the middle east growth but is there anything to read through there like maybe the growth in transaction that sberbank are growing better than those of stc or is that really all related to kind of those one time factors that you called out raj agrawal executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i would say most of it is related to the one time factors and we ll see how long the lebanon civil unrest we called out there s some in syria and then obviously the india tax is also the other factor which the issue was reversed so that tax came into play late in the third quarter but then it was reversed in the fourth quarter but we did have some customer attrition and that s what we re working through right now so we ve assumed that in the first part of this year we ll see some of that but we should be able to work through that as the months come along here so it s really related to those factors rather than any shift in mix if you will ben budish barclays analyst ok and then just kind of following up on again on the white labels would you say that performance has been kind of in line with expectations i mean we got like a little hint of it back at the analyst day and it looked like things we re going quite nicely is there any change to that or does it seem like things are kind of moving along according to plan raj agrawal executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i would say things are moving along very much according to plan they re doing quite well and we re very excited about them and we want to continue to add more and more partners to the mix ben budish barclays analyst ok great thanks for taking my questions raj agrawal executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator our next question comes from vasu govil of kbw please go ahead vasu govil kbw analyst hi thanks for taking my question i guess the first one on the pricing front it seems like clearly that s been a tailwind for a couple of quarters now can you talk about whether you re starting to see an impact your dynamic pricing initiative or it s just the underlying trends are better and if you could also comment on what s enabling the stability in the pricing environment because it doesn t seem like the competitive environment is necessarily abated hikmet ersek chief executive officer well pricing environment obviously as we said earlier partly impacted by mix partly with the strong pricing environment we feel comfortable with our dynamic pricing activities as you know we adjust our pricing corridor by corridor even zip code by zip code customer behavior by customer behavior and this effort started and we start in few corridors and we will expand that globally and that s something that we are very excited about that you can compare like a big airliner you fly one direction you have different customers with different needs with different price payments that s going to happen and that s what we are aiming to and we started in some corridors and we see good return on that and that s just the beginning of the story though and we are quite excited about that vasu govil kbw analyst great thanks and just a quick follow up on the transaction growth trends raj i think you mentioned a previous question that you re assuming that that will kind of continue to be weak in the first half is that true for just the india piece or all the various one timers that you saw this quarter and then just to confirm does coronavirus have any impact on your business positive or negative raj agrawal executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah in terms of the one time items that we called out for q4 obviously the ones that are under our control we re actioning those there are some things that are more country specific issues civil unrest is not really under our control but we ve assumed that some of these things will continue for the first part of this year we don t expect them to continue for the entire year but certainly we ll update you as we see more from a coronavirus standpoint we have not assumed any material impact for coronavirus china for us is about 2 of our total revenues and it s mostly inbound in nature and that obviously the conditions are evolving every single day so we need to see how that plays out hikmet ersek chief executive officer yeah on china i mean first of all we support our employees and look after them and it s very important also agent locations but most of the agent locations are active and as you said it s only 2 of our business but at the same time i want to mention that also we can drop money in minutes on an account in china so if people don t feel to go to the location and have a physical payout they could also do it online and this is one of the growing parts of our business and so we don t see a big impact from coronavirus yet now i can t judge generally what will have that do to general global economy but in specific areas we don t see a big impact on our business vasu govil kbw analyst thats very helpful thank you very much raj agrawal executive vice president and chief financial officer sure operator our next question comes from andrew jeffrey of suntrust please go ahead andrew jeffrey suntrust robinson humphrey analyst hi good afternoon appreciate you guys taking the question conceptually i m just wondering how you re thinking about the business raj because i think you made a comment about the domestic business increasingly being a source of free cash and presumably return of capital it would appear that strictly looking at wu com it s 100 of your c2c growth today should we think about that as sort of the future and the balance of the business as really being a cash cow for lack of a better term and fueling investments to support digital and returning capital to shareholders is that a reasonable framework raj agrawal executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think andrew as we laid out at investor day we said that our assumption was for 2 to 3 overall growth over the next three years and that has not changed and the composition of that was a flattish type retail business obviously we d like to get a little bit of growth out of it but we do believe that can be the case and then we expected digital to grow in the 20 range and off of a base of 600 million last year that s quite a bit of contribution and then we also expected and continue to expect that the b2b business will grow in the mid single digit range so those are the components we re thinking about obviously we want to drive to more than just 2 to 3 growth that s not satisfactory and that s where really our platform strategy comes into play and signing more and more partners as we move along but just the last point on the domestic business it was about 6 of our total revenues last year so it s becoming a smaller and smaller piece overall of the company and that s probably a trend we re going to see for a little while and that s what we ve assumed in our outlook for this year as well andrew jeffrey suntrust robinson humphrey analyst ok so still hoping that that retail business i guess can turn the corner for you raj agrawal executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah because yeah go ahead hikmet ersek chief executive officer yeah i mean we assume a flat business but nobody has the strength of retail mix compared with our global coverage and most importantly you connect digital with retail that we can pay out in different economical environment we serve different customer segments on the send side we do serve different customers segment on the receive side and combining that it s a big advantage for us that drives the growth of digital paying out in cash or paying out in an account or paying out in a wallet and that in real time it s huge and that s definitely going to continue happening in the retail business raj agrawal executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah and i think as you saw at investor day and it continues to be the case the opportunity on the retail side is to drive more dynamic pricing capabilities so time of day day of week location density those kinds of things give us confidence that we can keep the retail business in the flattish type range because there s more opportunity there that we haven t fully maximized yet andrew jeffrey suntrust robinson humphrey analyst ok and i apologize if i missed it but it looks like yields on wu com improved again this quarter what s driving that raj agrawal executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean there was certainly some mix impacts from the domestic business and things because we re running the domestic parts of our business for cash if you will and so that certainly has a positive mix on the on the revenue side there was also some pricing that we did as we mentioned net pricing was beneficial net of the mix in the quarter and so we feel good about where the overall digital business is we had 25 revenue growth in digital but over 30 transaction growth in that digital business so we re doing quite well overall on the digital side andrew jeffrey suntrust robinson humphrey analyst ok so that s pricing specifically at wu com or across raj agrawal executive vice president and chief financial officer on the branded wu com offering yeah andrew jeffrey suntrust robinson humphrey analyst ok all right thank you operator our next question comes from tim chiodo of credit suisse please go ahead tim chiodo credit suisse analyst good afternoon thanks for taking my question i wanted to talk a little bit about the unit economics of some of the digital white labeling programs i know we ve talked about in the past that the revenue per transaction is obviously a little bit lower but maybe you can talk about the absolute ebit dollars per transaction and how that might compare to a traditional western union transaction raj agrawal executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah first of all i would say it s still early stages on the white label partners and we re going to continue to learn on what kind of economics they can provide but you re absolutely right typically we ll have a lower starting point from a revenue per transaction standpoint but we also don t have much cost in that transaction either as we do in our branded offerings in a wu com transaction we re investing heavily in marketing to acquire customers we also have fraud losses and other things that we re paying for but in a white label transaction we are being delivered a customer who wants to do a transaction with us and has good funds right so we don t spend the marketing dollars there and we really have the processing cost so the margins in the white label offerings can be quite high actually and we re going to learn more as we launch more of these partners but based on our early experience it can be a very profitable business and last thing i would say is that we see it largely as an incremental business so incremental revenues and incremental profits tim chiodo credit suisse analyst right on thank you and to get a little bit more at the absolute dollars so i understand that the revenue is lower and the margin percentage could be higher but could the absolute dollar actually be similar raj agrawal executive vice president and chief financial officer it depends it depends i can tell you one of the examples we have that s currently going on is very profitable the other one is not as profitable but we re getting again incremental revenues and incremental profits so obviously it s important on how much money we re making per transaction but as long as we re getting incremental business for the company and it s within our overall framework that s the most important thing for us so we ll learn more over time and we wouldn t be doing this if it wasn t profitable for us hikmet ersek chief executive officer it s both our sorry both are profitable but it depends on the partner i mean also the new additions of the post offices will be very profitable but it depends on the partner and the geography and which corridor you are placing that and it s like started our westernunion com business as you know as we started as we start to report it was only 1 of our revenue now it s about 15 of our consumer revenue it s a huge part of that and same approach we think also could be done by our digital business like adding on the combining dot com and digital business will be a big part of the future of the company and will be very profitable tim chiodo credit suisse analyst great thanks a lot that s really helpful i appreciate it raj agrawal executive vice president and chief financial officer sure no problem

us equities renewed record on tuesday after the federal reserve chair said he is closely monitoring the emergence of the coronavirus which could lead to disruptions in china that spill over to the rest of the global economy but the fed will keep its wait and see position as long as the incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with the outlook despite early gains the three major us indices closed near flat on news that the ftc opened new investigations against the big tech companies to examine whether they acquired small tech firms in a way to harm competition most sectors edged higher in new york real estate 1 22 and energy stocks led gains 1 04 as technology stocks 0 34 lagged speaking of antitrust allegations the big us techs have been accused of altering competition for many years now but these allegations had little negative impact on investor appetite equities in asia traded mixed japanese chinese and korean stocks were mostly up while sales were dominant in parts of south east asia equities in new zealand advanced to a record as the reserve bank of new zealand rbnz kept its official cash rate unchanged at the historical low of 1 00 wti crude eased to 49 5 a barrel then rebounded past 50 as investors who lost opec s support found hope in fed s accommodative approach to the coronavirus outbreak and its negative implications on economic growth still wti is poised to settle durably below the 50 level as the demand side shock will likely increase the global oil glut and continue weighing on oil prices the euro fell to a four month low against the us dollar on tuesday after the investor confidence data missed expectations at a time when confidence was most needed in her speech yesterday the european central bank ecb president christine lagarde called for higher government spending as did her predecessor mario draghi multiple times in vain if the ecb seeks government support it is because the european companies prefer investing their cash in the market despite very low returns instead of borrowing at negative rates this trend could be easily tracked in production data due later this morning the industrial production data in the eurozone should confirm a 1 8 m o m contraction in december versus 0 2 printed a month earlier amid production in germany took another and an unexpected hit soft figures come as a warning that the improvement a month earlier may have been temporary the fear that german slowdown has probably not bottomed out just yet means that the ecb could be tempted to lower the interest rates in the future though as discussed above we are unsure that deeper interest rate cuts would remedy to europe s low investment problem even though our base case scenario is that the ecb would keep interest rates unchanged until normalisation each soft figure adds to the probability that this could change and weighs on the single currency by increasing the core short positions across the channel the fourth quarter growth data showed that the uk narrowly avoided an economic contraction as production remained subdued in december the consumer spending rose by the lowest since 2015 due next week inflation should show a rebound in january but even that could remain insufficient to improve the sentiment in sterling which looks poised to revisit the 1 28 levels in the coming weeks risk reversals for both short and long term maturities tell us that investors increase hedges for a softer sterling against the us dollar as mounting anxiety regarding the second phase of brexit negotiations and the expectation that the bank of england boe would cut the rates by 25 basis points in the first half of the year continue weighing on the currency ftse 0 17 futures hint at a soft positive start in london small rebound in oil and cheaper sterling may give a certain support to the british blue chip index but may not suffice to maintain it above the 7500p level
skip to comments posted on by seekandfind with a win in new hampshire a maybe win in iowa last week and a month long surge into second place nationally sen bernie sanders i vt is now in strong position to win the democratic party s presidential nomination it s been a long road for the curmudgeonly man from vermont who spent years toiling on the fringes of official washington of all things the event that ultimately launched him into the democratic party s mainstream turned out to be a binary 2016 primary contest with hillary clinton a match up in which the contrast ultimately benefited him more than her so here we are in february 2020 and a self identified democratic socialist appears poised to be the candidate of the democratic party that could easily change and the party establishment will work hard to ensure it does but let us not take for granted how stunning it is that a man as radically leftist as sanders is the likely nominee as primary season heats up as sanders and his supporters boast he is not a normal democrat candidate he is the most radical member of the senate his platform would make him the furthest left major party nominee in the modern era sanders is a european style ideologue who seeks to radically transform the government and the economy dismantling the system of free enterprise and he s not bashful about that to be sure his success has pushed other candidates left on issues such as health care and higher education but sanders still stands as the most radical candidate which makes him the most appealing to many of his supporters as sanders surges in the nominating contest the sheer extremism of his platform should not be normalized simply because he s earning a decent slice of the democratic primary vote it s in that spirit we present this list which conveys the radicalism on which sanders has built his career and staked his campaign 1 34 trillion socialized health insurance overhaul sanders would ban private insurance and implement single payer government health care under his medicare for all proposal federal spending on health care would still increase by 10 percent of g d p or more than triple what the government spends on the military according to the new york times 2 mass bailout of student loan debt the senator would bail out student loan debt for 45 million americans totaling about 1 6 trillion according to his campaign website 3 making higher education tuition free as with many of his policy proposals sanders oversimplified justification for providing free college is countries in europe offer it for free why can t the united states unlike in europe however tuition is precisely what made the united states the top country in which to study and the reason students from all over the world flock to the united states for education additionally the costs of state run universities in europe have not ballooned to pay for the ever expanded services american universities now must offer to remain competitive luxurious gyms with lazy rivers behemoth athletic departments and gourmet dining halls in 2016 sanders opponent hillary clinton knocked his free tuition plan because it relied on state governors including republican governors who often cut spending to put in state money 4 implementing national rent control sanders campaign has pledged to spend 2 5 trillion to build 10 million government housing units he also wants the federal government to further invade every state s housing laws and local economy by enforcing a national rent control standard he proposes using the federal government to wage war against gentrification and zoning laws 5 instituting a moratorium on deportations sanders immigration plan includes ending deportations of illegal immigrants and offering citizenship to the 11 million illegal immigrants already living in the united states 6 effectively abolishing ice and cbp sanders wants to eliminate the federal agencies immigration and customs enforcement as well as customs and border protection that protect our country s sovereign borders and protect u s citizens from illegal immigrants who commit acts of violence and organized crime all over the united states 7 enacting a green new deal sanders is a supporter of rep alexandra ocasio cortez s d n y green new deal which calls for the banning of fossil fuel energy production such as oil and gas which is the lifeblood of american industry the initial version of the green new deal also called for banning cars meat and air travel while also promising to provide all americans education healthy food housing and government guaranteed jobs sanders has admitted his climate plan would be an expensive 16 3 trillion 8 approaching abortion as population control presidential candidate sen bernie sanders answered yes and spoke about abortion when asked at a cnn town hall event wednesday night if population control would play a part in his administration s policy for dealing with climate change realclearpolitics reported in september 9 admiration for dictators communists and bread lines sanders has long admired and praised tyrannical dictators such as cuba s fidel castro and the ussr s mikhail gorbachev in 1985 sanders visited managua to celebrate the anniversary of nicaragua s authoritarian marxist regime and often claimed that the real truth is not being told about the nicaraguan dictators in u s press last year footage of sanders from the 1980s surfaced in which he praised socialist countries such as the soviet union and claimed bread lines in communist countries are a good thing it s funny sometimes american journalists talk about how bad a country is because people are lining up for food that s a good thing he said in other countries people don t line up for food rich people get the food and poor people starve to death 10 banning hydraulic fracking which would cripple the economy sanders introduced a bill just last month that would ban the process of hydraulic fracking according to fox business the global energy institute an arm of the u s chamber of commerce published a report in 2016 claiming that the u s would lose 14 8 million jobs by 2022 if a fracking ban were instituted 11 issuing dozens of sweeping executive orders to implement major policies a campaign list of potential sanders executive orders obtained by the washington post includes unilaterally allowing the united states to import prescription drugs from canada directing the justice department to legalize marijuana and declaring climate change a national emergency while banning the exportation of crude oil other options cited in the document include canceling federal contracts for firms paying workers less than 15 an hour and reversing federal rules blocking u s funding to organizations that provide abortion counseling the post revealed the report further said sanders is considering lifting the cap on the number of refugees accepted into the united states and immediately halting border wall construction in addition to reinstating deferred action for childhood arrivals or daca 12 hiking taxes even on the middle class sanders was forced in june to admit the middle class would pay more in taxes to fund his health care overhaul brian riedl in city journal points out how sanders elaborate plans will require even more money than his tax plan would generate sanders s agenda is virtually impossible to pay for adding 97 5 trillion in new spending to an underlying 15 5 trillion projected budget deficit under current policies creates a ten year budget gap of 113 trillion yet sanders s tax proposals would raise at most 23 trillion over the decade 13 making taxpayers fund political campaigns the fec no longer acts like enforcement agency and needs to be replaced to effectively regulate campaign finance and to address the outsized influence large corporate donors have on candidates america must move to publicly fund federal elections in order to ensure a fair playing field free of the corrupting influence of large donors sanders says on his website the senator s platform also includes a new system of universal small dollar vouchers would give any voting age american the ability to donate to federal candidates and the federal election commission determin the appropriate threshold candidates must meet in order to qualify for public financing assuming it still exists 14 allowing convicted felons to vote asked in april whether boston marathon bomber dzhokhar tsarnaev should have the right to vote sanders replied yes even for terrible people because once you start chipping away and you say well that guy committed a terrible crime not going to let him vote well that person did that not going to let that person vote you re running down a slippery slope 15 eliminating the electoral college sanders came out in favor of abolishing the electoral college in july 16 legalize marijuana in the first 100 days with executive action according to his website a president sanders would legalize marijuana almost immediately not through legislative action with congress but using unilateral executive order he would also vacate and expunge all past marijuana related convictions 17 eliminating nuclear power sanders aims to phase out nuclear power 18 nationalizing the internet sanders has a 150 billion plan to make the internet into a public utility and radically change the internet as we know it his high speed internet for all plan would break up big internet service providers such as at t and comcast and force local governments to buildpublicly owned broadband networks high speed internet is now a basic human right according to sanders proposal 19 eliminate billionaires sanders was quick to adopt sen elizabeth warren s idea to impose a wealth tax on the richest americans but he was also quick to make it rake in even more money for his grand plans sanders wealth tax would affect more households and with a higher top rate than warren s plan when the new york times asked sanders if he thought billionaires should exist in the united states he said i hope the day comes when they don t he added it s not going to be tomorrow he also said he wanted to tell the wealthiest families in this country they cannot have so much wealth
more than 3 000 tongans including members of the pacific country s royal family attended the state funeral of prime minister akilisi pohiva in the capital nuku alofa last september another 2 000 attended a memorial service in auckland new zealand pohiva aged 78 died in auckland hospital after suffering pneumonia he had been in poor health for some time pohiva who had served as prime minister from 2014 was a significant figure in pacific politics for several decades a former school teacher he led tonga s so called pro democracy movement which aimed to establish a more representative parliament within the tiny kingdom s authoritarian feudal monarchy new zealand prime minister jacinda ardern said pohiva would be remembered for his lifelong commitment to championing democracy other tributes came from frank bainimarama fiji s prime minister and former military coup leader who praised pohiva s recognition of the urgency of climate action and the nz pseudo left group organise aotearoa which hailed him as a powerful progressive leader in fact pohiva s successive governments represented a privileged layer of business owners and the upper middle class and proved totally incapable of meeting both the democratic aspirations and basic social needs of the vast majority of the population which numbers 108 000 the indigenous tongan monarchy is said to date back 1 000 years the ruling family claims its heritage from king george tupou i who converted to christianity under the influence of wesleyan missionaries and united tonga s 170 islands in 1845 in 1900 a treaty of friendship with britain was signed which gave britain control of foreign affairs and kept out other predatory powers the treaty remained until 1970 when tonga became formally independent throughout its 175 year modern history the royal family supported by a layer of chiefly nobles and the churches has ruled tonga in a dictatorial manner maintaining a lavish lifestyle while overseeing the impoverished and disenfranchised population there was no reform under pohiva that made any positive difference to ordinary tongans today the monarchy remains firmly in charge despite constitutional changes in 2010 that made a majority of parliamentarians elected rather than appointed by the king and 33 chiefly nobles a feudal land system still sees land ownership allotted by the nobles to selected families and women barred from owning land since riots in 2006 decimated central nuku alofa followed by the 2008 global financial crisis the tongan economy has continuously deteriorated with entrenched poverty and social crisis including a methamphetamine epidemic and high levels of non communicable diseases three decades of pohiva s pro democracy movement confirms that the working class and rural poor both in tonga and across the pacific can achieve democratic rights and decent living standards only armed with a socialist program the pro democracy movement emerged in the mid 1980s supported by sections of the state bureaucracy and businesses as historian ian campbell noted demands for reform were modest the typical requests of a new elite for less hereditary privilege and a sharing of power pohiva and others concentrated on criticising corrupt practices like the sale of tongan passports to foreigners and wasteful spending on ministerial travel pohiva s role as a protest organiser saw him fired from the public service posturing as an opponent of the privileged elite he gained a popular following and was first elected into parliament in 1987 he told radio nz that year the existing system is very much like a dictatorship people have no voice in the present government and we need more representatives of the people however there were never proposals to abolish the monarchy and nobility feleti sevele a key figure in the pro democracy movement wrote in 1987 that to do so would be tantamount to stripping off some of the most fundamental and stabilising elements of tongan society reflecting the aspirations of the growing entrepreneurial class sevele called for a greater proportion of aid from new zealand and australia to be directed to the private sector including fruit exporters and light manufacturing rather than to government and quasi government agencies in 2005 after decades of stagnation and rising inequality the government was shaken by a public service strike over low wages which escalated into a demonstration by 10 000 people demanding democracy in response the monarchy promised reform and sevele was appointed the first non noble prime minister in 2006 after becoming a close friend of prince tupouto a later king george tupou v pohiva initially supported sevele but soon grew frustrated with the government s refusal to include him and other pro democracy leaders in decision making according to journalist kalafi moala pohiva formed alliances with people who used to be supporters of the royal family and government but had been embittered for one reason or another including former police minister clive edwards former superintendent of prisons semisi tapueluelu and businessman uliti uata the november 2006 riot which followed speeches delivered to a rally by pohiva and his right wing allies destroyed businesses owned by sevele and the royal family as well as chinese owned businesses which sections of the tongan petty bourgeoisie viewed as rivals australia and new zealand dispatched armed forces to restore order and protect business interests pohiva was charged with sedition over the riot but the charges were dropped in 2009 moving to defuse deepening opposition to the entire ruling set up sevele and king george v promised more democratic elections in 2010 for the first time the majority of the legislature 17 out of 26 seats would be elected by the people a move which was hailed internationally as a democratic transition the nobles however retained 9 seats while their privy council exercised extraordinary veto powers over legislation significantly new zealand and australia helped fund the reform process the two regional imperialist powers tonga s main source of foreign aid had supported the absolute monarchy for decades but became increasingly concerned about popular unrest canberra and wellington also demanded pro business measures including the withdrawal of the royal family from business ventures government spending cuts and the privatisation of assets after a term in opposition pohiva was finally elected prime minister by mps following the 2014 election in 2017 however king george vi showed the monarchy s entrenched power by dissolving parliament triggering a new election the nobles opposed the government s decision to ratify a united nations women s rights treaty changes to the education system and the dismissal of three cabinet ministers including one who was convicted of bribery pohiva benefited from ongoing disgust with the monarchy and was re elected in 2017 among the population however there was growing disenchantment in august 2016 moala the journalist who had been a media advisor to pohiva said the government was failing to live up to expectations in particular promises to reduce poverty while the royal family nobility and a small business elite has continued to live in luxury youth unemployment is estimated at 40 percent and most families rely on subsistence agriculture and remittances from family members working abroad manufacturing mainly small scale industry and handicrafts contributes only 3 percent of gdp tourism is the major source of hard currency the monarchy and nobles have either owned or had interests in telecommunications companies satellite services and energy generation and distribution wages remain extremely low a labourer earns just 20 97 pa anga per day about us9 00 in november 2018 the statistics department estimated that 23 percent of adults and 33 percent of children live in poverty the pohiva government continued attacks on freedom of speech which had previously been a central issue for the pro democracy movement pohiva had been imprisoned in 1997 for 26 days for leaking information about ministerial expenses to the taimi o tonga the newspaper tonga s major daily was briefly banned in 2003 and 2004 for criticising the government last august however pohiva himself threatened to block facebook as anger toward the monarchy erupted when his government abandoned further proposed constitutional reforms this followed the forced resignation or sacking of senior journalists at the tongan broadcasting commission in 2017 in apparent retaliation for criticism of pohiva s administration the government also tried to shut down atenisi university founded in 1975 by the late dr futa helu a supporter of the pro democracy movement to teach philosophy literature history and other courses the institute was long seen by the monarchy as a threat for its emphasis on secularism and critical thinking last year the government banned atenisi from recruiting students claiming it was not properly accredited following a legal battle in november 2019 a court lifted the ban finding that the government had no legal justification notwithstanding the pro democracy leaders quarrels with the monarchy and the nobles over the division of power and privileges they proved to be just as fearful and hostile toward the poor and working people and just as tied to imperialist powers pohiva displayed contempt for the poor telling parliament in june 2019 that the main cause of hardship in tonga includes slothfulness and dependent lifestyles tonga is increasingly caught up in global geo political tensions and rivalries canberra wellington and washington are all seeking to confront china s influence in the pacific including tonga incapable of pursuing an independent path pohiva s government turned to beijing for financial aid and joined beijing s international belt and road infrastructure initiative while at the same time maintaining ties with australia and new zealand which control much of the judicial system and carry out regular military exercises with tonga in december 2017 the international monetary fund increased tonga s debt distress rating from moderate to high risk citing its vulnerability to natural disasters and noting that upcoming loan repayments to china would reduce tonga s foreign exchange reserves double its debt servicing costs and could force the country to borrow yet more money the experience of pohiva s movement confirms the key tenets of leon trotsky s theory of permanent revolution including that in countries of belated capitalist development the bourgeoisie is incapable of carrying out a democratic revolution trotsky the leader alongside vladimir lenin of the russian revolution in 1917 explained that only a socialist and internationalist revolution led by the working class and supported by the peasantry can bring about genuine democracy the tongan working class and rural poor can achieve democratic rights and decent living standards only with a program to abolish the monarchy and the capitalist profit system and reorganise society along socialist lines new organisations must be built to fight for the complete political independence of the working class from all the parties and representatives of the ruling elite this requires a movement that is international in scope none of tonga s urgent problems can be resolved within tonga alone only through a unified struggle with workers throughout the pacific australia new zealand and other countries can the working class in tonga end neo colonial oppression and gain control over the productive capacity and resources it requires to answer its social needs and those of the rural poor the way forward in tonga and across the pacific is the establishment of sections of the international committee of the fourth international the world trotskyist party and publisher of the world socialist web

forward to answering any questions you have but before i do that i will turn the call over to john to provide some additional comments john john w pietrowicz chief financial officer thanks terry we made a lot of progress during 2019 as we integrated nex attracted new customers and created innovative solutions we delivered 4 9 billion in revenue and managed our expenses very carefully which ultimately drove 6 80 in adjusted eps these strong results led to an annual variable dividend of 2 50 per share and we recently announced our regular dividend of 0 85 per share a 13 increase from last year in the fourth quarter we faced tough comparables to a very strong q4 of 2018 despite the headwinds we continued to manage the business very well expenses were virtually flat with the previous quarter and we delivered 1 52 in adjusted eps one thing to note for the quarter as you know our business experiences mix shifts in product venue and membership class in december we experienced an unfavorable mix shift with a higher proportion of member trading and a lower proportion of privately negotiated trades in our rates business which reduced its rolling three month rpc for the month of december none the less the rates rpc was up sequentially for the quarter and up year over year moving to 2020 we will continue to execute on our strategy integrate the businesses and migrate customers from the legacy brokertec system to globex in terms of our guidance for this year i want to provide some background we started 2019 with initial adjusted expense guidance of 1 65 billion to 1 66 billion for the full year we were 13 million below the low end of that range at 1 637 billion for 2020 we currently expect full year adjusted operating expenses excluding license fees to be between 1 64 billion and 1 65 billion for capital expenditures excluding one time integration costs and net of leasehold improvement allowances we expect to be in the range of 180 million to 200 million by the end of 2019 we targeted 50 million in run rate expense synergies and at the end at year end we exceeded that target and achieved 58 million in run rate expense synergies plus another 6 million of subleasing revenue for a total of 64 million this is net of the additional costs that we are carrying to run infrastructures in parallel as we prepare for the migration to globex for brokertec and ebs at this time we expect to be at 110 million of annual run rate expense synergies by the end of 2020 in terms of our tax rate last year we guided to an effective tax rate of between 24 5 and 25 5 i mentioned in q3 that the new us tax legislation would have a positive impact going forward as a result we expect our 2020 adjusted effective tax rate to be between 23 and 24 please refer to the last page of our executive commentary for additional financial highlights and details with that short summary we d like to open up the call for your questions thank you questions and answers operator thank you and our first question today we ll hear from rich repetto with piper sandler rich repetto piper sandler analyst yeah good morning guys at first i just want to shout out to bryan durkin i know nearly 40 years in the exchange space sorry to see him go he was truly an exchange guy so with that i guess my question is john is around the cost and the synergies and could you tell us we ended up in what you actually realized in 2019 and then i m just trying to get a feel for what the underlying growth rate is ex the synergies that you ve got it looks like it s going to be just slightly up on a net basis but what how does the synergies impact what you ve realized so far what will you realize next year john w pietrowicz chief financial officer yeah great thanks thanks rich i appreciate the question so in terms of our realized expense synergies we realized about 35 million in 2019 in terms of synergies like i mentioned in the prepared remarks we exceeded our run rate synergy target we had originally targeted 50 million we hit 58 million in expenses plus an additional 6 million in leasehold or sublease revenue so about 64 million all in so really pleased with the performance in terms of the integration and synergy realization this is a total company effort and i think we did an excellent job so in terms of next year the way to think about it is if you take our expenses for this year excluding license fees of about 1 637 billion you add that in the realized synergies when you grow that expense base between 2 5 and 3 that s about the upward pressure that we get in our expenses then you back out the run rate synergies that we had which is about 58 million and then you back out what we think we re going to realize in 2020 and that s about 15 million in realized synergies in 2020 now it s less than what we achieved in from a realized perspective less than we achieved in 2019 and that s because as you know we are going to be migrating customers onto globex in the fourth quarter so that s really kind of the target for us and that gets you basically flat with this year about 1 640 billion to 1 650 billion so that s kind of the way to think about it we are going to accelerate the synergies in 2020 as much as we can we re very comfortable with our target of 110 million but if we can accelerate the synergies we will but the company is really focused on making sure that we have a good and seamless transition from the legacy brokertec platform to globex rich repetto piper sandler analyst thank you for that terrence a duffy chairman and chief executive officer and rich let me just thank let me just thank you for making the nice comments about all of our dear friend mr durkin who is here rich repetto piper sandler analyst thank you that helps a lot john thank you john w pietrowicz chief financial officer thanks rich terrence a duffy chairman and chief executive officer thanks rich operator and move on we ll move on to dan fannon with jefferies dan fannon jefferies analyst hi thanks good morning can you talk about the nex integration a little bit more and specifically the migration over to globex in 4q i think in the prepared statement you talked about some of the client forms you ve been holding maybe what you re hearing from clients and as we think about that migration what if any kind of uptick in volume might we might you anticipate terrence a duffy chairman and chief executive officer bryan bryan t durkin president sure thank you with respect to the integration i think i ve alluded to the last call that we complete our api releases which makes it possible for our customers to begin mock trading in the test environment we are pleased with the outreach to the clients to date in terms of their sign up for connectivity and for testing we ve had multiple forums both domestically and internationally with our client base to get them situated and ready for testing i think the rubber will really meet the road in the course of the next quarter in terms of the acceleration and making sure that we ve got the clients in actively testing throughout q2 we re excited about the capabilities and the functionality attributes moving over to globex the feedback that we continue to hear from the client base is very positive in terms of the switch over so that in conjunction with the talks that we re having with clients in prep for ebs as well the clients feel like we re doing a very methodical job in terms of our outreach in terms of the preparation and in terms of the planning and testing i think i ve mentioned in the past we have a fairly elaborate testing program in the context of ensuring that our clients have the ample time to acquaint themselves with the functionality in the platform switch over but many of our clients by the way are very familiar with globex dan fannon jefferies analyst great thank you terrence a duffy chairman and chief executive officer thanks dan bryan t durkin president thanks dan operator next move on to brian bedell with deutsche bank brian bedell deutsche bank analyst great thanks good morning folks terrence a duffy chairman and chief executive officer good morning brian brian bedell deutsche bank analyst good morning can you just talk about maybe some potential the potential for rpc to move up a little bit in 2020 here maybe if john you can talk about the impact of the adverse member mix shift in rates on fourth quarter and then any planned pricing changes across the futures product suite in 2020 and also for the market data in your last time i think you had a price increase on the monthly fees in 2018 sometimes you do that every other year so just thinking if there s anything planned for 2020 and then i also just squeeze in just the non us has been growing nicely any commentary on the potential impact from the shift outside the us in that mix shift john w pietrowicz chief financial officer okay brian that was quite a number of questions so i ll do my best to hit them all so first off let s talk about our rpc so in the month of november we talked a little bit about it i m sorry we talked a little bit about in my prepared remarks and so basically what happened in the month of december the rolling three months average for rates for the rpc was actually down compared to the rolling three months average in november so really to understand why it went down you really need to look at the activity that was occurring in december which rolls into the calculation and september which rolls out of the calculation so when you isolate those two months of activity in september we had a higher amount of member trading activity plus a higher proportion of privately negotiated trades and that really costs those are higher rpc trading so that caused the rpc to actually decline rolling three month november compared to rolling three month december and it s really a change in mix between september and december so that was what happened on the rate side in terms of 2020 and things that are impacting or could impact our rates a couple of things to point out number one if you take a look at our trading activity so far this year and i m very pleased with our volume being up 11 year to date and what s interesting when you look at the mix of trading we see energy up 20 we see ag is up 11 we see metals up 51 all of them in the commodities area which have a higher rpc than the financials we also see very good strong energy equity trading as well also when you take a look at how we re performing overseas emea is up 25 with all prior periods up double digits so far this year and then apac is up about 34 so very strong activity coming from international as you know international tends to have a higher rpc than us so when you look at the mix of commodity strong commodities performance and strong international performance that should help in terms of the rpc then you had a question around pricing in general we are always looking at our pricing schedules and we take a look at everything that hits impacts our rpc so we ll look at the face rate look at the market maker programs and we look at incentive plans and we do a very detailed product by product analysis we take into consideration the market environment the total cost trade and other factors and when we do and we do when we look at making any pricing adjustment we do it with an eye toward not impacting volume that s very critical in 2019 we didn t take any significant pricing actions in 2020 we did make some adjustments that impact the rpcs and assuming similar trading activities in 2019 the impact would be in the range of past adjustments in the range of about 1 5 to 2 of our futures and options transaction fees and majority of the changes begin at the start of february so that was in response to your question on the pricing and then our market data we ve made some pricing adjustments in non display data recently that went into effect and then i think that s kind of the major point on our market data so i think that addressed all your questions brian bedell deutsche bank analyst yes that s great just maybe what s the impact of the market data price increases from a revenue perspective john w pietrowicz chief financial officer we didn t provide we didn t provide that on the market data brian bedell deutsche bank analyst okay all right fair enough thank you so much john w pietrowicz chief financial officer thanks brian operator and next we ll move to mike carrier with bank of america mike carrier bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning and thanks for taking the question just in terms of the growth outlook you guys highlighted the strength in adv and we ve seen that coming from outside the us and then even the new products i think you guys mentioned that over the past decade contributing about 10 of adv today so i guess just on the international front it looks like some of the products are contributing 25 today and some are in the 40s maybe where do you see that opportunity ahead given either penetration potential or some of the initiatives that you have in place and similar unlike the new product launches can you provide some color or some context around maybe the pace of new launches or even the uptake that you re seeing over the past few years versus the past decade that drove that 10 contribution to adv today terrence a duffy chairman and chief executive officer mike it s terry duffy we re going to kind of go around the table a little bit here so i think there s a lot to that question a lot of us could touch on it but i m going to ask sean to touch a little bit as it relates to some of the launches that i referenced earlier one being obviously sofr is not a brand new launch but it s out there and it s growing so i think that is something that we can have a conversation about and then obviously it lifted the esg futures which are new so it s kind of hard to get a trajectory of how they re going to perform in such a early stage and but sean i will turn it to you on some of the new products and we can talk about the international growth sean tully senior managing director and global head of financial and otc products we re constantly focused on about adjusting our existing products in order to make them more attractive to participants especially related to alternative products and listing new innovative products addressing the needs in the marketplace so far we re very excited about where we are there we re currently running over 40 000 contracts a day we have the equivalent of more than 1 2 trillion worth of open interest obviously silver a large and important initiative in addition to the futures side that i just talked about we ve now cleared more than 54 billion worth of sofr interest rate swaps across 30 counterparties on future side we now have well over 350 different firms trading our silver futures so very excited about those developments but if you look at each and every asset class in the financials what we noted was in our report we said that we had more than 2 1 million adv last year from new products launched since 2010 we had 310 million in revenues this is across every asset class we are continuously innovating so if you get equities for example over the last few years we launched the btic basis trade at index close which has got a very high rpc and enjoying a very good growth and significantly adds to our revenues in addition to that we have the total return in futures we have the dividend futures and then obviously you know very well about the micro e mini maybe just a brief update on the micro e minis we are doing 647 000 contracts a day so far this year that s up 37 from last year in addition to that we did tell you last year when we started in terms of the rpc when we initially launched our product we typically have heavy incentives to make sure that there is very high liquidity on day one so that everyone always has a good experience from day one but we also promised you that we would be reducing those incentives over time so if you if the q3 rpc for example on those micro e minis it was 0 078 if you look at in q4 that was 0 114 so a very significant increase in that rpc while the product is growing very significantly if you look then at the rpc on that micro e minis there s more than 80 000 different what we call tag50s that are trading then so a huge number of clients we believe we penetrated tens of thousands of new clients in particular larger retail traders but the other thing i want to get to is is just the enormous growth in the product growth in the rpc sorry the last thing i want to say is a very high premium relative to the e minis so if you do the math as you ll recall the micros are one tenth the size of an e mini that means risk equivalent that s a 1 10 a contract though this too you can see we reported in our equity index is 0 65 a contract as our average rpc if you look then we mentioned in the prepared remarks fx link a new record day in january in addition to that the other big thing i would mention in foreign exchange in terms of innovations or adjusting the existing products of late last year we adjusted the minimum price increments this sounds technical but it s actually very important adjusted the minimum price increments in the quarterly rolls in dollar euro dollar yen and dollar sterling those december rolls were outstanding i think it s fair to say for each of those three products so in each and every case the roll volume was up tremendously the percentage of the open interest that was rolled was up tremendously and we saw a huge increase in interest from banks and from hedge funds we did announce earlier this year that we are now going to likewise be reducing the minimum pricing increments in dollar canada and aussie dollar in addition to that what impact does that have on our foreign exchange market foreign exchange market volatility is incredibly low if you look at the january volatility it is the lowest volatility going back to 1992 for the g7 currencies so incredibly low volatility nonetheless last year the number of large open interest holders in our foreign exchange business grew by 30 on january 28th we had a new all time record high in large open interest holders and foreign exchange so we believe these adjustments to our products even in this very low volatility environment is having a very positive impact so every asset class is seeing new innovation new product launches i keep mentioning them one last one i ll mention is we just launched in january also options on our sofr futures i could go on and on but hopefully that gives you enough color terrence a duffy chairman and chief executive officer yeah mike let me just talk real quick about asia and europe and i ll ask bryan to comment a little bit about the growth throughout europe because i think that was the second part of your question and i ll touch just a quick story about asia last night julie winkler who is my chief commercial officer held an offsite which she was scheduled to be with her entire team in asia but obviously that was not going to be the case so they held it here from chicago and we have over 200 salespeople today we have a significant amount of those in asia we i actually participated in her presentation because i happened to be walking by so i did participate throughout the first hour and it s quite fascinating to see the enthusiasm among the asian sales folks because of we are now able to leverage our brokertec next to a treasury platform we hear things that sales folks never had before that can hopefully increase the business throughout the region of asia we re having great growth through there so we referenced it in our earlier numbers and we re excited about the prospects of what the sales force can do by creating capital and operational efficiencies with their next transaction as they continue to sell those products throughout the region and i ll let bryan talk about europe bryan t durkin president it s been a journey you walked along with us over the last few years you heard what we ve done to build up to the ability to say that we have about 5 million of our volume now coming out of international you re well aware of the liquidity programs we put in place over the years to build up that activity during the regional time zone and i think that that story is just continuing to unfold in a very positive way based on the diversity of the product the asset classes that we represent our global sales force that is very dedicated and attuned to the very specific client segments that do business at our institution over the past five years we ve seen over 75 growth in our average daily volume internationally and what that breaks down to is about 4 million contract coming out of the emea region and around another million contract coming out of asia this is the first year that we were able to on an average daily volume for the year really meet and in some instances exceed that 1 million 1 million contract level you had mentioned that you had seen double digit growth occurring in various asset classes again it s the beauty of the diversity of our products so earlier quarters you were seeing tremendous growth in the international side in europe on the interest rate products this last quarter we saw a little bit of a slide in terms of interest rates in the european side of the equation but that was offset by strong growth in terms of our commodities particularly our gold futures our platinum futures our foreign currencies did well with respect to asia pacific we saw a bit of a downturn in our energy products but that was highly offset by performance in our interest rate quadrant in our equity so again it s the diversity of the products that we have it s our ability to penetrate these client segments you ve heard me talk about country planning which is a rather new phenomena that we ve introduced across our sales force and our international team over the course of the last two years we re covering over 70 i think at the top 10 countries that are providing the revenues on the international time zone where we have very very specific deliverables for our sales force and our business lines and our international teams and we track those accordingly john w pietrowicz chief financial officer yeah just one last point if we maintain this level of volume from international this will be the largest month in our history since 2012 since we started tracking it this will be our largest adv month in the month of february terrence a duffy chairman and chief executive officer hopefully that gave you a little color mike mike carrier bank of america merrill lynch analyst yeah thanks a lot terrence a duffy chairman and chief executive officer thank you john w pietrowicz chief financial officer thanks operator and next we ll move to alex blostein with goldman sachs sheriq sumar goldman sachs analyst hi this is sheriq filling in for alex can you talk about the transition to sofr and what sort of preparation have you made and how should we think about the implications on volumes and the pricing for this product terrence a duffy chairman and chief executive officer go ahead sean sean tully senior managing director and global head of financial and otc products sure we have been a member of the alternative reference rate committee now for several years and we were the leader in terms of introducing the sofr futures already mentioned earlier that we have about 1 2 trillion worth of open interest we do now have 40 000 contracts a day if you look recently in terms of our sofr futures we are running 78 of the global volume in sofr futures in terms of average daily volume and we re right at 94 of the open interest so that s a very solid growth in terms of those products we see this as additive to the rest of our products in terms of the fed funds futures and the eurodollar futures and as well as treasury futures obviously there is net of product that we expect to grow side by side with our existing products in addition to that i mentioned earlier on interest rate swap side we cleared 64 billion worth of interest rate swaps we have 30 participants now who cleared interest rate swaps with us and working very closely with the industry on developments i did mentioned also earlier that we did launch sofr options on our server futures in january other things going on this year later this year we will be working with the industry we will be changing the discounting on our interest rate swaps from fed funds over to sofr so i would say that there is a continuous increase in the adoption of sofr buyer clients and a very goodly now ecosystem in terms of trading the sofr futures as i said earlier it s actually i think more than 370 participants have been trading the product so i think it s a very healthy it s a very healthy product area and it s growing very nicely sheriq sumar goldman sachs analyst thank you and anything on the pricing side as to how that would impact long term john w pietrowicz chief financial officer on the pricing side resume in the beginning when we when we launched new products we want to ensure that they are extremely liquid so in the beginning we typically offer incentives in order to ensure that we have the liquidity and with sofr i ve said this on previous calls i think we re the natural home for the product so we offer the most efficient place to trade the french economy spreads between eurodollar futures and the sofr futures the fed funds futures and sofr futures in addition to that from a margin and capital perspective we offer offsets between the sofr futures eurodollar futures sofr futures treasury futures sofr futures versus fed fund futures so an extremely efficient place to trade in the beginning we do have incentives we do have incentives today and as i said we have 94 of the global open interest in the product over time i would expect us to reduce those incentives and i expect the pricing to look similar even at some point to our eurodollar futures but at the moment honestly there are some incentives sheriq sumar goldman sachs analyst okay thank you operator we ll move onto alex kramm with ubs alex kramm ubs analyst hey good morning everyone wanted to take some of the pricing questions that you ve got and then maybe take them over to the nex side can you talk about how you view pricing in those legacy business a little bit more one on the non transaction side but also on the transaction side i think there s still a lot of legacy contracts that are fairly fixed so do you think there will be opportunities as maybe some of that comes up as you maybe move to globex to maybe restructure some of that or are you pretty happy to kind of keep the volume there no matter what the and maybe not participate in the upside as maybe competition gets a little bit bigger in that space thank you john w pietrowicz chief financial officer hi alex this is john i ll start and sean can chime in you know you re correct when you look at the nex the legacy nex businesses brokertec in particular has a large number of bespoke agreements and they tend to very less with volume than our futures business when you look at ebs it s more akin to our futures business in terms of volume activity versus revenue realization so that s on the market side on the optimization business the non transaction optimization business is much more of a subscription based or monthly based fee for those services obviously on the transaction side of the optimization businesses that varies a bit with the amount of activity that s performed so for example this quarter we saw a sequential increase in the amount of revenue generated from the transaction business of the optimization on our companies that we own it was actually up about 4 million sequentially that was primarily because there was more activity at trireduce in terms of our we haven t announced any long term plans around pricing we re very focused on the transition from the legacy nex platforms on to globex but as we always do we re always looking at our pricing and we want to make sure that we re very got a very compelling offering that we ve got a very compelling platform for our customers to use sean tully senior managing director and global head of financial and otc products yeah i think i think underlying what john said this is sean our primary focus now is transitioning the businesses on to globex so both brokertec this year and ebs next year on to globex and secondly making sure that we have single most attractive platform for anyone to trade in terms of our products so creating new between the cash and the futures markets that have existed before because we have both as a product so we are really focusing on the transition on to globex one two making sure we have the single most attractive products possible three creating new efficiencies that the marketplace has never seen before and four cross selling so the cross selling is the thing that we ve already we have already heavily into in terms of that cross selling maybe just a couple of points in particular we started out we started tracking what we call cross referrals and cross introductions between the cash and futures businesses and to date we are now tracking more than 400 cross introductions where we are having the cash markets salespeople introduce clients to our futures folks as well as our futures sales team introducing clients over into the cash markets businesses the large portion of those are as we had expected and as we talked about when we launched the transaction and the highest portion is coming from foreign exchange customers in the cash markets as always the futures markets looking at the cross sell opportunity particularly in europe the number two category is in interest rates so we re really very focused on the client experience alex kramm ubs analyst very helpful thank you operator and we ll move on to chris harris with wells fargo chris harris wells fargo analyst thanks hi guys terrence a duffy chairman and chief executive officer hi chris chris harris wells fargo analyst with the news out there regarding prices interest in ebay can you give us an update on your thoughts regarding m a and specifically hoping you could address whether you consider somewhat out of the box transactions terrence a duffy chairman and chief executive officer well we won t comment on what was just talked about wit intercontinental as far as our m a strategy chris as you ve seen we re very deliberate and diligent in how we approach it and we try to be obviously opportunistic if something arises that we think is right for good value of the shareholders again increase the value for the clients so we have a long history and i m not going to go through all the history of what our integration or our transactions have been we re focused on the nex integration we have two years left on that integration process to get both brokertec and ebs on the platform it s a big part of what we re trying to accomplish so that s our strategy for now and obviously we always look at things but at the same time we are focused laser focused as i ve said before and complete the integration of this transaction chris harris wells fargo analyst okay got it operator and next we ll move to kyle voigt with kbw kyle voigt kbw analyst hi good morning maybe a couple of questions on market data it looks like the nex market data revenues were down 5 million sequentially anything to call out there that drove the decline i suppose that implies there was some good sequential growth in cme s core data revenue just what drove that without the pricing move and then maybe if you can just give an update on the derived data initiative and the kind of sales progress there john w pietrowicz chief financial officer all right hi kyle this is john when you take a look at our market data line from a revenue perspective it was actually up about 500 000 sequentially from q3 to q4 and really when you peel it back our market data performed very well in the fourth quarter in q3 we had 1 1 million more in audit findings and as you know those audit findings can vary quarter to quarter depending on as those audit findings get realized so really if you strip out the audit findings our market data is actually up 1 5 million and that s really a function of two things one we had a pricing change that we discussed in our non display data it also we ve seen a stabilization on the attrition which has been helpful so the core market data excluding audits is up about 1 5 million and from a nex perspective the market data is relatively flat q3 to q4 bryan you want to talk a little bit about them bryan t durkin president i mean you covered the pricing but on the derive side of it we continue to be very pleased with the demand from the client base in terms of having access to our products for them to be able to build structured products based on our data that business continues to grow and evolve and the interest in the demand is coming from a variety of different client sectors what i m most pleased about is our engagement with the consumers of this data whether it be our core customers customers being the consumers of the data for trading so you got to think about this outside the box of subscribers the traditional subscribers but those looking at it from the perspective of using data to complement both their trading development of products that they can sell in house as well as demand for historical data that they used for a variety of reasons and so we ve really been trying to more deeply engage with the client base the audits quite honestly that we started almost a couple of i think it was couple of years back in earnest has really allowed us to capture a much deeper insight into how the variety of client segments utilize our data that s brought us much closer to the client base itself and the consumers the other thing that we look very closely at is the distributors of the data so really drawing a much closer alliance in relationships with the vendors and how we go about pricing that information for them to be able to redistribute our data so we re very excited about the foundation and the programs that we put in place over the last couple of years to help us really grow each of these variety of data offering when you look at nex as you can appreciate we have to get into this more deeply this past year in terms of looking at the maybe the esoteric nature of how that data is utilized by ebs as well as brokertec and so we have a number of plans on the horizon working closely with sean and his team in terms of how we can better structure and package that information for consumption kyle voigt kbw analyst thanks and john i apologize the 5 million sequential decline looking at was actually for the nex other revenue could you just help just provide any clarity on that i m sorry john w pietrowicz chief financial officer no worries no worries kyle yeah so really the primary driver of the 5 million reduction in the other revenue is as we call in the third quarter we announced that we had completed the sale of the enso business so the majority of the 5 million decline was related to that sale kyle voigt kbw analyst got it thank you john w pietrowicz chief financial officer all right no problem operator and we ll move on to owen lau with oppenheimer owen lau oppenheimer analyst good morning and thank you for taking my questions so i want to touch on the commodities and metals a little bit up so the adv and open interest of commodities and metals were up quite nicely year over year at the end of january could you please talk about some of the drivers of the strength there so are you taking shares from other exchanges internationally is that continued migration from cash to derivatives or is it mainly driven by like volatility events like coronavirus how should we think about the contribution of each driver and the sustainability of the strength for the rest of this year thank you terrence a duffy chairman and chief executive officer thanks i ll give that to derek derek sammann senior managing director and global head of commodities options products excellent yeah it s been a it s a good run it s actually there are three different businesses that some are operating in conjunction with other some are actually quite correlated when you look at the impact of coronavirus african swine fever and the phase 1 trade deal that we ve seen unleashing as bryan had mentioned we ve seen particular strength in the commodities businesses all three of these most especially our metals business out of europe and asia i think that s a business that over the last four or five years not only have we positioned our comex gold and silver contracts as the global benchmarks we are seeing that as more business shifts out of the bilateral swaps market primarily the london physical market the bullion market into all markets we actually regressed our volumes back 20 years and if you go back over 20 years ago comex represented 10 of the total physical and cash combined business as futures and cash fast forward to today and comex now represents 50 larger volumes than what we ve seen in lbma business so we re seeing that bullion market adopt very much of the capital and operational efficiencies of comex gold so we ve gone from one tenth of that physical market to 50 bigger than that cash market so the significant growth in uptake is largely driven by us and actually asian and european customers we see that on the competitive numbers we see that in global numbers but does this refer to so far this year we re up 50 we see that our asian business and metals is up 56 it s up 58 as well in apac so to the extent that business continues to grow that is both metal and particularly gold as a preferred commodity in on certain markets in which we operate and i think better positioning the futures market is the best solution and product for delivery of that market flipping over to our energy business i think it was referenced earlier in the call terry talked about the strong growth we ve seen so far this year in our energy business globally energy business is up 20 and we re seeing that actually up significantly in europe as well and what we re seeing there is after a year of basically a 10 trade in engine oil and natural gas sitting at around 2 5 we ve seen significant impact to concerns of global growth in two ways in which the market expressed the view on concerns of global growth is effectively the price of oil so we ve seen that downdraft has actually taken place we saw wti go from 62 to 52 in the span of two weeks on growth concerns we ve seen our business so far this year absolutely take off so not surprising to see that the preference for global crude trading taking the place in the form of wti it s a global crude oil market story that we ve been talking about for the last three years and we see that play very much intact and i d say even more strongly in natural gas our business in natural gas is up 40 so far this year and our market share has gone to an all time record 84 of natural gas futures henry hub in the us so again when you re seeing markets break out the low levels driven by growth rate concerns globally there s an article that just came out 20 minutes ago on global growth concerns putting downward pressure on energy prices the market is coming to cme to use our energy prices to manage that risk lastly on the ag side this is a business that s close to a 0 5 billion business to the firm this is a market where we saw record dairy and livestock volumes last year so as we saw concerns about african swine flu in asia the concerns are common occurrence we saw that risk being managed here at cme group most particularly with the phase 1 trade agreement now announced we ve seen a resumption of our volume went a little bit sideways in grains and oilseeds last year we re seeing our ag business up so far 11 this year and most notably when you see where that growth is taking place we re seeing the business so far up 33 in europe and up 51 in asia so again when the market experiences volatility uncertainty and breakout ranges you re seeing the market continue to adopt cme group global benchmarks and we re seeing that not just for us time zone but the point bryan was making and terry referenced earlier an outsized proportion of new client acquisition in europe and asia owen lau oppenheimer analyst that s helpful thank you terrence a duffy chairman and chief executive officer thank you john w pietrowicz chief financial officer thanks lau operator and next move to ari ghosh with credit suisse ari ghosh credit suisse analyst hey good morning everyone and apologies if you ve already hit on this but just wanted to touch on a couple of items that could be incremental to volumes looking forward so first just hoping if you could give us an update on conversations you re having with clients around navigating umr and potential cost saves from your fx suite and then just moving on to bitcoin you continue to see solid volumes and new account growth around bitcoin as well so just curious how the institutional ecosystem here is evolving around bitcoin and your competitive positioning in this emerging asset class as well thank you very much terrence a duffy chairman and chief executive officer thank you sean sean tully senior managing director and global head of financial and otc products yeah so in terms of the uncleared margin rules that s something we ve been very focused on now for a number of years and that will continue to be a tailwind for us in the next couple of years with the extension of the dates by regulators related to compliance so we do expect that september of this year another very large portion of clients will be forced into those uncleared marginal relative to that we do see an opportunity to offer clients listed fx options in particular but also use our fx futures as alternatives to forwards we added as you ll recall couple of years ago now monthly futures in addition to our quarterly futures in order to help facilitate that as well as fx link in order to make that transition from the otc market over the futures market to listed market much easier as you re rightly pointing out something that we point out we pointed out for years now right is that if you are affected by the uncleared margin rules you have a 10 day margin period of risk if you move to an otc product and we do now clear both non deliverable forwards as well as cash settled forwards those are g7 currencies so we are clearing fx forwards cash settled fx forwards in the otc market as well so uncleared 10 day margin period of risk cleared otc five day margin period of risk it s actually now cleared about 69 billion worth of ndf and csf in our otc fx business relatively small but increasing but the most efficient place is in futures and listed options which include one day margin period of risk so we do see that to be a continuing tailwind in addition to that our optimization services are very focused on having a holistic solution that no other marketplace can offer in terms of optimization of portfolios as well so in terms of umr we can see continued benefit there and i think you had a second question bitcoin ari ghosh credit suisse analyst bitcoin sean tully senior managing director and global head of financial and otc products it continues to operate well we re doing around

patrick o shaughnessy with raymond james david farnum raymond james analyst hey guys it s actually david farnum on for patrick i was wondering for the international business i was wondering if you could dig into the drivers of your growth across the various regions so can you speak to your sales headcount ramp over the last few years where are we kind of right now across the various regions where was it say five years ago and as we look forward would you anticipate further head count growth to continue to capitalize on the international opportunity or do you feel like you re at the correct point right now terrence a duffy chairman and chief executive officer good morning david it s terry duffy right now our head count in sales has gone up close to 200 of the cme workforce today and it s spread throughout the world fairly evenly obviously the big part of it is here in the us but in europe and asia as well and other parts listen if in fact the business is growing and i continue to see the benefits which i have seen by increasing the sales force over the last several years and i remember about 7 to 10 years ago that number was probably about 10 to 15 people on sales and now we re sitting at 200 and you can look at the chart up into the right at the growth of the business and you can correlate that the new account acquisitions that julie winkler and our team have been doing along with the sales folks and as long as we can continue to offer a solution that s more cost benefit to the participant we re going to continue to add our sales folks to do so it s one of those things you don t want to have the company full of sales people but if they are continuing to deliver value i have no problem increasing the size of that staff as long as the business is reflective of what they re producing david farnum raymond james analyst right very helpful thanks terrence a duffy chairman and chief executive officer thank you john w pietrowicz chief financial officer thanks operator and that will conclude today s question and answer session i would now like to turn the call back over to the management for any additional or closing remarks terrence a duffy

stock market 2020 â a close look at what to expect quite a bit has changed in the global markets and future expectations over the past 4 weeks q4 2019 ended with a bang us china trade deal us signing the usmca continental free trade agreement brexit and now the wuhan virus on top of all of that we ve learned that germany and japan have entered a technical recession as q4 2019 earnings continue to push the us stock market higher what should traders expect going forward in 2020 volatility sector rotation and continued us stock market strength our researchers have been pouring over our charts and predictive modeling tools to attempt to identify any signs of weakness or major price rotation there are early warning signs that the us stock market may be setting up for a moderate downside price rotation within the first 6 months of 2020 but we believe the continued capital shift that has been taking place over the past 24 months will continue to drive foreign investment into the us and north american stock markets for quite a while in 2020 and 2021 the interesting component to all of this which should keep investor s attention and really get them excited is the chance that some type of foreign market disruption may take place in 2020 and 2021 there are a number of things that could potentially disrupt foreign market expectations first on the list is this virus event in china that seems to be spreading rapidly second would be the news that japan and germany have entered a recession further down the list is the very real possibility that many asian and foreign nations could see a dramatic decrease in gdp and economic activity throughout much of 2020 and 2021 it is far too early to make any real predictions but traders need to be aware of the longer term consequences of global markets entering a contraction phase related to a confluence of events that prompts central bank intervention while consumers financial sectors and manufacturing and industrial sectors are pummeled imagine what the global markets would look like if 25 to 55 of asia europe and africa see a dramatic decrease in economic output gdp and financial sector activities on top of the potential for massive loan defaults it may spark another credit crisis event this time throughout the emerging and foreign markets a massive surge in us stock market valuation has taken place since the start of 2020 it is very likely that foreign capital poured into the us stock market expecting continued price advancement and very strong earnings from q4 2019 this valuation appreciation really started to take place in early 2019 and continued throughout the past 14 months we believe this valuation appreciation is foreign capital dumping into the us markets to chasing the strong us economic expectations we believe this surge into the us stock markets will continue until something changes future expectations the us presidential election cycle would usually be enough to cause some sideways trading in the us stock market maybe not this time the fact that japan and germany as well as china very soon have entered an economic recession would usually be enough to cause some sideways price rotation in the us stock market maybe not this time the potential wide spread economic contraction related to the wuhan virus would normally be enough to cause some contraction or sideways trading in the us stock market maybe not this time there is still a risk that price could revert to middle or lower price channel levels at any time in the future we ve highlighted these levels on the charts below yet we have to caution traders that the foreign markets may be setting up for one of the largest capital shift events in recent history if any of these contagion events roil the foreign markets while the us economic activity and data continue to perform well then we could be setting up for a massive shift away from risky foreign markets emerging markets and watch global capital pour into safe havens metals miners and pour into the us stock market us canada mexico we ve authored numerous articles about how the foreign markets gorged themselves on debt after 2009 while easy money policies allowed them to borrow us dollars very cheaply we ve highlighted how this debt is now hanging over these corporations manufacturers and investors heads as a liability the recent repo market activity suggests liquidity risks already exist in the global markets if these liquidity issues extend further we could see a much broader market rotation within the us and foreign markets dow jones industrial average quarterly chart currently the us stock market appears to be near the upper range of a defined price channel near these levels it is not uncommon to see some downside price rotation to set up a new price advance within the price channels this indu chart highlights the extended price channel trend originating from 2008 and the more recent price channel yellow originating from 2015 any breakdown of these channels could prompt a much broader downside price move s p 500 quarterly chart this spy chart highlights the extended upside price trend in the us stock markets the spy has recently breached the upper price channel level it may be setting up a new faster price channel yet we believe this rally in early q1 2020 is more of a reaction to the very strong 2019 us economic data and the continued capital shift pouring capital into the us markets a correction from these levels to near 275 would not be out of the question transportation sector quarterly chart this transportation index tran chart presents a very clear price channel and shows a moderate weakness recently in this sector the fact that the tran has consolidated into a middle range of the price channel while the other us stock market indexes continue to push higher suggests the valuation advance in the us stock market is mostly capital chasing strength of the us economy than a true economic expansion event 2020 will likely continue to see more volatility more price rotation more us stock market strength and further risks of a reversion event we believe forward guidance for q1 and q2 will be revised lower as a result of these new global economic conditions originating from asia europe and japan if the virus event spreads into africa and the middle east think belt road then we could see a much broader correction event in the meantime prepare for weaker future earnings related to the shut down of industry and consumer sectors throughout much of asia if this shut down type of quarantining process extends throughout other areas of the world then we need to start to expect a much broader economic contraction event minor events can be absorbed by the broader markets major events where global economies contract for many months or quarters can present a very dangerous event for investors overall we may see another 20 to 40 days of sliding higher in the us stock market before we see any real risks become present for investors this means you should start preparing for any potential unknowns right now plan accordingly as this event will likely result in a sudden and potentially violent change in price trend join my swing trading etf wealth building newsletter if you like what you read here and ride my coattails as i navigate these financial markets and build

measures we believe that net income and net income attributable to common stockholders nics as defined by u s generally accepted accounting principles u s gaap are the most appropriate earnings measurements however we consider funds from operations ffo normalized ffo revpor same store revpor ss revpor net operating income noi and same store noi ssnoi to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance these supplemental measures are disclosed on our pro rata ownership basis pro rata amounts are derived by reducing consolidated amounts for minority partners noncontrolling ownership interests and adding our minority ownership share of unconsolidated amounts we do not control unconsolidated investments while we consider pro rata disclosures useful they may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our joint venture arrangements and should be used with caution historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with u s gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation however since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient in response the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of operating performance for reits that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income ffo attributable to common stockholders as defined by nareit means net income attributable to common stockholders computed in accordance with u s gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate and impairments of depreciable assets plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests normalized ffo attributable to common stockholders represents ffo attributable to common stockholders adjusted for certain items detailed in exhibit 2 we believe that normalized ffo attributable to common stockholders is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance because investors and equity analysts may use this measure to compare the operating performance of the company between periods or as compared to other reits or other companies on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by unanticipated and or incalculable items we define noi as total revenues including tenant reimbursements less property operating expenses property operating expenses represent costs associated with managing maintaining and servicing tenants for our properties these expenses include but are not limited to property related payroll and benefits property management fees paid to operators marketing housekeeping food service maintenance utilities property taxes and insurance general and administrative expenses represent costs unrelated to property operations or transaction costs these expenses include but are not limited to payroll and benefits professional services office expenses and depreciation of corporate fixed assets ssnoi is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties using a consistent population which controls for changes in the composition of our portfolio as used herein same store is generally defined as those revenue generating properties in the portfolio for the relevant year over year reporting periods land parcels loans and sub leases as well as any properties acquired developed redeveloped including major refurbishments where 20 or more of units are simultaneously taken out of commission for 30 days or more sold or classified as held for sale during that period are excluded from the same store amounts properties undergoing operator transitions and or segment transitions except seniors housing triple net to seniors housing operating with the same operator are also excluded from the same store amounts normalizers include adjustments that in management s opinion are appropriate in considering ssnoi a supplemental non gaap performance measure none of these adjustments which may increase or decrease ssnoi are reflected in our financial statements prepared in accordance with u s gaap significant normalizers defined as any that individually exceeds 0 50 of ssnoi growth per property type are separately disclosed and explained we believe noi and ssnoi provide investors relevant and useful information because they measure the operating performance of our properties at the property level on an unleveraged basis we use noi and ssnoi to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess the property level performance of our properties no reconciliation of the forecasted range for ssnoi on a combined basis or by property type is included in this release because we are unable to quantify certain amounts that would be required to be included in the comparable gaap financial measure without unreasonable efforts and we believe such reconciliation would imply a degree of precision that could be confusing or misleading to investors revpor represents the average revenues generated per occupied room per month at our seniors housing operating properties it is calculated as our pro rata version of total resident fees and services revenues from the income statement divided by average monthly occupied room days ss revpor is used to evaluate the revpor performance of our properties under a consistent population which eliminates changes in the composition of our portfolio it is based on the same pool of properties used for ssnoi and includes any revenue normalizations used for ssnoi we use revpor and ss revpor to evaluate the revenue generating capacity and profit potential of our seniors housing operating portfolio independent of fluctuating occupancy rates they are also used in comparison against industry and competitor statistics if known to evaluate the quality of our seniors housing operating portfolio our supplemental reporting measures and similarly entitled financial measures are widely used by investors equity and debt analysts and ratings agencies in the valuation comparison rating and investment recommendations of companies our management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to historical operating results and in making operating decisions additionally they are utilized by the board of directors to evaluate management the supplemental reporting measures do not represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with u s gaap and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity finally the supplemental reporting measures as defined by us may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies please see the exhibits for reconciliations of supplemental reporting measures and the supplemental information package for the quarter ended december 31 2019 which is available on the

statement its noted soft momentum has continued in 2020 but growth is expected to accelerate over the second half of 2020 driven by monetary and fiscal stimulus and the high terms of trade impact of

us warns of supply chain disruption according to china s national health commission on february 11 there were 2015 new confirmed coronavirus cases bringing the accumulated total to 44653 death tolls increased 97 to 1113 there are currently 8204 serious cases 16067 suspected cases and 451462 people tracked us white house national security adviser robert o brien warned there s no doubt that the virus could have an impact on the us economy and also on the world economy the coronavirus could have disruptive impact on the global supply chain and we ll have to wait and see how it plays out and whether alternate suppliers can be found o brien also noted we expect the phase 1 deal will allow china to import more food and open those markets to american farmers but certainly as we watch this coronavirus outbreak unfold in china it could have an impact on how big at least in this current year the purchases are imf coronavirus poses large downsides risks for countries with close ties with china imf director of asia and pacific changyong rhee said that if coronavirus slows the chinese economy the government has policy room for stimulus nevertheless he insisted that china should continue with structural reform and credit control he added that we don t want to deny this event definitely increases the downside risk especially the downside risk will be large for countries which have close ties with china at this moment i think a major channel that has an impact in asia is tourism in china cai fang the vice head of the chinese academy of social sciences cass said although the temporary impact caused by the epidemic will slightly reduce the growth rate and other development indicators it will not delay the fulfillment of the goal of building a moderately prosperous society he added that the government should use policy tools in a timely and flexible way and adopt unconventional policy tools to support the economy fed powell current low interest rate means fiscal policy needed if economy weakens in the semiannual monetary policy report to the congress fed chair jerome powell warned that while some of the uncertainties around trade have diminished recently but risks to the outlook remain in particular fed is closely monitoring the emergence of the coronavirus which could lead to disruptions in china that spill over to the rest of the global economy but for now he said the current stance of monetary policy will likely remain appropriate if incoming information about the economic remains broadly consistent with fomc s outlook he also reiterated that if developments emerge that cause a material reassessment of our outlook we would respond accordingly powell also pointed out that the current low interest rate environment means it would be important for fiscal policy to help support the economy if it weakens he added putting the federal budget on a sustainable path when the economy is strong would help ensure that policymakers have the space to use fiscal policy to assist in stabilizing the economy during a downturn a more sustainable federal budget could also support the economy s growth over the long term elsewhere japan m2 rose 2 8 yoy in

officer thank you dan and good morning everyone thank you for joining us for our 2019 fourth quarter earnings call i m going to start on slide 5 on almost all accounts we had a very good 2019 exelon utilities and generation remain focused on delivering for our customers and their communities comed had its best performance ever the nuclear fleet had its best capacity factor and we delivered financially as you can read the full year gaap earnings were 3 01 per share and the non gaap earnings were 3 22 per share above our revised guidance range and midpoint of our original guidance range joe will walk you through the financial details later in the call i want to address the operational details as we go forward last year exelon utilities invested 5 5 billion in capital and 150 million which is 150 million more than originally planned these investments were primarily in infrastructure and technology to provide a premier customer experience improve reliability and resiliency modernization of our gas system resulting in the best ever customer satisfaction at each of our utilities we had a productive year on the regulatory front pepco dc filed its first multi year rate case and maryland s psc is moving forward with a multi year rate plans we ve received a constructive settlement at bge and at ace peco s transmission formula was approved by ferc and comed s formula rate provided the third rate decrease in five years helping to keep the average residential customer bill flat from where it was a decade ago excuse me on the policy front the united states supreme court upheld the illinois and new york zec programs new york state supreme court affirmed the zec program and the new jersey and new jersey implemented their zec program in the spring governor wolf in pennsylvania announced plans for pennsylvania to join rggi and the pennsylvania state senate passed legislation setting a goal for electric vehicles and deployment ferc approved pjm s fast start reforms pjm filed its proposal to reform the reserve market and scarcity rules we made our commitment to grow the dividend by 5 annually through 2020 with the board raising the annual dividend to 1 53 per share in january we re good partners also with the communities we serve our employees volunteered a record breaking 251 000 hours in 2019 that s 11 000 more than in 2018 during national volunteer week we sponsored 452 events in 16 states and 128 cities with 5 400 employees which is another record in addition exelon donated nearly 52 million to charities and organizations throughout our footprint we are committed to providing a diverse and inclusive environment for our nearly 33 000 employees we are once again named best company for diversity by forbes diversityinc and the human rights campaign our total diversity supplier spend exceeded 2 billion for the third straight year accounting for 27 of our overall supplier spend exelon companies continue to prioritize partnerships with local based diverse businesses by offering development programs we also continued to be recognized for our environmental stewardship and were named to the dow jones sustainability index for the 14th year in a row we are focused on operating at world class levels delivering on our strategy in supporting clean energy policies in their state the hard work and the commitment of our employees to provide safe reliable power and natural gas to our customers led way to the greatest performance we ve had in 2019 we delivered on our commitments to you our shareholders but also our employees and our customers and our communities however this year was not last year was not without challenges including subpoenas we received from the us attorney s office in northern illinois as we said before we are limited in what we can share about the investigation however i want to reiterate that we are fully cooperating with the us attorney s office and taking the situation very seriously the board appointed a special committee to provide oversight of the investigation led by outside counsels to determine if any changes are needed to ensure that going forward we operate at the highest possible standards at the end of the our commitments for 2020 turning to slide 6 we re committed to operating our utilities at the highest levels for our customers since 2016 we have deployed nearly 22 billion across the utilities and plan to invest 26 billion over the next four years these investments enhance reliability resiliency and modernize our electric and gas systems we ve been able to make these needed improvements while keeping the boards the bills affordable the rates in all our major cities baltimore chicago philadelphia washington are 13 to 18 below the average of for the large largest us cities and 2 to 7 below the national average these investments are producing tangible benefits for our customers customer satisfaction is at the highest level it s ever been at each one of our utilities reflecting a strong system performance that has come from our investments frequency of outages has decreased significantly down near 50 at comed and 30 at phi outage duration has also decreased by 52 and 38 at comed and bge respectively 2019 was the best reliability performance for comed and the second best for bge on the gas side peco and bge have replaced more than 200 miles of cast iron and bare steel mains and nearly 30 000 metallic gas services in 2018 these investments will help our customers current and future needs while reducing gas leaks and greenhouse gas emissions moving to slide 7 our states are focused on ensuring the electric and the gas systems are ready to meet the changing customer needs more reliable and more resilient and are prepared for renewables in electric vehicles and are ready to meet the challenges of climate change we are working with each state to get the right mechanisms in place to be able to make these needed investments our states are providing support through a range of regulatory tools including alternate rate making such as formula rates and multi year rate plans as well as tracker mechanisms for reliability and gas infrastructure programs turning to slide 8 ferc s recent order on pjm capacity the governors in illinois maryland and jersey are firmly committed to having their electricity to be supplied by a 100 clean these states are leading the way to a clean energy economy and we share that goal and we ll work with them to achieve it unfortunately there is a clear conflict between clean energy goals of our states and our customers on one side and the resource decisions being made by pjm and ferc on the other unless states take action to protect their clean energy programs ferc s december order on the pjm minimum offer price rule or mopr will result in clean resources supported by the states being pushed out of the capacity market only to be replaced by carbon based generation this would result in billions of dollars of additional cost for customers and threaten the progress being made in retaining and expanding our clean energy our states as well as many others oppose ferc s mopr decision and are evaluating what actions may be necessary in response we are working with policymakers and stakeholders to protect the clean energy programs from the negative impact of ferc s mopr decision and enable the transition to a 100 clean on slide 9 we show our operating performance for the year each utility continues to have outstanding customer operations all achieve first quartile in performance and service level and abandon rate and i mentioned we had our best ever scores on customer satisfaction index with bge comed and peco achieving top decile and phi s performance significantly improved in the last three years missing first quartile by 0 01 points reliability performance was mix this year due to a very active minor storm season throughout the mid atlantic for instance phi had 32 minor storms for 2019 compared to eight in 2018 minor storms are not excluded from these calculations however comed achieved top quartile in both outage frequency and duration and bge achieved top quartile on outage duration turning to generation on slide 10 our fleet generation fleet performed one of its best years ever very good in 2019 providing a significant portion of the country s clean energy exelon generates 12 or one out of every nine clean megawatts in the united states our best in class nuclear fleet operated very well last year our capacity factor was 95 7 our highest ever we generated 155 million megawatt hours avoiding 81 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emission in 2019 our average refueling outage duration was 21 days matching the record set in 2018 and 18 14 days better than the industry average exelon powers gas and hydro dispatch match 97 9 and wind and energy capture at 96 3 were better than plan our constellation business remains the industry leader a vast majority of our retail business is with c i customers where we have the largest retail platform with 25 market share delivering 154 terawatt hours of electricity and 67 terawatt hours more than our nearest competitor our retail operating metrics remain strong 79 customer renewal rates average customer duration of more than six years and power contracts terms of 23 months on average we continue to see stable unit margins with our power customers our focus is on cost and helping support operating margins constellation s strength lies in its durable relationship with our customers we work with our customers to provide them solutions to meet their energy needs while also reaching their environmental and sustainability goals we provide our customers with much more than just a commodity and i will turn the call over to joe to review the financials joseph nigro senior executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you chris and good morning everyone today i will cover our 2019 results annual updates to our financial disclosures and 2020 guidance starting with slide 11 we had another strong year for the fourth quarter we earned 0 79 per share on a gaap basis and 0 83 per share on a non gaap basis for the full year we earned 3 01 per share on a gaap basis and 3 22 per share on a non gaap basis which is above our revised full guidance full year guidance of 3 05 to 3 20 per share and 0 07 per share above our original midpoint exelon utilities delivered a combined 1 91 per share net of holding company expenses utility earnings were higher relative to original guidance due to favorable o m including lack of major storm and favorable weather at peco and bge as well as higher distribution revenues at bge these were partially offset by the impact of lower treasury rates on comed s roe exgen earned 1 31 per share exceeding its guidance range of 1 20 to 1 30 per share exgen s outperformance was primarily due to favorable o m including incremental nuclear insurance distributions and recognition in the fourth quarter of the research and development or r d tax benefit for the years 2010 through 2018 tax years we are expected to record this benefit but it was more favorable than we had planned this favorability was offset by the unplanned outages at salem hamley station and a contracted asset during the year overall we delivered well on our financial commitments moving to slide 12 the consolidated phi utilities earned a 9 2 roe for the trailing 12 months up 90 basis points from year end 2018 the improvement is driven by the constructive distribution rate cases across the jurisdictions as well as incremental transmission revenue and a decrease in o m partially offset by an increase in depreciation earned roes for the legacy exelon utilities were above 10 slightly improving from year end 2018 looking at our utility returns on a consolidated basis we earned a 10 roe for the trailing 12 months which compares to last year s 9 6 as a reminder we targeted 9 to 10 consolidated roe at our utilities and expect that we will move around in that band over the course of time and we remain focused on earning fair returns across all of our utilities on slide 13 we rolled forward our outlook for utility capex and rate base covering 2020 to 2023 this year we expect to invest nearly 6 5 billion in our utilities and a total of 26 billion over the next four years these investments are improving our system reliability service experience for our utility customers and preparing us for the future our capital forecast reflects identified and approved projects as we move through time we identify more investment needs across the system that will provide additional benefits to our customers and communities since the initial disclosures for the 2018 to 2022 period we have identified nearly 4 9 billion in additional investment including an additional 1 9 billion since last year s fourth quarter call as chris mentioned these investments benefit our customers by helping to drive our operational excellence overall customer satisfaction and meet state resiliency and environmental priorities since the phi merger in 2016 we have added more than 9 billion in rate base across the utility over the next four years we will grow our rate base 7 3 annually to 54 2 billion adding 13 billion to rate base by 2023 or the equivalent of adding a utility between the size of phi and comed without paying a premium issuing equity or obtaining merger approvals as a reminder 65 of our rate base growth is covered under either formula rates or mechanisms such as capital trackers these support our ability to efficiently invest in our system while also allowing us to earn a fair and timely return on our capital where we do not have these mechanisms we will continue to work with stakeholders to establish more timely recovery tools chris touched on this earlier but i want to remind you all that we have been able to make these important investments while maintaining lower customer rates compared to other large urban areas when we look at our projected residential bills we continue to see bill inflation around or below the rate of inflation even as we make these important investments in the appendix we provide a more detailed breakdown of the capital and rate base outlook for each utility starting on slide 23 turning to slide 14 we continue to forecast strong utility less holding company eps growth of 6 to 8 when you consider the drop in the 30 year treasury that lowered our eps outlook for comed by roughly a 0 05 compared to what we had showed you last year we ve been more than able to offset in the back end of our plan through the increased capex program across the utilities for the benefit of our customers which brings us to the durability of our industry leading earnings growth which reflects a combination of strong rate base growth to support system needs for a more digital economy and environmental goals successful cost management and a focus on customer bill affordability before discussing our gross margin update on slide 15 i want to remind you that given the lack of clarity around the outcome of legislation in illinois and the fact that pjm is not yet held the capacity auction for the 2022 2023 delivery year we will not be providing any exgen disclosures beyond 2021 so turning to the table there is no change in total gross margin in 2020 or 21 from our last disclosure open gross margin declined by 400 million and 100 million in 20 and 21 respectively due to decline in power prices across most regions offset by our hedges during the quarter we executed 50 million of power new business in 2020 we remain slightly behind our ratable hedging program in all years we ended the year 6 to 9 behind in 2020 and 3 to 6 behind in 2021 by taking cross commodity hedges into account we continue to see some upside in certain markets but are not expecting a significant rebound in power prices or volatility slide 16 shows our o m and capital outlook at generation for 2020 and 2021 compared to our previous disclosure on our fourth quarter call last year our o m is down in each year the updated forecast reflects o m cuts we announced on last quarter call pension benefits and nuclear savings the return on our pension investments in 2019 significantly exceeded our planned returns but this favorability was partially offset by the drop in the discount rate taking both into account our pension expense it s about flat to plan in 2020 and is down by approximately 25 million in 2021 turning to capex we expect lower cash outlays than we projected last year we ve reduced the growth capital in 2020 and 2021 given the focus of recycling exgen cash and the increased need for equity investments at the utilities given their growing capital needs nuclear fuel costs are also lower into 2020 and higher in 2021 versus last year s disclosure primarily due to a shift in deliveries overall we continue to see a constructive outlook for the nuclear fuel costs looking out over our planning horizon we will continue to look for ways to be more efficient in how we work and spend to improve the cash flow profile of exgen while maintaining the safety and reliability of our fleet moving to slide 17 we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment grade credit rating our consolidated corporate credit metrics are consistent with our targeted ranges and above s p thresholds looking at exgen we are well ahead of our debt to ebitda target for 3 0 times for 2020 we expect to be at 2 4 times debt to ebitda and 1 9 times debt to ebitda when excluding non recourse debt this year we will be active in the capital markets as we support our utility rate base growth at exgen we plan to retire 1 5 billion of long term debt this year including the 1 billion maturity we paid off in january as a reminder this is in addition to the 600 million of long term debt retired in october of 2019 finally i will conclude with our 2020 earnings guidance on slide 18 we have provided 2020 adjusted earnings guidance of 3 to 3 30 per share growth in utility earnings is primarily driven by the continued increase in rate base as we deploy capital for the benefit of our customers as well as carry through from the 2019 rate cases we will see offset from lower treasuries on comed s earned roes higher depreciation and some regulatory timing drags between investment and rate cases most notably at peco our consolidated range in 2020 for utilities less holdco is 1 80 a share to 2 10 per share the decline in our exgen s earnings is a combination of lower realized energy prices and capacity revenues more planned nuclear outage days and the absence of nuclear decommissioning trust gains these are partially offset by a full year of zec revenues in new jersey and increased zec revenues in new york we expect first quarter operating earnings to be in the range of 0 85 per share to 0 95 per share more detail on the year over year drivers by operating company can be found in the appendix starting on slide 55 with that i will now turn the call back to chris for his closing remarks chris m crane president and chief executive officer thanks joe turning to slide 19 i want to discuss our key focus areas for 2020 we will continue to deliver operational excellence across our businesses focusing on modernizing the grid and improving the customer experience at our utilities while staying focused on safety and reliability we will meet or exceed our financial commitments delivering earnings within the range and maintain our investment grade credit ratings as joe mentioned at utilities we will prudently and effectively deploy 6 5 billion of capital to benefit our customers and help meet the needs our state s energy policy goals and we will work with our regulators to ensure timely recovery on these investments we will support the enacted enactment of state and federal clean energy policies with major initiatives which was in flight in several states we will and we will partner and ally with the communities we serve this is key to who we are slide 20 i will close on exelon s value proposition which highlights our strategy and commitment to shareholders we will continue our focus on growing our utilities targeting 7 3 rate base growth and 6 to 8 earnings growth through 2023 rolling forward another year this at this above group trajectory we will use free cash flow from exgen to support utility growth pay down debt and support the external dividend we will continue to optimize the value of our genco business by seeking fair compensation for our zero emitting generating fleet closing uneconomic plants and monetizing assets as we see value is there while maximizing their value through generation to load matching strategy at constellation we will sustain growth investment grade metrics excuse me strong investment grade metrics and we will grow our dividend at 5 through 2020 the strategy underpinning this value proposition is our effective and providing tangible benefits to our shareholders we remain committed to optimizing the value of our business and earning your ongoing support to exelon operator we can now open the call to questions questions and answers operator thank you your first response is from greg gordon with evercore greg gordon evercore isi analyst thanks good morning congratulations on a great year and the outlook is encouraging a couple questions the utility growth outlook is obviously improved as we go out through time despite the headwind from comed the capex is up significantly but the rate base growth numbers look like they re not moving as much in tandem i skimmed through the whole deck i understand you ve also moved capital around the different jurisdictions as well but can you just comment on sort of that modest level of dissidence between capex being up and rate base growth looking like it s not up as much joseph nigro senior executive vice president and chief financial officer yes greg good morning it s joe yes the issue isn t solely that the incremental capex that we mentioned of approximately 2 billion isn t falling the rate base it s about all of the capex and what we get into is the timing of when these projects go in service so we ve updated some assumptions as it relates to the schedule of when the projects are finished and then they go into service in addition to that we could have changes and things like depreciation that would also impact that so it s really just a movement of when we see project timing and other things greg gordon evercore isi analyst so afudc is not or cwip and afudc are not contemplated in that those calculations then joseph nigro senior executive vice president and chief financial officer no they re not contemplated in that calculation greg gordon evercore isi analyst okay that explains it thanks in terms of the cash flow profile i know that you haven t given us an update but because we do have obviously significant uncertainty with regard to exgen and illinois but as you look at most scenarios there whether it s getting some sort of deserved incremental revenue for the clean attribute to your plants or having to use self help to rectify the earnings issues under most of those scenarios do you still see the utility being funded by the cash flow of the corporation without needing equity through this forecast period joseph nigro senior executive vice president and chief financial officer yes greg so first thing i would say is based on the current plan as i mentioned in my prepared remarks we don t incorporate any equity issuance from in the plan and going forward we can meet the funding needs and maintain the investment grade credit metrics under most scenarios that we look at because we do look at this under a range of different possibilities greg gordon evercore isi analyst okay two more questions they are quick one since the q since the ei deck where you usually give us your update on where you think o m and capital are driving at exgen things have improved on the margin can you comment on how you ve pulled forward some of those the o m and capex trajectory joseph nigro senior executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i think the big thing is when you look at the improvement in exgen earnings it s really driven by four variables as you could see in 20 and 21 the gross margin hasn t changed right but what has changed is we announced the o m reductions on the third quarter call that s been a benefit property lower property taxes has been a benefit at exgen lower depreciation is also a benefit and then finally we do have some lower interest expense when you think about the retirement of debt so those four variables have driven improvement to the exgen earnings greg gordon evercore isi analyst okay final question chris time flies seems like yesterday since you made the commitment to grow the dividend 5 through 2020 and here we are in 2020 and you ve made good on that commitment at what point do you go back to the board with a recommendation on the dividend policy post 2020 chris m crane president and chief executive officer so i would anticipate the discussions with the board will be in the fall timeframe when we have further clarity on what the future looks like if we are able to enact some of the policies and programs in the states we re working on and it provides us with certainty that we can provide certainty to the board that maintaining the health of the balance sheet while creating shareholder value we should have a better picture at that time so i would expect us talking to you around year end timeframe about that greg gordon evercore isi analyst thank you chris take care guys chris m crane president and chief executive officer thanks operator thank you your next response is from stephen byrd with morgan stanley stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst hey good morning chris m crane president and chief executive officer good morning stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst i had a couple of broader policy questions we ve certainly been seeing quite a bit of evidence of especially in the pjm states a movement away from fossil fuels and on the merchant side i think i understand some of the moving parts there but on the regulated utility side what is your sense of the degree to which states are now pushing to move away from fossil fuels and how do you think broadly about pivoting and sort of reacting to that shift at the utility side of your business chris m crane president and chief executive officer so as you know steven our utilities do not have any generation and are restricted from having generation in the states that we serve what you see in our planning years that you re looking at for the utilities they incorporate what we believe needs to be done to support the state s needs which calls for more robust distribution system investments to allow two way energy flows which is going to require transmission build out to take care of importing the win from the pockets of the service areas that we serve and that s what s anticipated right now in the capital plan that we have in front of you we have got to keep up with the state s policies legislative agendas or whatever is going to change the system so our customers can benefit from these policies that the states are enacting stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst understood and then just shifting over to the pjm capacity process i wanted to just get your latest thinking on next steps procedurally i m thinking about sort of the broader process under which pjm would refine their approach and the timing under which they have an auction and i guess i m thinking also about the possibility of pretty significant litigation around the whatever comes out of the pjm and the ferc process here how do you see that unfolding just wanted to get your latest thoughts there kathleen l barron senior vice president government and regulatory affairs and public policy hi steven it s kathleen barron i can take that question i ll start with auction timing as you know there is a large group of stakeholders including clean energy advocates consumer advocates renewable developers and most importantly the states who have asked pjm to take their time in scheduling the next auction there s just been such a fundamental change in policy here that states need time to evaluate what the impact is on their customers and to design appropriate policies to protect their customers from the significant impact of this new policy on customer bills so we of course agree with that perspective and are going to continue to urge pjm when they re developing their next filing at ferc which as you know is in march to propose an auction timing schedule that takes into account the state s needs and in terms of litigation you re right that there have been a number of request for rehearing that have been filed that would be the next step for ferc before this case could go to litigation forecast no timeline on which to act on request for rehearing but i think the more important point is they have been developing this policy for years i mean they ve laid out in an order in iso new england three years ago that mopr is their standard solution and they ve carried that through to pjm i see no future where they change their mind on that policy and i think therefore the states are right in looking at what their alternatives are to continue participation in rpm stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst understood and just to follow up there kathleen can the auction proceed if there is pretty significant litigation for multiple states sort of questioning the fundamentals of that ferc order kathleen l barron senior vice president government and regulatory affairs and public policy well technically it can i mean i think from a good governance perspective of course as i said before pjm should take into account the fact that some of the state s needs more information to figure out what the impact is going to be on their citizens they are going to need to do an internal evaluation but from a legal perspective the ferc order is final and once the compliance filing is submitted and approved then pjm will be allowed to conduct an auction unless there is some sort of a judicial stay imposed stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst understood that s helpful thank you very much operator thank you your next response is from steve fleishman with wolfe research steve fleishman wolfe research analyst yes hi good morning chris m crane president and chief executive officer good morning steve fleishman wolfe research analyst can you hear me ok chris thanks chris m crane president and chief executive officer yes perfect yes we steve fleishman wolfe research analyst great great so just on the illinois process could you just maybe talk to i guess an update of the legislation and just trying to make sure that i think the hope is that there ll be more of a long term framework in place for treatment of nuclear and renewables and just how much is that likely to be part of any legislative activity in the state chris m crane president and chief executive officer well it s definitely there is two focuses that exelon has in the legislation one is the comed side ensuring that we have adequate recovery mechanisms for capital investments being made while trying to maintain the customer protections that we need by caps on bill increases so that part is very critical kathleen can address the genco part she has been heading that up in springfield in and around the state kathleen l barron senior vice president government and regulatory affairs and public policy sure steve i can jump in on the on your point about having a longer term framework which is exactly the point of the legislation that s pending in illinois and the idea of using the fixed resource requirement provision in the pjm tariff for the frr provision is to give states that kind of flexibility to provide for example for renewables that may want to have contracts of different lengths exactly that flexibility for them to have those those contracts and likewise for their broader clean energy goals for them to be able to differentiate when they re procuring capacity resources between clean resources and emitting resources and having that ability to design their capacity procurement to meet their state policy on a longer term basis is one of the key benefits of the frr strategy steve fleishman wolfe research analyst okay and any sense on when we ll get kind of a more kind of fully full bill with more details proposed to get a better sense on just the details of the potential bill kathleen l barron senior vice president government and regulatory affairs and public policy yes i think you should expect to see further discussion and public hearings about what the bill should look like as you know there are a number of proposals that are alive in the legislature and springfield and so there needs to be some discussion and public hearings of how the state s policy on all the issues that are pending will come together in a comprehensive approach so i think over the course of the spring session those details will become more evident as you know in most legislators it usually takes until closer to the end of the session for all the details to be worked out but i think you ll start to see over the coming weeks and months more details emerge steve fleishman wolfe research analyst okay and then a broader question just on i guess it s a esg nuclear carbon question just maybe for chris just how do you feel about your ability to get credit it seems like there s a lot of focus on esg and renewables and not necessarily as much focus on the benefits of nuclear and carbon reduction as you said 12 of the megawatt hours you produced for the country last year just how do you feel that you re going to be able to get credit either republican or democrat for the benefits of nuclear just how both sides are kind of looking at that right now including on the democrat side chris m crane president and chief executive officer yes i think over the last two years to three years you ve seen a greater recognition of the benefit of nuclear as it s contributing to a cleaner environment low carbon and also other emitting gases so as we work with stakeholders explaining electrification and the benefits of electrification and that electrification is coming from clean sources that are highly reliable like base load nuclear and there has been quite a few environmental organizations and government legislative folks that agree with that the dialog is going on on how do we keep these assets so the states can make their goals and that s going to be a critical part going forward we ve shared numbers with you before that if we shut down a couple of nuclear units in a single state we can totally destroy all the investments that were being made in the renewables and we re just going to go backwards with our carbon emission so we have to do our job not only as a company but as an industry and we re trying to do that the nuclear energy institute has done a very good job on their campaign to communicate that through greater and broader masses and we ll continue to do it ourselves and work through things like the legislation that may be enacted or policies that may be enacted in states we ve seen the zec and the recognition in new york we saw the zec and the recognition in illinois we re going to have to go a little bit further to be able to save these plants and that s where we re talking about frr and it s also another part of it it s more than just environmental the reliability they provide the jobs they provide the economic engine for the communities that they serve is very impactful and to not have these assets or to be replaced with carbon based assets will just send the states not only financially but environmentally backwards steve fleishman wolfe research analyst thank you operator thanks you your next response is from shar pourreza from guggenheim shar pourreza guggenheim securities analyst hey good morning guys chris m crane president and chief executive officer good morning shar pourreza guggenheim securities analyst just focusing little bit on the genco if we get to sort of the november veto session and find energy legislation gets pushed to 21 and we assume that there will be a pjm auction in let s say december and january and another one roughly six months after that can you just walk us through how you would be thinking about the auction participation and the timing of potential closures and do you feel that the mopr order has catalyzed the states to act on cjc chris m crane president and chief executive officer you know we re not speculating right now on that we surely hope for many complicated issues that the states are able to enact and given time to enact the policies that they desire that will allow these plants to still operate i ve said for the last four years or five years on almost every earnings call that if we can t see a path to financial stability for each one of these assets then we will have to retire them and we are not going to speculate today on which ones are win but we ve shut down oyster creek gone into decommissioning with the decommissioning company tmi is off there was no path for financial stability and as i ve said in the past we must watch the balance sheet and our debt commitments and negative cash flow assets will only send the fleet backwards and our goals on strong investment grade that will allow us to maintain our commitments to operate plants safely and meet our financial commitments on retiring our debt so we ll work hard through this legislative session to convey the importance of it and we re not going to speculate until we no longer have a path to profitability for the assets shar pourreza guggenheim securities analyst got it and then if let s just say illinois does frr how are you thinking about maybe the potential impacts on sort of the rest of the rto fleet like in pennsylvania and maryland especially given obviously the imm has been taken somewhat of a bearish tone on the impact kathleen l barron senior vice president government and regulatory affairs and public policy yes shar this is kathleen i can take that one i mean there are a number of estimates as you know out there about the impact of one two three four five states choosing the frr option we have not conducted an analyses of what that means for the rest of the pool so i m not going to speculate on which ones of those analyses are accurate but i will just say with respect to the market monitor and the suggestion that the mopr is going to have no impact on capacity clearing prices it s and i know that that s been repeated by number of the fossil companies it s a little bit concerning i mean it s exactly these state programs that they that were the reason that the mopr litigation was brought by these companies recall when the first lawsuit was filed in new york when new york adopted a zec program they said the point of the lawsuit was that zec programs were suppressing market prices by 15 billion over the course of that program s life the whole purpose of mopr was to raise capacity prices commissioner glick estimated that it s going to raise capacity prices by 2 4 billion annually across the pool other independent analyses have gone there too so it s just not credible for them to be now saying mopr is going to have no impact shar pourreza guggenheim securities analyst got it that s helpful and congrats guys it s very solid results chris m crane president and chief executive officer thank you operator your next response is from joseph rokowski from bank of america please go ahead julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey it s julien can you hear me chris m crane president and chief executive officer yes julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thank you guys for the time super quick let me come back to some of the numbers that we start with greg earlier just in terms of the guidance i know you mentioned the afudc spend and the reconciliation between capex and rate base can we talk about the earnings obviously rate base unchanged eps guidance higher is that principally due to some of the changes in afudc that isn t formerly reflecting that rate base but obviously reflected in that capex or are there other changes obviously the cadence of the trajectory of the earnings in 20 and 21 onwards has shifted a little bit as well so i just wanted to clarify that and then also on exgen similar dynamic around what s causing the offset versus the open margin i think you had a little bit of a quick brief commentary about basis potentially so just want to elaborate quickly on that as well as maybe the tax piece for exgen year over year joseph nigro senior executive vice president and chief financial officer yes julien good morning it s joe on your first question remember we re giving you guidance for the combined eu and holdco so there is a couple of variables even though we re investing capex and rate bases and rising when you look at it the interest rate the interest expense at corporate is projected lower which drive eps as one variable that s positive to the earnings we are when you look at these projects right you could still see there is additional capex growth and then we ve had some improvement in roes versus our prior plan as well based on some of the regulatory actions and performance so there is a number of variables outside just the incremental capex that would drive the value your second question on the offsets at generation it s when you look at the prices falling use 21 as an example where we re less than 70 hedged you see that you would have the open gross margin come down however that s a price at a common trading point when you look at the values associated back to where the generator bus bars are for example those prices move every day as well and there was some offsets associated with that so that got us down to flat julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it excellent and then just to come back to the broader strategic points here at what point in time you need to make decisions here it sounds like there s a latitude through the course of this year and then related to that are you expecting any kind of frr developments ahead of these auctions themselves or would the outcome of the auction and the outcome of any ultimate resolution of how to run this auction proved to be a decision point for states outside of illinois i just want to understand the cadence of events given where we stand today i know there s a lot of moving pieces and that could be a long question but i ll let you respond to as you keep that chris m crane president and chief executive officer we are definitely responding to the mopr in our commentary to ferc and pjm if they need to allow the states to enact whatever policy or legislation they are pursuing prior to running the auctions there is adequate capacity in within the system that we don t need to rush to secure it until the rules are clear so it would be an unfortunate event if the auctions ran before the states we are able to take action which means you d be looking at 2024 2025 before you d be able to enact and that s a long time with negative cash flows that many of the units would be facing at that point so we want to work with every stakeholder we can within the states that we serve to help them enact the policies and explain what we can on the economics if the bill as we ve seen it and draft toward the end of last year is enacted it actually has a significant benefit to the consumer it s not a bill increase as being communicated by some or understood by others it actually as kathleen pointed out could cost as much as 2 6 billion to the pjm customers and you take just illinois alone that s about 15 or a little over 400 million on an annual basis on an increase to those customers so there is a customer benefit here there is as drafted or inputted previously there is a cap on the and what can be increased on both sides the investment to support the renewables or the cost of the energy capacity in a system so we need to be able to have the time or the states need to be able to have the time and there is discussion in multiple states right now that they want to look at something differently and we hope that pjm respects the state s needs and allows them time to enact the policies that they desire julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst thank you operator thank you your last question comes from the line of michael weinstein from credit suisse michael weinstein credit suisse analyst hi joe and chris chris m crane president and chief executive officer hey mike michael weinstein credit suisse analyst hey maybe you could explain a little bit why the hedging program is still i guess a little bit more behind ratable i guess you talked about not expecting a significant balance in power prices going forward just wondering what the thinking is chris m crane president and chief executive officer yes i ll let jim mchugh answer that james mchugh chief executive officer constellation executive vice president yes hi michael it s jim we have shifted our positioning in the markets through time i think we at this time a year or 18 months ago or even 24 months ago we are carrying a position behind ratable primarily in the baseload regions looking at the markets and where they were trading what we ve done is we ve shifted some of that to different regions for example one of the areas we ve with a backward dated curve in ercot for example we see opportunities in different seasons in texas with ordc pricing being more relative for the future so there is just we re picking and choosing our spots i would say and it s spread out across multiple regions and it s just a smaller overall position but we re looking at where the opportunities are and then not a little bit relative to your question i would just highlight to that the vast majority of our new business would not come from that type of optimization activity but 70 to 75 will come from our load sales and customer facing business in retail and wholesale so we see a good strong pipeline for those activities and you saw the win rates and renewal rates that chris spoke to during the call which is another opportunity for us to continue to make our new business targets michael weinstein credit suisse analyst all right still pretty well balanced and on the capital program would it be fair to say that it s that you are being conservative on it given the uncertainty over pjm and cjc could the capital program actually be higher next year if we see some more resolution or more certainty over there joseph nigro senior executive vice president and chief financial officer michael what i would say is our capital program reflects what we think is the projects we ve identified as i said in my prepared remarks at this point in time i think that you ve seen the uptick in what we put in 2019 versus what we re putting in 2020 and we ll continue to challenge ourselves for the benefit of our customers but right now i would tell you i think what we re showing you is a fair reflection of where we are and what we expect to do calvin g butler senior executive vice president and chief executive officer of exelon utilities and michael this is calvin i would also say when you look at 2019 we added 150 million additional capital all around gas main replacement and really adding to the overall customer experience and as we ve built out our plan whether it s transmission or distribution additional capital it s all around meeting those customers expectations and our stakeholders in terms of reliability and resiliency so we feel we have a solid plan and can execute to it chris m crane president and chief executive officer the only thing i d add to that is every quarter we look at the total bill of the customers and we re very sensitive to making sure the investment is prudent it drives efficiency reliability and benefit to the customer and we also watch the affordability michael weinstein credit suisse analyst got it one last question hey calvin for the phi multi year rate plan filing for this year are you guys would it be fair to say that the roes tick up from the low 9s could go up to the high 9s if you get that approved later on calvin g butler senior executive vice president and chief executive officer of exelon utilities no what we anticipate we do not first right now we expect the dc commission to come out with a ruling in the fourth quarter of this year and along the way we ve adjusted our ask in terms of those multi year plans but we have a very solid understanding of what those roes are so i m comfortable with where they are right now michael weinstein credit suisse analyst got you all right thank you very much chris m crane president and chief executive officer thank you and thank you for participating today before we end i want to thank our employees for staying focused on safety and delivering another good year both operationally and financially and with that i ll close out the call thank you operator duration 61 minutes call participants daniel l eggers senior vice president corporate finance chris m crane president and chief

the perspective atlanta georgia february 11 2020 background every bread and butter issue in liberia these days is a subject for street protests three major street protests involving the mass gathering of people were held in monrovia between september 2018 and january 2020 on september 24 2018 a previously unknown group the coalition of citizens united to bring our money back cocubomb staged the first major street protest to demand governmental accountability for an alleged missing 16 billion liberian banknotes another previously unknown group the council of patriots cop staged the second protest on june 7 2019 and the third on january 6 2020 the second protest centered around a multiplicity of issues including demands for the president of liberia to publish his assets fire certain cabinet officials reshuffle the cabinet cancel the government s salary harmonization scheme and reverse a policy decision at the national seaport while the third protest sought to pressure the government to address the issues raised during the june 7 protest emboldened by article 17 of the 1986 liberian constitution which states in part that all persons at all times in an orderly and peaceable manner shall have the right to assemble and consult upon the common good to instruct their representatives to petition the government or other functionaries for the redress of grievances many liberians seemed beholden to the idea of an unfettered constitutional right to free expression and free assembly and the right of individual citizens to know and to consent to every governmental undertaking as a result every tom dick harris sarah or mary in liberia nowadays thinks he or she knows best what the priorities of government ought to be and who the government should hire and not hire to serve in various public offices even minor policy differences among government functionaries are no longer resolved behind closed doors but in the public glare and major socio economic and political issues and related high level policy initiatives are now discussed openly in the public without any regard for legitimate public information and legitimate national security information in this article i rely on some historical facts about protests and the reality of the economic situation in liberia in times past to argue that although protests are an inherent component of free expression in a flourishing democracy they cannot by themselves solve any local or national problems rather in my view protests can only stimulate dialogue between the governed and the governor on specific issues of general concern whether or not such issues arise from perceived expectation or discontent in the hope of reaching an amicable solution but to be successful at reaching an amicable solution for whatever issues raised by the protestors the protests themselves must be peaceful and non violent less adversarial and more persuasive and beholden to the legal social and security requirements of the particular society within which the protest is staged historical antecedents liberia faced serious threats to its territory during the 1900s from mainly french and british colonialists and intermittent internal wars between the liberian government and the local indigenous ethnic groups after annexing large portions of liberian territory to british sierra leone and french guinea and ivory coast during the scramble for africa in 1884 5 great britain and france still sought in the 1900s to annex more liberian land including british annexation of kanre lahun district of luawa chiefdom in the kissi kingdom to sierra leone in 1911 from 1910 to 1921 the liberian government was heavily engaged with internal wars with various ethnic groups beginning with the first grebo war in 1910 the kpelle and gbandi wars from 1911 14 the kissi and gio and mano wars in 1913 the kru wars from 1915 16 the gola and gbandi wars from 1918 19 and the joquelle kpelle wars from 1916 20 and so on akpan 1985 pp 263 272 the net results of these political acts pressured the liberian government into virtual bankruptcy with huge financial deficits in operational costs a declining revenue base and huge drops in trade and foreign aid president arthur barclay 1904 1912 sought to lower the political pressure by granting the indigenous peoples of the grebo kru bassa kissi kpelle and other local ethnic kingdoms liberian citizenship in 1904 president barclay also sought to mitigate the financial situation by borrowing heavily like his predecessors from the french and british governments and also from liberian french british german and dutch merchants operating in liberia at the time in particular the barclay administration borrowed 1 1 million british pounds 1100000 in 1906 and the equivalent of 1 7 million us dollars 1700000 from british and other european financiers in 1912 at very high interest rates akpan 1985 p 274 in order to meet payroll basic operational costs and other exigencies of the government because the loan repayment depended on liberian customs revenue generation the liberian revenue collectorate was administered by british officers as from 1906 and by an international receivership as from 1912 to ensure and facilitate repayment to creditors akpan 1985 pp 273 275 liberia s indebtedness to foreign creditors therefore enabled great britain france germany and other foreign powers to constantly interfere in the internal affairs of liberia to the consternation of liberians hence as these political and economic challenges mounted the liberian people wanted immediate answers from the government leading to the anti barclay and pro barclay protests in 1909 the anti barclay protestors might have felt that the president unnecessarily mortgaged the future of liberia by acquiring huge debts and subjecting management of the country s revenue collectorate to foreign creditors while the pro barclay protestors might have felt on the contrary that the actions taken by the president were a necessary price that liberians had to pay to secure a peaceful and functioning homeland current socioeconomic conditions today the liberian revenue collectorate is not under foreign control and liberian territory is not being encroached upon for annexation but the current political and economic situations in the country greatly paralleled what they were in the 1900s under president barclay and in the 1980s the 1990s and the early 2000s under president samuel k doe interim presidents amos c sawyer and charles gyude bryant and president charles taylor respectively liberia s current liquidity and cash flow problems are quite alarming with huge drops in foreign aid and foreign direct investment grants and international ngos participation in addition to the withdrawal of the un military mission in liberia unmil which used to pump millions of dollars monthly into the liberian economy on the basis of such recurring expenditures as building and fleet rentals air travels military gear and hardware purchases repairs and other general operational costs including security support to the liberian government liberia is still burdened however with huge foreign and domestic debts and related balance of payments issues which payment regimes often constrained the government to be delinquent in meeting payroll and other financial obligations on time the banking system and mobile money services are stressed to the limits and performing poorly in meeting customer demands for withdrawals of cash amid shortages in liberian dollar supplies and high prices of basic commodities on the markets at the same time the reality for past and present generations of liberians remained basically the same liberia has not changed much since 1847 in terms of its socio economic and politico cultural development after 172 years of national independence liberia still lags far behind its west african neighbors in road connectivity technological innovations modern academic institutions equipped with science laboratories and other scientific and pedagogical tools electricity and water supplies intrastate transportation and passenger rail services shipping and airline services medical facilities equipped with the latest medical tools and equipment and other basic infrastructural development liberia is still fighting hard to dismantle and destroy its cultural heritage at the urging of foreign partners while its neighbors are celebrating their cultural heritages locally at the highest level of society and exporting the same to other countries inside and outside the sub region liberians still lack a begrudging sense of national unity and commitment to nation building and appeared to still be settling for that woe meme mentality i e in liberian parlance the mentality of outsmarting another in the most degrading and teasable manner that has generated so much mistrust animosity and brisk sentiments among liberians to the point of undermining national development and progress brisk sentiments after the1985 elections drove liberians to a protracted 14 year civil war when differences over results of the 1985 multiparty elections could have been settled through court actions or dialogue brisk sentiments have become the new norm in liberian society since the 2017 elections and it appeared that many liberians are fighting frantically to delegitimize and ostracize the current government by the public suggestions that the liberian people made a mistake in 2017 in electing the current head of government this prophecy of doom has become part and parcel of the national public discourse amid concerted efforts clandestinely and overtly to cast doubts over every policy initiative or priority project of the government as being against the welfare of the liberian people and it appeared that political cynicism has given rise to the frequency and vehemence of the current waves of street protests in liberia and not necessarily because of the current economic situation in the country liberia has had her share of economic woes in the past and repeated street protests never became the answer yet the september 24 protest organizers called on the foreign powers to whom they presented their petition to impose economic sanctions on liberia until the missing 16 liberian banknotes were accounted for absent any prior investigation as if the goal of the protest was to strangulate the new government of needed cash and render it useless in the eyes of the people rather than to establish the facts in the case hence it must dawn on liberians that economic recovery or economic revival is never the handiwork of coordinated street protests and sanctions but a concerted national effort to secure an environment for the free flow of goods and services at affordable prices through relevant policy initiatives and actions the liberian protest dynamics on april 14 1979 the progressive alliance of liberia pal staged the first major protest demonstration in my generation involving a huge mass of liberian citizens against proposed hikes in the price of a 100 pound bag of rice the national staple the peaceful demonstration later turned violent resulting in massive looting of businesses across monrovia and the loss of more than 100 human life after the police tried to quell the demonstration by shooting live bullets into the crowd comparatively pal and the cop shared the same advocacy strategy regarding mass protests but differed on how key issues were to be formulated and packaged for presentation to the government for redress pal dwelled on a single protest issue at a time and appeared to have respected the organs of government by moderating its public utterances and engaging government representatives at every turn the cop dwelled on multiple issues at a time and appeared abrasive indifferent cheeky and full of self adulation in its public utterances while clinching to constitutional rights and downplaying the authority of the organs of government these differences in how each protesting group interacted with the organs of government can perhaps be attributed to the fact that pal operated under a governing system that was an autocratic one party state while the cop operated under a multiparty democratic state pal succeeded nonetheless in registering a political party the progressive people s party ppp which was the first opposition political party registered in liberia in 24 years 1955 1979 since the birth of the independent true whig party in 1955 but what little rapprochements existed between pal and the government of president william r tolbert jr soon evaporated with pal s second public demonstration in march 1980 in the form of a candlelight vigil to ask the president to step down the leaders of pal were arrested and jailed and rumors had it that they were scheduled to be secretly executed when the 1980 coup changed their plight the liberian truth and reconciliation commission even identified the 1979 rice riot as the baseline or genesis of the political conflicts in liberian history but that timeline excluded many incidents of great acrimony throughout liberian history including the ethnic wars already cited the cop on the other hand demanded answers to an array of issues that threaded deep into the operations of so many government ministries and agencies that it would have been impossible to implement the cop s demands without first restructuring the political economic and social institutions and the governing system in liberia but no protests whether for or against a sitting government have ever impelled any government administrations to take any actions at repelling the deteriorating political and economic situations in the country contrary to their best judgments based of course on thorough institutional evaluation of the political cultural social economic diplomatic and national security implications of the prevailing circumstances moreover protests are neither intended as an opposition tool to remove a democratically elected government from power on fiat nor are protests meant for groups opposed to a sitting government to outrightly recalibrate society on the whims rather protests are the means by which a citizen or a group of citizens can appeal to and prevail on a governing authority to make some adjustments in particular policies and programs in order to best serve the needs of the particular segment of society for which the policies and programs were originally intended indeed one of the key dynamics of the current waves of protests in liberia is the issue of constitutional right to know it took the 1980 coup the 1984 national referendum and the 1985 general elections to bring liberians face to face with the workings of democracy for the first time since independence in 1847 as a result many liberians tend to believe that government has responsibility to directly inform and seek their approval for every policy initiative contemplated by the government be it concessionary agreement loan program design or financial decision when in reality such inquiries become the prime domain of the national legislature which has both oversight and impeachment powers over the other two branches of government for while a citizen or a group of citizens has the right and freedom under the liberian constitution to know and act on whatever the underpinnings of each government administration might be direct participation of the average citizens in the daily running of government is generally procured through their elected representatives in the national legislature or through a court of law if and when the citizen or a group of citizens feel that a particular portion of a new government program or policy may otherwise jeopardize their interests many liberians also do not know that democracy is a partisan based adversarial system that thrives on a winner takes all mantra after an election that is in the absence of a power sharing agreement between or among two or more political parties the winner of an election at the presidential level has the inherent moral and constitutional rights to formulate a government and bring people on board who will be loyal to the national leadership and work to implement the policies and programs of the government of the day and there are no ifs and ands about all public officials adhering to these political and constitutional requirements when called upon to serve a particular government administration yet many liberians still believe they are deserving of cabinet and other top posts in government based on education and experience alone when it is loyalty to a particular government administration plus education and experience that can lead to increased productivity efficiency and creation of a positive legacy by that government administration besides the notion that government is continuity doesn t necessarily mean that each government administration should or will be the same the reality is that a government is distinguished by administrations e g the tolbert administration the doe administration the barclay administration etc and each government administration has the right to chart its own course of action to create the legacy that it wants and desires it is based on this legacy that a government administration may or may not be reelected and every new government administration has the legal right and authority under the liberian constitution to identify priority programs and set policy guidelines for implementation befitting of whatever legacy it wishes to create this is why it would be highly unlikely that any newly elected government administration will endeavor to recalibrate and reprioritize its policies and programs in adherence to protest demands by any group whether chartered or unchartered conclusion for the older generation of liberians born in the 1930s 1940s and 1950s it was almost a taboo to use profanity or unkempt speech before a parent or guardian or any older person for that matter let alone criticize government leaders publicly or engage in street protests without severe reprimands but times have changed liberians of the current new generation are now part and parcel of an emergent democracy made possible by the 1980 coup and a new constitution that guarantees the rights of individual liberians to free speech free assembly and free press today people inside and outside the media landscape can now insult and make the wildest allegations against any liberian public official or business executive at will without remorse or consequence the line between national security information and public information has blurred so much so that it now appears that liberia has no national security interests to preserve and street protests have become the new negotiation tool in the workplace and the general public sphere the current socio economic situation in liberia has gotten worst to the point that many liberians sincerely want the freedom to initiate street protests on the whim when it suits their political interests but they do not want police interrogations justice ministry interventions and counter protests to their causes but as the anti barclay and pro barclay protests in 1909 showed liberians can reasonably disagree on national socio economic and political issues and related policy matters without trying to tear the country apart through foul language threats of war and acts of gross disrespect to the presidency and the government of the day the anti barclay and pro barclay protests of 1909 also showed that protests and counter protests on the same day the same time and the same venue are also an inherent part of democracy hence liberian protestors and protest organizers must learn to recalibrate their general attitude toward liberia s emergent democracy and what the roles and responsibilities of individual citizens ought to be to make liberian democracy work for the betterment of all liberians the constitutional right of individuals to freely assemble and present their petitions to public officials is also not absolute article 15 of the constitution grants liberians the right to freedom of expression and the right to hold opinions without interference provided that each person or group is held fully responsible for the abuse of the freedom and opinions so expressed hence reading through articles 17 and 15 concurrently one is apt to see serious defects in the law as to what is meant by an orderly and peaceable manner and at all times in article 17 similar defects can be found in reference to the right to individual free expression and opinions and the responsibility clause in article 15 does article 17 hold that liberian citizens and residents are free to assemble at any time of the year the month the week the day or the night at the homes or offices of public officials and private citizens for the expressed purpose of presenting grievances and petitions will there not be qualms about invasion of privacy disturbance of the peace and public nuisance or does the phraseology an orderly and peaceable manner in article 17 mean that two three or even five different groups of protesters can converge at the same venue on the same day and the same time in either case what might be the role of state security agencies in the protection of every citizen against unwanted protests and invasion of privacy and the general enforcement of law and order under these scenarios the recent suggestion by senate pro tempore albert chie for the national legislature to provide some clarity on these constitutional issues seems timely finally as much as people have the right to hold government accountable for corruption and other vices those spearheading these charges must themselves be accountable to the government and people of liberia by presenting not propaganda but the facts liberian protesters and protest organizers will also have to be more moderate in tone less confrontational and defiant and learn to target one or two issues for redress at a time rather than trumpeting a laundry list of issues that may not be easily addressed accordingly a few questions are quite in place for careful introspection by all liberians as to how liberian democracy can grow and prosper 1 can a group of citizens under whatever nomenclature be adamant in demanding security protection from government for its planned street protests but at the same time want to be able to decide at will what day and time to engage in street protests without regulatory permission 2 can any political parties or groups of citizens refuse to officially present their petition to the government and still demand an immediate response from the government 3 can a government use teargas and water cannons to disburse a crowd of protestors from cooking at a national historic site the answers you provide to these questions could very well be the starting point for future discussions on the progress of liberian democracy

post written by gene goldman cfa getty past performance is no guarantee of future results is an all too familiar refrain in the world of investing nonetheless with a presidential election looming it is difficult not to consider elements at play in previous races when weighing the chances of either party in this next go around as voters prepare for the field to narrow and the rhetoric to ramp up the direction of the economy will likely play a role in their final decision in recent decades gdp growth has been cited as one of many predictors of an election outcome given the u s has been in its longest economic expansion in history it seems any challenger to the incumbent would face an uphill battle however growth is showing signs of moderating real gdp grew by nearly 3 in 2018 but is expected to fall to about 2 for 2019 and 2020 though slower such levels are in line with the expansion overall gdp growth has averaged just 2 3 throughout this historic period as election day approaches a u s economy that appears to be muddling along will be one of the issues at the forefront of voters minds more specifically voters could be swayed by five factors that strike close to home 1 unemployment generally a working voter is a happy voter the u s unemployment rate is just 3 5 hovering at the lowest level since 1969 one concern that might derail this job train is the recent weakness in manufacturing the december 2019 jobs report indicated manufacturing employment fell by 12 000 although not as significant a component of the american economy as in the past manufacturing still has ramifications given its link to many companies however as trade impacts lessen and lower interest rates work through the economy the stage may be set for solid job growth this year 2 wage growth another factor likely to impact voter psyche is their financial stability and wage growth is one indicator according to the atlanta fed s wage growth tracker wage growth has trended upward since a low point midway through the current administration but has been fairly range bound since the last election over 12 months ending december of last year average hourly earnings a good measure of wage growth rose 2 9 this figure has dipped slightly but it is considered a lagging indicator some positive momentum in the job market and near record lows in jobless claims could lift wage growth throughout this year 3 spending power just as important as wage growth is how far voters can stretch their dollars one way to measure spending power is to subtract the inflation rate from the wage growth rate a positive result is good news for consumers wage growth around 3 may seem flimsy but it remains ahead of inflation for 2019 inflation as measured by the consumer price index rose 2 3 through december while this figure represents a one year high due to the recent jump in energy prices after last year s slump due to economic growth concerns energy prices should reverse with a de escalation of middle east tensions declining car prices and muted gains in clothing prices additionally should wage growth pick up and inflation remain in check spending power could rise throughout the year 4 housing owning a home has been part of the american dream for generations and the fed s lowering of interest rates by 0 25 three times in 2019 has greatly benefited the housing market lower mortgage rates have contributed to a rebound in the formerly struggling market as housing starts and building permits jumped in 2019 according to the case shiller home price index home prices increased modestly rising 3 5 in 2019 over the prior 12 months with mortgage rates likely to remain low and the economy likely to grow slowly in 2020 voters should remain optimistic 5 debt debt household corporate and government is increasing to levels not seen in some time the issue is how debt will affect the economy in the future will growing household debt curb consumer spending the main driver of economic growth will rising corporate debt impact how companies navigate as the economic expansion gets long in the tooth will more government debt limit options to stimulate the economy if fundamentals deteriorate these concerns are legitimate especially if interest rates reverse and borrowing costs increase however the economy appears to be on solid footing and household debt service payments as a percent of total disposable income remain low after pausing in 2019 corporate earnings should improve and allow debt servicing with some exceptions voters tend to cast their ballots in a presidential election based on how the economy is doing the current economic expansion characterized by some as ho hum and as one of the least loved expansions ever follows the traumatic events of 2008 a sharp recession a market sell off and numerous bankruptcies with the great recession still fresh in americans minds there is a fear of a recurrence on the bright side this expansion has not had the asset bubbles and surges that have contributed to collapse in the past in general today s voters are seeing low unemployment positive wage gains growing spending power a solid housing market and serviceable debt along with an economy moving in the right direction albeit slowly while the economy may not be an immediate and pressing concern for voters it will be one more piece of information to review and analyze when deciding at the polls

in early march the united states of america sanctions imposed unilaterally on zimbabwe in 2003 will expire in early march the united states of america sanctions imposed unilaterally on zimbabwe in 2003 will expire by own correspondent but this does not mean that the us is going to remove the noose from the neck of zimbabwe the us senate s foreign relations committee has called for a review of the sanctions on zimbabwe with a call for more names to be added to the sanctions list to deter human rights abuses senators jim risch the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee and chris coons a member of the sub committee on africa and global health policy have sent a letter to treasury secretary steven mnuchin and secretary of state mike pompeo requesting that the us department of the treasury update the list of sanctioned persons in zimbabwe given the developments in zimbabwe over the last two years we urge you to consider enhancing the tools at your disposal including the use of targeted sanctions to incentivise changes in behaviour by the government of zimbabwe the two senators wrote an update to the list of the specially designated nationals and blocked persons list should incorporate a balance of new designations with appropriate removals to justify the illegal actions of the white house which uses a sanctions policy to exert pressure and change unwanted regimes us ambassador in botswana craig cloud on january 28 met in gaborone with sadc executive secretary stergomena tax just after the meeting the us embassy in botswana tried to spin the meeting by falsely claiming that a cloud and tax had agreed that corruption and not sanctions was causing zimbabwe s problems they also added a hash tag itsnotsanctions that was used by the us embassy in zimbabwe on october 25 last year when sadc nations rallied behind zimbabwe in the call for the removal of the illegal western sanctions ambassador cloud and dr tax also discussed how failed economic policies and corruption have created the current economic crisis in zimbabwe itsnotsanctions the us embassy claimed but tax was quick to expose the falsehood saying sadc did not share the said position this was not part of what was discussed might be the position of the embassy but definitely not sadc s position she said tax also reiterated the need to further engage on reforms that will lead to zimbabwe s economic recovery on the contrary in a statement on its twitter handle the regional body said sadc es dr tax met with the ambassador of usa to botswana h e craig cloud where dr tax reiterated sadc s call for the immediate removal of sanctions on zimbabwe the need to further engage on reforms that will see a recovery of the country s economy read the tweet this statement by tax shows that sadc is not going to change its stance in august last year sadc resolved to set aside october 25 as the solidarity day against illegal sanctions imposed on zimbabwe and resolved to conduct various activities in their respective countries on the day to call for the immediate removal of the economic embargo the regional campaign widened beyond the regional bloc to the entire continent when the african union voiced its objections to the sanctions imposed on zimbabwe calling for their immediate removal internationally china cuba and the non aligned movement made strong calls for the removal of the sanctions and the situation with the coverage of the meeting of the american ambassador in botswana and the sadc executive secretary clearly shows how the americans wishful thinking and use twitter as an official channel for disseminating false information the same us embassy in botswana tweeted the 5 so called facts about us sanctions in zimbabwe 1 us sanctions largely target those who engage in corruption violate human rights and undermine the democratic institutions or process 2 targeted sanctions do not prohibit trade between the us and zimbabwe 3 zidera and targeted sanctions are different the us has never invoked zidera 4 the sanctions list is a living document 5 failed economic policies and corruption not sanctions hinder zimbabwe s economic growth however in contrast to the loud statements of the americans the facts stubbornly speak of the destructive effect of american sanctions on zimbabwe sanctions have been detrimental to zimbabwe s economy as they have dragged economic progression backward and worsened socio economic conditions of the general populace ever since they were imposed in the early 2000s meant to choke zimbabwe s economy these sanctions аге two dimensional the first being zidera and the second is referred to as а targeted sanctions programme it is imperative to note that sanctions have negatively affected the economic prosperity of zimbabwe several government officials and companies in which zimbabwe had interests were placed оп а sanctions list among them was the industrial development corporation idc а wholly state owned enterprise at the time idc had interests in а broad range of zimbabwean companies such as olivine sable chemicals chemplex and zimbabwe fertiliser company which have been under performing as а result of sanctions these companies had no access to credit lines as а result of western sanctions standard chartered ordered idc to close its accounts with the bank standard chartered s fears were not unfounded economists have estimated that zimbabwe state enterprises account for 14 of the country s gdp making them а key component of the economy typically state enterprises are key to any economy s growth and largely depend on foreign loans for their capital expenditure such loans have mostly dried up due to restrictions which are encompassed in zidera thanks to zidera zimbabwe has not been receiving enough foreign direct investment due to the fact that most firms and companies аге handicapped so the us has maintained its theory that the sanctions are targeted only some entities and individuals in zimbabwe and not directed against the people of zimbabwe is it so but the reality of the situation is that western sanctions harm primarily the financial services sector and lead to a reduction in foreign investment so necessary for the development of the economy of the republic it s only a few banks which can take zimbabwe s risk zimbabwe is under sanctions and the sanctions are in three parts the first one is zidera which says no one should give zimbabwe development finance be it the international monetary fund imf world bank or african development bank secondly there is ofac which says that the transactions from zimbabwe should be scrutinised for compliance risk the third is zimbabwe s exclusion from the african growth and opportunity act whose purpose is to assist the economies of sub saharan africa and to improve economic relations between the united states and the region which means we do not have market access these three pillars have placed immense constraints on the zimbabwean economy the real effects of the sanctions have been to cut off zimbabwe from the global banking system here is a situation where the global financial markets have been de risking zimbabwe the country s constrained access to international financing has been worsened by the fact that the country has lost over 100 foreign correspondent banks since 2008 and this is one of the causes of the currency crisis but with a currency crisis creating long term productive capacity becomes a mammoth task major export earners like mining agriculture and tourism are frustrated through increased costs of doing business in addition to restricted access to international markets consequently zimbabwe s economy today is half its size as evidenced by capacity utilization which hovers below 50 that means around us 20 billion of economic potential was lost last year alone now imagine zimbabwe is approaching 20 years under sanctions by comparison the us estimates of lost receipts from corruption in zimbabwe were around us 1billion at the same time western countries say that despite sanctions they are increasing support for zimbabwe through various assistance programmes external aid instead of investments in fact perpetuates poverty it is actually washing out much needed investments which would otherwise ignite economic growth boost job creation and support self sustenance if direct investments come to the country over a number of years zimbabwe will be self sufficient and not reliant on any foreign humanitarian support but this is absolutely not beneficial to the west so called programmse of assistance actually benefit donor countries as in return they earn considerable soft power and gain significant leverage over the economic affairs of the host governments the fact is the losses from the effects of sanctions alone far exceed the cash handouts dished out by westerners for this reason there is no doubt that in late february early march the united states will extend or perhaps even toughen anti zimbabwean sanctions and the european union will follow the american example doing everything for the prosperity of democracy in zimbabwe and those who doubt the good intentions of the west implemented through sanctions can read tweets by american officials

form 10 k and our quarterly reports on form 10 q for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management s projections forecasts estimates and expectations this morning we will discuss some measures of our company s performance that differ from those recognized by gaap reconciliation of our non gaap measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures which we are able to calculate are contained in the earnings release kit i encourage you to visit our investor relations website to review the earnings conference call materials including the earnings release kit the investor relations team will be available after today s call to answer any questions joining today s call are tom farrell chairman president and chief executive officer jim chapman executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer as well as other members of the executive management team i ll now turn the call over to jim james r chapman executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thank you steven and good morning let me start by saying that we have a lot of ground to cover on today s call which reflects the exciting progress we re making on our investment program our financial targets and on our esg efforts including the introduction of an enterprisewide net zero emissions initiative over the last several years dominion energy has transitioned into a larger more regulated and more predictable company and this is reflected in our ability to extend our track record of delivering financial performance consistent with our guidance i m pleased to report on slide 3 that the fourth quarter of 2019 was the 16th consecutive quarter of achieving operating earnings per share that adjusted for normal weather met or exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range quarterly operating earnings were 1 18 per share which includes a benefit from better than normal weather of less than 0 01 even without adjusting for weather this was still the 16th consecutive quarter of results that aligned with our guidance range 2019 full year operating earnings of 4 24 also exceeded the midpoint of our annual guidance range of 4 15 to 4 30 per share when adjusted for about 0 02 of help relative to normal weather these operating earnings for the year met the midpoint of our annual guidance range and represent a 5 5 increase over 2018 s weather normalized operating eps gaap earnings for the quarter and for the year were 1 32 and 1 73 per share respectively recall that full year reported results were materially impacted during the first two quarters of the year by charges associated with the scana merger including a substantial customer refund as approved by the south carolina public service commission adjusted for these merger and integration related costs our trailing three year aggregate gaap earnings are actually higher than our total operating earnings over the same period a summary of adjustments between operating and reported results are included in the appendix with a detailed reconciliation available on schedule 2 of the earnings release kit turning now to slide 4 as usual our operating earnings guidance ranges assume normal weather variations from which could cause results to be toward the top or the bottom of these ranges we are initiating 2020 operating earnings guidance with a range of 4 25 to 4 60 per share the midpoint of this range represents a 5 increase over our weather normalized 2019 results which aligns with the guidance we provided at our investor day last march select drivers in 2020 as compared to 2019 include increased earnings from regulated investment growth across our electric and gas businesses lower interest expense due to lower average debt balances and a lower rate environment the full year impact of the millstone zero carbon contract and lower depreciation expense associated with an anticipated extension of the useful life assumption for our regulated nuclear plants in virginia negative drivers include increased minority interest expense associated with the equity recapitalization of cove point share dilution lower new england capacity prices and a double outage year at millstone note that the double outage occurs every third year and will therefore be a positive driver in 2021 we are introducing first quarter consolidated operating earnings guidance of 1 05 to 1 25 per share we are also affirming our post 2020 guidance of 5 plus annual operating eps growth as well as our dividend per share growth rate of 2 5 per annum subject as is customary to board approval we have successfully changed the way we manage and report our businesses as shown on slide 5 to better reflect the larger and more regulated nature of our operations we expect that these realigned segments will also make it easier to model and analyze our company on slide 6 we provide annual operating income guidance at the new segment level let me take a moment and highlight a few points first except for contracted generation which i ll explain in a minute each of our segments exhibit strong operating earnings growth trends driven primarily by regulated investment and general cost discipline contracted generation s earnings trend is negatively impacted by the sale of manchester and fairless at the end of 2018 and by the double outage year at millstone in 2020 as i mentioned previously the double outage driver will reverse for 2021 second we ve adjusted the cagr of the gas distribution segment to exclude the impact of the addition of psnc in 2019 to demonstrate the very strong core growth rate at this segment absent merger activity third we are not showing a 2018 through 2020 cagr for dominion energy south carolina as the merger with scana did not conclude until 2019 growth in 2020 is primarily driven by merger cost savings which we expect to accrue to the benefit of our customers in south carolina as part of our upcoming electric rate case in other words this growth is good for both customers and shareholders finally these segment level operating income cagrs of course don t reflect equity issuance at the parent over the period shown including shares issued in exchange for scana stock early last year and which actually produce a consolidated eps growth rate that is slightly below the segment level growth numbers shown here on slide 7 we show expected 2020 operating eps contribution by segment this page underscores two of the key investment themes we have emphasized first that the strategic progression of our company has resulted in having approximately 95 of our operating earnings derived from regulated and regulated like operations and second that around 70 of our operating earnings come from state regulated utility operations centered around five highly attractive states including virginia north carolina south carolina ohio and utah going forward we plan to provide this segment level operating guidance annually we have also simplified or added to our existing disclosures including with regards to weather impacts customer growth rate base estimates millstone hedging fixed income and other topics we hope you find these changes which are included in our earnings release kit and in the appendix of today s presentation helpful turning to slide 8 we ve summarized our current capital structure we now have distinct and aligned financing entities related to our dominion energy virginia dominion energy south carolina and gas transmission and storage operating segments these financing vehicles are in addition to our parent level entity sec registrants and therefore will continue to file 10 ks and 10 qs for the gas distribution and the contracted generation segments we show here the aggregate of existing financing balances across the individual opco entities which primarily due to their smaller size are financed in the private markets let me now address credit more generally i frequently remind our investors that we manage our balance sheet to a target credit rating range and not just to one of the specific credit metrics also that the cash coverage metrics such as ffo or cfo pre working capital to debt represent only a small weighting within the overall rating methodologies employed by our credit rating agencies nonetheless on slide 9 we illustrate the meaningful improvement we have achieved in the cash coverage metric over the last four years and which we expect will continue to gradually improve over the next several years we ve included in the appendix additional detail on the calculation of this metric for 2019 on a related topic strong performance of our retirement plan assets combined with an earnings neutral fourth quarter contribution more than offset a year on year reduction in discount rates resulting in an increase in the overall funded balance of these plans by around 7 percentage points this leads me to our 2020 capex and financing plan slide 10 provides our 2020 capital investment plans which are broadly in line though a little higher in the aggregate than the forecast we provided at our investor day due to a handful of small positive revisions and timing deltas and slide 11 provides an overview of our 2020 external financing plan a couple of things to highlight here first consistent with previous guidance our common equity plans for the year includes only around 300 million via our drip program you may recall that we had previously forecast 300 million to 500 million of atm issuance in 2020 but subsequently announced that we would use proceeds from the cove point equity recapitalization to reduce or eliminate that issuance which is reflected here next i ll point out that during 2020 we intend to issue up to 1 8 billion of privately placed fixed income securities at dominion east ohio which as a result of the dominion energy gas holdings reorganization we completed last november is currently levered only on an intercompany basis we currently expect this issuance in mid year and we use proceeds to retire current level debt finally as is the norm this annual financing plan does not reflect any opportunistic refinancing activities which may arise during the year for example in 2019 we rebalanced the capital structure at dominion energy south carolina via a series of bond repurchases in the fourth quarter we took advantage of an attractive financing environment to replace existing debt with an equity credit preferred security that priced at an all time industry low we will continue to monitor opportunities to similarly strengthen our balance sheet in an earnings supportive manner turning now to the atlantic coast pipeline which tom will address in greater detail in a moment since about a year ago when we announced last material increase in our estimated total capital cost for acp discussions have been ongoing between the project owners and the anchor shipper customers regarding the equitable sharing of those increases within the contract tariff those negotiations have been productive and we expect to formalize an agreement in the coming weeks as part of those discussions the major project customers have confirmed their willingness to take on higher project rates given the strategic importance of acp as an alternative pipeline option to the region as a reminder these are 20 year take or pay agreements with regulated utility customers and no commodity exposure this customer negotiation progress allows us to provide guidance related to the project s economic contribution after entering commercial service as shown on slide 12 we expect the 2022 contribution to be between 0 20 and 0 25 per share which includes supply header and assumes a full year of commercial in service this estimate also reflects the transition from afudc to contract based cash earnings potential we expect this contribution to increase over time as we expand the project to be a compression and laterals there is no change to our expected contribution this year of mid to high teen cents per share in related news we are announcing today that we have agreed to acquire certain modestly sized gas transmission and storage assets from southern company subject to hsr regulatory approval the first is pivotal lng which liquefies and delivers lng as fuel for transportation in the southeast us primarily from a new lng production facility located in jacksonville florida tom will discuss how this asset together with cove point support the expansion of our lng strategy to include maritime transportation the second asset being acquired is southern company s 5 stake in the atlantic coast pipeline which upon closing will bring the project ownership to 53 dominion energy and 47 duke energy note that the governance arrangements for the project company remains such that it will continue to be recognized on an unconsolidated equity method basis in dominion s financial statements likewise there is no change to southern company s status as one of the anchor customers for the project through its virginia natural gas local distribution company the near term financial impact of of the acquisition of these two assets is positive though relatively small and the increased acp ownership is reflected in the earnings contribution estimates i provided previously total cash consideration for these acquisitions is around 175 million turning to santee cooper our interest remains limited to a management proposal arrangement designed to cooperatively improve operational efficiency from our nearly co located utility footprints consistent with our previous messaging on this topic while the potential financial impact of any such arrangement would not be a material near term financial driver for dominion we are glad to participate if selected by the department of administration and the south carolina general assembly especially if the collaborative approach results in cost savings that can be passed on to our and santee cooper s customers in the state we will provide updates as warranted as the process moves into the next phase finally let me offer just a brief comment on the recent ferc order related to the pjm capacity market structure commonly referred to as moprets we will continue to monitor that situation as it winds toward resolution in the mean time we do not see this as a material financial risk for our company given the even balance of supply and demand of dominion energy virginia further if we determine it to be in the best interest of our customers we have the option to make a fixed resource requirement or frr election this would require a notification to pjm and we would also notify the virginia state corporation commission and the north carolina utilities commission with that let me conclude my remarks by reiterating the key investment themes that i spoke to on our last quarterly call we are highly regulated with about 95 of our company s operating earnings derived from regulated and regulated like operations 70 of our earnings are from utility operations centered around five attractive states another 25 of our earnings are from ferc regulated transmission and storage operations primarily serving utility customers under long term capacity contracts during 2019 we grew our regulated rate base by approximately 6 we continue to expect five year rate base cagr of approximately 7 consistent with our expectations at investor day we are executing on our previously announced five year 26 billion growth capital plan that will modernize strengthen and improve the sustainability of the services we offer to our customers and finally this customer focused approach also benefits our shareholders as demonstrated by our growing track record of meeting and affirming our financial guidance including a 16th consecutive quarter of meeting or exceeding our guidance midpoint i ll now turn the call over to tom thomas f farrell ii chairman president and chief executive officer thank you jim and good morning first a reminder that safety is our first core value on slide 14 we have recast our historic safety results to incorporate our mergers with questar and scana as you can see the overall trend reflects a continuous focus on employee health and welfare pro forma for past mergers our companywide osha recordable incident rate decreased in 2019 for an 11th time over the last 13 years turning now to our consistent national leadership as it relates to environmental social and governance matters over the course of the last year we have intensified our efforts to reduce emissions of all types as shown on slide 15 we have already reduced carbon emissions by around 50 since 2005 which is nearly twice as much as the most recently reported industry average we have followed a similar path for methane emissions which have fallen by around 25 since 2010 a significant reduction driven by industry leading efforts further as shown on the next slide we have reduced coal fired generations contribution to companywide electricity production by 80 from 52 in 2005 to 12 in 2019 and we estimate that coal fired generation today accounts for less than 8 of our total regulated investment base turning to slide 17 i m pleased to announce a new commitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 the goal includes both carbon dioxide and methane emissions and covers all of our businesses including electricity generation and gas infrastructure this represents a significant expansion in the company s previous greenhouse gas emission reduction goals which included a commitment to cut methane emissions from our natural gas operations by 50 between 2010 and 2030 and carbon emissions from our power generating facilities by 80 between 2005 and 2050 reducing emissions as fast as possible and achieving net zero emissions companywide requires immediate and direct action that is why the company continues to make meaningful steps to extend licenses for its zero carbon nuclear generation fleet promote customer energy efficiency programs invest heavily in wind and solar power reduce the amount of coal fired generation on our system enhance gas infrastructure leak detection systematically replace legacy gas distribution lines and harvest agricultural methane emissions to be repurposed as renewable natural gas all these initiatives are included in our capital investment plan guidance through 2023 and will extend well beyond that over the long term achieving these goals will require supportive legislative and regulatory policies and broader investments across the economy this includes support for the testing and deployment of technologies such as large scale energy storage and carbon capture which though still early stage have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions significantly when deployed in conjunction with carbon free generation we will never lose sight of our fundamental responsibility to customers provision of safe reliable and affordable energy we have issued a press release this morning that addresses the topic in additional detail and you should expect to hear more about our plans including an upcoming climate and corporate and social responsibility reports though certain approaches will undoubtedly evolve over the coming decades to reflect the most up to date assumptions our commitment to net zero emissions will not change i m pleased to report that our work on reducing emissions and enhancing our esg disclosures was recognized with a leadership rating by cdp an influential non profit that monitors and measures environmental impact these ratings put dominion energy in the upper echelon of not just us utility companies but all companies of all industries globally in addition just capital an organization that promotes corporate responsibility in partnership with forbes has ranked dominion among america s top 100 corporate citizens it is of course nice to receive accolades like these but we are not declaring victory in addition to minimizing our own operational environmental footprint in line with the carbon and methane goals i just described we are also embracing the notion of beyond dominion energy as it relates to our ability to transform the emissions profiles of our customers and energy end users as shown on slide 19 in the transportation sector which accounts for 29 of u s greenhouse gas emissions we are leading the way in the development of the largest electric school bus program in the nation we are enhancing the resiliency and flexibility of our electric grid to enable the more rapid deployment of electric vehicle charging infrastructure as enabled in virginia by the grid transformation and security act and we are developing infrastructure that will make liquefied natural gas compressed renewable natural gas and potentially hydrogen fuels more available and more affordable for use in transportation applications including maritime shipping vessels in the agricultural sector which accounts for 9 of u s greenhouse gas emissions we are partnering with the nation s largest hog and dairy producers to capture methane from farm operations these partnerships have already committed 700 million of shared investment to capture methane emissions and use rng to serve pumps businesses and vehicle fleets these are large and ambitious multi decade plans that are consistent with the spirit of dominion energy and nearly its 20 000 employees many of these efforts are well under way including our solar offshore wind nuclear relicensing and energy efficiency programs others are in more nascent stages including our electric school bus rng and marine lng programs over the coming months and years you should expect to hear more on these strategies as we work diligently to reduce the emissions profiles of our company and our customers i will address several of these now turning to slide 20 late last year we announced plans to install over 2 6 gigawatts of wind generation capacity approximately 27 miles off the coast of virginia a major milestone for a project we began developing in 2013 since that announcement we have achieved several additional milestones including selecting siemens gamesa as our preferred turbine supplier and entering into an agreement with three prominent trade unions to support the onshore electric interconnection work we will begin ocean survey work in april which will help to support the submission of the construction and operations plan at the end of this year we expect to commence construction in 2024 upon timely completion of the bone permitting process with full in service by the end of 2026 we will continue to work to refine the preliminary capital cost estimate of approximately 8 billion the vast majority of which will occur in the 24 to 26 time frame as major components are fabricated and installed cost reductions as well as any tax benefits that we achieve will accrue directly to the benefit of our customers dominion energy virginia will be the sole equity owner of this regulated asset we will seek recovery via a rider from the virginia state corporation commission while the existing gtsa provides a strong framework for regulated cost recovery for offshore wind investments legislation which was supported by the governor s office in recent legislative committee meetings is working its way through the current virginia general assembly session that if enacted would provide additional regulatory clarity a related 12 megawatt pilot project will begin turbine installation in may and is expected to achieve commercial operation in late summer of this year the lessons learned on this project will be invaluable to the successful completion of our full scale deployment the pilot is the first and only offshore wind project in federal waters to have completed the bom permitting process which included a cumulative impact analysis we expect to leverage the right of way and other work already performed under the pilot project to facilitate routing the export cable to shore and connecting to the onshore electric transmission system also in virginia our weather normalized sales increased 1 4 year over year driven primarily by increased data center and residential demand we connected nearly 34 000 new accounts about 10 more than last year including 26 data centers which set another annual record earlier this year pjm revised upwards their peak load assumptions for our service territory to reflect among other things continued strong data center growth pjm s domzone summer peak load growth is now expected to be 1 2 per year over the next 10 years and 1 annually over the next 15 years these rates are double the pjm systemwide growth rates and rank our zone as one of the fastest growing regions among the 13 states that comprise pjm turning to slide 21 last month the state corporation commission approved our u s forward solar cpcn application the second such approval in the last 12 months we expect subsequent rider approval in april overall we have now achieved 57 of our commitment to virginians to have 3 000 megawatts of solar in development or in operation by the end of 2021 to date and inclusive of around 800 million of spending in 2019 alone dominion energy s enterprise wide total solar investment now stands at approximately 4 billion with an additional nearly 3 billion expected through 2023 we anticipate continued solar investment for years to come which is why we expect to improve our current ranking of fourth among the largest utility owners of solar in the country phase 2 of our grid modernization program is before the commission representing around 500 million of capex the request includes deployment of automated metering a new customer information platform and investments in grid resiliency and telecommunications that are essential to delivering the products and services that our customers desire and which provide for a system more capable of withstanding climate related risks we are optimistic that we will receive approval next month our other investment programs shown on slide 22 such as electric transmission nuclear relicensing distribution undergrounding pumped storage renewable enabling quick start generation and rural broadband are tracking in line with our expectations virginia general assembly has been in session for about five weeks and is scheduled to conclude in less than a month there are two proposals currently pending that i believe warrant highlighting one is related to offshore wind which i previously addressed the other relates to our nation leading initiative to replace diesel with electric school buses we have already selected a vendor and worked with local school districts in our service territory to allocate an initial delivery of 50 school buses by year end pending legislation calls for replacing an additional 1 500 buses by 2025 representing an estimated dominion capital investment of approximately 400 million which will be eligible for cost recovery subject to commission approval ultimately we would replace all 13 000 diesel school buses in our virginia service territory not only will this effort dramatically improve the air quality for our students and their communities it will provide valuable real world experience with vehicle to grid battery technology as the first 1 500 buses while idle represent up to 60 megawatts of effective battery storage we are monitoring other active pieces of legislation all of which we expect to represent a reasonable and balanced approach to statewide energy policy priorities turning now to south carolina on slide 23 we are pleased with the work done by our team members to provide for smooth integration while maintaining their historically excellent levels of reliability and customer service around mid year we plan to file an electric rate case as stipulated in the merger agreement our most recent earned return was around 7 5 and our current authorized return is 10 25 the most significant driver of the under earnings is related to normal course safety customer growth and reliability utility investment over the last eight years it is not currently captured in rates we believe the case will conclude by year end with an outcome that appropriately balances the interests of customers and shareholders turning to gas distribution recently we have begun to hear of investor concern that at least in some states municipal level ordinances could limit overall demand growth for natural gas utility service while that may be true elsewhere we simply do not see any evidence of slowing customer or investment growth in the states in which we operate gas utilities utah idaho wyoming ohio west virginia north carolina and south carolina compounded annual customer growth across this segment was 1 5 over the last three years and as high as 2 6 in utah and north carolina with no signs of abating anytime soon for many of our customers the alternative to natural gas for home heating is fuel oil or even wood which have significantly higher carbon signatures and in certain communities within reach of our system a lack of energy infrastructure is constraining growth and impacting every day quality of life further we are an industry leader in minimizing the emissions footprint of natural gas utility operations including through promoting energy efficiency utilizing innovative technologies and increasing access for our customers to renewable natural gas we also continue to invest hundreds of millions of dollars every year in modernizing our distribution infrastructure which improves safety reduces emissions and is recoverable in the form of riders or trackers that will continue over the course of at least the next decade regulators continue to approve new investments like our on system peaking storage facility in utah that will improve system reliability for decades to come our gas distribution segment is focused on being part of the solution to a sustainable future finally let me now discuss our gas transmission and storage business first rng we are the largest agricultural waste energy investor in the united states with investments of 700 million across our partnerships over the next 10 years these investments will grow as the offtake market matures through these efforts we capture otherwise fugitive methane from livestock and convert it to pipeline quality natural gas for use in homes businesses and vehicle fleets every captured unit of methane is the equivalent of eliminating 25 units of carbon dioxide dominion is uniquely positioned to lead the industry in this effort given the geography of our assets at investor day last year we identified marine lng as one of the many innovative ideas we were working to advance by way of background crews and cargo vessels primarily consume diesel or fuel oil each of which is a major contributor of greenhouse gas and other emissions the maritime industry is taking steps encouraged by recent global regulation to reduce its emissions footprint which is expected to result in a material shift to lng this expected growth in lng is a fuel source allows dominion an attractive opportunity to provide natural gas liquefaction and lng distribution services to a growing list of maritime customers as jim mentioned we are acquiring an interest in existing florida based operation that currently services marine vessels with an onshore liquefier coupled with marine fuel delivery infrastructure customer contracts in this business are typically long term take or pay with no commodity exposure this initial acquisition will support a broader marine lng strategy that would include cove point where we are partnering with an existing export customer to redirect a portion of their liquefied natural gas inventory to provide lng to constrained markets along the east coast and to provide fuel for marine vessels under zero commodity risk take or pay contracts importantly this arrangement does not and will not alter the existing 20 year take or pay export contract revenues or terms though modest initially this market has the potential to support the significant decarbonization of the country s marine industry in addition to dramatically reducing pollution at our nation s ports overall inclusive of the acquisition from southern company we expect to deploy approximately 200 million on this strategy over the next five years this is an innovative element of our long term beyond dominion energy effort to help our customers new and old meet their emissions reduction targets turning now to an update on activities related to the atlantic coast pipeline as shown on slide 24 two weeks from yesterday the supreme court will hear oral arguments related to the appalachian trail crossing aspect of our u s forest service permit we remain optimistic that the court will issue an order reversing the fourth circuit in the may or june time frame we continue to work with u s fish and wildlife service on a reissued biological opinion and are pleased that ferc reinitiated formal consultation yesterday we applaud the service for taking the time to consider thoroughly the feedback provided by the court during the prior judicial proceedings and we believe an updated biological opinion will be issued during the first half of this year upon receipt of the updated biological opinion we intend to notify ferc and anticipate thereafter the recommencement of construction across major portions of the pipeline we re also pleased with the progress related projects nationwide 12 permit which was issued by and subsequently voluntary remanded to the u s army corps of engineers last month the core adopted repromulgated regulations that would allow for acp to seek reissuance of the permit as it relates to the buckingham county compressor station air permit which was vacated late last year i repeat my message from our last earnings call we can deliver a very material amount of contracted volumes to customers on our existing schedule even if permit resolution delays the in service date of the projects third compression station we are working on a number of solutions which we expect will resolve the issue during the second half of this year we believe that the options we are evaluating will satisfy the court s concerns which centered on process not the substance of the permit itself based on our expectation of the biological opinion being reissued during the first half of the year we are confirming our project timeline that calls for construction completion by the end of next year and commissioning to be completed shortly thereafter project cost of approximately 8 billion are in line with the high end of the judicial option range we provided about a year ago this estimate incorporates the various potential approaches to permitting issues and construction plans and timing including as it relates to the buckingham compressor station which are being contemplated in the customer discussions that jim described also have noted we have agreed to acquire the 5 ownership in the project from southern company further underscoring our confidence in the successful completion of the project with that i will summarize today s call as follows our first value is safety and we achieved another year of record safety performance we introduced a net zero emissions by 2050 target that accounts for carbon and methane emissions across both electric and gas operations we achieved weather normalized operating earnings that exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range for the 16th consecutive quarter we further improved our credit metrics and successfully completed the restructuring of our operating segments we introduced 2020 earnings guidance that represents a 5 year over year increase consistent with previous messaging we confirmed our earnings per share growth expectations of 5 plus post 2020 and we are making significant progress across our capital investment programs to the benefit of our customers we will now be happy to answer your questions questions and answers operator thank you ladies and gentlemen at this time the floor is open for questions our first question comes from shar pourreza with guggenheim partners shar pourreza guggenheim partners analyst hey good morning guys thomas f farrell ii chairman president and chief executive officer good morning shar pourreza guggenheim partners analyst thanks for the additional disclosures on the acp slides with the afudc rate versus returns once gas is flowing can you just elaborate if you re expecting any sort of step down there in your assumptions i guess what returns are you kind of assuming in your 0 20 to 0 25 per share contribution once the pipe is in service post these contract negotiations and curious if these negotiations built in any potential further cost increases james r chapman executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer shar good morning it s jim thanks for that yeah there have been as we said in our prepared remarks quite substantial discussions with the anchor customers the anchor shippers and those discussions don t really revolve around roe it revolves around a rate so what the guidance we ve given is for the first full year of operation at that rate and that will of course imply an roe which of course do the math on but it s reflective of the expected rate for the anchor shippers now when you do calculate that roe that s implied by that math you ll get to a number that is reflective of the first full year of operation only meaning over time as that project expands through laterals or compression or whatever that s not reflected in that year one roe but that will all flow from the input which is an agreed upon customer rate and cost shar pourreza guggenheim partners analyst got it and then is there a point in time jim that you can sort of update us on laterals and compression is there and then where sort of your intentions are there at that point diane leopold executive vice president and co chief operating officer no what we can say is that we are optimistic that there will be expansions over time sorry this is diane leopold but we re right now focused on getting the base project in shar pourreza guggenheim partners analyst okay got it guys this was terrific thanks so much thomas f farrell ii chairman president and chief executive officer thanks shar james r chapman executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from greg gordon with evercore isi greg gordon evercore isi analyst thanks good morning thomas f farrell ii chairman president and chief executive officer good morning greg gordon evercore isi analyst hey tom i may have you covered a lot and you ve made a ton of progress so congratulations i don t recall if you mentioned whether you think there ll be any substantial legislative activity in virginia this year and if so what should we be monitoring thomas f farrell ii chairman president and chief executive officer thanks greg we mentioned two things in particular the legislation that would allow for up to 1 500 diesel school buses to be converted to electric between now and 2025 and there are bills in both the house and senate that are working their way through today is what we call crossover day in virginia where each of the houses has to finish work on its own bills so the house has to finish work on all house bills and then everything goes over to the senate and they can no longer work on house bills after tonight and the same is true for the senate so there are bills on the electric school bus in both houses and there are bills related to providing even further regulatory clarity around our 2 6 gigawatt offshore wind farm other than that greg there has been a large amount of legislative activity some bills are no longer viable others are and we just are monitoring all those working on them until they work their way through the legislative process it s really it s premature to comment on them greg gordon evercore isi analyst great and what would be what s your expected let me reword this what would be the outcome that you would expect coming from the legislation with regard to offshore wind if it does pass and what type of regulatory framework would that entail thomas f farrell ii chairman president and chief executive officer well again greg just the bills are there pending and i think they speak for themselves they have language in them that increase regulatory clarity greg gordon evercore isi analyst okay thank you i ll go take a read appreciate it take care thomas f farrell ii chairman president and chief executive officer thank you james r chapman executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thanks greg operator thank you our next question comes from michael weinstein with credit suisse michael weinstein credit suisse analyst hi guys thomas f farrell ii chairman president and chief executive officer good morning michael weinstein credit suisse analyst good morning hey what impact does the ferc mopr have on virginia the offshore wind projects and what is your i guess your decision process at mepco versus an frr tariff james r chapman executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer hey michael it s jim let me start there we as mentioned we don t expect that mopr as proposed will have really any financial impact on dominion as you know our capacity and load in virginia dominion energy virginia is pretty well balanced so no near term impact and if we foresaw that some change with mopr in pjm rules would mean that we would not be potentially receiving capacity payments on new build generation we could very easily in the interest of our customers in virginia just elect that frr option which we think is pretty straightforward it already exists for another utility in the virginia regulatory framework so we just don t see the mopr in general being an impact to our business one way or the other michael weinstein credit suisse analyst okay so for now i mean i guess later on you might make make that election if it does impact the ability to bid into the auction for the offshore wind correct james r chapman executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer correct michael weinstein credit suisse analyst one other question the 8 billion for acp is a little higher i guess you are at the high end of the range now what are some of the factors that are pushing that up toward the high end of the range is it the buckingham issue or something else diane leopold executive vice president and co chief operating officer hi this is diane leopold again so we ve run a lot of scenarios incorporating where we are with permitting issues and based on the timing of that construction scenarios certainly including buckingham compressor station options and all of those have been taken into account and the customer negotiations that are factoring into revised rate but really that s what took us to the 8 billion which is in line or just above the high end of that judicial option range michael weinstein credit suisse analyst okay got it thank you very much thomas f farrell ii chairman president and chief executive officer thank you james r chapman executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thank you operator duration 58 minutes call participants steven ridge vice president investor relations james r chapman executive vice president chief financial officer and

reconciliation of gaap to non gaap measures is available in our earnings release and in today s presentation to begin today s call kare schultz teva s chief executive officer will provide an overview of the 2019 performance recent events and priorities going forward our chief financial officer eli kalif will follow up by reviewing the fourth quarter financial results in more detail before providing an overview of teva s 2020 financial outlook joining kare and eli on the call today is brendan o grady teva s head of north america commercial who will be available during the question and answer session that will follow the presentation please note that today s call will run approximately one hour and with that i will now turn the call over to kare schultz kare if you would please kare schultz president chief executive officer thanks kevin good morning everybody and thanks for calling in it s a great pleasure to talk to you about our strong results for 2019 on the financial side it s worth noting that we met all the components of our 2019 guidance revenues came in at 16 9 billion and here you should of course note that we ve changed the way we report the distribution sales that we have in israel the sle company in israel from a gross basis to a net basis and we ve done a revisions to restate the numbers so that you can see the numbers for 17 18 19 this has no impact on the earnings numbers or cash flow numbers it s simply whether you record that revenue from distribution in israel as well as the net so we met that target of revenues we met the target for ebitda with 4 7 billion and the non gaap eps of 2 40 we re also very pleased that the cash flow came in above 2 billion now the key drivers for this was some good business performance austedo as i m sure you noticed kept on its rapid growth and has of course big continued potential we launched ajovy in the eu and got reimbursement in the first countries very excited about that also very excited about the fact that we just got the autoinjector approval in u s we have it in europe already so that looks very good also for the future and then we are very pleased with the way we manage to managed the decline of copaxone in both u s and actually also in europe so we saw stable copaxone sales at the end of 2019 and we expect to see a modest decline in 2020 in generics we had many many launches around the world alone in the u s we had nearly 50 launches including our first big biosimilar launch in the u s truxima and we re also very happy about the results so far of that launch we also published our first ever global economic impact report and just a couple of highlights our products actually helped the u s healthcare system save 41 9 billion on a yearly basis and out of that number 6 billion was patients savings where they save on out of pocket costs so we think we contribute very well in the u s also with direct and indirect 57 000 jobs now if we move to the next slide then you probably all remember that in 2017 so a bit more than two years ago 2 5 years ago we had a pretty dramatic situation we had a debt of 34 billion and we had copaxone going off patent worldwide so we were under a lot of pressure looking at a revenue loss over a couple of years of close to 5 billion the way to handle that was a restructuring plan that was meant to reduce our spend base by 3 billion thereby securing cash flow to handle the debt and securing our future earnings i m happy to report that we have executed the restructuring plan exactly as we laid it out 2 5 years ago it has not been you could say easy on the organization we ve had to close down or divest some 23 manufacturing sites some of those are still in process of the final closures and we ve had to close more than 40 offices and laboratories around the world and say good bye to more than 13 000 employees now we managed to do this without hurting our operational capacity in anyway we are still fully operational on all the many many products we do 30 000 different products many many billions of skus per year and to give you a feel for how complex the restructuring has been the next slide shows you a map of the world and you can see that we ve been closing down a lot of sites all over in north america south america europe middle east southeast asia japan so this is really truly been a great effort and i d like to thank everybody in the organization for the fantastic job they ve done keeping everything going in a nice way high quality while reducing the spend base now one of the reasons why we had to do this was to handle our debt situation and on the next slide you can see that we started out when i started in the company back in the end of 2017 with around 34 billion of debt i m happy to report now that we just come at just below 25 billion 24 9 billion so it s definitely going in the right direction and you should of course expect that this trend will continue in the coming years now talking about the debt we ve also had to do a refinancing and we ve done that very successfully in the fourth quarter and as a consequence of the refinancing we now have liquidity and projected cash flow to cover the bond repayments due in the next three years at the same time we have a situation where our ebitda is stabilizing as we said it would before i said that the trough year for earnings would be 2019 so that s the bottom of the trough so to speak and we ve seen that stabilization happening so when you stabilize your ebitda and you keep on reducing your debt then slowly your ratio your debt ratio ebitda to net debt to ebitda will be declining and that s what we ve seeing it peaked in q2 of 19 at 5 72 and it s been declining and has now come down to 5 32 at the end of 2019 and this ratio will keep on improving meaning that it will keep declining in the coming years talking about the debt and we have a slide here showing the debt structure and what you can see here is that the next three years we have debt stacks of around 2 billion which basically means as i said before that we can handle these with the liquidity we have on hand right now and with the cash flow and we expect to be generating the debt stack in 23 will call for some refinancing so sometime in 22 you should expect that we will do a refinancing similar to the one that we just executed to handle that situation now you could say the restructuring is now over and done with and so what s next so the next phase will be dominated by two elements one is a continued improvement of our manufacturing cost the gross margin improving the gross margin and the other is secured growth in the top line growth in revenues and if we move to the next slide then i d like to address the gross margin improvement program that we just initiated and that we ll be running over the coming years now the program has five key levers and these are not new for manufacturing optimization but they are all levers where we have not taken the full advantage of these levers in the past and that s what we re going to do in the coming years so due to the fact that we have a very widespread manufacturing network and very many products we can still improve on our procurement cost excellence and this is what we re going to be doing by consolidating things getting better overview of the situation and making sure that we get all the procurement benefits around the world now we can also still improve our network we had around 80 manufacturing sites when i started and you will see this happening in the future year by year but there is another way to optimize and just consolidate manufacturing sites and that is to optimize each and every site on their own basically making sure that the manufacturing volumes should have financial capabilities that you utilize your manpower your equipment through the fall and in the restructuring we really focused a lot on sort of optimizing the network footprint closing sites and moving things so that we could consolidate our volumes now in the coming years we will also be very focused on optimizing each and every manufacturing site for better efficiency better ratio between output and costs and we are very convinced that this is something we can do successfully then given the fact that we still have around 60 manufacturing sites worldwide and we sell billions of products every year 30 000 different products then of course the whole supply chain optimization is very important and we are working hard to reach a situation where we have global systems that cover our entire supply chain and that will be the basis for continuous optimization of the supply chain and then last but not least we need to have an agile operating model and organization and i m happy to inform you that the new head of our manufacturing organization eric drape has yesterday reorganized his organization to have a more technology focused setup where we ensure that all the best practices can be implemented in a fast and consistent way across the world now some of you who are thinking more about the investment in teva might say ok this is very nice all textbook stuff about optimizing manufacturing but what does it really means to the p l and if you look at the next slide you can see here the operating margin expansion that we are projecting and you will notice that the target is 28 in non gaap operating margin at the end of 2023 now there s really nothing new to this because this is our long term financial target that we already communicated in 2018 so what we re doing now is part of the plan from the beginning and the reason why it s not the 27 you heard in 2018 is simply that the change of the reporting from gross to net on the israeli distribution lifts off mathematically this percentage by a 0 9 percentage points so that s why we revised the target from 27 to 28 so this is our commitment that we will aim at reaching 28 operating margin at the end of 2023 so that s on the cost side you will see then on the revenue side i just explained that we need some strong growth and we need some strong growth drivers so here we have two key products that are very important one is austedo and the other one is ajovy and i ll talk a little bit about both of those if we move to austedo first then before i get into the sort of new things that we are looking at in our clinical development i d just like to say that we are very very pleased about the performance of austedo in 2019 we keep on accumulating patient basis and that of course helps a lot of patients it is also a good contribution to our revenue growth right now we have around 9 000 patients on a daily basis using austedo and if you think about the growth potential you will know that in tardive dyskinesia there is only austedo and one other competing product that has been approved in the last couple of years it s the first products ever for this indication so for the first time ever there is a way to treat tardive dyskinesia it s our estimates that there is around 500 000 patients suffering from tardive dyskinesia in the united states alone and that of course puts into perspective the fact that we have so far gotten to 9 000 patients on austedo and it just indicates that we believe that this product can keep growing for many years to come on top of the current indication in huntington s disease and in tardive dyskinesia we are also working on two new indications one is very imminent that s tourette syndrome where we have conducted a phase iii trial and the results will be reported in the coming months so that s very very close to being reported of course we hope there ll be a positive outcome we don t know it s too early to say but it will be really good for patients if we saw a positive outcome of this trial we are also doing a phase iii trial treating dyskinesia in cerebral palsy there is no drug really approved for that so it will be a first if it s possible to show a good clinical effect these data we will see sometime in 2021 but both these new indications are very exciting and hopefully they succeed to the benefit of patients but of course also to the benefit of the growth of austedo sales if we move to ajovy then we have a lot of regulatory approval activities ongoing we are in the middle of launching in europe we ll be launching our autoinjector soon in europe it has been approved and talking about the autoinjector we are also very pleased that we ve had the autoinjector approved in the united states and we will also in the coming months be launching the autoinjector in united states we hope in the migraine indication that we will get back to a capture rate of around 25 based on the fact that we now have a competitive device and we have a very very competitive clinical profile we re of course also working on bringing ajovy to the rest of the world for instance in japan where we just had really good clinical results together with our partner otsuka for the partner for japan and then in many other market so you will see a lot of launches of ajovy in 2020 in terms of clinical development if we move to that and of course we re also working on expanding the clinical indications for ajovy and we are doing some phase ii trials where we are expecting results in 2021 one is in post traumatic headache a very serious and quite widespread problem for many patients in the u s and of course we hope to be able to show effect there and the other one in fibromyalgia which is also a disease that has a big patient population in the u s and a disease where there is really no real good treatment now talking about the different lifecycle managements we are doing on austedo and ajovy eli is going to talk about our total specialty pipeline and we ve not disclosed this before but we are very happy about our pipeline as you know we have a strategy where we want to be leaders in generics and we want to aim for a leading position in biopharmaceuticals and if you look at the pipeline you will see that we have a high number of biosimilars in development and we had one imminent launch in biosimilars in novel biologics we have a lot of different things going on the most exciting short term is fasinumab that we are developing together with regeneron and where we hope to see data this year from the phase iii trials and we re very excited about that and we we ll see a big potential if it succeeds in clinical development on the small molecule side we re really not doing a lot of say new molecules but we are doing some exciting long acting products in different cns indications and of course we do have the lifecycle management that we re doing on austedo and then we have a brand new thing which is i would say potentially revolutionary in the respiratory field and we have developed and gotten approval for some very very sophisticated digihaler is basically respiratory inhalers to treat asthma and we are working now on launching these products sometime during this year and we are very excited about that if we move on to generics and we are the world leaders in generics and in order to maintain that position of course you need to do a lot of generic projects and we do so more than a 1 000 generic products are currently under development and you ll see here that the big numbers are quite favorable between 2020 and 2030 there are some 210 billion in originator sales that go off patent and you will see that that fits very well with our business where we have around 4 billion in revenue in north america and we are loading in some 400 million 500 million of new sales every year which is basically if you think about the math it s the 210 billion split out over 10 years we get some 10 to 12 of that and that s a price discount of some 80 for the generics compared to the originators on average and that ends you up with the 400 million to 500 million that we load into the market of new sales every year we of course also have a strong pipeline of generics in europe and international markets and overall we are very confident of maintaining our leadership and also maintaining a good profitability going forward now talking about profitability leads me to the long term financial targets and as i ve already showed you we have a target by the end of 23 to have a 28 operating income margin we have a target already today to be above 80 in the cash earnings and we have a target to get our net debt to ebitda below three times which we still aim at doing at the end of 2023 and now to talk about the financials i would like to hand over to our new cfo eli who will take you through the financials over to you eli eli kalif executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you kare and good morning and afternoon to everyone i would like to start by saying that i m extremely pleased to be here today as part of teva team i will start with a review of our financial results and then we ll follow that with the first look to our 2020 guidance as well as some of the major assumptions behind it beginning on slide 20 we start with a review of our gaap performance in q4 2019 we recorded a gaap operating income of 148 million a gaap net income to teva shareholders of 110 million and a gaap earnings per share of 0 10 this compares to q4 2018 when we recorded a gaap operating loss of 3 2 billion and gaap net loss to teva s shareholders of 2 9 billion and a gaap loss per share of 2 85 the year over year improvement in the quarterly result was mainly driven by the impact of non recurring items which had as much greater negative effect in q4 2018 compared to q4 2019 turning to slide number 21 we see impairment provision of 477 million for intangibles in q4 2019 of which 259 million in the u s intangible assets related to the acquisitions of actavis generics this compares to 2 7 billion of goodwill and 1 billion of intangibles in q4 2018 amortization was 290 million for the fourth quarter and we expect 2020 run rate should be at the average of 250 million and 260 million per quarter lastly restructuring charge of 59 million in the quarter were consistent with the ongoing activities throughout 2019 as we turn to slide 22 we review our non gaap performance quarterly revenue were 4 5 billion up slightly compared to q4 2018 revenue were mainly affected by higher revenue from austedo ajovy truxima qvar proair and anda in the u s as well as europe generics new product launch and russia offset by generic competition to copaxone as well as decline in revenue from bendeka and treanda israel and japan compared to q4 2018 we experienced a negative fx impact of 470 million net of fx revenue in q4 2019 increased by 96 million or 2 gross margin for the quarter was 60 6 compared to 52 7 in q4 18 the change in gross margin was mainly driven by a declining share and profit of copaxone in the u s as an increasingly less profitable distribution business partially offset by the ramp of austedo and ajovy as well as an increase in profitability of api and other activities operating profit in q4 2019 was 1 1 billion a 12 increase compared to q4 2018 the increase was mainly due to the ongoing cost reduction program higher revenue for austedo and the proair family partially offset by a decline in copaxone and other specialty brands mainly bendeka treanda compared to q4 2018 we experienced a negative fx impact of 29 million thus operating income increased by 144 million or 50 net of fx we ended the quarter with a non gaap eps of 0 62 18 or 0 09 higher than q4 2018 mostly due to higher operating profit and lower finance expenses partially offset by higher debt before going further with my review of the quarter i would like to take a few minutes to discuss the revision of previously reported consolidated financial statements related to our israeli distribution business sle this business is part of the international markets reporting segment which facilitates distribution of teva and third party products to pharmacies hospitals and other organization in israel in connection with the preparation of teva consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december 31st 2019 teva determined that in the full years and interim periods of fiscal years 2017 and 2018 and the first three quarters of fiscal year 2019 is an immaterial error in the presentation of the distribution revenues from its israeli distribution business the company evaluate the cumulative impact of this item on its previously issued annual financial statements for 2017 and 2019 and interim financial statement for 2017 and 2018 in its first three quarters of 2018 it concluded that the revisions were not material individually or in aggregate to any of its previously issued interim or annual financial statements teva has revised its presentation of the net revenue and cost of sale in the historical consolidated financial statement to reflect this item the impact of this revision is a decrease in the net revenue with an offsetting decrease in the cost of sales there is no impact on the gross profit operating income or earnings per share in addition there is no impact on teva s balance sheet or statement of cash flows for the related periods on slide 24 you can see a very detailed illustration of what s changed and what did not due to the revision i just described throughout the presentation we have noted the revisions in some cases like we have done here that presented results both prior to and after the revision in order to assist you in your analysis now turning to slide 25 we can see that the fourth quarter was especially strong one for free cash flow teva free cash flow in q4 2019 was 974 million an increase of 452 million or 87 compared to q4 2018 and more than 2 billion for the full year 2019 exceeding our annual guidance the difference compared to q4 2018 was mainly due to the higher net income focused working capital management as well as a few one items most notably sle sale and leaseback deal as it relates to the working capital in 2020 i would note that we expect working capital to be neutral to positive source of cash generating free cash flow is our greatest focus in order to successfully continue reducing our debt load an effort which is highlighted in slide 26 we ended the year with a net debt of just under 25 billion and a net debt to ebitda ratio of 5 32 times the second consecutive quarter decline our expectation is that by the end of 2020 our net debt to ebitda ratio will be below five times as kare mentioned in his remarks following our successful financing in november our liquidity and expected cash flow will cover bond repayments for the next three years now let s look at the development of 2019 results versus our guidance here on slide 27 we present the full year 2019 performance compared to the original guidance issued at the start of 2019 as well as the revised guidance from november will serve us to bring up the bottom end of all of the ranges please note that as it s related to revenue the guidance range are the original range and do not reflect the revision of sle to add in your analysis representing the 2019 sales prior and after the revision and as i mentioned earlier there is no further impact on the other metric that you see here including cash flow we are very pleased with the overall performance throughout the year which allow us to meet all of our financial guidance target we believe this results provide a strong foundation for us to begin growing from 2020 and beyond turning to slide 28 i would like to give you a brief overview of some of the main assumption for our 2020 financial guidance which can also be found in this morning s press release the most notable assumption is our global copaxone revenue which we expect to decline by approximately 300 million versus the full year 2019 the majority of this decline is expected to come mainly in the u s but the decline will be offset by the ongoing growth of austedo and ajovy we expect continued momentum of austedo in both tardive dyskinesia and huntington disease and expected sales to grow to 650 million in 2020 furthermore ajovy is expected to benefit from continued patient growth in both u s and europe where we continue ramp up our initial launch in germany global sales of ajovy are expected to be approximately 250 million i would like to add that we expect both north america and u s generics to be relatively stable compared to 2019 benefiting from new launches which help us to offset regular price erosion or losses of exclusivities in fact the only real pressure we see is in our international generic where japan continues to be a drag on our other regions due to their national health insurance price revision a few more items to highlight in our assumptions foreign exchange rate movements are expected to have a moderate negative impact on revenue and operating profit versus 2019 looking at tax in 2019 our tax was 18 as we guided last november you will recall that our 2019 tax was higher than previous years due to the interest expense disallowance resulting from u s tax reform and other changes to the tax provisions as we look at 2020 we expect our tax to remain in the 17 to 18 range so now turning to our financial outlook for 2020 on slide 29 based on the assumption i just reviewed as well as the sle revenue revision we expect total 2020 revenues to be between 16 6 billion to 17 billion non gaap operating income is expected to be between 4 billion and 4 4 billion while ebitda is expected to be between 4 7 billion to 4 9 billion using a share count of approximately 1 1 billion shares we expect earnings per share to be in the range of 2 30 to 2 55 lastly 2020 free cash flow is expected to be in at range of 1 8 billion to 2 2 billion and this concludes my review for the fourth quarter results and 2020 financial guidance we will now open up the call for questions and answers operator would you please open the call for questions questions and answers operator thank you very much the first question we have today comes from the line of gregg gilbert from suntrust please go ahead gregg gilbert suntrust robinson humphry analyst thank you first kare i was hoping you could provide whatever update you can about progress on the settlement framework you laid out a few months ago given its importance to cash flow and debt etc in the coming years and my follow ups for brendan how can we best think about u s generics sales in 2020 and can you provide the obligatory update on important products like generic forteo and nuvaring and whether they re factored in for this year thank you kare schultz president chief executive officer thanks for those two questions so i ll address the first one and brendan will to do the second the framework that we negotiated last year is still being worked on and the ags are active and we are active in this and so is the other participants in the framework the three distributors and johnson johnson and i m still cautiously optimistic that this will result in an actual settlement and this will be i think positive for the u s population it will be positive for those the people in the u s suffering from substance abuse so i m optimistic that it will come to fruition there is of course the new york trial coming up around 20th of march and it would of course be beneficial if the settlement could materialize before that date so that we wouldn t have to go through that trial but it remains to be seen there is nothing firm on it but i ll just repeat that i m optimistic about the changes of the framework resulting in a firm settlement brendan brendan o grady executive vice president north america commercial good morning and thanks for the question so in regards to the north american generic business we see this year 2020 much like we did 2019 it is around a 4 billion business and should continue to be right around that range we get a lot of questions around the products and with some of the big product launches here of course restasis we continue to work with the fda and have positive discussions there as well as nuvaring so they are in the 2019 plan of course they re properly risk adjusted truvada is there as well in q4 and of course we ve already launched the biosimilar truxima which is the rituxan biosimilar which is going quite well and we ll launch herzuma in the march timeframe so all in all we see this year shaping up very similar to last year as far as the u s or the north american generic business which is stabilized for us quite nicely kare schultz president chief executive officer thank you brendan next question operator thank you very much the next question comes from the line of ronny gal from bernstein please go ahead ronny gal sanford c bernstein co llc analyst good morning everybody and thank you for taking my question first question is for eli around cash flows i m kind of looking at your cash flow year over year and you re basically pointing us to essentially flattish free cash flow you had a lot of impairment charges in 2019 that probably should not recur in 2020 associated with elimination of staff and so forth is there anything in the free cash flow in 2020 that we should be aware of is there did you put some additional reserves for settlements and so forth or is this essentially the earning power of the business and the follow up is around the biosimilar business if i understand what brendan told us you guys are putting the biosimilar revenue in the u s into the generic business i was wondering if you can tell us a little bit about the relative contribution here the margins and i noticed that you ve got tvb going into in the clinical already but i couldn t find it in clinicaltrials gov can you share with us what that product might be kare schultz president chief executive officer so eli will take the first one and then brendan will take the second part eli kalif executive vice president and chief financial officer hello thanks for the questions so if you look on 2019 in terms of cash flow we have kind of several one items one of them as i mentioned in my prepared remarks is the sle lease back this one equivalent around 120 million and we have some significant reduction in our working capital mainly associated with inventories of around 200 million for q3 to q4 as well year over year of around 300 million so if you actually it still goes to too many items you will end around 1 7 billion 1 8 billion working now on the midpoint of around 2 billion for next year and this is associated with what we re doing now in terms of operations and margin and again more positive i would say elements on working capital ronny gal sanford c bernstein co llc analyst so this is really the earning power of the company in terms of cash flow that s a good it s a good base to start the improvement for the following years thank you brendan o grady executive vice president north america commercial yeah correct so ronny in regards to the biosimilar so as you know we launched truxima in the fourth quarter and we were fairly pleased with the uptake of truxima in the fourth quarter we achieved double digit market share and you can see the market share kind of it s been bopping around between 12 and 15 we think we can grow that and we re pleased with the growth seen as well we re not going to get actually into the margin you can probably back into that a little bit but as you know we have a profit share with celltrion so it s something that we don t really disclose but we are reporting truxima as well as herzuma in the generic business and i missed the last part of your question ronny gal sanford c bernstein co llc analyst you ve got in your pipeline a product supposedly in phase 1 a new biosimilar that you re developing on your own in phase 1 and it s not on clinicaltrials gov i wonder if you can share with us what that is and should we see it there soon brendan o grady executive vice president north america commercial ronny i would actually prefer not to comment on anything that early in the pipeline so we ll share more information with you that is appropriate at the right time ronny gal sanford c bernstein co llc analyst thank you kare schultz president chief executive officer thank you next question operator thank you very much the next question we have comes from the line of louise chen from cantor please go ahead louise chen cantor fitzgerald analyst hi thanks for taking my questions here so my first question here is if you could elaborate more on some of the pushes and pulls that actually get you to a sales and ebitda growth in your guidance for 2020 and then my follow up here is can you elaborate also a little bit more on the outlook for the european and the rest of the world generic market thank you kare schultz president chief executive officer thank you i ll take those so if you take the push and pulls then of course you got the main push and pulls regarding the main assumptions so there is a pull coming from the global copaxone where we are saying that we did 1 5 billion in 19 and we expect to do 1 2 billion in 2020 that s roughly around 700 million in u s 400 million in eu and a 100 million in international markets so that s a pull of 300 million and then we have austedo and ajovy growing and altogether they grow up to 900 million that s a plus of 400 million so that of course net positive of 100 million then once you get into the details and of course there is a lot of details eli mentioned that we have price erosion on some of the key products in japan linked to the reimbursement system of the japanese government so there is a decline there we have other elements where we have increases so a lot of smaller moving parts if we look and sort of sliding to the second part of your question about the generic business in europe and in international markets then we are expecting and we said this before as well we are expecting low single digit growth of the generic market in europe and also in international markets if you exclude the price pressure that we re seeing on the long listed products in japan so a low single digit growth of generic and otc for that matter in those markets thank you next question please operator thank you the next question comes from the line of esther rajavelu from oppenheimer please go ahead esther rajavelu oppenheimer co analyst good morning thank you for taking my questions kare a quick one for you if i may you ve talked about 2019 as a trough year for earnings yet the low end of your earnings guidance is below 2019 results can you walk us through some of the considerations that went into setting that lower end of the guidance range kare schultz president chief executive officer so when you set your guidance range you will always have some kind of needed flexibility because you don t know what s going to happen and i have not missed the guidance of the company i ve been working at for 62 quarters in a row i m not planning to start doing that now so that means that in your guidance you always need a certain flexibility for having some unforeseen events happening and you can never sort of say to investors that there won t be bad surprises right so therefore of course the guidance includes a certain level of flexibility to handle bad surprises that s just the way it is and that s also the way it should be because with the breadth of our business globally we cannot foresee anything that might happen during a full year so therefore you re right at the low end but low end is of course on what we are aiming for that will never be the case but it reflects the fact that there s always uncertainty in any business esther rajavelu oppenheimer co analyst thank you and then a quick follow up on ajovy how are you thinking about the u s ous split in that 250 million guidance and do you think an oral cgrp for prevention in the u s could disrupt the market for meds meaningfully either on pricing or patient preferences kare schultz president chief executive officer yeah so a quick answer to this roughly 200 million in the u s and roughly 50 million outside the u s with some variation of course depending on the launch speed outside of the u s and we don t think that the acute therapies that are coming to the market will have any meaningful effect on the preventive therapies that we re talking about here next question please operator thank you very much the next question comes from the line of amy fadia from svp leerink please go ahead ami fadia leerink partners analyst hi good morning thanks for taking my question can you talk about some of the dynamics with regards to ajovy in the u s market now that you have an autoinjector would you be more aggressive with regards to contracting and getting formulary access there to drive further growth and if you can talk about how that dynamic might play out in the context of some new entrants in the market there and then i have a follow up kare schultz president chief executive officer thank you very much brendan will answer your question brendan o grady executive vice president north america commercial so yeah i mean when you look at the the preventative cgrp market in the u s and we knew that as we went through 19 there were going to be ebbs and flows as to how things went with ajovy but in general we have the payer coverage that we need to hit our targets we re about 70 preferred coverage across u s of course there are gaps that we continue to work on and we continue to have conversations with payers but it s certainly a balance as you look at your gross to net as to how aggressive that you like to be and you need to be we think now that we have the autoinjector approved as we as we prepare for launch which we ll do here in the next couple of months we will have an offering that is really unmatched in the cgrp market will have the prefilled syringe will have the auto injector will have the ability for medical on the medical side as well as on the self administer patient side and of course we have the quarterly dosing which continues to increase so the quarterly dosing now is up to about 17 1 we continue to see that grow and that s really indicative of ajovy being the longest acting cgrp preventative therapy so we re quite optimistic about the continued growth of ajovy and our competitive place in the market ami fadia leerink partners analyst okay thank you can you also talk about the market opportunity in tourette syndrome for austedo and then maybe if possible give us an update on the forteo application thank you kare schultz president chief executive officer yeah so on tourette of course we haven t seen the final phase iii data so it s a bit too early but it is quite clear that if we were to see positive outcome of the phase iii trial and following that if we were to get an approval from fda this is a very clear medical need for thousands of patients so there is definitely a very meaningful use of the product in that indication and there is a very meaningful market for the product in that indication and then on your i guess your third question on forteo brendan brendan o grady executive vice president north america commercial yeah i ll just give you a quick update on forteo we continue to work with the fda on forteo as you know and if we re successful this year it would be late this year or could slide into 2021 we ll wait and see that we re continuing to work with the fda on it kare schultz president chief executive officer thanks brendan next question operator thank you the next question comes from umer raffat from evercore please go ahead umer raffat evercore isi analyst hi since everyone is asking 1 3 questions i ll do the same first kare on the 2020 guidance i noticed you re guiding ahead of consensus on the ajovy and austedo and a little bit on copaxone too and yet the overall guidance is not ahead of consensus it almost makes me ask is that delta entirely explained by the revision in anda distribution ex u s or are you guiding slightly below consensus on generics as well that s first second the tourette s trial you re flagging as a catalyst it s my understanding that trial has been concluded since november and i would have thought we should have results by now and the fact that we don t makes me wonder maybe we shouldn t be setting high expectations but you flagged it very prominent so i m curious where you guys shake out and what are you expecting from that trial especially knowing neurocrine did not work there and finally the operating margin target of 28 that you are setting out can you give us a little more color on that as it relates to whether it assumes additional sg a r d declines or do you have to assume at least 2 billion in new revenues to get to those margin targets thank you kare schultz president chief executive officer okay yeah like you said three integrated questions and let me try and answer all three of them relatively briefly so first of all the dynamics i mentioned on the revenue they are really sort of reflecting a marginal increase in revenue which is also what the guidance is reflecting if you look at it we re not seeing a dramatic increase in revenue and of course it will accelerate in the coming years simply due to the math that as we ve talked about before the drag from copaxone is getting less and less as you can see and the contribution from austedo and ajovy is getting bigger and bigger in terms of north american generics we are also maintaining the guidance we ve had for the past i would say two years which is the north american generics around 4 billion which means 1 25 billion it can be up and down it can be between 900 million and 1 1 billion but that s really how we see it also for the year as the common rate yeah on tourette you re absolutely correct we don t know you know the way it works with trials is of course that they are completely blinded they get you end them you clean the data you do the analysis and until you sort of have the final conclusions you don t inform anybody about it other than the team that s working on it so i have no knowledge about it just like you have no knowledge about it so it s anybody s guess you re absolutely right other products has failed in these trials i have no reason to believe different than anybody else so that basically means that in a situation like this there is you know a big chance of success and a big chance of failure that s the way it is with any phase iii trial in terms of the 28 margin then what i tried to explain it presentation was that we are now intensively working on a gross margin improvement project as you know our gross margin is around 50 which means that the biggest cost elements in our entire p l is our manufacturing costs and that also means if you want to see a meaningful improvement in your total margin then you really need to try and improve that element and that s really what we re driving for now doing a lot of things at the same time ending a very consistent gross margin improvement program now that also means that what you should expect will be done in order to reach the 28 it s a combination of improving the gross margin modest growth in the top line no dramatic changes to the r d and the commercial cost pattern next question please umer raffat evercore isi analyst thank you operator thank you very much the next question comes from randall stanicky from rbc capital markets please go ahead randall stanicky rbc capital markets analyst thanks kare looking at your net leverage target of just under 3 times by 2023 if we take the current net debt and apply roughly 2 billion in free cash flow pay down through that time period the implied ebitda growth or the applied ebitda is closer to 6 billion that seems like a big jump and even if we take a higher free cash flow assumption we still get pretty robust ebitda growth so the question is what is your confidence in that current leverage target for 2023 and then the follow up is you ve been talking more recently about china than you have in the past the revenue opportunity there for our products like treanda and austedo can you talk about how important china is over the next three to five years and how much revenue contribution you think you can get from that region thanks kare schultz president chief executive officer yeah let me answer both of them let me start by china and saying it s not a significant contribution over the next three to five years but it s a ramp up from basically close to zero and that means it s meaningful in the outer years of course five to 10 years out you will see that the strong percentage growth per year means the absolute number starts to be meaningful sort of five to 10 years out and china is a slow moving market where you need to launch your products and then they survive for long time and they keep growing for long time i ve done that in my previous two companies very successful and i think we can do exactly the same here with products such as treanda austedo and so on so it s a more long term play than it s a short term factor i am very firm on the target of going below 3 times i ll give you the simple math just like you just laid out let s say we had just below 25 billion right now at the end of 23 we ll probably be let s just say very simplistic math at least 8 billion lower right hopefully a little bit more because we ll do 2 billion plus a year that takes us to somewhere between below 17 billion now if you then say hey what is 17 divided by three that s just below six so that means we need to grow ebitda somewhere between 5 5 billion and 5 8 billion and i think that s very realistic so you re absolutely spot on with the math but it s very doable and it s our plans to do it randall stanicky rbc capital markets analyst great that s helpful thank you kare schultz president chief executive officer next question please operator thank you the next question comes from balaji prasad from barclays please go ahead balaji prasad barclays analyst hi good morning and thanks for taking the questions firstly on biosimilars can you throw some more color on the truxima market dynamics your competitor has come in with a strong discount and ims shows you have a strong q4 can we expect this run rate to be maintained with a surprisingly aggressive discount kare schultz president chief executive officer so yes when you look at the biosimilar i assume that you re when you re talking about discount you mean there reduction of wac price relative to the innovator yes so we were 10 under they came in at 23 24 under but of course there is more gross to net that happen in the overall channel so i think you have to take a look at how you balance that between the gpos between the payers certainly have to take asp into consideration and physician reimbursement so all of those things are part of our competitive offering and i will tell you that we certainly want to maximize the value of the biosimilar launch but at the same time we intend to be competitive on pricing and make sure that make sure that everybody in the value chain realign that appropriately to be successful balaji prasad barclays analyst got it that s helpful just secondly on celltrion announced its 2030 plans do you see an opportunity for you to enhance your current partnership which is just limited to 2 biosimilars could you take it up higher kare schultz president chief executive officer potentially i mean we re certainly open to having those conversations and we have a good partnership going right now with the first two we re very optimistic about the launch of truxima so we ll see where it goes balaji prasad barclays analyst thank you kare schultz president chief executive officer thank you next question please operator thank you the next question comes from the line of soo romanoff from morningstar please go ahead soo romanoff morningstar inc analyst hi just a great quarter in the generic side i know you have truxima as a positive but i think you had 50 launches on the generics i mean is there is that kind of offsetting any pricing or is the pricing stabilized kare schultz president chief executive officer so the pricing for us is somewhat stabilized and i think it depends upon your portfolio and your mix what you have launched that s new what goes into transition and what your basis but for us we ve seen the pricing stabilize for us it doesn t mean that on the base business that we don t have consists in rfps and price challenges and everything else because you do continue to see erosion there but new launches is certainly important and it s not necessarily because that s how you refill the bucket which you are losing on the base business and it s not always necessarily the number of new launches it s you can have fewer launches but higher value launches so it kind of depends on the mix we had between 40 and 50 as you point out last year depending upon what you count as the new launch we probably will do fewer launches this year but we may have some higher value launches so overall that s kind of the ebb and flow of the generic business eli kalif executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i guess to repeat the overall numbers we have a north american generic business of just around 4 billion and we see you could say price erosion every year stabilizing probably at around 400 million so like 10 but then we see new launches also of around 400 million it could be 500 hundred could be 400 million it goes a little bit up and down but in the big picture we see this as a very stable business going forward and the same goes for europe where we see this modest single digit percentage growth of the business and the only real challenge you could say on the pricing we have right now is in japan where the price reforms means that the long listed products are coming down in value and some of the generics are coming down in value so overall our generics business is in very good shape soo romanoff morningstar inc analyst yeah that s super helpful especially since you re kind of fighting off the copaxone and then the generic pricing so yeah and great great stuff on the specialty side also thank you eli kalif executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you kare schultz president chief executive officer thank you next question please operator thank you the next question comes from the line of elliot wilbur from raymond james please go ahead elliot wilbur raymond james analyst thanks good morning kare just want to go back to the ajovy opportunity in europe could you reframe for us once again how you see that opportunity relative to the u s in dollar terms and then what you think your ultimate capture could be of that market i know you ve talked about hoping to get back to 25 in the u s but how are you thinking about the relative european or ex u s opportunity i should say and then i also want to go back to you ve talked about the operating margin target quite a bit already but wanted to just drill down on that a little bit more if i think about 350 basis points of improvement headed into 2023 i mean that translates into incremental operating profit of around 630 million relative to your total cogs line currently it seems to be a very small number and i would have expected just giving some of the more aggressive restructuring or manufacturing optimization initiatives that the ultimate savings there would be far greater than what we re seeing which obviously also includes some element of growth in the business overall so just if you could maybe provide a little bit more granularity in terms of what the actual dollar amount that could come out of the cogs line over the next couple of years versus growth in the business that would be helpful thanks kare schultz president chief executive officer sure so let me take those two questions so first we have the question about ajovy outside of the u s and if we look at europe first then one thing which is interesting actually given today s debate about some super pricing in the u s is that the pricing level we are seeing in europe so far and that we expect to see going forward including different government rebates and so on the net pricing is very similar between u s and europe so we don t have this situation where europe is priced lower and the frequency of chronic migraine and the treatment of chronic migraine is at the same level in europe as in u s basically meaning and you have a slightly bigger patient pool in europe than you have in u s there is traditionally a slower penetration in europe than in the u s for couple of reasons one of the reasons is that you have 35 countries each with their own healthcare systems and reimbursement systems so it takes a while to do the negotiations and get on reimbursement country by country we re doing quite well we got a lot of the big countries but we re still working on others and that means that your ramp up curve in terms of the market penetration is slower our expectation is that we can commence the same share basically a 25 share we believe we have a clinical profile which is actually the best in the market it s longer acting than your products it s both quarterly dosing and monthly dosing and now we have a really really good autoinjector that matches the competition so we believe that 25 is a realistic target for this market on top of europe you could say there is a lot of small countries but there is also japan where we have outlicensed the product to a very good partner otsuka that i know for many years and they just concluded very successfully the local trial in collaboration with us with excellent clinical outcome once again as you ll notice ajovy has only had excellent clinical outcomes in all trials short long whatever and now also in japan so we re also optimistic about the opportunity in japan so long term but now we re talking maybe five years out you probably see the same potential for ajovy in u s as in the rest of the world now addressing your second question then 2023 is not the end of the optimization of our manufacturing operations but what we are doing now is a long term program that we ll continue most likely for the next 10 years where you optimize on a sustainable basis more and more by integrating your manufacturing more and more let s remember we come from a situation the company was created out of 20 mergers manufacturing sites all over world not really consolidated it systems not consolidated manufacturing planning and we are improving all of that as we speak and we think the target we gave you for 28 in 2023 is very realistic and then after that of course we will continue to work on optimizations but it doesn t happen that fast in manufacturing so i m sure you know regulatory requirements approvals stability programs all the things you need to do when you consolidate and optimize your manufacturing is something that takes time and therefore i think it s a realistic target we have but it s also a cost of development and it s of course something we will keep on doing also after 2023 yeah last kevin c mannix senior vice president investor relations i think so do we have any more operator no kevin c mannix senior vice president investor relations so thank you everybody for joining us today i think we re past the 9 o clock time we apologize for those who were not able to ask a question we ll be around all day and throughout

new york despite the buzz around climate action at this year s world economic forum meeting in davos switzerland the world s current environmental prospects look grim there are three obstacles climate change denial the economics of reducing greenhouse gas ghgs emissions and the politics of mitigation policies which tend to be highly regressive according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change global carbon dioxide emissions must be cut by 45 per cent from 2010 levels by 2030 and then eliminated entirely by 2050 to have even a reasonable chance of preventing global warming of 1 5 c above pre industrial levels we need quick wins warns the united nations environment programme in its latest emissions gap report or the 1 5 c goal of the paris agreement will slip out of reach that is an understatement even if the current nationally determined contributions ndcs under the 2015 paris accord are met emissions in 2030 will be 38 per cent above where they need to be global average temperatures will be on track to rise by a disastrous 2 9 3 4 c by 2100 with continuing increases thereafter the ndc targets would need to be roughly tripled just to limit warming to 2 c and would have to increase fivefold to achieve the 1 5 c goal that is not going to happen the only time in recent history when co2 emissions have looked as though they might plateau was in2014 2016 owing to weak global growth according to the global carbon project emissions have since increased again by 2 7 per cent in 2018 and 0 6 per cent in 2019 making matters worse the december 2019 un climate change conference cop25 was a dismal failure resulting in no new climate pledges or clear messages of intent for this year s cop26 summit in glasgow why is humanity so reluctant to save itself first many people simply do not accept the predictions issued by climate scientists but denialism is the least serious of the three main obstacles there will always be a minority for whom facts and logic are unwelcome distractions yet even us president donald trump must realise by now that climate change will undermine the future viability and profitability of mar a lago as the real world costs of climate driven disasters mount over time denialism will become less of an issue indeed a november 2019 yale university survey finds that 62 per cent of registered voters in the united states already would support a president declaring global warming a national emergency if congress does not act the second major challenge is that ghg emissions are the quintessential global economic externality climate change doesn t respect borders ghgs emitted anywhere will affect everyone eventually that means there is a massive free rider problem under current circumstances it will always be individually rational to let others cut back on their emissions rather than doing so yourself the only way to correct this problem is through collective rationality or enlightened self interest but given the current state of multilateralism expecting a truly global effort in pursuit of the common good is a tall order the third obstacle is that effective policies to reduce ghg emissions disproportionately hurt the poor both globally and within countries the international monetary fund recently calculated that the current effective global price of co2 emissions is a mere 2 per tonne to limit global warming to less than 2 c however would require an average effective price of 75 per tonne by 2030 i agree with harvard university economist kenneth rogoff that a uniform global carbon emissions tax is likely to be the best solution to the climate challenge at least from an environmental perspective but with such a tax in place average household electricity prices over the next decade would increase cumulatively by 45 per cent and gasoline prices by 15 per cent hence even within rich countries the distributional consequences would be difficult to handle as france s government found out after it tried to introduce a modest fuel tax in 2018 worse since the 1980s effective redistributive fiscal mechanisms in most advanced economies have been emasculated moreover the larger distributional burden of a global carbon tax would fall disproportionately on poor countries that are hoping to pursue rapid development in the coming decades around 570 million people in sub saharan africa alone lack access to basic electricity globally the number is closer to 1 2 billion needless to say long overdue growth in developing and emerging economies will bring massive increases in energy consumption and ghg emissions in india china and many other countries coal fired power plants will likely continue to be built for years to come clean and renewable energy from solar and wind will complement but not displace fossil fuels in these countries despite the strides made in battery storage technology the intermittency problems associated with wind and solar imply a continuing role for fossil fuels and nuclear power consider india which accounts for 7 per cent of annual global ghg emissions making it the world s fourth largest emitter after china 27 per cent the us 15 per cent and the european union 10 per cent that is despite the fact that india s per capitaenergy consumption is around one tenth of america s and even if that figure doubles by 2030 it will still be only half of what china s was in 2015 countries like india and those in sub saharan africa are not going to sacrifice their economic development for the sake of emissions reductions the only way to square the circle is to extend financial aid to developing and emerging economies undergoing unavoidably energy intensive development so that they can afford to internalise the ghg externality through an appropriately steep tax on emissions unfortunately sustained large scale international aid programmes are deeply unpopular and given that domestic fiscal solidarity is already wanting cross border fiscal solidarity seems like a non starter unless and until that changes an existential crisis of our own making will only worsen willem h buiter a former chief economist at citigroup is a visiting professor at columbia university

warnings by banks and corporate economists that australia could fall into recession because of the bushfire and coronavirus disasters are feeding into rising political discontent and the fragility of the liberal national coalition government by all indicators the economy is already in reverse and the damage will only worsen over coming months the back in black 5 billion fiscal surplus for 2019 20 proclaimed by prime minister scott morrison s government in last year s budget speech has almost certainly disappeared as well this is adding to the pressure on the faction torn government already discredited by its contemptuous response to the bushfire catastrophe and ongoing vote buying slush fund revelations according to the australian financial review economists at anz and nab two of the big four local banks believe that australian gross domestic product gdp will shrink in the first three months of this year because of the coronavirus and the bushfires affecting an already slumping economy in the latest development the government is set to extend its blanket coronavirus travel ban on china blocking at least 100 000 international students from entering the country in time for the start of tertiary education semesters apart from the serious impact on the rights and future of the students this will deal a hammer blow to australia s universities which depend heavily on chinese students as well as related accommodation and service industries at 34 billion annually revenue from overseas students is australian capitalism s second biggest export earner behind iron ore starved of government funds the universities rely on charging exorbitant fees to international students treating them as cash cows the ratings agency moody s warned last friday that australian universities will be harder hit than those of any other country because of the high proportion of international students one quarter of whom are from china reserve bank of australia rba governor philip lowe warned last week that the coronavirus will do more harm to australia s economy than the 2003 sars outbreak because of the greater reliance on exports to china and students and tourists from china than 17 years ago alongside the education sector the tourism industry is expected to be among the worst hit queensland s labor party premier annastacia palaszczuk told state parliament last week the cairns region had already lost 200 million in bookings and gold coast operators expected to lose 400 million there has been a flow on effect to tourists from other asian nations as well such as south korea and japan and other parts of the world chinese make up around 16 percent of visitors to australia and they outspend american tourists by a ratio of three to one their annual spending of 12 16 billion is greater than american british japanese and new zealand tourists combined these losses are on top of those inflicted by the bushfire devastation by the best estimates the tourism retail and rural industries will lose around 100 billion in income from the bushfires that does not include the effect of injuries and shortened lives due to smoke related stroke and cardiovascular and lung diseases or the terrible social costs of mental health problems and unemployment the rba has predicted the bushfires would cut economic growth by 0 2 percentage points through the december and march quarters while the drought would likely depress gdp by a quarter percentage point through all of 2020 the central bank has yet to even determine the financial fallout from the widening coronavirus epidemic in china and internationally business economists believe it could further slash economic growth through the first three months of this year by up to half a percentage point yet such predictions could be swamped if the epidemic continues to worsen deloitte access economics estimates the virus will cut about 1 8 billion from budget revenues this financial year because of the impact on chinese production deloitte partner chris richardson also forecast a fall in iron ore prices which will flow through to the government s company tax revenues kpmg chief economist brendan rynne said monthly revenue and spending figures from the finance department showed the budget was already 1 1 billion behind expectations and still deep in deficit in december even before the worst of the bushfires senior anz economist cherelle murphy said if that trend continued the 5 billion surplus would clearly disappear this will mean more severe government cuts in social spending to satisfy the dictates of the global financial markets the credit ratings agencies have warned that any retreat on the surplus could endanger the country s aaa borrowing rating other economic barometers reveal a deepening underlying slump new car sales in january fell to their lowest level since mid 2012 following the 2008 09 global financial breakdown annual new car sales are now running 12 4 percent below their march 2018 peak retail sales grew by just 0 4 percent over the past year the fourth worst result since the 1991 recession they are likely to stagnate for longer because real wage growth is expected to fall from the already weak rate of 0 6 percent to just 0 2 percent in the 12 months to june 2022 even this average wage statistic hides the reality that low paid and insecure workers in particular have been subjected to real pay declines for at least six years three rba official interest rate cuts last year taking them to a record low of 0 75 percent have failed to reverse the slump in consumer spending a lack of consumer confidence has been compounded by household debt which stands at almost 200 percent of disposable income a research report published this month by the melbourne institute of applied economic and social research showed intensifying income inequality magnified by tax cuts for the wealthy and the stripping away of welfare entitlements it calculated that income inequality as measured by the gini coefficient increased by almost 10 percent between 1994 95 and 2015 16 in particular the income share of the bottom tenth of households decreased from 4 5 percent to 3 6 percent pushing an additional 3 3 percent of the population more than 800 000 people below the poverty line of 50 percent of median income two thirds of the decline stemmed from people being forced off parenting and disability payments and onto sub poverty newstart jobless benefits what the government cynically calls tax transfer reforms at the expense of the poor the top decile increased its share from 22 7 percent to 24 2 percent boosted by cuts in top tax rates and higher tax thresholds by both coalition and labor governments the looming further decline in living conditions accentuated by deeper inequality is generating intense political disaffection not just directed against the coalition government but the entire parliamentary establishment in which public trust has already fallen to historic lows the author also recommends rising under employment fuels discontent in australia australian workers to pay as bushfire disaster intensifies slump
by in 1982 william r catton published overshoot the ecological basis of revolutionary change in it cattonl illustrates the trap we humans have set for ourselves fossil fuels have allowed humans to live from what catton calls ghost acres the land or ocean that would be necessary to produce the various goods we make or grow using fossil fuels we are spending the capital of what from this perspective is nature s bank account this has allowed the population and the way of life for many to greatly exceed the carrying capacity of the planet in so doing we have lost the ability to live within our means we have overshot that ability by a wide margin fossil fuels are a finite resource we have now reached peak oil extraction of oil has exceeded discovery since 1980 and all oil wells deplete it is impossible to sustain civilization without fossil fuels alternative energy from renewables is a chimera the benefits from wind and solar has proved elusive seven day lulls at wind farms are not unknown and battery backup at grid scale would be enormously expensive gail tverberg reports eia reports the average cost for utility scale battery systems to be about 1500 per kwh at that rate the batteries needed for backing up a solar or wind facility for three days cost around 30 times as much as the re facility but wind is often unpowered for more like seven days during huge stagnant high pressure episodes thus the backup battery cost is more like 100 times the wind farm cost batteries are not feasible if not batteries then what fossil fuel or atomic energy backups that were mostly idle what of the cost nor is intermittency the only problem with wind and solar they require a whole new and more elaborate grid and their management is far more difficult for example the use of rolling blackouts during demand spikes to prevent grid burnout is not feasible with such distributed sources of power all this must be built with fossil fuels which also must be used to mine rare earths required in wind turbine manufacture when the costs are really totaled these are not economic alternatives germany the poster child for alternative energy is finding that out with germany as inspiration the united nations and world bank poured billions into renewables like wind solar and hydro in developing nations like kenya but then last year germany was forced to acknowledge that it had to delay its phase out of coal and would not meet its 2020 greenhouse gas reduction commitments it announced plans to bulldoze an ancient church and forest in order to get at the coal underneath it but germany didn t just fall short of its climate targets its emissions have flat lined since 2009 over the past five years alone the energiewende has cost germany 32 billion 36 billion annually and opposition to renewables is growing in the german countryside nor is there any hope for biofuels cattonl does a calculation in 1970 the entire united states corn crop came to about 4 15 billion bushels this would have yielded about 9 67 billion gallons of alcohol if we had been willing to forgo exporting any of the corn or eating any of it or feeding any of it to livestock since each gallon of alcohol has heat value equivalent to about 0 7 gallons of gasoline this means the entire 1970 corn crop converted to alcohol could have supplied less than 7 1 2 percent of that year s domestic demand for motor fuel it would have supplied only 1 27 percent of total u s energy consumption even the record corn crop tabulated in 1976 just over 6 billion bushels would have supplied less than 2 percent p45 in 2019 the us corn crop is 13 019 billion bushels us population 1970 205 million us population 2018 327 million of course the corn crop requires more and more use of fossil fuels to produce between 1910 and 1983 corn yields in the us increased by 346 on a per area basis which the energy inputs increased by 810 also on a per area basis we depend upon fossil deposits not only for fuel and food but durable goods as well manufacturing cars houses i phones and the like requires fossil fuels we not only use them for energy but make things from them especially fertilizer in short there is no way to maintain civilization as we know it without fossil fuels catton points to an attitude of exuberance fostered by the discovery of america and the development of technology that allowed humans to use fossil energy this was a normal perhaps inevitable attitude during the period when population did not exceed carrying capacity that period ended around 1880 but the attitude of exuberance didn t this attitude is the american can do attitude optimistic democratic work praising in overshoot this attitude is obsolete and will lead to catastrophe catton wrote to inspire us to challenge this attitude fossil fuel wells deplete the resources are finite of this there can be no doubt all conjectures that they are a renewable resource fail in that if they were renewable at the rate we use them the earth would be swimming in oil given how much extraction exceeds discovery we can expect a decline in production relatively soon this is likely to happen in an unexpected way recent years have seen ever more heroic efforts to extract oil from deepwater horizon that blew up drilling a well five miles down in the gulf of mexico to the ponzi scheme of fracking tight oil evidence for a last dregs effort is everywhere investors often consider oil drilling companies as asset plays their assets are the proven oil reserves proven reserves are reserves they predict will be economically producible but at what price oil prices have continued to hover around 65 proven reserves that are economically producible at 85 might not be at 65 already reserves in marcellus shale have been downgraded the federal government gave the marcellus shale a big thumbs down this week it dramatically downgraded its estimate of technically recoverable natural gas in the formation from 410 trillion cubic feet tcf or enough to heat and power the u s for 20 years to 141 tcf or about a 7 year national supply the montery play in california is even worse in 2011 the eia published a report that stated the monterey shale in california had 15 4 billion barrels of recoverable oil or two thirds of the then estimated recoverable tight oil in the us the eia subsequently downgraded its estimate to 13 7 billion barrels in 2013 post carbon institute and pse healthy energy doubted the veracity of these estimates and i worked with them to assess the eia s claims by analyzing available drilling data and the geology of the monterey formation in december 2013 they published my report drilling california a reality check on the monterey shale which concluded that the eia s estimate was vastly overstated a few months later the eia quietly downgraded its estimate by 96 to 600 million barrels but the revision was picked up by the los angeles times in may 2014 yesterday the u s geological survey usgs released a report stating that the mean technically recoverable oil resource in the monterey was just 21 million barrels a further 96 downgrade from the revised 2014 eia estimate oil companies that had been holding on in hopes of a higher price are being forced to give up here s the new york times in the last four years roughly 175 oil and gas companies in the united states and canada with debts totaling about 100 billion have filed for bankruptcy protection many borrowed heavily when oil and gas prices were far higher only to collectively overproduce and undercut their commodity prices at least six companies have gone bankrupt this year and weatherford international the fourth leading oil services company which owes investors 7 7 billion is expected to file for bankruptcy protection on monday gail tverberg gail the actuary is good with numbers she has predicted low oil prices and a consequent recession in 2020 she points out that world oil production has fallen since the fourth quarter 2018 this is in spite of sharp production increases in the united states as a result of fracking that make up somewhat for declining production in the middle east in spite of this decline in production oil prices have remained around 65 a barrel even though the oil operations producing this extra oil are not profitable at less than 80 a barrel if they would be then ms tverberg points out that fracking is such an oil consuming operation that the increased costs if oil cost 80 might still make these operations unprofitable in any case at 65 all the companies engaged in this activity have lost money the stock of chesapeake oil once the second largest producer of natural gas in the united states has fallen from more than 60 to under a dollar while the stock market has climbed steve schlotterbeck who led drilling company eqt as it expanded to become the nation s largest producer of natural gas in 2017 arrived at a petrochemical industry conference in pittsburgh friday morning with a blunt message about shale gas drilling and fracking the shale gas revolution has frankly been an unmitigated disaster for any buy and hold investor in the shale gas industry with very few limited exceptions schlotterbeck who left the helm of eqt last year continued in fact i m not aware of another case of a disruptive technological change that has done so much harm to the industry that created the change there are no longer any investors in these companies and no one will lend them money they are drilling very few new wells and their current wills deplete 60 in the first year tad patzek head of the university of texas at austin s department of petroleum and geosystems engineering has commented that companies are trying to extract shale oil and gas as fast as possible the danger of this is that we re setting ourselves up for a major fiasco he notes that after production peaks in 2020 there s going to be a pretty fast decline on the other side and that s when there s going to be a rude awakening for the united states he notes rather ominously that it cannot be good for the us economy arthur berman an independent geologist claims that the u s has only 2 years worth of tight oil production left given current levels of consumption he says that the us has about 10 billion barrels of proven plus proven undeveloped reserves left yet it is consuming 5 5 billion barrels of oil per year on top of this was the 96 downgrade in shale oil reserves in the monterey play in california last year by the eia which was meant to have the largest shale oil reserves in the us why can t these companies sell such an essential product at a price that will allow them a profit gail tverberg makes a good case for the obvious demand falls off above that price income inequality has at last pushed poor people to the breaking point when prices of oil go up any further people drive less or buy fewer durable goods the little people can no longer tolerate a price above 65 the sale of durable goods falls of sharply when the cost of oil pushes the prices up a good proxy for this is car sales car sales have fallen slightly for three years in a row prior to that china had been responsible for almost all growth which had been significant in light of a state that could be dubbed peak car in developed markets carmakers are particularly keen on tapping into the growing affluence of asian countries to increase worldwide car sales passenger vehicle sales in china reached 23 7 million units in 2018 and asia s economic powerhouse has emerged as the number one sales market for passenger cars market stalls on weak demand in asia however china appears to be grappling with an economic slowdown in 2019 although the economy is still growing there are fears that a recession may be looming car sales have fallen in china for the last two years the national auto industry body said total car sales fell 8 2 to just under 25 8 million in 2019 after having slid nearly 3 in 2018 in the first contraction since the 1990s december car sales in china dipped 0 1 according to the data marking 18 straight months of declines so even with a decline in the amount of oil being extracted the price will not be able to rise if it does the sale of durable goods will contract still further and with it demand for oil this means layoffs and still less demand the work of all economists based on an 80 price for oil is flawed the world economy is beginning to contract and everyone is on the edge of panic it is something like this dynamic that leads ms tverberg to predict a recession only this time with the oil depletion storm rolling in it is hard to see any shelter civilization is beginning a journey through energy shortage to social upheaval then on to chaos war and the end it is interesting that in the near term it is income inequality that is the apparent cause the inevitable conclusion either civilization as we know it with all the extravagance goes or homo sapiens will anyone complaining about climate change to name just one small part of civilization s damage who imagines there is a solution that will allow him to live pretty much as he does now is delusional indeed as delusional as those who deny the climate catastrophe completely catton s book demonstrates just how large overshoot was even in 1982 obviously it has gotten much much worse there is no alternative to fossil fuels and they are in decline we are beginning to slide down the slope on the other side of peak oil we will soon realize that we have estimated that we have far more than we really do only a plan for a corresponding contraction of the need for fossil fuels restricting their use to transition to a human world that has a much smaller population is worth contemplating that population will have to survive without advertising vacations in phuket and the military industrial complex if contraction to a population within the earth s carrying capacity is not done through limiting birth rate the four horsemen will do it such a thing could never be done through force from above it would have to be a plan embraced by virtually all of human kind who knows the sudden awareness of the dire situation might yet wake us up still it must have a leader someone who merely speaks what everyone wants to say one way or another the human population will contract and civilization will disappear in the near future already we see many states beginning to crumble into nations hastening the dissolution of the idea of a universal humanity and the possibility for world wide action the united states unable to release the butterfly of exuberance strangles itself in a cocoon of self delusion it seems bent on pointless war and national suicide the chance to see our situation clearly and act with purpose is small and diminishing if the human race could somehow manage an orderly retreat from civilization all we would have to worry about is the sixth mass extinction

performance for more details on these measures the most comparable gaap measures and a reconciliation of the two please refer to yesterday s news release and financial supplement i ll now turn the call over to alan alan b colberg president and chief executive officer thanks francesca good morning everyone we are pleased with our operating results for both the fourth quarter and full year 2019 that they illustrate our ongoing ability to deliver superior value for our customers employees and shareholders for the full year net operating income excluding reportable catastrophes increased 11 while earnings per share grew 6 reflecting the shares issued for the warranty group acquisition after adjusting for certain non reoccurring items which richard will detail later net operating income increased 15 and earnings per share grew 10 at the high end of our expectations these results primarily reflected the stronger than expected performance of our mobile business and full year contributions from the warranty group overall we continue to evolve our mix of business with about 75 of our segment earnings now coming from non catastrophe exposed businesses driven by strong growth in connected living we believe this allows us to generate more diversified earnings and cash flow in 2019 our operating segments contributed a total of 748 million in dividends to the holding company this allowed us to raise our common stock dividend for the 15th consecutive year since our ipo and return 426 million to our shareholders this positions us to deliver on our investor day objective to return a total of 1 35 billion to shareholders by the end of 2021 we delivered strong earnings and cash flows while also taking actions to strengthen assurant for the future we added or renewed more than 60 valuable client partnerships across our lifestyle and housing segments and launched several new product offerings to drive even greater value for our customers our targeted investments in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and other capabilities will ensure that we continue to deliver a superior experience for the 300 million consumers we serve worldwide these investments also were made possible by the 100 million in gross expense saves we ve now realized since 2016 our performance wouldn t be possible without the unwavering dedication of our 14 000 employees across the world they continue to serve not only our customers but their local communities as well with our assurant foundation during 2019 we provided support to nearly 1 300 charities focused on helping our local communities grow stronger most recently this included relief for the australian wildfires and the earthquakes in puerto rico in march we will publish our next assurant social responsibility report to share our progress on multiple environmental social and governance priorities which we believe are key to the execution of our strategy now let me provide additional highlights from the year for each of our business segments within global lifestyle 2019 was a record year as we increased earnings 37 to 409 million connected living was the major contributor as this segment benefited from several long standing partnerships and the market success of 10 new mobile programs added since 2017 as of year end we now protect over 53 million mobile subscribers an increase of 15 year over year importantly we cemented several key partnerships including securing a long term extension of a major client relationship in japan where we ve increased the number of covered devices by over 50 just in the last year key to our success has been our ability to drive additional value for customers by expanding our fee for service offerings beyond traditional advice protection to include value added offerings like personal tech pro and pocket geek these platforms allow customers to help solve technical issues optimize the performance of the devices and connect to live technical insistence all of which delivers a better experience as tracked through our strong net promoter scores in the year ahead we will look to further expand our services to include new offerings such as id protection in global automotive we protect over 47 million vehicles worldwide up by almost 3 million since 2018 this growth is the result of the strength of our relationships with global oems national dealers and tpas and the scale and expertise we acquired with the warranty group in 2019 twg contributed an estimated 130 million to global lifestyle s earnings after accounting for intangibles and synergies as we announced in the second quarter we ve delivered operating synergies beyond our initial goal of 60 million pre tax since the close of the acquisition while 2020 earnings growth is expected to moderate from a record 2019 it supports our view that we can grow net operating income by at least 10 on average from 2019 through 2021 and continue to produce strong cash flows in global lifestyle moving to global housing we generated operating return on equity including cats of almost 17 which we believe continues to surpass the p c industry average we benefited from a relatively mild cat year and continued growth within our multifamily housing business while we incurred higher losses within our specialty housing portfolio we have taken actions to limit our go forward exposure and improve results for this year within our lender placed business we renewed 16 clients representing approximately 60 of our tracked loans a testament to our superior offerings as we look to sustain our leadership position we will continue to invest in our more efficient and customer centric single source platform where we ve now on boarded multiple clients and have plans to on board others in the pipeline in multifamily housing we grew our renters policies to 2 2 million up 10 we re also growing revenue by 6 our focus remains on driving a superior experience for both our clients and renters we continued the rollout of our integrated billing and tracking platform which provide substantial value to renters and landlords to allow us to increase attachment rates going forward overall we believe the actions we ve taken within global housing positions the business for profitable growth in 2020 and enables us to further generate above average returns and strong cash flows in global preneed we delivered 52 million in net operating income after the one time dac adjustment in the third quarter during the course of the year we continue to leverage our strong long term partnership with sci an industry leader while also growing our final need business with new distribution partners this has allowed us to create a more profitable sales mix as we continue to generate strong cash flows the unique characteristics of this business including low mortality risk relative to other life insurance products steadily growing earnings and strong cash flows provides us with confidence that we can sustain operating roe of 13 in global preneed long term to summarize 2019 was a strong year for assurant we deepened our relationships with many leading brands delivered superior value for end consumers and strengthened our bench of talent all of this helped us generate a more diversified base of earnings from which we expect to continue to grow for full year 2020 we expect operating earnings per diluted share excluding catastrophe losses to increase by 10 to 14 from 9 21 in 2019 the range includes a 1 negative impact related to convertible shares being dilutive for 2020 eps growth will be driven primarily by higher net operating income across each of our segments as well as continued share repurchases we believe our 2020 outlook builds off a larger and more diversified mix of businesses overall it gives us confidence that we can meet our financial objective with 12 annual eps growth on average for 2020 and 2021 as we enter the connected decade we believe it will create opportunities for assurant as consumer lifestyles will increasingly intertwine with our connected ecosystems for example with the rollout of 5g and major enhancements to vehicle technology on the horizon we look to address consumer needs in both the connected home and connected car we believe that investing in our people customer experience and innovation should allow us to continue to expand earnings and cash flow over the long term to prepare we will drive investments both organic and through targeted acquisitions to scale our operations develop new offerings and launch new client programs while strengthening our infrastructure to support future growth i ll now turn the call over to richard to review fourth quarter results and 2020 outlook in more detail richard richard dziadzio executive vice president chief financial officer thank you and good morning everyone as alan noted we are pleased with our overall performance for 2019 i m now going to review our fourth quarter results and our 2020 outlook in more detail excluding cats fourth quarter 2019 net operating income declined by 5 million to 140 million due to the absence of the client recoverable in the prior year period in the quarter we accelerated investments within global lifestyle to support future growth driven by strong business momentum at the same time we also took actions to transform our it operations which resulted in 8 million of severance savings are expected to fund future investments in our infrastructure and cloud capabilities now let s move to segment results for global lifestyle this segment posted earnings of 97 million an increase of 15 when excluding 4 million of it severance and a 9 million client recoverable from the prior year period growth was driven primarily by continued mobile subscriber growth from programs in asia pacific and north america this was partially offset by investments to support business growth in global automotive earnings declined due to higher expenses to support business growth partially offset by growth in the national dealer and ppa distribution channels total revenue for this segment was up 233 million or 14 the increase was driven by expansion within connected living primarily from mobile carriers and oems and to a lesser extent extended service contracts within global automotive revenue grew 11 primarily reflecting prior period sales of vscs across all three distribution channels while our protected vehicle count increased by 7 for the full year 2020 we expect global lifestyle s net operating income to be up modestly compared to an exceptionally strong 2019 this is in line with the expectations we presented at investor day the main driver would be growth from maturing connected living programs launched since 2017 as always trading activity will be driven by the timing and success of new phone introductions and carrier promotions which can vary from quarter to quarter throughout the year we expect to make additional investments to support new programs and future growth our global automotive business is also expected to grow next year but to a lesser degree than connected living growth will be driven by prior period sales of vehicle service contracts auto results will continue to be impacted by the low interest rate environment and expected declines in investment income within global financial services we continue to anticipate declines in our legacy credit insurance business which will offset growth from embedded card benefit offerings as we scale our programs in the united states moving to global housing net operating income for the quarter totaled 73 million an increase of 85 million year over year largely driven by lower reportable catastrophes excluding catastrophe losses and a 3 million and 3 million of it severance earnings declined 8 million this was driven by higher loss experience primarily related to a client within our sharing economy portfolio in response we have taken actions to improve results including terminating certain coverages and we are continuing to monitor experience closely lender placed income contracted reflecting the reduction in policies in force from the financially insolvent client we previously disclosed higher premium rates and lower expenses helped to partially offset the decline within small commercial policies are now in runoff and results improved during the quarter in line with our expectations going forward we expect contributions from the business to be immaterial turning to revenue global housing net earned premiums and fees increased 2 driven by our specialty property and multifamily housing businesses lender placed revenues decreased reflecting the reduction in loans referenced earlier partially offset by higher premium rates the placement rate within the lender placed business decreased to 1 58 down 5 basis points year over year and 3 basis points sequentially reflecting our mix of loans in january we placed two thirds of our 2020 catastrophe reinsurance program and expect to finalize the program in july we secured additional multi year coverage with now 47 of our us program benefiting from this feature we maintained our per event retention levels at 80 million as we believe the actions we took last year combined with growth in our non cat exposed businesses provide appropriate risk return balance for 2020 as always we will continue to reevaluate our exposure for 2020 we expect global housing net operating income excluding cats to increase for the first time after several years of decline driven by expansion across all of our lines of business results should benefit from improved profitability in our specialty property offerings including the wind down of our small commercial business lender placed growth will be partially offset by the transition of loans from the financially insolvent client over the next few quarters lastly we expect continued growth in multifamily reflecting increased penetration across our pmc and affinity partner channels while still early we re monitoring claims from the earthquakes in puerto rico in january and believe that they will surpass our reportable catastrophe threshold of 5 million pre tax overall we continue to believe that we can generate above market operating returns on equity of 17 to 20 including cats through 2021 should the economy soften the segment has potential for additional upside now let s move to global preneed the segment reported 16 million of net operating income down slightly year over year due to a combination of lower real estate income and lower investment yields revenue for preneed was up 6 driven by us growth including final need sales as we continue to add new distribution partners in 2020 we expect global preneed s earnings to be up compared to 2019 reported results and relatively flat excluding the third quarter dac adjustment growth from existing distribution partners and adjacent offerings will be offset by lower portfolio yields due to the current interest rate environment at corporate the net operating loss was 22 million a 6 million improvement compared to the prior year period the decrease was due to the benefit from our annual consolidating tax rate adjustment and lower employee related expenses for the full year 2020 we expect the corporate loss to be similar to 2019 around 85 million as we continue to benefit from scale efficiencies interest expense should be approximately 81 million a modest savings from 2019 driven by our debt financing last year preferred dividends are expected to be approximately 19 million turning to holding company liquidity we ended the year with 534 million or 309 million above our current minimum target level of 225 million dividends in the quarter from our operating segments totaled 276 million in terms of inflows we received 27 million in upfront cash related to the sale of rights to future claims from our aca risk corridor program receivables in addition to our quarterly corporate and interest expenses key outflows included 109 million in share repurchases and 43 million in common and preferred dividends in 2020 we will continue to be strong stewards of our capital for the full year we expect segment dividends to approximate segment earnings providing us the flexibility to invest in our businesses to organic growth in acquisitions as well as return of capital to shareholders in line with our stated objectives subject to market conditions we expect the pace and level of buybacks to be somewhat similar to 2019 and weighted toward the second half of the year in january we signed an agreement to sell our interest in ike to certain management shareholders subject to regulatory approvals we expect the closing to occur in the second quarter this should result in an expected net cash outflow of approximately 54 million this amount represents the difference between the balance owed on the put call and the agreed sale price the amount could increase up to an additional 40 million in the event we provide seller financing at closing as a result of the pending sale we are required to further adjust the fair value at end year which resulted in an additional charge to net income of 33 million we believe divesting in ike will enable us to deploy our capital and management attention to our targeted areas where we can drive greater shareholder value in summary we re pleased with our results for the fourth quarter and for the full year 2019 which provide a solid foundation to drive continued growth into 2020 and with that operator please open the call for questions questions and answers operator the floor is now open for questions our first question is coming from mark hughes from suntrust your line is open alan b colberg president and chief executive officer hey good morning mark mark hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst thank you good morning good morning the investments in the global lifestyle business that was one of the interesting things in the quarter was the step up in expenses i wondered if you could just give a little detail about the timing of expenses the magnitude of that investment compared to the prior periods you re talking about noi in lifestyle being up modestly you clearly stepped up the investment in 2019 and does that continue into 2020 just a little more detail there would be helpful alan b colberg president and chief executive officer yes no mark i appreciate the question a couple of thoughts on how to think about expenses in global lifestyle first it s important to remember that we have an ongoing mix shift occurring in that business whereas we increasingly drive services and fee income you re going to see sg a growing and you re going to see the traditional underwriting or premium not growing and so part of what you re seeing there is just that mix shift and that s going to continue we are going to continue to add the additional services most of what went on in 2019 was really to absorb the growth which was extraordinary in lifestyle in 19 and to set up for continued growth in 2020 you also have the one time it severance that went through q4 which is also about setting up and helping fund the transition we need to continue to make to cloud to digital to even strengthening further our customer experience but we feel good about lifestyle s 2019 results and very well positioned for continued growth in 2020 mark hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst the sharing economy losses within global housing you described that as having an influence on the overall loss ratio could you expand on that a little bit more i think you described here is that one client any more detail would be helpful alan b colberg president and chief executive officer yes so let me provide some context on how we think about the sharing economy so as we look to the future and the shift in ownership models from owning to renting we see a strong alignment between what we re doing in the connected car what we see happening around rental and the sharing economy and we ve been investing in a variety of experiments over the last couple of years to understand how might these covers evolve how might our services evolve one of them didn t perform the way we expected this year in 2019 so we took aggressive action at the end of the year to improve the results and we expect those results to improve significantly as we head into next year but again the sharing economy very strategic for us and something we re going to continue to invest in as we go forward mark hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst is that to say it maybe a little bit of a catch up on the losses in that segment in the fourth quarter richard dziadzio executive vice president chief financial officer yes that that s it s richard hi mark yes that s right we had some increase in claims come in q4 and then put up some ibnr related to that mark hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst and then one final question you mentioned on global auto the lower interest rates having an impact on that business any way to quantify that for us alan b colberg president and chief executive officer i would sort of say if you look at the lifestyle the balance sheet in the lifestyle business there is a level of invested assets in that a lot of that is related to auto think about auto having some level of duration that s linked to the premiums we underwrite and the time of business we put it in so there will be a rollover in that business so as interest rates have come down and the business rolls through there will be an impact on the other hand the business is growing and so that will offset that and that s why we say as we go forward that the overall auto business will increase its profitability mark hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst thank you richard dziadzio executive vice president chief financial officer thank you mark operator your next question comes from brian meredith from ubs your line is open alan b colberg president and chief executive officer good morning brian richard dziadzio executive vice president chief financial officer good morning brian brian meredith ubs analyst good morning a couple ones here for you just first i appreciate you walked through the new catastrophe reinsurance program but was there any additional cost that we should expect from that program in 2020 maybe depressing margins a little bit in the global housing area richard dziadzio executive vice president chief financial officer well i mean i guess first is first i would say that as you heard in the prepared remarks overall housing is going to be growing next year really turning that corner so we think that s a great thing and a great moment for the segment in terms of the catastrophe reinsurance we renewed a big portion of it at year end we did have some uptick in the rates it wasn t huge that s been built into the planning and the 10 to 14 eps growth that alan mentioned earlier on the other hand some of our exposures will come down so that will offset the aggregator absolute level of the reinsurance premium brian meredith ubs analyst great and then another one a little broader so yesterday there was an announcement that the sprint t mobile merger looks like it s going to happen here i m wondering anything you can kind of provide on kind of opportunity there in timing how long does it typically take for this thing to kind of work them play out once the merger is completed and they decide on what carrier they re going to use alan b colberg president and chief executive officer yes first i want to congratulate our partner on what could be a potentially transformative merger for them and for the us wireless industry and i think we are in a good position with t mobile over the last seven eight years we ve become their partner of choice for everything they re doing broadly in the mobile ecosystem and that sets us up well to continue to grow with them so too early to speculate on what might happen and to be clear we said this in investor day we haven t factored anything related to new clients into our outlook brian meredith ubs analyst and i m just curious alan could you is there anything you can kind of tell us how long does it typically take post let s say a merger close or is it happen coincident with the merger close that decisions are made with respect to who gets the business alan b colberg president and chief executive officer yes hard to speculate on this we re an unprecedented situation with the merger of major carriers i would just go back to well positioned to support t mobile s growth into the future brian meredith ubs analyst great that s all i got for you right now thanks alan b colberg president and chief executive officer thank you richard dziadzio executive vice president chief financial officer thank you operator your next question comes from michael phillips from morgan stanley your line is open alan b colberg president and chief executive officer hey good morning mike richard dziadzio executive vice president chief financial officer good morning mike michael phillips morgan stanley analyst good morning guys good morning thanks i guess first off on the guidance i want to talk about that a little bit the 6 the 10 to 14 starting with the 9 21 from this year i guess if you adjust the 9 21 for some the items this year that s obviously some moving parts but if you can bring that up maybe from the severance to the dac and you bring it up to maybe 9 50 and so i just want to make sure i m thinking about this right if we do that that 10 to 14 kind of looks more like a 6 5 to 10 which sounds a lot like the last year s guidance and i guess hey does that sound right am i thinking about that right and then if i am is it simply because of your guidance talks on the lifestyle being more modest this year versus last year or what would cause the guidance to be if i adjust that correctly will the guidance be about the same as last year thanks alan b colberg president and chief executive officer absolutely so a few thoughts on that first our outlook for 2020 is very much in line with what we had shared at investor day back in the spring of 2019 second we are continuing to invest and it s important to invest on the back of an extraordinary growth year in connected living last year so you will see us continue to invest in the migration of our infrastructure to the cloud which improves our delivery and reliability and capabilities you ll see us continuing to invest in the next product i mentioned briefly id protection but we have a whole pipeline of things that we re going to embed into our offerings in the years ahead that also creates additional future profit but it s an investment today the other thing i would say we re growing off of a much larger base in 2020 2019 had the benefit of a full year of really capturing the warranty group synergies and driving that into our business that s good news but creates a much larger starting point as we head into 2020 the final couple of things i d say on it is it s early in the year we are being appropriately measured in how we think about the outlook when we set an expectation we fully intend to meet that expectation and we have a strong pipeline that if that develops this year as we ve talked about in the past if we launched another new program another client that will actually hurt in the short term in earnings but it s a very positive long term development for our shareholders michael phillips morgan stanley analyst okay great thank you very much for that i guess a quick one on the ike the ike investment and i guess what are your expectations there for maybe some capital releases that fits upon our cash outlay in the second quarter but any capital releases that may come from that and expectations on how that may get deployed this year alan b colberg president and chief executive officer so i ll ask richard to answer that in just a minute but i think it s important just to remind everyone the context of why we made the decision to exit ike that investment was originally put in place seven years ago in a very different assurant and it was put in place with the objective to really grow scale in latin america as well as potentially expand some fee income opportunities with the warranty group deal we are in a much stronger position in latin america and international and it just became not nearly as strategically relevant and we are trying to focus our efforts around our true growth businesses and so that led to the decision and then richard do you want to answer the question richard dziadzio executive vice president chief financial officer right just in terms of the overall cash that that would free up our liquidity think about i mean obviously we have a cash outflow with the that could put call and the price we re selling it for the overall cash out that would be freed up would be about a 100 million i think 100 million think about it in that level and again as we talked about at investor day that would go to potentially fund incremental organic growth as alan just talked about the momentum we have behind us it would go to m a and it would go to capital repurchases so really keeping that discipline that we ve had all along and thinking about where is the best way to employ that that new capital michael phillips morgan stanley analyst okay perfect thank you that s very helpful and then just lastly a little bit on global housing you ve talked a lot about kind of expense savings and efficiencies there and i wonder if you could elaborate more on what we can expect going forward from here for this year alan b colberg president and chief executive officer yes so i ll start and richard feel free to add on to it first of all we were disappointed in the 2019 results of housing but i think we took actions collectively that put housing into a much better position as we head into 2020 if you look at lender placed homeowners extraordinary progress last year kind of an consolidating our franchise beginning to make real progress in converting clients to our single source processing system which will continue that affects our expenses every time we convert one we can then reduce some expenses related to that so that business is well positioned and with the reductions we ve taken in the retention on the hurricane exposure we feel good about that business multifamily althought the growth was a little bit slower it s still above market we continue to gain share and we have consolidated our position there by investing in digital and being able to provide a new way to acquire that product and then finally in specialty obviously the real disappointments last year but at the end of the day we re running experiments if they work great and then we scale them if they don t we take decisive action and as you heard richard say we did that in a small commercial and it s now going to be kind of immaterial in 2020 richard dziadzio executive vice president chief financial officer i would just add just overall we have a great expense discipline in the company and culture in the company so we are looking at across the board to make sure we re leveraging the power of the size that we have so that s one thing i guess in terms of the ratio itself expense ratio has we ve cut down a couple of these businesses that haven t been positive for us you might see a little pressure on that but not much at all and then the last thing i d say is if you look at our combined ratio on housing for the year at about 89 including cats it s a very good ratio all in and it s well within what we ve talked about at investor day michael phillips morgan stanley analyst okay thank you and just last one sorry i might have missed this but so a little confused on the lifestyle side kind of increases there for expenses this year versus last year in terms of the investments i mean you talked about earlier one of the questions but again i may have missed it but can you kind of maybe to allow a little bit more on what we can expect for kind of a run rate going forward for the lifestyle expenses this year alan b colberg president and chief executive officer yes so to clarify maybe what i said earlier so probably the biggest thing going on in lifestyle is this evolving business mix where as we grow what s growing disproportionately our fee income and services those are primarily expense driven and so you re going to see that effect continuing of sg a growing faster than you might expect but it s because we re creating new fee income streams that are diversifying our earnings that don t have exposure or volatility really in those earnings i think that s a big positive if you look at investments hard to say exactly how investments this year were compared to last year a lot will depend on whether we re able to sign some new clients because a big part of our investment is when we sign a new client we have to ramp up the people the technology the marketing their filings etc but we re going to continue to invest this is a business that has a history now for many years of strong double digit growth on average and we see that continuing in the future so we re going to continue to invest in lifestyle michael phillips morgan stanley analyst okay perfect thanks very much alan b colberg president and chief executive officer thank you richard dziadzio executive vice president chief financial officer thank you operator your next question is coming from gary ransom from dowling partners your line is open alan b colberg president and chief executive officer good morning gary good morning gary gary ransom dowling partners securities analyst good morning i had a question on the affordable health care recovery was the amount you received the actual reduction in the valuation allowance and is there anything is there any additional potential on that alan b colberg president and chief executive officer yes so for those who weren t following the company five years ago this relates to the 2015 risk corridor when we were winding down the health insurance business we were owed a little bit over 100 million by the us government we did not think it was collectible so we fully wrote it off back in 2015 so we had zero carrying value we received a 27 million pre tax inflow as part of selling our right to that recoverable we also have a gain share if there is recovery above the 27 million but given the uncertainty that still exists to whether they will ever be a payment on that we have not put anything on the books for that gain share gary ransom dowling partners securities analyst so it sounds like the 27 million is sort of the post of the final part of the story alan b colberg president and chief executive officer yes unless there is some extraordinary payout on that eventually but yes for now that s what we realistically expect to get from that receivable gary ransom dowling partners securities analyst okay i also had a question on preneed you didn t really say a lot about the guidance for that business is that is there anything to add about what you expect on the operating earnings in that segment alan b colberg president and chief executive officer yes so i think the important thing to remember on preneed is it s a strong pretty predictable business that is delivering on average 13 roe which we believe is better than typical for that industry we have a long term partnership with the industry leader we expect slow we re not trying to grow that business in a meaningful way it s just a slow steady growth just growing with the industry contributing cash flow that we re using to invest elsewhere in the company gary ransom dowling partners securities analyst does owning that business if you any advantages or diversification benefits with the rating agencies richard dziadzio executive vice president chief financial officer well yes i mean it is it is part of diversity that we get overall i mean i put it into perspective though i mean given the size of it the relative size of assurant i would say that s fairly fairly small and i mean some of the headwinds we have an investment rates interest rates to kind of our part of what allows us to say that earnings will be fairly modest next year would be up relative to what we posted this year on dac but then fairly flat next year gary ransom dowling partners securities analyst okay thank you and i guess i wanted to also follow up on the reconciling in my own mind the guidance you gave at investor day with 2020 kind of being a dip in this path this 12 eps growth and then more or less recovering in 2021 is everything you re talking about today consistent with that from your point of view are there any nuances that you d like to add on that alan b colberg president and chief executive officer no i would say it s very consistent with what we saw as we were preparing for investor day last year i would say i think the business is stronger today with more momentum in a diversified larger base of earnings but largely consistent with what we had expected for 2020 and looking out into the future gary ransom dowling partners securities analyst did you actually pull for i think i heard during your original remarks maybe richard that you had pulled forward some of the expenses in this severance charge could you clarify on that richard dziadzio executive vice president chief financial officer well essentially what we re saying is at the end of 2019 we had some we had severance charges so severance charges would be that reduction in staff going into this year that reduction in staff would decrease the expenses we re not expecting that to fall to the bottom line but we re expecting to do is redeploy that in the ip it infrastructure the cloud capabilities that we mentioned etc gary ransom dowling partners securities analyst are there additional severance charges that might be coming as we go into 2020 richard dziadzio executive vice president chief financial officer nothing that wouldn t be outside bau type of stuff that was exceptional for us gary ransom dowling partners securities analyst okay and just one more thing on the sharing economy loss it sounds like there by saying you re correcting it and getting the underwriting or pricing right that there is some sort of loss characteristic of this business that s a feature of the business so to speak i mean can you help clarify is there something about sharing economy risk that is notably different than what you thought alan b colberg president and chief executive officer no this was really an issue with one client where we ran into some unexpected problems and how their business performed with us but overall i think we continued to be encouraged by the progress there and ultimately see some of the products and capabilities there being integrated into our offerings around the auto for example gary ransom dowling partners securities analyst okay i guess that s all i have thank you very much richard dziadzio executive vice president chief financial officer thanks gary alan b colberg president and chief executive officer thank you operator our last question is coming from mark hughes from suntrust your line is open alan b colberg president and chief executive officer hey mark mark hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst thank you just hey just a quick question on the lender placed business when we think about rates in 2020 versus 2019 how is your pricing year on year presumably there is some underlying inflation on materials etc so what would one anticipate other things being equal kind of aggregate price increase if it is alan b colberg president and chief executive officer yes let me start on that i mean the good news on lender placed is that businesses in a really strong position today we ve addressed all of the regulatory issues now many years in the past our rates are ordinary course they reflect our experience and on balance rates are going up mark hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst any way to characterize that low single mid single richard dziadzio executive vice president chief financial officer i guess the way that we look at it is we look at the rates but we also look at the placement rates so overall what is the impact on the profitability of the business and we ve seen that the rates i mean obviously they vary by state to state but as alan said overall there are up and they offset or partially offset kind of the placement rate the decrease in the placement rate that we have so it kind of balancing it to a certain extent mark hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst thank you richard dziadzio executive vice president chief financial officer okay thanks mark alan b colberg president and chief executive officer all right well i want to thank everyone for participating in today s call we re very pleased with our performance in 2019 and we re looking forward to another strong year in 2020 we look forward to updating you on our progress on our first quarter earnings call in may in the meantime please

washington federal reserve board chair jerome powell told congress on tuesday that now would be a good time to reduce the federal budget deficit which is expected to top 1 trillion this year putting the federal budget on a sustainable path when the economy is strong would help ensure that policymakers have the space to use fiscal policy to assist in stabilizing the economy during a downturn powell said in testimony to the house financial services committee in past recessions the fed has played a large role in reviving the economy by sharply cutting interest rates but powell has been warning lawmakers that the central bank won t have much ammunition left to fight the next downturn because interest rates are so low the benchmark rate is just below 1 75 percent far below rates above 5 percent in the past more government spending is likely to be needed to aid the economy in the next recession the fed chair s warning comes as the u s federal debt has grown by about 3 trillion since president trump took office and the president s latest budget proposal submitted this week would add another 5 trillion to the debt over the coming decade economists worry that so much u s government debt can dampen private investment by driving investors to buy public bonds instead of private ones a more sustainable federal budget could also support the economy s growth over the long term said powell who spent time before he joined the fed educating congress about the debt limit as a bipartisan policy center scholar advertisement trump blasted powell tweeting in the middle of the congressional hearing that the fed chair was keeping interest rates too high when jerome powell started his testimony today the dow was up 125 heading higher as he spoke it drifted steadily downward as usual and is now at 15 germany other countries get paid to borrow money we are more prime but fed rate is too high dollar tough on exports trump wrote on twitter the united states has never had a negative interest rate when asked about that possibility on tuesday powell said that s not a tool we are looking at economists widely view negative interest rates as only worth doing when the economy is in a terrible situation trump keeps calling for lower interest rates to further boost growth and the stock market for now the fed chair does not see any signs of a recession on the horizon he told congress that the u s economy is in a very good place and has remained resilient to numerous punches in recent months he expects growth to remain solid although he said the coronavirus is a major unknown for the economy we know that there will be some very likely be some effects on the united states from the coronavirus powell said but he was hesitant to predict how big of an impact it will have on the economy i think it s too early to say we have to resist the temptation to speculate on this powell said he reiterated that the fed is closely monitoring the situation for possible disruptions in china that spill over to the rest of the global economy advertisement powell stressed to congress that his concerns for the economy are more long term in addition to reducing the deficit he once again said there is a great need to invest in programs to get more people back to work and to boost productivity finding ways to boost labor force participation and productivity growth would benefit americans and should remain a national priority powell said the share of working age americans who are in the labor force is at its highest rate in more than a decade according to a labor department report friday but it remains well below most of the nation s competitors powell s fairly positive assessment of the u s economy was echoed by other fed leaders this week policy is in a good place the economy is in a good place san francisco fed president mary daly said in a speech monday in ireland daly was also careful to lower concerns about the effect of the coronavirus on the u s economy so far for now i m watching the coronavirus carefully to see if it has any longer term effects on the economy or deeper effects than we ve penciled in right now daly said but to date none of those have materialized send questions comments to the editors previous next
new york over the last decade the world economy has experienced a steady build up of debt now amounting to 230 per cent of global gdp the last three waves of debt caused massive downturns in economies across the world the first of these happened in the early 1980s after a decade of low borrowing costs which enabled governments to expand their balance sheets considerably interest rates began to rise making debt service increasingly unsustainable mexico fell first informing the united states government and the international monetary fund in 1982 that it could no longer repay this had a domino effect with 16 latin american countries and 11 least developed countries outside the region ultimately rescheduling their debts in the 1990s interest rates were again low and global debt surged once more the crash came in 1997 when fast growing but financially vulnerable east asian economies including indonesia malaysia south korea and thailand experienced sharp growth slowdowns and plummeting exchange rates the effects reverberated worldwide but it is not only emerging economies that are vulnerable to such crashes as america s 2008 subprime mortgage crisis proved by the time people figured out what subprime meant the us investment bank lehman brothers had collapsed triggering the most severe crisis and recession since the great depression the world bank has just warned us that a fourth debt wave could dwarf the first three emerging economies which have amassed a record debt to gdp ratio of 170 per cent are particularly vulnerable as in the previous cases the debt wave has been facilitated by low interest rates there is reason for alarm once interest rates begin to rise and premia inevitably spike the mechanics of such crises are not well understood but a 1998 paper by stephen morris and hyun song shin on the mysterious origins of currency crises and how they are transmitted to other economies shows that a financial tsunami can make landfall far from its source how the source of financial trouble can vanish leaving others stranded was illustrated in the delightful short story rnam krttva by the celebrated twentieth century indian writer shibram chakraborty in the story which i translated into english and included in my book an economist s miscellany the desperate shibram asks an old school friend harsha to lend him 500 rupees 7 on a wednesday to be repaid the following saturday but shibram squanders the money so on saturday he has little choice but to ask another school friend gobar for a loan of 500 rupees to be repaid the next wednesday he uses the money to repay harsha but when wednesday rolls around he has no way of repaying gobar so reminding harsha of his excellent repayment record he borrows from him again this becomes a routine with shibram repeatedly borrowing from one friend to repay the other then shibram runs into both harsha and gobar one day at a crosswalk after a moment of anxiety he has an idea every wednesday he suggests harsha should give gobar 500 rupees and every saturday gobar should give the same amount to harsha shibram assures his former school friends that this will save him a lot of time and change nothing for them and he vanishes into kolkata s milling crowds so who are the likely harshas and gobars in today s debt wave according to the world bank they could be any country with domestic vulnerabilities a stretched fiscal balance sheet and a heavily indebted population there are several countries that fit this description and run the risk of being the conduit that carries the fourth debt wave to the world economy among advanced economies the united kingdom is an obvious candidate in 2019 the uk narrowly avoided a recession with a growth rate a shade above zero the weakest growth in a non recession period since 1945 the country is also about to undertake brexit conservatives in britain have promised that a tidal wave of business investment will follow this is unlikely if there is a tidal wave it will probably be one of debt instead among emerging economies india is especially vulnerable in the 1980s india s economy was fairly sheltered so the debt wave back then had little impact at the time of the east asian crisis in 1997 india had just begun to open up and it experienced some slowdown in growth by the time of the debt wave in 2008 the country had become globally integrated and was severely affected but its economy was strong and growing at nearly 10 per cent annually and it recovered within a year today india s economy is facing one of its deepest crises in the last 30 years with growth slowing sharply unemployment at a 45 year high close to zero export growth over the last six years and per capita consumption in the agricultural sector decreasing over the last five years add to this a deeply polarised political environment and it is little wonder that investor confidence is rapidly declining it is not too late for countries to build seawalls to protect against debt tsunamis while india s political problems will take time to solve the union budget to be presented on february 1 is an opportunity for preemptive action the fiscal deficit needs to be controlled in the medium term but the government would be wise to adopt expansionary fiscal policy now with money channeled into shoring up infrastructure and investment managed properly this can boost demand without increasing inflationary pressures and strengthen the economy in order to withstand a debt wave the country s leaders must seize this opportunity the alternative is to adopt

conventional wisdom suggests that a church whose budget is not 100 percent supported by tithes and offerings is not sustainable we believe however that a coming revolution in church economics will necessarily redefine the notion of church stability altogether as an increasing number of congregations find they are not stable or sustainable by this definition imagine how much less your church would accomplish if it was forced to cut 30 percent of its budget it would probably result in a significant reduction of staff programming community engagement and giving to missionaries overseas such a scenario is already playing out in many churches across the united states as tithes and offerings are stagnant or in decline given the possibility if not a probability that local governments may someday assess church real estate to collect property taxes and or that the federal government could take away tax exempt status for churches altogether we believe the time to pivot is now there 1
the federal reserve takes the goldilocks view of economic growth not too hot not too cold president trump by contrast has made it clear that he wants the economy to grow as fast as possible in the short term even if that increases the risk of an eventual crash he wants lower interest rates and in pursuit of that goal he keeps trying to place loyalists on the fed s board his latest nominee is judy shelton an economist who has carefully cultivated the president by advising his 2016 campaign staying at his hotels and loudly supporting low interest rates presidents are empowered to pick central bankers who share their economic views but not to undermine the goals that congress has set for the central bank just as mr trump crossed a line in naming opponents of pollution controls to lead the environmental protection agency his nomination of ms shelton amounts to an attack on the fed s congressional mandate the question now is whether senate republicans are inclined to shake up the fed the central bank charged with moderating inflation minimizing unemployment and regulating the financial industry spearheaded the government s efforts to revive economic growth after the 2008 crisis but since becoming president mr trump has repeatedly attacked the fed and its chairman jerome powell for failing to do more including in comments this week
lebanon s association of banks urged the state on wednesday to pay a forthcoming eurobond maturity on time despite fears that such a move may compound the country s worst economic crisis in decades the 1 2 billion eurobond payment due in march is a divisive issue in debt ridden lebanon economists warn that payment on time would eat away at plummeting foreign currency reserves while bankers say a default would damage lebanon s reputation and compromise its ties with lenders in a statement on wednesday the association of banks said paying on time would protect the interests of depositors preserve the country s place in global financial markets and would maintain ties with lenders it said debt restructuring which some experts have called for could not be undertaken on time especially as it would require talks with international bodies the remaining period before the debt matures in march is very short it added lebanon is one of the world s most indebted countries with a debt reaching more than 150 percent of gdp it is currently in the throes of a severe economic meltdown and a biting liquidity crunch that has seen banks impose stringent controls on withdrawals and transfers abroad earlier on wednesday sources reported that lebanon will ask for technical help from the international monetary fund imf on how to restructure its public debt in attempt to avoid financial collapse there has been contact with the imf but lebanon will send an official request in the coming hours to have a team dedicated to dealing with technical assistance a source cited by reuters said credit rating agencies and economists have also warned of dwindling foreign currency reserves that have plummeted in recent months threatening import payments and a devaluation of the lebanese pound the local currency has already lost more than a third of its value on the black market credit rating agencies in recent month have downgraded lebanon into junk territory citing a high risk of default the lebanese government has never defaulted on a debt payment but some analysts say now may be the right time to do so repayment would weaken our foreign currency reserves and we will therefore have less dollars to import basic goods such as medicine and wheat said economist charbel cordahi who argued in favour of a deferred payment mohammad zbeeb an economic expert said repayment may further threaten savings of ordinary depositors who are already struggling to access money trapped under informal banking controls a comprehensive rescue plan must be developed including restructuring of public and private debt he said but a banking source close to the issue said that the eurobond payment would ease pressure on commercial banks failure to pay by march may have a negative impact on commercial banks which hold a large share of the maturing eurobonds said the source who asked not to be named because he is not authorised to speak on the matter such a scenario would put additional pressure on banks he told afp bank of america merill lynch in a november report estimated that around 50 percent of eurobonds were held by local banks while the central bank had around 11 percent foreign investors owned the remainder around 39 percent of eurobonds it said but these figures may have changed with local media reporting that local banks have recently sold a chunk of their eurobonds to foreign lenders follow us on facebook twitter and instagram to stay connected

last year was certainly a good one for us equities generating the best returns since 2013 says derek deutsch co manager of the clearbridge sustainability leaders fund we attribute this to a more accommodative us federal reserve reasonable economic growth and healthy consumer spending he says these factors overcame heightened geopolitical risks and anti competitive trade policy technology investments have been among the most positive contributors to the fund while holdings in renewable energy companies such as solaredge technologies ormat technologies nextera energy and brookfield renewable partners have also helped drive performance however biotechnology companies underperformed deutsch says this was due to a combination of competitive threats and negative sentiment towards the healthcare sector generated in part by the forthcoming us presidential election we remain modestly overweight in the industrials information technology and utilities sectors which is a function of bottom up fundamental research that integrates esg considerations in guiding stock selection he adds he suggests consumers may hold the key to success if they can remain resilient we believe the recent interest rate cuts by the fed will begin to have an impact early in the new year allowing the us economy to avoid recession and helping equities deliver positive returns he says underpinning a positive outlook frank caruso manager of the ab american growth fund agrees the us market has performed well and says valuations in terms of price earnings ratios are higher than europe or most emerging markets this is perhaps unsurprising as the us is home to the majority of the world s high quality growth companies that deserve a somewhat higher valuation he says current earnings are trailing market gains so accommodative monetary policy appears to be driving us equity returns he remains overweight healthcare and underweight technology healthcare has performed better recently largely reflecting strong underlying fundamentals and perhaps some softening of healthcare reform proposals on the presidential campaign trail he says however he views the odds of dramatic reform such as medicare for all as very low and uses swings in sentiment and prices to manage positions caruso says us economic growth is forecast to be higher than europe employment numbers are strong and both the housing market and levels of consumer spending are solid however he notes some potential clouds in addition to uncertainty around trade wars the 2020 presidential campaign and impeachment proceedings may sour investor sentiment and cloud the corporate capital expenditure planning horizon he says given this backdrop markets could become more challenging of course such a scenario may create opportunities for those willing to be liquidity providers in times of stress during the 2016 election year value sectors like finance industrials and commodities energy did very well so it will be interesting to see what this year brings he says risks and rewards the problem is that market sentiment can be very fickle and notoriously hard to predict says brad weafer co manager of the marlborough us multi cap income fund we prefer to focus on the fundamentals of the concentrated group of high quality companies we own he says he points out that on average companies in his portfolio grew earnings per share by 10 with overall earnings for the wider market barely growing we are quite happy with that result he says we saw strength in a number of our large technology holdings including microsoft mastercard equinix and apple weafer says the global economy needs productivity enhancements to support growth in the coming years and decades with population growth forecast to be lower relative to history and even negative in some regions the us technology industry is a global leader and both the fund and us markets are overweight this space he adds the fund s most disappointing holdings have been healthcare companies including gilead unitedhealth and johnson johnson demographic trends support a robust outlook for healthcare demand but drug pricing controls and healthcare policy have been a key topic of political debate specifically from the democratic party presidential nominees he says weafer believes the key issue facing us equity markets remains policy error particularly the risk that the current trade dispute with china transmits into weakness for the us economy and harms corporate profits given the complexity of the issues it s difficult to predict what the outcome of these negotiations will be he says what we can see is the negative impact on business confidence he also highlights declines in the conference board measure of ceo confidence to grow the economy and profits businesses need to invest he says as ceo confidence correlates with business investment the decline in recent months is not encouraging however weafer maintains that the outlook for his portfolio s companies remains bright and he expects the businesses he owns to grow ahead of the rate of the broader market ralph bassett head of north american equities at aberdeen standard is cautiously optimistic that the economy will remain on a firm footing even though he is retaining a high quality defensive posture that should enable outperformance even if he s wrong focusing on quality franchises with pricing power recurring revenues and strong management teams matters more than ever in preserving and growing our clients capital says bassett who runs several funds including the aberdeen mid cap us equity as we are now more than 10 years into a bull market with a likelihood of more modest returns going forward basset says his strategy of protecting investors in down markets will become even more relevant in the years to come while he d welcome a more robust growth environment bassett continues to see minimal risk of a recession given recent policy actions low inflation expectations and positive corporate profit growth the environment broadly remains supportive of positive sales earnings growth growth is expected to accelerate as we move into 2020 and given the reasonable valuations that supports a positive view for us equities crunching the numbers us equities dr nisha long head of cross border investment research citywire what a difference a year makes in the world of us equities in july 2019 the fed lowered interest rates for the first time since the great recession of 2008 and cut them further at the end of october 2019 in order to keep the us economy healthy and avoid a potential downturn this move has helped drive us stocks to all time highs however that didn t stop investors pulling more money out of us focused actively managed equity funds than in any year on record the chart shows net flows over 2019 in the equity us and equity us small medium companies sectors both waved goodbye to billions of dollars over the course of the year as investors de risked their portfolios due to headwinds in global markets and the uncertainty surrounding the us china trade wars tensions in iran and fears of a recession outflows in the second half of the year were particularly high as investors withdrew more than 10 billion each month from us large cap equities a slowdown in growth will mean the bouts of market volatility we saw in 2019 will persist this year even though company earnings are expected to grow the cost of labour company debt levels and profit margins may come under pressure in this scenario investors are best placed in us large cap equities rather than small or medium caps this article originally appeared in a special report on the us market published in january 2020

tariffs exceeded the ramp up of our productivity improvements we expect to resume sales growth this quarter and additionally savings from our global productivity improvement plan are expected to offset our tariff headwinds we continue to expect net sales adjusted ebitda and free cash flow growth in 2020 said david maura chairman and chief executive officer of spectrum brands holdings we continued to make progress on a number of fronts in the first quarter first we entered into an agreement for the sale of our dog and cat food manufacturing operations in coevorden the netherlands this action represents progress against our plan in global pet care to exit non core assets and focus our efforts on our core growth brands second we rewarded shareholders by executing a 125 million asr

non gaap financial measures may be useful in providing additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior periods management believes that organic net sales provide for a more complete understanding of underlying business trends of regional and segment performance by excluding the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations and the impact of acquisitions in addition within this release including the supplemental information attached hereto reference is made to adjusted diluted eps adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin adjusted ebitda is a metric used by management to evaluate segment performance and frequently used by the financial community which provides insight into an organization s operating trends and facilitates comparisons between peer companies since interest taxes depreciation and amortization can differ greatly between organizations as a result of differing capital structures and tax strategies adjusted ebitda also is one of the measures used for determining compliance with the company s debt covenants adjusted ebitda excludes certain items that are unusual in nature or not comparable from period to period adjusted ebitda margin reflects adjusted ebitda as a percentage of net sales of the company the company s management uses adjusted diluted eps as one means of analyzing the company s current and future financial performance and identifying trends in its financial condition and results of operations management believes that adjusted diluted eps is a useful measure for providing further insight into our operating performance because it eliminates the effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next an income tax adjustment is included in adjusted diluted eps to exclude the impact of the valuation allowance against deferred taxes and other tax related items in order to reflect a normalized ongoing effective tax rate adjusted free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments

economist intelligence unit has revised downwards its global growth forecast for 2020 to 2 2 per cent from 2 3 per cent previously citing new risks that have emerged following the novel coronavirus outbreak in china the virus originated in wuhan a city of around 11 3 million people in central hubei province china and has spread to most provinces in mainland china and overseas the chinese authorities are taking unprecedented quarantine measures to halt the spread of the pathogen which is likely to have consequences on the global economy the economist intelligence unit eiu said in a report global growth was sluggish throughout 2019 amid trade tensions a sharp deceleration in real gdp growth in the us china and india and political uncertainty in a number of eu countries in addition since the start of 2020 concerns related to coronavirus have increased threats to global growth it said noting that the virus is a threat for global growth the eiu has revised china s growth downwards on the assumption that the spread of the virus will be under control by end march we are lowering our real gdp forecast for china in 2020 to 5 4 per cent from 5 9 per cent previously the eiu said in a report the economist intelligence unit s baseline scenario is that the public health emergency within china will be under control by end march the suggested case fatality rate had stabilised at 2 2 per cent as at february 1 nevertheless the risk of virus mutation and of heightened transmission during the post chinese new year travel period and strains on the chinese healthcare system are grounds for concern the eiu said the eiu was bullish about india growth forecast provided the coronavirus epidemic does not spread to india in asia we believe that india and japan respectively recorded the best and the worst rates of quarterly growth among g7 and brics countries in october december it noted the report further said a series of government stimulus measures coupled with a low interest rate environment are likely to spur demand and investment in 2020 and to cause a rebound in full year real gdp growth to 6 1 per cent up from an estimated 4 9 per cent in 2019 provided that

to infect tens of thousands has shuttered businesses grounded flights and killed over 1 000 people so far mostly in china as the world s second largest economy struggles to get back to work after an extended lunar new year holiday analysts and bankers have been revisiting their estimates of the economic impact of the virus most believe china faces a short but sharper economic shock than originally thought one that will be felt around the world expectations of how harsh the impact will be vary widely however health professionals and economists say opaque chinese data and lack of precedent hinder clear estimates china s gross domestic product growth in the first quarter could fall to as low as 4 nicholas r lardy senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics estimated on tuesday that compares to chinese government estimates of 6 annual growth before the virus emerged however if the number of confirmed new coronavirus cases continues to decline then adverse effect on annual growth will be much smaller he added analysts from s p meanwhile estimated tuesday that the virus could lower china s gdp growth to 5 0 this year with a peak effect in the first quarter before a rebound begins in the third quarter the numbers are very imperfect and that s the basic reason behind the wide range of estimates said lardy everyone is guessing many economists and analysts are looking closely at the historical precedent from the sars virus spread in 2003 but when sars struck china s contribution to global gdp was just 4 compared with 15 in 2017 and chinese companies were much less integrated into global supply chains any forecasts are also complicated by the fact that beijing has a history of closely managing china s economy to hit specific targets and there were already doubts whether china s economy could reach 6 growth this year further much remains unknown about the coronavirus including its exact incubation period and the effectiveness of china s quarantine measures catherine troisi a university of texas public health specialist said tuesday during a national association for business economics call on the virus s economic impact the authoritarian nature of china s government could also hinder the response by making officials afraid to report problems she said adding the latest update of around 43 000 infections is likely an undercount it s a culture that shoots the messenger because of the bureaucracy local officials are afraid to say anything she said reuters 12 15 pm indusind bank shares fall

auto production to shrink by 8 3 in 2020 coronavirus spread may hit supply chain fitch fitch solutions on wednesday said it expects vehicle production in india to contract by 8 3 per cent in 2020 as the auto industry faces increasing risk of supply shortage due to china s coronavirus outbreak possibly hitting domestic output if the virus spreads in the country in china where the virus originated automotive manufacturers have halted production in order to limit the congregation of people and reduce the exposure of its population to possible infection and we see india adopting similar policies if the virus spreads throughout the country it said given that india s health care system is ill equipped to deal with a large scale epidemic the rating agency said the impact on indian autos will be much larger because the virus will likely spread much faster in the country when compared to china furthermore because china is one of india s largest supplier of automotive components a slowdown in the supply of china made components will lead to shortages in india and could force auto makers to slow or stop production as a result we forecast vehicle production in india will contract by 8 3 per cent for 2020 following an estimated contraction of 13 2 per cent in 2019 the agency said that it believes that the weak domestic demand for new vehicles will see india s vehicle production continue to contract in 2020 china supplies india with between 10 30 per cent of its automotive components and this could be two to three times higher when looking at india s ev segment which highlights just how exposed india s automotive manufacturing industry is to the slowdown of vehicle chinese component manufacturing it said fitch also believes that the protectionist policies presented in the country s 2020 budget with regards to electric vehicles will offer some upside potential for local ev production but it will be accompanied by increased trade risk pti 11 45 am gold flat as new virus cases

china s gdp goal on track despite virus impact says government economist china will be able to achieve its long term goal of doubling gross domestic product and incomes this year despite the impact from a conoravirus outbreak an influential economist at a top government think tank said on wednesday the virus outbreak will only have a one off hit on the economy and demand will recover quickly cai fang the vice head of the chinese academy of social sciences cass said in an article in the people s daily the newspaper of the chinese communist party although the temporary impact caused by the epidemic will slightly reduce the growth rate and other development indicators it will not delay the fulfillment of the goal of building a moderately prosperous society cai said this year is crucial for the ruling communist party to fulfill its goal of doubling gross domestic product gdp and incomes in the decade to 2020 a growth rate of about 5 7 this year will be enough for achieving the goal of doubling gdp and incomes cai said analysts believe growth could decelerate sharply by 2 percentage points or more from a 6 expansion in the last quarter but they say business and consumer activity could rebound sharply if the outbreak peaks soon much like the pattern during the sars epidemic in 2003 the government should use policy tools in a timely and flexible way and adopt unconventional policy tools to support the economy cai said without elaborating the government has taken some stimulus measures including injecting liquidity into the banking system providing re lending and fiscal support for some firms and more steps are expected the epidemic has delayed the return of migrant workers to cities and affected the resumption of firms operations which could lead to unemployment and lower incomes cai said regions that have not been hit hard by the epidemic should allow migrant workers to return to cities and let firms resume operations on the condition the outbreak is controlled

the 2018 general election was a momentous one for democrats still smarting from the stunning 2016 loss by one of the most unpopular presidential candidates in history to one of the most unconventional presidential candidates in history dems came out swinging in 2018 flipping enough seats to take control of the u s house of representatives and breaking the veto proof supermajority in the north carolina general assembly but one seat they just couldn t flip was that of n c s 11th congressional district rep mark meadows r asheville three democrats hendersonville physician scott donaldson pisgah forest college professor steve woodsmall and mcdowell county small business owner phillip price competed fiercely for the democratic nomination which ultimately went to price price proved the strongest competitor to meadows since he first ran in 2012 but price still lost in 2018 by more than 20 points during an election where dems made gains across the board across the country as the 2020 campaign began in earnest woodsmall again took up the fight starting his campaign in march 2019 for a long time he was the only candidate until mills river music producer michael o shea joined him in october a few days later courts demanded a re map of the district drawing retired air force attorney and administrative law judge moe davis into the district and into the race on dec 2 the first day of the candidate filing period davis who d just returned to his native state after a career spent elsewhere served for a time as the chief prosecutor in guantanamo bay cuba until his concerns over the torture of suspects at cia black sites led him to resign price had hemmed and hawed over whether to give it another go and on the evening of wednesday dec 18 endorsed o shea hours later meadows stunned the political establishment by announcing he wouldn t seek reelection to his seat the next day the last day of the candidate filing period price jumped back into the race joining davis o shea and woodsmall since then the four have been hitting the road across this expansive 17 county district in pursuit of the 11th district democratic nomination that will give one of them the best chance to flip the seat which still holds a 5 to 7 point republican lean in nearly a decade as with the serious republicans in the race there are but minor differences in policy positions among the democrats who ve been listening to each other speak several times a week for several weeks now and are even starting to parrot each other on some issues they re also well aware of the differences among themselves those differences are nuanced but significant and will ultimately decide who gets to face the republican nominee in november steve woodsmall the top five or six issues among democrats in this race are largely the same but as a retired brevard college professor with master s degree in business administration and a ph d in organization and management it s no surprise that woodsmall takes a 30 000 foot view of all of them the polls show that the top issues are jobs and the economy but when i go out and talk to people they re really concerned about health care woodsmall said my personal number one issue as it has always been is passing a constitutional amendment to overturn citizens united the money issue really is the root cause of basically all the problems we have now citizens united vs federal elections commission was a watershed 2010 supreme court ruling that effectively neutered the 2002 bipartisan campaign reform act by allowing corporations labor unions and nonprofits to make independent expenditures on behalf of or in opposition to political candidates in 2002 before the act was passed big pharma made more than 19 3 million in those so called soft money contributions according to opensecrets org but during the next cycle that dropped to just 2 250 after citizens united that number has ranged from 2 9 million to more than 20 million over a 10 year period during which an opioid crisis has ravaged the nation we can pass federal legislation to hold the drug companies accountable because they re part of that problem they never really disclosed the fact that they knew how it addictive those drugs were and they continue to really misrepresent that he said transitioning people suffering from addiction to rehab and drug courts instead of incarceration has been slow in coming much of rural north carolina lacks the resources to address the issue in that way we don t do enough in terms of helping people that have those addiction issues and we re locking them up when we should be giving them medical attention said woodsmall we could always from the federal level provide funding to support those kinds of programs access to health care is also an obstacle to recovery for many as well as a general quality of life issue that s been debated since long before the affordable care act of 2010 i m absolutely the only one for universal health care single payer not everybody in the race is on that page he said a couple of folks support the public option but i ve done a lot of research on this personally i ve gone to numerous presentations by health care professionals and the resounding opinion of the majority is that the dual track system or the hybrid system as some people call it will not work for a couple of reasons the first said woodsmall is that preserving the private insurance system maintains the profit motive in health care which hearkens back to his feelings about citizens united the second just from a purely business standpoint is that if you have a dual track system the private insurers are going to be very very selective as to who they will accept both in terms of for existing conditions and high risk and high cost patients he said they will only take on people if they know they can make money from them which is going to overburden the government system with all the high risk and high cost people candidates on both sides of the aisle agree that the nation s immigration system is badly broken including the obama era deferred action for childhood arrivals daca act which deferred deportation for children unlawfully in the united states the trump ordered cessation of the program is currently on hold in courts perhaps the most insulting failure of the current immigration system has led to the deportation of illegal immigrants who have served in the armed forces of the united states like moe davis woodsmall is also retired air force but by far the most visible failure is the separation of children from parents who are apprehended during unlawful border crossings we ve got to give everybody who wants it a pathway to citizenship there s a right way to do that but we re treating people who cross the border illegally as felons and we re putting them in cages and that s just not the way to do it he said that s not the america i think we want we fail to remember that this country was founded by dreamers for dreamers now that the old white people have gotten theirs they want to keep the brown people out which is absolutely ridiculous that s not what america s all about one thing america is all about is guns enshrined in the second amendment the creator endowed right to bear arms has led to the united states having both the highest per capita gun ownership rate in the world 120 firearms per 100 residents and the greatest number of firearms in the world almost 400 million or more than the next 42 nations combined one of my mantras on the gun issue in this country is it s not a second amendment issue it is absolutely a public safety issue he said other than the money from the nra and gun manufacturers one of the reasons we can t address that problem is because the people on the right are framing it from the fear perspective that everybody s going to take away your guns woodsmall favors reasonable responsible gun ownership and approves of restrictions on certain weapons magazines and ammunition as well as an assault weapons ban like the one that expired in 2004 we have kids doing active shooter drills in kindergarten on the first day of school with walmart selling bulletproof backpacks he said you know 97 percent of gun owners want more restrictions on guns it s not the gun owners that are the problem going back to my experience as a management expert a huge part of being able to solve a problem effectively is how you frame that problem and we ve got to do a better job of framing that problem for what it is which is a public safety issue bringing woodsmall s management and money focused platform full circle is the issue of the federal deficit which has counterintuitively increased during a purportedly fiscally conservative republican administration to levels not seen since the outset of the great recession in 2008 the deficit has been run up by the trump administration at the expense of the working people said woodsmall immediately after he got elected they added 1 trillion to the deficit right out of the gate and passed that tax cut for the top 1 percent the deficit is the difference between the amount of revenue the federal government collects and spends when it spends more than it collects it incurs a deficit and has to borrow to make up the difference that adds to the national debt which as of press time was more than 23 trillion we need to level out the tax base we need to look at where we re spending our money he said i ll say this as a veteran and people raise their eyebrows when i do but we ve got to look at the defense budget which is roughly 750 billion the real war woodsmall said is a cyber war and the u s isn t spending nearly enough money on it i tell people all the time i took the oath of office numerous times in the military very similar to the oath that people take in congress and that is to support and defend the constitution and represent the people that you re elected to represent he said it s not to represent big money it s not to be loyal to the occupant of the white house or the freedom caucus or the party or the big donors it s about representing people here and i think i can make a really good case to do that michael o shea as the field s only millennial o shea has maintained a message grounded in that identity and in the fact that he and his cohorts will be the ones to experience the greatest effects of contemporary policymaking for the greatest amount of time my top issues are economic inequality and climate change said o shea i have a hard time prioritizing which one is first because i think they re both super pressing and right now we need to be addressing things on multiple fronts most people in the 17 county 11th district are focused on the immediacies of poverty and health care access he said and those are largely issues of economic inequality the way they all intertwine helps sustain the opioid crisis although opioid addiction transcends geography and demographics o shea s fellow millennials were the first to bear witness to heretofore unthinkable levels of supply one of my best childhood friends actually went through opioid addiction after he graduated with a 4 0 from western carolina university he couldn t find a job in the great recession and i think that became a barrier for him in finding mental health counseling o shea said i think addiction directly stems from that as well as economic prospects when people are desperate they turn to drugs i think that s obvious unwinding the opioid crisis according to o shea is about treating opioids as a health care issue and getting the money out of medicine we have for profit insurance companies and a for profit health care industry he said i think that one of the reasons why we need to get profit out of health care is so there s no profit motive to push pills the same way we need to get profit out of the prison system so there s no profit motive to lock people up for their addiction problems profit motive is also partly at play in the nation s immigration debate employers can exploit undocumented workers with fewer repercussions than they can citizens and for profit prisons have been cashing in on the commodification of illegal immigrants housing up to 73 percent of detainees according to a 2018 new york times report yeah we absolutely need to create a real sensible path to citizenship said o shea recalling an acquaintance s reckoning with an extended aggravating process there really isn t one right now that doesn t take extraordinarily long it s no wonder a lot of people end up here illegally we can t really stop the fact that they re seeking asylum from their own countries but we can make there be a path where they can come and pay taxes and contribute to our society instead of simply being in a position where they can t pay taxes and they re exploited by their employers o shea s generation has also been among the first to grow up with mass shootings as a regular occurrence i was 12 years old when columbine happened since then the only major change to gun legislation that we ve seen is they ve let the federal ban on assault style weapons expire he said nothing me or anyone else on this slate are proposing are things that are wanted by less than half of america he said and most of these proposals are wanted by far more than that o shea sees the trade off between losing some of his own rights and reducing some deaths as being a fair one my wife teaches first grade they have to do drills for this he said no one is getting out of elementary school without knowing exactly why they re selling bulletproof backpacks at walmart deficit spending is another one of those long term issues that concern millennials like o shea who ll be making the interest payments on the nation s growing 23 trillion debt for a lot longer than his competitors no single generation s going to pay that off but as baby boomers exit prime earning years and the much smaller generation x steps up to service that debt it s millennials that will eventually end up on the hook yes literally i mean this is this is something i like to joke about that i m 20 years younger than the next person on this slate and i don t want to be living with it in my sixties he said the answer isn t in spending less said o shea it s in spending smart on things like medicare for all i m not willing to spend 600 billion extra in order to keep private insurance companies profitable said o shea of the potential savings he thinks implementation could provide right now you have one in five children living in food insecure homes and childhood poverty is socially costing us over 1 trillion a year the universal basic income proposal that i back would cost about 539 billion and take a huge dent out of the long term ramifications of poverty other proposals o shea says foster economic equality include an end to incarceration for minor drug crimes closing corporate tax loopholes fairer taxes for the middle class lower spending on defense and the abolishment of student loan debt a lot of my platform really is about spending more efficiently and getting that under control he said the things that differentiate me i think from everyone else are things like universal basic income i m the only candidate who s been talking about things like cambridge analytica and the effects of social media companies on election process and how to address the oncoming changes in our modern economy because of automation and artificial intelligence while o shea s millennial generation will have to live through the consequences of those decisions for longer than most but thanks to the proliferation of mass shootings the scourge of opioids and the effects of global warming they ve already lived through more than most phillip price like woodsmall price ran in 2018 and as such came into this race with a cross district network of supporters and a familiarity with the issues that affect residents of the 11th congressional district from murphy to montford i ve lived in six counties of the district for over 36 years and owned a small business for over 20 years as well as been married for 23 years into a family that has deep roots throughout this district price said as his campaign has evolved so have his positions while he still thinks that health care is the top issue it s rooted in the generational poverty that makes the 11th district the second poorest congressional district in north carolina and 393rd out of 436 congressional districts in terms of median household income i m supporting medicare for all he said it would increase funding for mental health and i think that s a big part of combating the opioid problem the health care system could have a positive effect on that problem my whole four legged platform is about improving the economic situation in western north carolina that would help with the opioid problem because i think that a lot of cases where people get hooked on opioids it s just out of desperation and depression due to their economic position when you re poor when you don t have a job you don t see any light at the end of the tunnel admitting that there are other factors at play price said that the opioid crisis isn t strictly confined to the poor although wnc skirts the underbelly of the opioid belt a massive piece of real estate that stretches from central west virginia down through eastern kentucky and neighboring east tennessee that can be because of different reasons like over prescribing of opioids and not understanding the power of the drugs and being misled by the pharmaceutical industry itself he said i think that they are guilty of pushing the drugs on the country and being misleading about their addictiveness streamlining the immigration system is another priority among both democrats and republicans but the dems at least agree on one tactic that won t fix the problem i don t believe it involves a wall said price i believe that we need to employ more asylum judges and case workers that can handle the flow of asylum seekers at the border so that we don t have to turn them away and i believe that we need to address the people in the united states that employ undocumented immigrants and penalize them we ve got to provide an easier path to citizenship that doesn t take years and years on gun reform price maintains a position that implementing stricter controls shouldn t upset adherents to the shall not infringe mantra it is not an infringement on the second amendment to require universal background checks to require registering a weapon as you would an automobile he said that includes re registration when firearms are sold so that if crimes are committed responsible parties can be located and held accountable it wouldn t be as easy for a child to get a hold of a weapon or a neighbor or friend or a spouse or somebody because people would be more conscious about where that weapon is at all times price said the nation s growing budget deficit results from two components income and expenditure price has ideas about both the first thing i would do is rework the tax code we have to get the 1 percent the wealthiest at the top to pay their fair share and we must get corporations to actually pay taxes he said many many corporations pay zero percent that ain t right on the spending side price notes that taxpayers pay approximately 300 billion a year for bodyguards whose mission is essentially to protect the interests of oil companies overseas according to reagan era secretary of the navy john lehman that s almost half of all military spending we the taxpayers are paying basically mercenaries to protect a private industry s product overseas he said that ties into my environmental policy we ve got to get off of fossil fuel immediately and as soon as we have no more interest in fossil fuels there s 300 billion plus in our budget that could be reallocated somewhere else like health care if he again receives the democratic nomination in the 11th district price will draw on a life lived in the western north carolina mountains as inspiration for his campaign against whomever emerges from the republican side i aspire to not just represent my party i am running for this office to represent every single person in the 11th district the reason that i believe that i m the best choice for that job is that i have the most comprehensive understanding of who the people are how they live and where they live i am a product of western north carolina i have friends who live in single wide trailers and some who live in million dollar homes i get along with all of them to represent a group of people you must be one of them and i am one of us moe davis a bit of a celebrity before he even entered the race shelby native col morris davis is a familiar face to regular viewers of abc cnn msnbc nbc npr and fox news and has a social media presence that ranges far and wide but still he admits he s a bit behind in his efforts the biggest challenge right now is just time as i was the last one to start running after it became apparent that they were going to un gerrymander the district said davis i think we ve had a fundraising advantage over the other candidates so we re able to do advertising and that kind of outreach that they can t afford to do from a legal or law enforcement perspective davis says that the opioid crisis is a multifaceted problem but there are steps that can be taken on a federal level there s not a whole lot of difference between what s happened with opioids and your regular drug cartel selling other drugs he said it was apparent that the company knew the addictive properties they knew they were marketing to people that in many cases didn t need the product you had doctors that were willing to violate their oath in order to profit off of it and i think if we had a robust criminal prosecution of the enablers it would be a real deterrent because something else will come along behind this as the next drug crisis the health care industry is a cause of and perhaps a solution to the negative impact of opioids davis position on health care differs from his opponents most notably woodsmall in that he thinks there s still a place for a private option my position is that health care is a fundamental human right everyone should have the ability to get treatment whether it s mental health or the flu he said i would support making a government funded healthcare program available to everyone what he wouldn t do is advocate for that to be the only option many of the labor unions have negotiated good health care for their members and there s some people that have health care that they like davis said the bottom line is we ve got to have some of those republican votes and if you say we re going to force you onto a government plan and you have no choice we ll be sitting around two years from now trying to figure out how we can flip this district immigration reform for davis means holding employers who hire illegal immigrants accountable like our president who s hired dozens of undocumented workers because they re easy to exploit he said right now the system focuses on the powerless rather than the powerful so if you put trump in prison for a couple of weeks i imagine that employers would take their obligation more seriously than they do davis also decries the elimination of daca deferrals the deportation of veterans and the scarcity of resources needed to process immigration requests i retired as an administrative law judge for the department of labor and i ve got friends that are immigration judges he said they re just overwhelmed with cases a lot of the folks coming to the border are legitimate asylum seekers that are fleeing poverty and persecution and we need to have more judges in place so they get a prompt hearing on their asylum claims rather than being turned away as a hunter who grew up in rural cleveland county as well as a career military veteran davis holds strong feelings on the second amendment if you ve seen the jim davis ad him standing there with a pistol and a pile of cheeseburgers he said the liberal democrats are going to come take your guns and your cheeseburgers he said he says he s going to go to washington and stand up and fight to save your guns and your cheeseburgers well i ve got guns and a grill so his argument is what i would call fake news in a perfect world only military personnel have assault weapons according to davis he supports a constitutional right to own pistols rifles and shotguns as well as stricter background checks and red flag laws he also supports a national policy that would allow for more than just those three firearms but only after extensive training testing and licensing finally in reference to the deficit davis blames the trump tax cuts and a bloated military budget i would begin by repealing the trump tax cuts and that would essentially put us back to zero he said i taught fiscal law at the air force jag school in my view our fiscal policy is upside down and top driven rather than bottom lifting we have a system where at the end of the fiscal year in september you re encouraged to go out and spend every penny you ve got because if you don t spend it this year you obviously don t need it next year as to the effect trump will have on the race for the 11th congressional district seat currently held by one of his biggest supporters davis believes that trump has done himself and his party few favors over the past few years clearly democrats are energized and they re going to turn out and they re going to vote he said i think there are enough of those old traditional reagan republicans out there that are offended by trump s conduct and offended by those that enable it they re offended by the debt and the deficit i think that i can win over those disaffected republicans that believe in sanity so i m as optimistic i can win in march as i can win in november north carolina house district 11 democrats moe

net revenues adjusted net revenues offset distribution related payments to third parties as well as amortization of deferred sales commissions against distribution revenues we believe offsetting net revenues by distribution related payments is useful for our investors and other users of our financial statements because such presentation appropriately reflects the nature of these costs as pass through payments to third parties who perform functions on behalf of our sponsored mutual funds and or shareholders of these funds we offset amortization of deferred sales commissions against net revenues because such costs over time essentially offset our distribution revenues we also exclude additional pass through expenses we incur primarily through our transfer agency that are reimbursed and recorded as fees in revenues these fees do not affect operating income but they do affect our operating margin as such we exclude these fees from adjusted net revenues we adjust for the revenue impact of consolidating company sponsored investment funds by eliminating the consolidated company sponsored investment funds revenues and including ab s fees from such consolidated company sponsored investment funds and ab s investment gains and losses on its investments in such consolidated company sponsored investment funds that were eliminated in consolidation adjusted net revenues exclude investment gains and losses and dividends and interest on employee long term incentive compensation related investments on january 1 2018 as a result of our adoption of asc 606 we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment net of tax of 35 0 million to partners capital in the consolidated statement of financial condition this amount represents carried interest distributions of 77 9 million previously received net of revenue sharing payments to investment team members of 42 7 million with respect to which it is probable that significant reversal will not occur these amounts were included in adjusted net revenues and adjusted operating income in the first quarter of 2018 lastly during 2017 we excluded a realized gain of 4 6 million on the exchange of software technology for an ownership stake in a third party provider of financial market data and trading tools during 2018 we decreased our valuation of this investment by 3 7 million adjusted operating income adjusted operating income represents operating income on a us gaap basis excluding 1 real estate charges credits 2 acquisition related expenses 3 the impact on net revenues and compensation expense of the investment gains and losses as well as the dividends and interest associated with employee long term incentive compensation related investments 4 our ceo s eqh award compensation as discussed below 5 the impact of consolidated company sponsored investment funds 6 the loss on the sale of a software technology investment 7 adjustments to contingent payment arrangements and 8 the revenues and expenses associated with the implementation of asc 606 discussed above real estate charges credits have been excluded because they are not considered part of our core operating results when comparing financial results from period to period and to industry peers however beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019 real estate charges credits while excluded in the period in which the charges credits are recorded are included ratably over the remaining applicable lease term acquisition related expenses have been excluded because they are not considered part of our core operating results when comparing financial results from period to period and to industry peers during 2019 these expenses included an intangible asset impairment charge of 3 1 million relating to our 2016 acquisition prior to 2009 a significant portion of employee compensation was in the form of long term incentive compensation awards that were notionally invested in ab investment services and generally vested over a period of four years ab economically hedged the exposure to market movements by purchasing and holding these investments on its balance sheet all such investments had vested as of year end 2012 and the investments have been delivered to the participants except for those investments with respect to which the participant elected a long term deferral fluctuation in the value of these investments is recorded within investment gains and losses on the income statement and also impacts compensation expense management believes it is useful to reflect the offset achieved from economically hedging the market exposure of these investments in the calculation of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin the non gaap measures exclude gains and losses and dividends and interest on employee long term incentive compensation related investments included in revenues and compensation expense the board of directors of eqh granted to seth p bernstein ceo equity awards in connection with eqh s ipo and mr bernstein s membership on the eqh management committee mr bernstein may receive additional equity or cash compensation from eqh in the future related to his service on the management committee any awards granted to mr bernstein by eqh are recorded as compensation expense in ab s consolidated statement of income the compensation expense associated with these awards has been excluded from our non gaap measures because they are non cash and are based upon eqh s and not ab s financial performance we adjusted for the operating income impact of consolidating certain company sponsored investment funds by eliminating the consolidated company sponsored funds revenues and expenses and including ab s revenues and expenses that were eliminated in consolidation we also excluded the limited partner interests we do not own the loss on the sale of a software technology investment has been excluded due to its non recurring nature and because it is not part of our core operating results the recording of changes in estimates of contingent consideration payable with respect to contingent payment arrangements associated with our acquisitions are not considered part of our core operating results and accordingly have been excluded adjusted operating margin adjusted operating margin allows us to monitor our financial performance and efficiency from period to period without the volatility noted above in our discussion of adjusted operating income and to compare our performance to industry peers on a basis that better reflects our performance in our core business adjusted operating margin is derived by dividing adjusted operating income by adjusted net revenues view original content source alliancebernstein
promises made promises kept has been one of president trump s frequent boasts in his campaign for a second term so it was a little awkward this week when his own proposed budget acknowledged in the fine print that several of his key promises haven t been kept at all advertisement when trump ran in 2016 he promised that if congress enacted big tax cuts for corporations economic growth would soar to 4 or more i actually think we can go higher he said he promised to balance the federal budget in eight years a longstanding republican aim that those economic growth rates could make possible neither goal is being met not even close in 2017 a republican congress approved trump s corporate tax cut it gave the economy a boost but only a temporary one growth reached 2 9 in 2018 but slowed to 2 3 last year it s running about 2 now according to private sector economists advertisement that has extended the long economic expansion that began under president obama as well as reduced unemployment and raised wages all good things but it s far short of trump s initial 4 promise and it s done nothing to balance the federal budget quite the contrary trump s tax cut ballooned the deficit by about 1 trillion a year and his new budget forecasts that pace to continue to which trump s budget chief said as he unveiled the new budget this week never mind this president is a promises made promises kept kind of president russell vought the acting director of the office of management and budget told reporters advertisement the promises are still there he said they ve just been scaled back they re also still wildly unrealistic trump s proposed budget forecasts 2 8 growth this year growing to a steady 3 after that those numbers are way above reputable economists estimates with 3 growth vought said the federal budget could come into balance 15 years from now in 2035 that s 10 years later than trump promised but who s counting his pie in the sky growth number is what budgeteers call a magic asterisk a statistical device that allows a president to claim that he s meeting his goals even when he s not obama and earlier presidents used them too advertisement but trump s election year budget plan uses a second magic asterisk to made the deficit look better it assumes that the federal reserve will keep interests low for the next 10 years which will reduce the cost of interest on the national debt that s a wish more than a forecast and a third magic asterisk maybe the biggest it assumes congress will enact all of trump s proposed cuts in domestic spending from obamacare and medicaid to environmental protection and the centers for disease control and prevention advertisement that s not going to happen house democrats have promised to resist draconian cuts in the social safety net health and the environment just as they did last year and the year before republicans in the senate have rejected many of trump s proposals too including cuts in farm subsidies and foreign aid many of his domestic spending proposals represent other broken promises advertisement when he ran last time trump pledged he would not touch medicaid he promised to replace obamacare with a better cheaper health insurance plan he vowed to protect clean air and clean water he s done none of those things presidents budgets are often little more than a wish list that congress politely ignores but trump s new budget with that mountain of magic asterisks is wholly untethered from reality but maybe that s not the point as trump reportedly told campaign donors last month who the hell cares about the budget advertisement his 2016 campaign promises were always unrealistic you can t cut taxes and balance the budget at the same time without cutting spending so deeply that even republicans will blink so trump blames democrats for failing to embrace the republican agenda of gutting domestic programs we have not been able to make progress because democrats in congress have opposed his previous budgets vought said we hope that changes we probably need to have a national election before it does advertisement translation if trump wins a second term and the gop takes control of the house those budget cuts will begin to look possible many moderate democrats want to be fiscally responsible just as republicans once were and still might be under a different president but if a democrat wins the white house the first thing gop leaders in congress will do is demand a balanced budget and claim that democrats are responsible for the 1 trillion deficit trump bequeathed them advertisement all the democratic presidential candidates say they would reverse trump s tax cuts republicans will say it s bad for growth and unfair to hardworking corporations they ll claim the only way to reduce the deficit is to cut domestic spending don t listen trump s fantasy budget proposal shows how cynical that argument is
