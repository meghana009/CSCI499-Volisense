expensive currencies against the pound sterling of 2019 so far market participants focusing on the majors often mistake the pound sterling for the world s single strongest currency but as you ll soon see this isn t the case with the gbp ranking around fourth globally from the oil rich to the largest reserve currency in the world the following list includes a mix of both the unsurprising developed

open economy allowing for frictionless international trade and exports according to the latest data petroleum revenue contributed over 50 of gross domestic product gdp growth last year accounting for 92 of the nation s exports and 90 of the government s income while exceedingly wealthy the kuwaiti economy s reliance on oil exports represents a distinct lack of diversification and despite the

and over 60 of gross domestic product gdp a civil war between 2014 and 2016 alongside plunging oil prices which fell to seven year low during the period forced the central bank of libya to fund subsidies for fuel and food not to mention government salaries leading to an estimated budget deficit of around 17 of gdp in 2017 plans to transition the libyan economy away from qadafi s socialist leaning model have all but stalled amid persistent political chaos despite the nation s robust oil reserves and the revenue generated therefrom the middle eastern nation suffers from regular widespread power outages and poor living conditions including limited access to clean drinking water health services and general security so there we have it the top 10 most expensive or strongest currencies against the pound sterling gbp for 2019 so far looking at the above list a couple of common themes are immediately clear oil rich nations with a high reliance on hydrocarbon based exports and the revenue therefrom make up the largest chunk of the list it s not a hard rule however that oil reserves equates to a strong currency the two nations with the world s largest proven oil reserves namely venezuela and saudi arabia don t even make the cut developed open market economies make up the next sizeable group with this including the euro eur us dollar usd swiss franc chf and canadian dollar cad the pound sterling gbp would also fall into this bracket
if someone were to make a movie about neoliberalism there would need to be a starring role for the character of paul volcker as chair of the federal reserve from 1979 to 1987 volcker was the most powerful central banker in the world these were the years when the industrial workers movement was defeated in the united states and united kingdom and third world debt crises exploded both of these owe something to volcker on october 6 1979 after an unscheduled meeting of the fed s open market committee volcker announced that he would start limiting the growth of the nation s money supply this would be accomplished by limiting the growth of bank reserves which the fed influenced by buying and selling government securities to member banks as money became more scarce banks would raise interest rates limiting the amount of liquidity available in the overall economy though the interest rates were a result of fed policy the money supply target let volcker avoid the politically explosive appearance of directly raising rates himself the experiment known as the volcker shock lasted until 1982 inducing what remains the worst unemployment since the great depression and finally ending the inflation that had troubled the world economy since the late 1960s to catalog all the results of the volcker shock shuttered factories broken unions dizzying financialization is to describe the whirlwind we are still reaping in 2019 at the height or nadir of the volcker shock benchmark interest rates were over 20 percent and worse if you had bad credit the exorbitant cost of borrowing put tens of thousands of firms out of business and led to twenty two months of negative growth in december 1982 unemployment was at 10 8 percent closer to 20 percent if you include workers who wanted jobs but had stopped looking and underemployed workers who could not find steady full time work in absolute terms twelve million americans were unemployed that month plus another thirteen million discouraged and underemployed the nation s industrial belt was the hardest hit ninety percent of job losses occurred in mining construction and manufacturing it was costly for businesses to pay their debts and borrow money to invest while a strong dollar made american exports even less competitive internationally in places like flint michigan and youngstown ohio more than one in five workers was unemployed in akron the commercial blood bank reduced the prices it would pay by 20 percent due to the glut of laid off tireworkers lining up to bleed in the area around pittsburgh suicide rates and alcoholism soared while residents competed for spots in homeless shelters the unemployment rates for african americans were worse peaking in early 1983 at 21 2 percent up from around 12 percent already a crisis in 1979 those who praise volcker like to say he broke the back of inflation nancy teeters the lone dissenter on the fed board of governors had a different metaphor i told them you are pulling the financial fabric of this country so tight that it s going to rip you should understand that once you tear a piece of fabric it s very difficult almost impossible to put it back together again teeters also the first woman on the fed board told journalist william greider that none of these guys has ever sewn anything in his life fabric or backbone both images convey violence in any case a price index doesn t have a spine or a seam the broken bodies and rent garments of the early 1980s belonged to people reagan economic adviser michael mussa was nearer the truth when he said that to establish its credibility the federal reserve had to demonstrate its willingness to spill blood lots of blood other people s blood the point of all this misery was to halt the rise of inflation which had become a problem during the vietnam war and hit a monthly peak of almost 15 percent in april 1980 the cycle went like this if prices were high today people would expect them to be higher tomorrow businesses would raise their own prices to keep up while workers would demand higher wages to preserve the real value of their income people considering a purchase would tend to buy immediately while their money was still worth something and before the shortages appeared volcker was convinced that altering expectations would take a demonstration of determination that no one could miss contracting the money supply and hiking the interest rate makes it harder to borrow for investment or consumption harder to pay off existing debts and more profitable to save money all of this reduces aggregate demand and leads to a fall in price levels as well as a rise in unemployment did volcker consciously see unemployment as the instrument of price stability a rhode island representative asked him is it a necessary result to have a large increase in unemployment volcker responded i don t know what policies you would have to follow to avoid that result in the short run we can t undertake a policy now that will cure that problem in 1981 call this the necessary byproduct view defeating inflation is the number one priority and any action to put people back to work would raise inflationary expectations growth and full employment could be pursued once inflation was licked but there was more to it than that even after prices stabilized full employment would not mean what it once had as late as 1986 unemployment was still 6 6 percent the reagan boom notwithstanding this was the practical embodiment of milton friedman s idea that there was a natural rate of unemployment and attempts to go below it would always cause inflation for this reason the concept is known as nairu or non accelerating inflation rate of unemployment the logic here is plain there need to be millions of unemployed workers for the economy to work as it should central bankers like volcker can decide how much employment is too much because they are insulated from domestic democratic politics the world beyond the united states had even less say in the matter but it suffered more the interest rate shock was the trigger for a worldwide recession it also touched off a debt crisis across latin america where governments found the cost of paying dollar denominated loans soaring at the same time that the global contraction was lowering the prices they received for their primary source of foreign currency commodity exports events like these helped deliver the coup de grâce to the ambitious third world politics of the 1970s exemplified by the call for a new international economic order which had been sustained by a global commodity boom the tremolo of debt crises across mexico brazil zambia and other countries and the lost decade that followed was the overture for imf structural adjustment subsequently introduced across the global south it is easy to imagine a world in which volcker never became fed chair in some accounts his appointment was an accident jimmy carter s treasury secretary resigned the president responded by moving fed chair william miller to treasury suddenly there was a hole at the fed in the words of carter adviser stuart eizenstat volcker was not the first person offered the post what if someone else had accepted what if as his wife would have preferred volcker had turned down the job on the other hand the event lends itself to a powerful narrative of inevitability inflation was a crisis attempts to tame it had failed and so something new had to be tried something drastic volcker was less the demiurge of monetarism than the one selected to execute the plan that so many others wanted his appointment was not an accident one of carter s lead advisers admitted volcker was selected because he was the candidate of wall street this was their price in effect economist gerald friedman recalls i remember sitting in the lounge at the national bureau of economic research that day when everyone both economists friendly to and opposed to the carter administration understood what happened in replacing federal reserve board chairman g william miller with paul volcker president carter had finally caved to wall street s demands for an aggressive attack on inflation without regard for the social costs global forces also constrained american policy in 1971 when volcker worked in the nixon treasury the united states had delinked the dollar from gold without the money supply anchored by a scarce metal the only thing ensuring the soundness of the dollar and therefore its role as the world s reserve currency was effective anti inflation policy just weeks before announcing his shock volcker had gone to europe the new york times reported murmurs that the europeans all but backed him up against the berlin wall to tell him squarely that although america may take some perverse pleasure from its perpetual inflation its chief trading partners and allies do not in his recent memoir volcker suggests there was no alternative did i realize at the time how high interest rates might go before we could claim success no from today s vantage point was there a better path not to my knowledge not then or now he likens himself to odysseus lashed to the mast and unable to respond to the siren call of unemployed workers and failing businessmen what is surprising is that everyone else seems to share this view volcker s successor alan greenspan praises his gold standard like restraint as does anti fed icon ron paul those further to the left tend not to like volcker but they also deny that he had any alternative at least not if he wanted to preserve private control of investment and employment decisions most versions of the marxist story present the crisis of the 1970s as the result of a working class empowered by the postwar full employment regime 1 difficult to fire and able to find new jobs easily when they were workers made demands that threatened the system their wage increases bit into profits lowering the incentive to invest and their militancy slowed productivity growth shrinking the surplus out of which both wages and profits are paid even the oil price increases widely blamed for the decade s inflation were the result of a third world movement emboldened by american defeat in vietnam opec style attempts to raise commodity prices were widely called the trade unionism of the third world at the time the volcker shock altered this balance of class forces and restored the conditions of profitable accumulation at home and abroad if conservatives and radicals agree about the necessity of volcker you might expect liberals to dissent but they don t according to paul krugman volcker with bipartisan support began fighting inflation the only reliable way we know how rick perlstein described carter s appointment of volcker as rather heroic and self sacrificing and claimed the shock itself saved the economy even lane kirkland who became head of the afl cio the year of the volcker shock later told an interviewer that he had to do it that way in the face of inflation christina romer the leading voice for stimulus in the obama white house has said like all good revolutions the volcker revolution was the triumph of better ideas over worse ones among leading liberal economists only joseph stiglitz to my knowledge has expressed any real ambivalence we can describe the benefit of what he did which is that he brought down inflation and we can describe the costs but we can t know for sure what would have happened if he had tried another approach liberals at the time were sure there was another way they cheered ted kennedy at the 1980 democratic convention when he said let us pledge that we will never misuse unemployment high interest rates and human misery as false weapons against inflation that same year kenneth arrow stated his disagreement with those who suggest we use shock methods or a very severe economic slump to eliminate inflation it could have permanently bad consequences people don t get over a depression easily and paul samuelson argued that to change the present inflation growth path quickly will take severe measures which i m not for my personal judgment is that this is too severe a price for less advantaged people to pay many instead looked for a solution in the political management of wage levels then known as an incomes policy the phrase has a foreign or archaic resonance now but it was ubiquitous in the postwar years the simplest way to think about it is this since the great depression though governments in capitalist societies haven t controlled the commanding heights of the economy they nonetheless made it their business to manage the performance of the economy as a whole their main tools are monetary policy targeting the price and supply of money and fiscal policy targeting aggregate demand through taxes and government spending but sometimes governments have gone beyond managing aggregates to target something more particular namely wage and price decisions in particular industries enacted successfully this would allow the government to fight inflation without forcing recession and unemployment everyone would keep working at lower or at least frozen wages rather than some people working in fear of unemployment while the laid off sat idle and got nothing the us had compulsory wage and price controls during world war ii and the korean war and informal guidelines during the kennedy and johnson years from 1971 to 1974 nixon imposed the first peacetime wage and price controls even though they did not last the decade it was easy to assume that the future belonged to political wage setting in 1979 64 percent of americans wanted to revive controls the politics of how a permanent incomes policy might have been implemented is of course another question entirely capitalists naturally would be suspicious of political wage setting especially if it required them to share information with the government which had been proprietary in the us organized labor under the leadership of george meany was also an opponent of an incomes policy partly out of an ideological commitment to free collective bargaining that is bargaining with specific firms rather than with a central government agency and partly because nixon s controls had bound wages more tightly than prices writing in 1982 the radical economist stephen marglin had a proposal for overcoming labor opposition growth of real wages did have to be limited but he suggested that the left can at the same time demand something in return for wage restraint namely a gradual extension of worker participation in the private preserve of management prerogative neither then nor now have american labor leaders had time for such ideas james tobin who supported an incomes policy admitted it was a conveniently evasive term including everything from full fledged wage and price controls to wage price guideposts and open mouth operations without legal sanction with advocates like this it is not surprising that many people complained that an incomes policy was more of a phrase than a policy ultimately what is interesting is not the details of proposed incomes policies or the coalitions that favored or opposed them it s that before the volcker shock ended the argument very few people thought there was a market based solution to the inflation crisis most thought the path out led through more extensive government controls and planning deepening rather than constraining the power of democratic or in the us quasi democratic politics over private economic prerogatives a generation of historians following alan brinkley have argued that american keynesianism was powerful precisely because in promising to manage aggregate demand it foreswore any ambition of influencing the structure of production or distribution but keynesians like tobin thought the 1970s demanded a microeconomic strategy focused on industries and firms to supplement the manipulation of aggregates labor s qualms about wage and price controls remind us that the politicization of the economy and the extension of controls does not always or perhaps even often favor the popular classes but the point is that the incomes policy reminds us of a surprisingly recent past in which the economy was still politicized shortly thereafter volcker helped usher in an era of central bank supremacy a masterful exorcism of the political in political economy but as springsteen sang on nebraska released in 1982 the trough of the recession maybe everything that dies someday comes back volcker has his attractive qualities even for those unmoved by his crusade against inflation for people shaped by the obama rather than the carter years he is probably best known for the volcker rule which limits the kinds of speculative trading in which commercial banks may engage the regulation ultimately enacted as part of dodd frank bore some resemblance to the new deal glass steagall law which separated commercial and investment banking and which had been overturned during the clinton administration at the behest of then newly formed citigroup which otherwise would have been targeted by it even such a modest limit was enough to put volcker at odds with the common sense of the obama team i am sure tim geithner and larry summers would have been content if i disappeared he writes adding that the proposal passed with only tepid support from within the administration itself beyond his rule volcker has been a consistent critic of financialization he once told an audience of bankers that the only financial innovation that had improved society was the atm more seriously he believes we have done little to prevent another crisis on the scale of 2008 despite his hostility to certain elements of activist government volcker son of a new jersey town manager has always believed in public service his cheap suits and ten cent cigars advertised his indifference to the elite culture of the 1980s he has an uncommon contempt for think tanks policy institutes and elite law schools and he has lately taken to describing his country as a plutocracy and admitting that the concerns of industrial workers have been too easily dismissed with vague promises of job retraining the irony is that volcker played a significant role in bringing about the situation he laments there is no force on earth he writes today that can stand up effectively year after year against the thousands of individuals and hundreds of millions of dollars in the washington swamp aimed at influencing the legislative and electoral process if there was ever such a force it was the labor movement which volcker helped destroy in the economy as a whole volcker said in 1981 labor accounts for the bulk of all costs and those rising costs in turn maintain the momentum of the inflationary process the high interest rate high unemployment environment would moderate new wage demands and push unions to agree to concessions both because workers would fear unemployment but also because they would no longer seek raises to compensate for the inflation they expected but there was also a more direct path to breaking the unions volcker says the most important single action of the administration in helping the anti inflation fight was defeating the air traffic controllers patco strike in 1981 when reagan fired and permanently replaced ten thousand government workers and arrested their leaders the show of force had a psychological effect on the strength of the union bargaining position on other issues whatever the issues were he was right in 1979 twenty one million americans belonged to a union in 2003 despite substantial growth in the workforce the number was down to just under sixteen million after the crushing of patco those unions became less restive in the 1970s there were on average about 289 major work stoppages per year for 1983 2017 the annual average is thirty volcker also helped to bring about the orgy of financialization that has driven the american economy since the early 1980s as sociologist greta krippner shows in her invaluable capitalizing on crisis the high interest rates of the 1980s created punishing conditions for productive investment and drew economic activity inexorably toward finance followed the removal of capital controls around the world after 1971 and the deregulation of domestic finance that had begun in the late 1970s the result of high us interest rates was to attract an unprecedented flood of foreign money into us financial markets savings from other countries above all japan funded reagan s government deficits as well as the ballooning balance sheets of wall street banks along with a vast expansion in consumer credit while the high cost of borrowing kept real investment low and caused hundreds of thousands of businesses to fail all this liquidity flowed into financial markets in his memoir volcker writes the real danger comes from encouraging or inadvertently tolerating rising inflation and its close cousin of extreme speculation and risk taking in effect standing by while bubbles and excesses threaten financial markets statements like this make clear the connection between the scourge of the unions and the critic of the bankers between the volcker shock and the volcker rule both inflation and bubbles create fictitious money claims in excess of the wealth a society actually possesses leading to spurious gdp gains that must give way whether in an inflationary spiral or financial panic in both cases temporizing economists the enemies of practical bankers like volcker claim that things can be finely measured and controlled through fiscal policy and price indexes hedges and efficient markets and in both cases pride brings a fall from one vantage these sentiments sound like a fussy obsession with sound money and real value but critical scholars have also linked consumer price inflation and asset bubbles according to greta krippner the result was to transfer inflation from the nonfinancial to the financial economy where it was not visible or conceptualized as such a growing money supply understood to include not just dollars but new credit instruments which banks as well as governments can create still causes prices to rise but instead of causing a general inflation of all prices including the price of labor the new spiral affects only assets from bonds to houses to picassos enriching the rentier class but also creating instability as for example when the notional value of derivatives swells to several times the value of world gdp if this is the case the troubles of the 1970s simply mutated like so many other maladies of capitalism into new forms for most of 1980 jimmy carter remained curiously serene regarding the fact that one of his appointees had induced a recession in an election year he publicly questioned fed policy exactly once calling a recent interest rate hike ill advised in a speech that also went out of its way to call volcker an outstanding chairman the president s criticism of the federal reserve is regrettable said arthur burns former fed chair under nixon william mcchesney martin another former fed chair called it deplorable this concern for the sanctity of central banking has echoes today when volcker s memoir was published last fall newspapers questioned trump s escalating conflict with fed chairman jerome powell whom trump resents for continuing janet yellen s policy of gradual tightening after the long post 2008 era of quantitative easing and other loose monetary policies in the memoir volcker recalls being told by james baker reagan s chief of staff that he was under strict orders not to raise interest rates before the election luckily according to volcker he had not been not planning to tighten inspired by the anecdote interviewers asked if he had any advice for powell volcker obliged by saying that his message to chairman powell is be strong and follow your instincts obsession with central bank independence has roots like most things in america in the class war to raise interest rates in response to low unemployment rates even when inflation is low is to make sure that the ratio of surplus going to workers does not change that the vigilant central bank whatever else it may be is an instrument of class rule should not surprise anyone familiar with 19th century politics over currency and inflation the original gold standard historians have concluded became untenable around the time of world war i once universal suffrage was granted across europe the strategy of maintaining price stability through recurrent bouts of deep unemployment became politically impossible volcker wrote in 1978 that the fed s control of the money supply and the resulting high interest rates could provide the same discipline that was once a function of the gold standard the next year he brought back the form of wage discipline that is recession which had been considered politically impossible it makes sense that it wouldn t remain politically possible forever given the darkening economic outlook trump will likely continue to clash with the fed and we can expect central bankers to take their place alongside fbi agents and laundered neoconservatives in the surreal new liberal pantheon but there have also been signs of new thinking with vox s matthew yglesias writing that there is a decent size body of economists mostly though by no means exclusively on the left who argue that at the end of the day trump is right the fed has been raising rates too quickly not just this year but for decades and in doing so has hurt workers and laid the groundwork for political dysfunction for one thing economists may be mistaken about where the natural rate of unemployment lies or they may neglect the fact that higher wages can increase the labor force thus expanding employment without risking overheating or in a more daring rendition it might be that we could live with a slightly higher rate of inflation as the price of a high pressure economy but what happens if inflation does come back and at a level that everyone agrees is a problem what would we expect a democratic or democratic socialist president to do in 2019 the immediate problem is stimulating demand not stopping inflation but the question will come back one day and perhaps sooner than we think take the jobs guarantee an increasingly prominent demand of the new left the idea is simple enough the government would act as an employer of last resort ensuring that anyone who wanted a job can find one the left leaning economist dean baker has warned that this would unleash a serious wage price spiral unless we introduce other measures his logic is that affluent earners will have to pay more for services leading them to seek raises of their own to offset their losses not everyone agrees with him about the effects of the jobs guarantee but it can never be too early to start about those other measures debates about job guarantees green new deals and co determination make clear a dominant question of our time the renewal of political economy after decades of depoliticization trump made headlines last may by threatening to use emergency powers to keep unprofitable coal plants running an unprecedented intervention into us energy markets per bloomberg it was reminiscent of the late 1940s when harry truman threatened that if the steel companies refused to expand as much as government economists thought was necessary for national prosperity the government would build and run new plants by itself this wasn t mere bluster democrats in congress talked about nationalizing steel and treating it like a public utility while truman s chief economic advisor leon keyserling believed interest rates should be permanently kept close to zero as indeed they were from 1940 1951 after the crisis of the depression and the planned economy of world war ii ideas like this were familiar if never quite mainstream the intervening years saw the ebbing of such proposals and the triumph of a vision of the economy as a discrete sphere managed by technical experts above all by central bankers it is now clearer this state of affairs never completely hegemonic anyway was an exception in the longer history of political economy the best way to discover what was possible in the 1970s would be to test the limits of what is possible today

bahraini financial trouble bahrain spends much more money than its oil financial and other sectors bring in it is thus in the midst of negotiating a five year 10 billion bailout package with its arab allies that will include low interest loans spending cuts and a new value added tax the 10 billion aid package will help the country plug fiscal holes in the short term but will not substantially alter the long term rent seeking activity by the country s elites that keeps bahrain in dire economic straits as bahraini citizens are being asked to tighten their financial belts due to the country s economic constraints there are legitimate questions of how bahrain will come up with the money to pay for new military purchases as well as what they contribute to the kingdom s defense the answer is that no one outside the bahraini royal family seems to know the bahraini royal family is not obligated to put many public accounts including security sector procurement to scrutiny so there is little transparency or accountability to these purchases this breakneck but unaccountable security sector procurement spending may create pressures on the legitimacy and ultimately the stability of the bahraini regime large purchases of weapons come at the expense of paying for other items like housing and economic development those same arms are also often turned on the population itself especially the politically marginalized shia majority to repress dissent the lack of transparency and accountability over the security sector as well as the repression it metes out allows the regime to largely resist both internal and external calls for democratic reforms with a population holding significant grievances with the monarchy and a political economy on shaky ground large purchases without clear national security purposes means to pay for them or public accountability only further hurt the legitimacy of the regime this potential for instability has important strategic ramifications for the united states given bahrain s role as a key basing location and ally in the persian gulf it is thus in the united states interest to strongly encourage the bahraini royal family to improve its security sector accountability and transparency lest the lack thereof fuels domestic political grievances that may boil over and jeopardize u s objectives in the region bahrain s monarchy has ruled through a combination of coercion patronage and sectarianism while extracting significant rents from bahrain s economy yet this extractive and absolutist regime has fostered discontent among bahrain s shia majority and the population at large the bahraini security sector and in particular its unaccountable purchases of security related equipment and services contributes decisively to the problem of state fragility given its pivotal role in providing for bahrain s security and supplying nearly all its weapons the united states has leverage it should use that leverage to push the bahraini monarchy to reform its security sector procurement practices otherwise unchecked security spending and endemic corruption will threaten to destabilize the bahraini regime and imperil u s interests the political and economic anatomy of the bahraini regime bahrain is one of the smallest authoritarian states in the world both in terms of population and geographic area and it is in some ways an efficient regime with strong capacities to maintain order yet its monarchy stands in a uniquely precarious position as the country is the only remaining arab state where a minority sunni population rules over a majority shia one though bahrain keeps data on the demographics of its sunni and shia communities a closely guarded secret 2 a statistical analysis conducted in 2017 suggests that shia represent between 55 and 60 percent of the population 3 coercion patronage and sectarianism the pillars of bahraini regime survival above all the sunni royal family maintains its power through absolute control over politics the king hamad bin isa al khalifa has the power to appoint all ministers judges and one of the two houses of a very weak parliament he can amend the constitution at will his family holds twelve of twenty six cabinet posts including the roles of prime minister deputy prime ministers and ministers of interior finance justice and foreign affairs 4 most political organizations have been ruled illegal nonviolent opposition leaders are regularly arrested or exiled and the last relatively free media outlet was closed in 2017 the bahraini population is not quiescent protests have been a near constant reality over the decades including widespread demonstrations that threatened the monarchy s hold on power during the arab spring in 2011 however the regime s practice of surveilling arresting and punishing its citizens keeps a lid on larger protests so small scale protests are the norm second the monarchy selectively distributes patronage from oil rents to preserve a small but crucial coalition of supporters particularly within the security sector thus while bahrain has a per capita gross domestic product gdp of nearly 50 000 per year 5 the nation s oil wealth is highly unequally distributed throughout the population as is the case in many other gulf cooperation council gcc countries many gcc states bahrain included maintain various overstaffed and inefficient state agencies to absorb much of the labor force and spend huge sums on relatively large well equipped militaries 6 by providing targeted patronage to the security sector the monarchy keeps its ruling coalition as small as possible and protects the regime from any potential challengers as scholar justin gengler notes indeed why waste limited resources chasing citizens opposed to the status quo when they might be used to reward those who already have a material stake in its preservation rather than deploy limited resources inefficiently upon the whole of society rulers of distributive states such as those of the gulf generally seek to maximize their own share by rewarding disproportionately a finite category of citizens whose support is sufficient to keep them in power while the remaining population is comparatively excluded from the private rentier benefits of citizenship 7 in determining which citizens may be most loyal to the regime and deciding questions of resource allocation the bahraini regime deliberately exploits sectarian divisions the regime s policy as described by gengler can be described as an ethnic subsidy whereby a ruler co opts one s co ethnics as a relatively cheap support base that is large enough to ensure regime survival 8 thus rather than trying to temper sectarianism in bahrain the regime reinforces it the government uses electoral and legislative rules plus hiring practices and the media to institutionalize sectarian cleavages rather than ameliorate them the regime also moves aggressively against cross sectarian political movements and leaders limiting their ability to unite under common grievances using the politics of fear so common in authoritarian states the monarchy portrays the shia majority not as an aggrieved group of fellow bahraini citizens but as a mob backed by bahrain s arch enemy iran that poses an existential threat to bahrain in a version of protection racket politics 9 the regime portrays democracy as dangerous to the sunni minority and stirs up fear that the shia majority could vote in an iranian style government the bahraini regime can also point to the results of other arab spring revolutions in places like syria where civil war and chaos resulted the regime can thus win the allegiance of its key supporters by highlighting that it is better for sunnis to remain under the security umbrella of an oppressive state and receive the regime s largesse rather than risk civil war or subservience under shia rule 10 given its reliance on the three pillars of coercion patronage and sectarianism the bahraini regime has created three distinct groups first is the sunni monarchy and the inner circle of key supporters including elites within the security sector who receive an outsize share of the overall rents second is the larger sunni population who are generally supportive of the regime though this group receives a greater share of rents than shia it is still rather poorly compensated by the regime for its support last are the shia who make up the majority of the country but receive the fewest benefits 11 the privy purse the monarchy s dominance over bahrain s economy control of state resources including the massive security procurement budget is at the core of this model the same people who control bahrain s economy and especially its oil and natural gas wealth also control the security sector 12 a key aspect of maintaining control for authoritarian regimes is restricting access to information on state finances and economic activity and bahrain is no different it is thus unclear how much money is actually in state coffers and how much of the state s resources are expropriated by the monarchy and its key supporters 13 it is clear however that the royal family can extract billions in rents each year from sources as diverse as oil revenues land titles a sovereign wealth fund shares in companies and tax revenues there are some specifics available public debt is 88 percent of gdp and the 2 3 billion bahrain has in foreign reserves is barely enough to cover a month of imports 14 all three major rating companies rate its debt as junk and investors are betting that the bahraini dinar is likely to be unpegged from the dollar 15 it does not help that 70 percent of government revenue is based on oil 16 with its highly volatile price swings or that bahrain needs oil prices to rise to 125 a barrel to balance its budget oil has hovered over 60 per barrel so far in 2019 17 as a result hydrocarbons are critical to the budget 18 all mineral wealth on the surface and underground in bahrain is owned by the state 19 historically in an agreement originally reached among the british colonial administrators oil companies and the monarchy one third of oil revenues went to the privy purse another third to the state budget and the final third to a reserved fund 20 however when the abu sa afa oil field was discovered in 1966 which at the time became the largest source of oil revenue for bahrain its revenues went straight to the privy purse rather than the government budget in addition to the previously allocated third of oil revenues 21 this lopsided distribution of oil rents between the privy purse and the public budget was typical of countries that now comprise the gcc prior to their independence and the 1973 oil crisis when most countries ceased to publicly account for revenues 22 it is impossible to know with any surety how much oil revenue the monarchy receives but a 2016 study found the total value of bahrain s oil exports to be 92 8 billion dollars between 2002 and 2011 compared to total declared public oil and gas revenues over the same period of 39 billion dollars that leaves a gap of 53 8 billion in most of those years the value of the oil exported was at least double the declared public revenue while these estimates do not provide a definitive number for how much money is off budget in bahrain they do highlight the large gaps between publicly listed amounts and the actual value of exports 23 but the monarchy has more resources available than just oil and natural gas the next most obvious is land because especially in a place as small as bahrain large landowners are particularly noticeable the king and the prime minister the king s uncle own two relatively large islands off the coast of bahrain as well as a number of other palace compounds 24 a 2010 bahraini parliamentary investigation documented that about one quarter of the country s land did not have complete records the land registration board whose director is appointed by the king is accused of re registering public and sometimes even private lands to the royal family which has then turned over the deeds to developers for new offices or hotels prime minister khalifa bin salman al khalifa is reportedly known as mr 50 percent because he takes that share in the businesses to which he provides public land 25 the monarchy also controls mumtalakat bahrain s sovereign wealth fund which holds 11 billion in assets worldwide established in 2006 the organization has twenty nine commercial assets including some of the largest firms in the country such as gulf air the bahrain telecommunications company batelco and the national bank of bahrain 26 the revenue from mumtalakat does not go into the government budget 27 and though the fund is recognized for the transparency of its accounts as ravi shankar chaturvedi of tufts university noted in 2016 the fund s transparency is of little good when its parent the sovereign is shrouded in a veil of corruption 28 beyond its official holding company the royal family is believed to have a stake in a number of other companies often secretly held through cut outs a 2014 investigation by the financial times showed for instance that a private investment vehicle called premier group believed to be owned by the royal family had shares in projects worth at least 22 billion 29 in other cases the monarchy s role in various businesses is public for example shaikh mohammed bin isa bin mohammed al khalifa described as a political and economic adviser to the crown prince is the executive chairman of the mclaren group limited holding company which includes the mclaren luxury car brand and formula one racing team the largest shareholder with a 62 6 percent share of this 3 1 billion business is mumtalakat 30 on top of all of this the royal family ultimately controls the tax revenues to further help plug gaps in the budget the government announced a 5 percent value added tax that is beginning a phased rollout in 2019 bahrain has received loans and other direct financial assistance from saudi arabia in the past 31 the country will presumably receive more direct assistance as part of the 10 billion bailout yet even that may not be enough as the chief middle east economist for bloomberg economics ziad daoud estimates bahrain will need at least 12 7 billion to cover its expenditures and possibly quite a bit more 32 thus while it is impossible to know exactly how much money is going to the bahraini monarchy s inner circle it is clearly many billions more than the billions estimated to be derived just from oil rents this creates a massive unaccountable slush fund for whatever the monarchy chooses to spend it on including expensive security sector purchases and amid all of this average bahraini citizens are being asked to tighten their belts the regime s discontents sectarian and cross sectarian grievances during the arab spring bahrain was often a center of global attention as over one hundred thousand protesters demanded democratic reforms many of which had been previously promised by the royal family the bahraini protests began on february 14 2011 33 and at first they were largely nonsectarian with broad calls to reform the bahraini regime though as the protests continued they became increasingly more sectarian the monarchy soon found itself unable to cope and on march 14 saudi troops and emirati policemen from the gcc peninsula shield force arrived in bahrain the government soon declared martial law with mass arrests a curfew a ban on rallies and other repressive measures 34 this crackdown became a symbol of how brutal a regime s response could be not only were the protester camps bulldozed and protest leaders imprisoned but even the doctors who treated the wounded were arrested more broadly thousands of workers were fired nearly all of them from state or semi state entities 35 since then small scale protests have occurred regularly in shia areas and low level attacks against police and other security forces continue 36 but 2011 was hardly the first time there had been mass mobilization against the regime the majority shia had engaged in waves of uprisings and protests against the khalifa regime for decades 37 the current protest movement is made up largely of shia groups though wa ad a recently disbanded leftist group with both sunni and shia participation is also prominent a small number of shia groups are solidly pro iranian and some of them are willing to use violence the vast majority however eschew violence and instead seek reforms to allow greater representation accountability and equality shia grievances shia grievances center primarily on their political and economic marginalization under the bahraini regime particularly a lack of voice and representation bahrain s political system has been designed to exclude the shia majority as well as the regime s opponents more generally while bahrain has a parliament it is advisory only and its upper house is entirely appointed moreover severe gerrymandering has been used to ensure the election of supposed independents who are friendly to the royal family 38 when even that was not enough the bahraini government made it illegal for anyone in the opposition to actually run for parliament opposition leaders of peaceful political societies since political parties are illegal are regularly imprisoned stripped of their citizenship or sent into exile the prominent political societies have all been dissolved by the government sunni and shia communities are very segregated 39 so another significant grievance involves the lack of housing and access to basic public services with many shia villages missing even paved roads furthermore in shia communities many basic services are supplied by local charities rather than the state 40 according to a 2009 poll shia respondents were much more likely than sunnis to report difficulty in claiming official documents enrolling a child in public school receiving medical treatment or receiving help from the police when needed 41 the ghettoization of many shia also has a secondary benefit for the regime by pushing most shia into isolated villages protest movements are easy to contain in local areas with a few roadblocks preventing larger protests from reaching the city center as they did in 2011 42 the lack of employment opportunities is also a major grievance shia are explicitly forbidden from working in some sectors and informally barred from others 43 anyone seeking a sensitive job position in the bureaucracy needs a certificate of good history and conduct from the police to show they have never been arrested or detained including for political reasons this discourages many shia applicants and restricts many others to only the lower rungs of state jobs 44 shia have many fewer opportunities for public sector employment than sunnis with identical employment attributes while shia were likely to be in lower paying lower prestige jobs than equally qualified sunnis 45 a 2003 survey found that shia held only 18 percent of the 572 high ranking government posts 46 and in a 2009 survey all those surveyed who were employed in semi skilled unskilled or agricultural labor were shia 47 one of the job sectors largely unavailable to shia is the security sector 48 a leaked march 2009 confidential list of over 1 000 employees in bahrain s security sector showed that only 4 percent of employees were shia while 64 percent were non citizens most of asian nationalities the aforementioned 2009 survey did not find a single shia who worked for the police or armed forces despite the fact that the security sector is one of the largest employers on the island 49 the ministry of interior is believed to employ the most shia of any security agency yet even here the personnel is only estimated to be about 10 percent shia 50 furthermore the bahraini regime has stocked the lower ranks of the security sector with non bahrainis 51 as early as 1998 a financial times article reported that 8 000 to 10 000 sunnis and their families had been brought from jordan pakistan syria and yemen into the bahraini security sector 52 and they continue to be the most common groups along with a smattering of british in senior positions in 2011 a pro government media outlet reported that about 40 percent of the ministry of interior was composed of foreign nationals 53 in addition the national guard and police force are thought to be primarily staffed by foreigners especially pakistanis and yemenis in 2009 the bahrain center for human rights reported that almost two thirds of the national security agency s personnel were non bahraini 54 shia are also concerned that foreign sunnis are being brought in to change the sectarian makeup of bahrain in a country of less than 1 4 million people it does not take many new immigrants to change the sectarian balance especially when shia hold only a slight majority of the country 55 grievances over the security services were a major motivator in the 2011 uprisings and thus were a central aspect of the reforms promised by the monarchy in 2012 these reforms quickly stalled however in part because the exclusion of shia from the security sector is fundamental to the bahraini regime s strategy of survival 56 according to a leaked 2006 u s diplomatic cable the king noted that many shia complain that there are no shia in the military leadership of the country this is a question of loyalty he stated as long as khamenei has the title of commander in chief bahrain must worry about the loyalty of shia who maintain ties and allegiance to iran 57 shia exclusion from the security sector exacerbates discontent with the bahraini state overall in three ways first it ensures sunnis especially the royal family maintain control over the organs of power despite being a minority of the population second the bahraini security sector is a major employer in the country and exclusion from that sector means fewer good middle class jobs for shia and third with an enlisted force largely made up of noncitizens and very recently naturalized citizens who speak little or no arabic and have no social ties to the areas they patrol the bahraini security sector leadership can better oppress civilians where locals might balk locals blamed non bahraini security members for much of the violence during the arab spring protests 58 cross sectarian grievances more worrying still for the bahraini regime is that it is not just the shia who have grievances against the monarchy many concerns are cross sectarian issues such as repression corruption and the naturalization of noncitizens including in the security services anger sunnis as well 59 the regime s increasingly authoritarian behavior in particular has caused discontent across sectarian lines while shia have suffered the bulk of the repression sunnis protesting the regime were also arrested during the 2011 uprising 60 as of 2018 the number of sunnis being arrested interrogated and censored on social media seemed to be increasing 61 and even pro government groups especially those that had spoken out on corruption issues were under increasing pressure parliamentary elections were held on november 24 2018 with a runoff on december 1 but political opposition was not allowed 62 and many leaders both sunni and shia have been imprisoned new laws passed in 2018 prohibit anyone who has ever been a member of any illegal political societies or who has been sentenced to prison for more than six months from seeking to hold office thereby disqualifying many protesters and political prisoners 63 and while the standard of living for sunnis is higher than that of most local shia they too suffer from the poor economy the 5 percent value added tax will further add to that burden 64 and subsidies for meat cooking oil and other necessities have been eliminated 65 despite the roughly 50 000 per capita gdp wages have been flat and the median income is only 13 300 per year for private sector jobs and 18 600 for public sector ones 66 furthermore the lack of affordable housing is ranked as one of the leading issues facing all bahraini families regardless of religion or tribe 67 bahrain has the world s second highest population density 68 over 1 million people are crammed into a location one quarter the size of the u s state of rhode island which would make for a tight fit under the best of circumstances but half the island is reserved for vast royal properties and military facilities in a 2011 gallup poll 41 percent of bahrainis said they did not have the money they needed for shelter 69 in 2016 50 000 bahrainis were on a waiting list for public housing with a backlog of applications that would need at least fifteen years to process 70 the naturalization of non nationals further exacerbates this problem sunnis as well as shia resent how non nationals receive free housing and can jump to the head of the queue for scarce housing as members of the security services get automatic priority 71 bahrain s security sector and risks to stability the bahraini security state the bahraini security sector is essential to maintaining the monarchy s power a tiny coterie of the closest members of the monarchy and key supporters firmly control all major security sector bodies via the fourteen member supreme defense council which is chaired by the king and consists almost entirely of members of the royal family 72 domestic security sector bodies the security sector is divided into four parts the bahrain defense forces bdf ministry of interior moi national guard and national security agency nsa the bahraini government does not publish much basic information on its security sector but sources have put the combined security sector forces at over 21 000 of which approximately 8 200 are in the bdf and the rest in the other three branches 73 the regime also does not disclose basic personnel issues like salaries and promotion standards 74 there is no evidence of promotion boards and rank seems to be associated with sect and citizenship rather than merit 75 in the past the regime has imprisoned those publishing the names and salaries of public sector officials 76 the bdf is generally well equipped professional and well compensated given bahrain s military weakness relative to potential aggressors the bdf s role has always been less about protecting the island from invasion and instead it is to protect the regime from internal foes and stave off any attackers for forty eight hours until outside help arrives 77 the royal family occupies the most senior positions in the bdf while the rest of the officer corps consists of a princely class of bahraini sunnis who are carefully vetted according to their family background history and political orientation 78 the moi includes the coast guard traffic police customs and immigration officials and the special security forces command the moi also runs the community policing program this program with at least 1 500 members was established in 2005 and is the only branch to allow bahraini shia to join though its members are unarmed 79 however according to a 2016 u s state department report it does not appear that a significant segment of the force is shia 80 the third branch in the bahraini security sector is the national guard whose main mission is to guard critical infrastructure such as the airport and oil fields it can provide extra forces to the ministry of interior if needed and a 2016 report put the number of personnel at about 2 000 81 it is commanded by the king s brother who reports directly to the king 82 the fourth branch is the nsa which conducts both domestic and foreign espionage it is headed by lieutenant general adel bin khalifa al fadhel the only senior leader of the various branches who is not a member of the royal family 83 the nsa was largely blamed for the worst civil rights abuses in the 2011 uprisings and was subsequently stripped of much of its authority but in january 2017 the agency had its powers reinstated including its authority to conduct arrests 84 the demographics of the nsa are unclear but a leaked 2009 report indicated that shia did not make up more than 4 percent of it 85 further bolstering the security sector are an unknown number of private security contractors many of whom appear to provide state like security services involving guarding key infrastructure such as oil gas and industrial enterprises plus major airports and seaports some also advertise expertise in electronic security their customers include most bahraini security agencies the u s navy and bahrain s royal court 86 key foreign backers despite multi billion dollar investments in the domestic security sector it is foreign powers who play an outsized role in bahrain s security and have since its earliest days great britain occupied bahrain in the late nineteenth century and signed a treaty with the ruling al khalifa family britain ensured that the pro british monarchy was fully entrenched when it established a naval base there when britain withdrew from the region in 1971 as bahrain and other british protectorates became independent the united states stepped in as the security guarantor and the u s navy fifth fleet took over the british base 87 now however britain is making a comeback in early 2018 it opened a new naval facility in bahrain the hms juffair 88 bahrain s most important regional protector is saudi arabia whose support is supplemented by the other members of the gcc the bahraini monarchy reportedly runs all major policy decisions past the saudi regime and the bahraini economy is largely propped up by saudi arabia 89 today bahrain s oil production predominantly relies on saudi arabia s economic largesse it receives half of the net proceeds of the abu sa afa oil field located on the maritime boundary between the two these profits make up between one half and two thirds of total government revenue 90 bahrain also refines saudi crude oil which it receives at discounted prices 91 of equal importance in march 2011 as bahrain s monarchy teetered under the strain of arab spring protests saudi arabia and the united arab emirates uae deployed security forces to help stabilize the regime these forces secured strategic locations allowing the bahraini police to use its manpower against the protesters 92 but bahrain s ultimate security guarantor is the united states besides hosting the u s naval support activity with the u s naval forces central command and fifth fleet headquarters 93 bahrain has received preferential status for arms procurement from the united states since 1987 and the united states officially designated bahrain a major ally in march 2002 94 the two nations extended the defense cooperation agreement for an unspecified period of time during the monarch s visit to washington dc in november 2017 95 though prior agreements have been extended for ten year periods 96 as part of its relations with the united states bahrain has long seen its security related purchases from the united states and to a lesser extent other western countries as a form of insurance as noted in a leaked diplomatic cable reporting on a 2006 luncheon between the bahraini king the u s ambassador and the then u s naval component commander for central command admiral patrick walsh turning to admiral walsh the king noted the us navy s long presence in bahrain and the vital role it has played in preserving bahrain s security in a difficult regional environment we feel we are protected by your presence he said without you we would be squashed returning to this theme later in the conversation he also had high praise for the us military equipment that the us has provided to bahrain under fms fmf programs other countries might be able to match the us in terms of price and quality he stated but nobody comes close in terms of support 97 since 2006 the regime s belief in their need for u s support has not diminished 98 not surprisingly about 85 percent of its weapons come from the united states 99 extravagant security sector procurement while the budget for defense spending and procurement in bahrain is described by jane s defence weekly as opaque at best 100 the publicly declared portions of the security sector budget are significant and have continued to rise over the past few decades the declared bdf budget has risen from 308 million in 1988 to 958 million on the eve of the arab spring in 2010 to 1 397 billion in 2017 all in constant 2016 dollars or 11 8 percent of all government spending 101 these totals do not include money for the other three branches of the security services nor for the off budget portions of the security sector like procurement and construction 102 and yet even with this large chunk of the bahraini budget defense spending still exceeds its officially budgeted amount although the bahraini government does not publish figures on procurement the limited information available indicates that the procurement budget dwarfs that of overall declared security spending much information can be gleaned from sales notifications from other countries especially the united states and from leaks and other defense analysis one trend is that the procurement budget does not seem to match the overall defense budget nor move in any smooth predictable pattern instead it appears to spike whenever aid or other funding is available procurement spending has skyrocketed recently due in large part to the trump administration s decision in september 2017 to end export conditions related to bahrain s human rights record that were enacted under former president barack obama 103 the amount of weapons and the cost of bahrain s current spending spree are very high as the list of u s sales since 2017 indicates see table 1 just the known u s purchases between september 2017 and september 2018 amount to 6 22 billion or over four and a half times the publicly declared 1 4 billion defense budget for 2017 adding the declared budget to the cost of u s purchases yields a total of 7 62 billion or over three quarters of the entire 10 billion government budget for a typical year 104 and this number still does not include the other three security services construction and research and development budgets or any other secret procurement spending these purchases are in addition to other significant recent purchases for bahrain s navy there was also the sale of two 35 meter fast patrol boats from the united states for 60 million and a 70 million contract with the italian firm leonardo to upgrade six naval vessels both signed in 2015 105 bahrain also bought two c 130j transports from great britain for an unknown amount these are bahrain s first transport aircraft 106 in 2015 bahrain purchased upgrades to its ah 1 cobra helicopters from turkey worth 24 8 million 107 mortars from spain at an unknown cost 108 and unknown quantities of anti tank missiles from russia 109 in addition to these expensive procurements the bdf spends significant sums on infrastructure and personnel for instance the bdf is currently building a new base and a new hospital 110 moreover the gcc announced in 2014 that it would establish a joint naval force based in bahrain which will presumably require additional infrastructure 111 finally there is purely domestic procurement such as massive housing compounds with high concentrations of security personnel and their families including foreigners with no public oversight of the sector however it is impossible for bahraini citizens to know how many units are being built at what cost and for how many troops and their families 112 the high potential for security sector corruption the lack of transparency and oversight in bahrain s defense procurement process raises the likelihood that this multi billion dollar budget is rife with corruption according to the 2015 edition of transparency international s government defence anti corruption index bahrain was in the highest risk category for corruption in the defense and security sector with procurement as the highest risk within that though the monarchy provides a total defense budget expenditure to the public there is no further breakdown of it 113 bahrain exempts all military procurement from public tender and information on military procurement can only be shared with the supreme defense council neither parliament nor the national audit court is permitted to examine the security sector nor does the ministry of defense have its own audit function there are also no restrictions on the use of agents or intermediaries in procurement contracts a key pathway for defense corruption around the world and no anticorruption requirements for suppliers 114 with the security sector consuming so much government spending with no independent oversight or accountability the potential for corruption is very high aggravating the risk of corruption is that anyone in the country publicizing any information about corruption associated with the security sector is punished severely while there is an ombudsman in the ministry of interior there are credible reports that people have been arrested and tortured for reporting corruption to it 115 arrests in march 2018 of five individuals who had previously reported corruption and government abuses along with new restrictions on social media indicate that corruption is likely to be significantly underreported 116 and if other bahraini economic sectors are a guide there is reason to suspect malfeasance aside from the aforementioned corrupt land deals there was also a major scandal that first broke in 2011 involving the state owned aluminum company alba when a forensic audit uncovered tens of millions of dollars in bribes the chairman of alba at the time sheikh isa bin ali al khalifa a member of the royal family was a co conspirator yet did not face charges 117 there were also allegations that the prime minister was involved though these were never investigated 118 the risk of instability the very high levels of spending for bahrain s security sector and significant risk of corruption therein pose a risk to the country s economic and political stability in the short term military procurements sustain the regime s capacity for coercion provide patronage for key regime allies and entrench sectarian divisions while buying the monarchy continued support from the united states all three pillars of the regime coercion sectarianism and patronage are at least in part bolstered by the lack of transparency and accountability in security sector procurement yet in the long run unchecked security sector spending threatens to aggravate sources of discontent that could put the bahraini regime s stability at risk short term stability spending in the security sector provide near term stability in four ways first and foremost this largesse serves to maintain the monarchy s capacity for coercion a key pillar of the regime with a need for a large coercive apparatus it is no surprise that the security budget consumes a remarkable amount of the state s declared and undeclared resources as zoltan barany notes bahrain s military is the servant of the absolute monarchy it is not a national army but rather the army of the sunni muslim state and the regime 119 second unaccountable security spending serves as a source of patronage for regime supporters the security sector consumes by far the largest part of bahrain s public budget and is also one of the largest employers of sunnis a 2009 survey found that 13 percent of households that provided occupational data had someone working in the bahraini security sector 120 the good salaries and retirement plans ensure that members of the security forces themselves are invested in the regime and by ensuring that many sunni extended families have someone in the security sector the government ensures that these families have a continued stake in the monarchy s survival 121 furthermore big ticket defense contracts provide ample opportunity to divert revenue to key regime supporters to help buy their loyalty such patronage can come from artificially inflating prices and using that for kickbacks to various actors it can also come from hiring local companies especially via offset contracts who may provide overpriced contracts for poor quality work or even no work third security sector spending plays a crucial role in maintaining sectarian animosities the exclusion of shia from these contracts is a major source of grievance and enables an us versus them mentality on the island moreover the contracts for security services performed by various foreign members from places like jordan and pakistan as well as the procurement contracts to support them divorce the enlisted and noncommissioned officer corps in particular from the bahraini population writ large finally and of particular importance bahrain s procurement budget keeps the united states and other patrons committed to the monarchy s survival the united states not only relies on the regime for continued basing rights but also benefits from lucrative arms sales while bahrain may not necessarily need so many u s supplied f 16v fighter jets for defense it is clear the regime sees these aircraft purchases as a sound investment for ensuring continued backing from the united states long term vulnerability in the long term however bahrain s procurement practices are causing fiscal problems aggravating societal grievances and obstructing reforms that would shore up the monarchy s legitimacy first very high levels of security sector spending and the associated potential for corruption have imperiled bahrain s long term fiscal stability it is unclear where bahrain s regime will get the money for the purchases whether from the privy purse saudi arabia or some other donor in addition neither parliament nor the populace know whether the country will need to make an immediate one time payment or pay in various installments 122 the needed funds will not be coming from the united states all u s assistance to bahrain amounted to just a bit more than 1 million in 2017 123 second excessive spending on security depletes funding for social programs that could address sectarian and cross sectarian grievances only the leftovers from defense spending are available to provide housing education or infrastructure for the average bahraini citizen within even that paltry allocation to larger social needs shia then receive the barest minimum state resources required for basic social order third arms purchases have been used to put down protests and peaceful calls for reform thereby preventing democratic and economic reforms that would enhance the regime s legitimacy despite the repression the protests continue to pressure the current bahraini political settlement bahrain s monarchy has thus backed itself into a corner in order to achieve its primary goal of maintaining an absolute monarchy it fears opening up even a bit to the needed democratic and economic reforms that would give the regime greater legitimacy the royal family must therefore rely on a combination of coercion patronage and sectarianism a regime reliant on such a foundation is threatened if any of those three pillars should fall should the coercive apparatus of the state fail for any reason localized demonstrations might swell again as witnessed in 2011 without patronage to key actors those actors may seek other better options sectarianism in particular is far from a sturdy pillar for the regime sunni and shia could overcome the animosity by rallying around grievances common to both groups there have been several occasions when reformists from the two sects have worked together including in 1996 when both jointly protested the bahraini government s decision to renege on promised democratic reforms 124 during the initial days of the 2011 uprisings the protests were largely nonsectarian and the general federation of bahrain trade unions the main trade union in the country which has both sunni and shia members twice called for general strikes to protest the use of force against demonstrators 125 the wa ad society a left leaning secular opposition society that was disbanded in may 2017 by the government 126 included both shia and sunnis and continued a long running trend of cross sectarian movements that advocate for unity across religions being especially targeted by the bahraini security sector 127 reformists have overcome sectarian divides to demand government action and could do so again it would not be easy but it is also not impossible alternatively if the regime increases its demonization of shia especially in the armed forces it could accidentally ignite a sectarian conflict in a country where its co religionists are the minority 128 the regime has been publishing and distributing hyper sectarian material to the bdf that encourages discrimination against non sunnis and even labels shia as heretics who must repent or be killed 129 one indicator of rising anti shia extremism is that over 100 bahrainis joined the self proclaimed islamic state including a former police lieutenant from a family close to the monarchy 130 by relying excessively on sectarianism to maintain its power the monarchy combined with various sectarian identity entrepreneurs on all sides could accidentally light the very spark of an uprising it seeks to avoid policy recommendations for the united states under the obama administration the united states made some limited steps to check the bahraini regime s authoritarianism his administration withheld some arms purchases from bahrain following the 2011 uprisings and publicly chastised the bahraini regime in 2016 though no sanctions were imposed on any bahraini officials nor was military cooperation interrupted since 2012 the united states had an administrative hold on providing weapons to the ministry of interior though that hold did not apply to the coast guard or to the military nor did it affect u s training for the moi 131 in 2017 the trump administration dropped human rights conditions for arms sales though some restrictions remain on weapons that can be used for crowd control 132 the united states and other western powers have tremendous leverage over bahrain which receives almost all its weapons from the united states and relies on its more powerful security partners to defend it from a major attack by iran the united states can mitigate its strategic risks by using that leverage to nudge the monarchy toward greater reform before it is too late security sector procurement reform will encounter fierce resistance from the monarchy as well as from its local patron saudi arabia but slow painful reforms now can help lessen the chances of popular unrest and political instability in bahrain which would be highly detrimental to u s interests in the region start with security sector procurement reform for decades western governments have usually focused on efforts to integrate the shia into the security sector as a means of enhancing the bahraini government s legitimacy this is a noble goal that western countries should continue to pursue fixing this problem however is a long term task even if shia were recruited into the security services today it would be a decade until they made it to mid level ranks and many shia may not even apply given the poor opinion they hold of the regime and the likelihood of being seen as traitors by their own communities efforts to foster shia integration will also be wrenching for society and have encountered resistance from the bahraini monarchy in the meantime working on procurement issues is a less controversial place to start and the results can be seen more quickly without as much social turmoil in order to build the legitimacy of the bahraini monarchy and make it more accountable to the population in a shorter timeframe western governments should use their leverage to influence the bahraini monarchy to improve security sector procurement transparency and accountability procurement reform is a less controversial and more advantageous place for larger government reforms for several reasons first issues of transparency and accountability as well as security sector abuses already crosscut most of bahraini society focusing on common ground can build more trust between sunni and shia communities bahraini society has already shown a clear concern for procurement on social media bahrainis raise doubts about large military purchases especially about where the country will get the money and parliamentarians have tried to raise such questions as well 133 second the procurement sector is so large that even limited reforms would go a long way toward fixing bahrain s fiscal imbalances and freeing up resources for social programs in 2012 the bahraini parliament tried to formulate a strategy to handle the budget deficit and the country s debt and it highlighted that military spending was reducing the resources available for spending on health and education 134 yet without the basic facts and figures of security sector procurement parliament cannot hope to balance the overall budget 135 third procurement reform would be an important start in addressing larger civil military relations issues by gradually bringing the security sector under a level of civilian nonmonarchical control action items for procurement reform the first efforts should focus on influencing bahrain to publish a national security strategy the strategy should be unclassified though there may be a need for some classified annexes with that strategy in hand bahraini citizens and western powers can better evaluate how bahraini security sector procurement contracts are or should be aligned with bahrain s national security goals as well as u s interests such as containing iran and fighting terrorism this step can help ensure that bahrain s budget is more rationally spent ideally leaving more money for economic and social development projects second given how western defense contracts can be abused to bolster the bahraini regime s coercive apparatus western governments should insist on extra scrutiny of all contracts associated with bahrain governments should mandate that all contracts associated with the bahraini state be published to improve transparency and accountability any u s associated contracts or contract licenses that cannot be made public due to national security concerns should have to be reported to congress along with the national security justification offset contracts should be forbidden and the beneficial owners of all subcontractors agents and other intermediaries should be made publicly known all contracts should include corruption clauses to make contract termination easier should malfeasance be discovered thereby incentivizing better contract delivery third western countries should encourage bahrain to develop a timeline and action plan for adherence to international contracting standards like the open contracting partnership standards including their data standards these standards lay out best practices for the entire contracting process from contract tenders to eventual contract completion some contracts will need to be classified but those contracts should be the exceptions not the rule which contracts will remain secret should be explicitly spelled out to the public and approved by parliament parliamentary committees should be established with clearances and the legislative authority to be briefed on and approve secret security contracts just as is done in the united states the timelines involved must be enforced with credible sanctions for noncompliance signing up to such standards would signal to key actors within bahrain that this particular form of patronage would be ending the bahraini government would build legitimacy as the public could better see that bahraini security spending is more accountable and public tendering and fewer secret contracts could improve the bahraini economy as smaller contractors could compete on price and quality rather than on connections helping to bring in new economic actors and bolstering existing smaller ones eventually along with better contracting the government should be required to submit audited statements of security sector procurement with an eye to ultimately putting the entire government budget to public audits with limited specified exceptions for national security concerns bahrain already has a national audit court that produces a professional and detailed annual public report on financial and administrative activities and irregularities unfortunately it does not cover all government revenues nor can it report on royal court expenditures much of the security sector or the sovereign wealth fund 136 various scandals like the aforementioned land scandals indicate it is not capturing all spending either however the example of bahrain s gcc ally kuwait demonstrates that auditing bahrain s expenditures is feasible kuwait has a relatively open and transparent system of publicly available audited accounts while some money may not be accounted for the declared value of oil and gas exports compared to oil and gas revenues showed deviations that were within typical international norms indicating that much less of the country s revenue was being illicitly siphoned off 137 use u s leverage given that security procurement is a key component of the regime s survival strategy the monarchy will fight back with threats to revoke western basing rights or to buy weapons from other suppliers especially russia and china there is precedent for this when congress froze a sale of small arms to bahrain in 2011 bahrain bought the small arms elsewhere 138 when the united states froze sales of humvees that same year bahrain purchased turkish made cobra armored personnel carriers instead though in september 2017 bahrain announced it was purchasing u s humvees again 139 bahrain also publicly stated that it would buy russian s 400 missiles though no details of the purchase were offered 140 bahrain should be reminded that such purchases would endanger the u s security umbrella overall and jeopardize western military aircraft operations there bahrain as well as its patron saudi arabia recognize that they need the u s bases in bahrain at least as much as the united states does and the united states should be willing to use that leverage to push for security procurement related reforms using its leverage over procurement should be coupled with other leverage such as limiting high level engagement additional audits of prior weapons deliveries and heightened congressional scrutiny of purchases to further pressure bahrain at the same time the united states should explore viable alternatives to basing the navy s fifth fleet in bahrain this is prudent planning given the importance of the base and the potential risks to the stability of the regime viable basing alternatives would lessen the bahraini regime s leverage for unconditional support there have been a few proposals in this direction in 2013 a u s navy captain published a paper on fifth fleet basing alternatives 141 that same year former director of national intelligence admiral dennis blair argued for moving the fifth fleet headquarters back aboard a u s navy flagship as it was before 1993 both to signal u s resolve for the need for bahraini government reforms and because of the vulnerability of u s bases there given prior instability 142 the house version of the fy2016 national defense authorization act ndaa contained a provision to require the department of defense to report on alternative locations for the u s navy but the final bill did not contain the provision 143 that provision should be reinstated in the fy2020 ndaa after all bahrain does not have a viable external protector besides the united states neither china nor russia at this time has the willingness or capability to take on that role thus the time is now while the balance of power is in the united states favor the united states continues to support the bahraini regime without demanding reform despite the fact that the monarchy s form of rule violates democratic principles and engenders risks to bahrain s stability as the united states learned from the arab spring deals with such dictatorships can rapidly collapse and the domestic conflicts that ensue can lead to much larger strategic dilemmas thus though fraught and difficult the reasonable approach is to use existing western leverage to push for gradual reforms that give the bahraini people hope for a better future under a constitutional monarchy a relatively stable legitimate constitutional monarchy will be a better guarantee of western interests in the region in the long run especially when compared to the potential results of continuing to support a brittle absolute monarchy given the size of the security sector procurement budget the importance of these purchases in sustaining coercion the role the security sector plays in the bahraini people s grievances and the leverage western governments have security sector procurement reform is a good place to start gradual reform can act as a catalyst to rein in a free spending regime giving foreign investors more confidence that bahraini debt may be worth purchasing and keeping the state better afloat it can also help bring more accountability to the regime and reduce human rights abuses thereby improving the legitimacy of the monarchy such measures to mitigate against popular unrest can help better ensure in the long term that the united states maintains its basing rights and freedom of movement in the persian gulf region the reforms will not be easy but the rewards can be substantial and the consequences of not doing so disastrous notes 1 richard mcdaniel no plan b us strategic access in the middle

potential instability in bahrain poses a significant threat to u s strategic interests the united states gains immensely from basing rights in bahrain which is a key location in the persian gulf with its deepwater port and good airfield access nowhere else in the region provides such useful geography or facilities 1 yet another sudden uprising by bahrainis could endanger u s military personnel and their families living in bahrain and could threaten the ability of the united states to keep its bases aside from relying on the united states for protection bahrain also prioritizes its own security sector as it faces both internal and external threats internally the country was roiled by protests sparked by the arab spring in 2011 with smaller scale protests continuing to this day externally it considers iran to be a potential existential threat and bahrain is also taking part in operations against yemeni rebels jodi vittori jodi vittori is a nonresident scholar in the democracy conflict and governance program she is an expert on the linkages of corruption state fragility illicit finance and u s national security more especially since restrictions on u s arms sales to the country were lifted by the administration of u s president donald trump bahrain has been on a massive military spending binge in 2017 and 2018 just the publicly known defense procurement contracts with the united states amounted to over 6 billion that is a tall order for a country with an overall budget of about 10 billion per year this military procurement splurge is occurring against a backdrop of long term bahraini financial trouble bahrain spends much more money than its oil financial and other sectors bring in it is thus in the midst of negotiating a five year 10 billion bailout package with its arab allies that will include low interest loans spending cuts and a new value added tax the 10 billion aid package will help the country plug fiscal holes in the short term but will not substantially alter the long term rent seeking activity by the country s elites that keeps bahrain in dire economic straits as bahraini citizens are being asked to tighten their financial belts due to the country s economic constraints there are legitimate questions of how bahrain will come up with the money to pay for new military purchases as well as what they contribute to the kingdom s defense the answer is that no one outside the bahraini royal family seems to know the bahraini royal family is not obligated to put many public accounts including security sector procurement to scrutiny so there is little transparency or accountability to these purchases this breakneck but unaccountable security sector procurement spending may create pressures on the legitimacy and ultimately the stability of the bahraini regime large purchases of weapons come at the expense of paying for other items like housing and economic development those same arms are also often turned on the population itself especially the politically marginalized shia majority to repress dissent the lack of transparency and accountability over the security sector as well as the repression it metes out allows the regime to largely resist both internal and external calls for democratic reforms with a population holding significant grievances with the monarchy and a political economy on shaky ground large purchases without clear national security purposes means to pay for them or public accountability only further hurt the legitimacy of the regime this potential for instability has important strategic ramifications for the united states given bahrain s role as a key basing location and ally in the persian gulf it is thus in the united states interest to strongly encourage the bahraini royal family to improve its security sector accountability and transparency lest the lack thereof fuels domestic political grievances that may boil over and jeopardize u s objectives in the region bahrain s monarchy has ruled through a combination of coercion patronage and sectarianism while extracting significant rents from bahrain s economy yet this extractive and absolutist regime has fostered discontent among bahrain s shia majority and the population at large the bahraini security sector and in particular its unaccountable purchases of security related equipment and services contributes decisively to the problem of state fragility given its pivotal role in providing for bahrain s security and supplying nearly all its weapons the united states has leverage it should use that leverage to push the bahraini monarchy to reform its security sector procurement practices otherwise unchecked security spending and endemic corruption will threaten to destabilize the bahraini regime and imperil u s interests the political and economic anatomy of the bahraini regime bahrain is one of the smallest authoritarian states in the world both in terms of population and geographic area and it is in some ways an efficient regime with strong capacities to maintain order yet its monarchy stands in a uniquely precarious position as the country is the only remaining arab state where a minority sunni population rules over a majority shia one though bahrain keeps data on the demographics of its sunni and shia communities a closely guarded secret 2 a statistical analysis conducted in 2017 suggests that shia represent between 55 and 60 percent of the population 3 coercion patronage and sectarianism the pillars of bahraini regime survival above all the sunni royal family maintains its power through absolute control over politics the king hamad bin isa al khalifa has the power to appoint all ministers judges and one of the two houses of a very weak parliament he can amend the constitution at will his family holds twelve of twenty six cabinet posts including the roles of prime minister deputy prime ministers and ministers of interior finance justice and foreign affairs 4 most political organizations have been ruled illegal nonviolent opposition leaders are regularly arrested or exiled and the last relatively free media outlet was closed in 2017 the bahraini population is not quiescent protests have been a near constant reality over the decades including widespread demonstrations that threatened the monarchy s hold on power during the arab spring in 2011 however the regime s practice of surveilling arresting and punishing its citizens keeps a lid on larger protests so small scale protests are the norm second the monarchy selectively distributes patronage from oil rents to preserve a small but crucial coalition of supporters particularly within the security sector thus while bahrain has a per capita gross domestic product gdp of nearly 50 000 per year 5 the nation s oil wealth is highly unequally distributed throughout the population as is the case in many other gulf cooperation council gcc countries many gcc states bahrain included maintain various overstaffed and inefficient state agencies to absorb much of the labor force and spend huge sums on relatively large well equipped militaries 6 by providing targeted patronage to the security sector the monarchy keeps its ruling coalition as small as possible and protects the regime from any potential challengers as scholar justin gengler notes indeed why waste limited resources chasing citizens opposed to the status quo when they might be used to reward those who already have a material stake in its preservation rather than deploy limited resources inefficiently upon the whole of society rulers of distributive states such as those of the gulf generally seek to maximize their own share by rewarding disproportionately a finite category of citizens whose support is sufficient to keep them in power while the remaining population is comparatively excluded from the private rentier benefits of citizenship 7 in determining which citizens may be most loyal to the regime and deciding questions of resource allocation the bahraini regime deliberately exploits sectarian divisions the regime s policy as described by gengler can be described as an ethnic subsidy whereby a ruler co opts one s co ethnics as a relatively cheap support base that is large enough to ensure regime survival 8 thus rather than trying to temper sectarianism in bahrain the regime reinforces it the government uses electoral and legislative rules plus hiring practices and the media to institutionalize sectarian cleavages rather than ameliorate them the regime also moves aggressively against cross sectarian political movements and leaders limiting their ability to unite under common grievances using the politics of fear so common in authoritarian states the monarchy portrays the shia majority not as an aggrieved group of fellow bahraini citizens but as a mob backed by bahrain s arch enemy iran that poses an existential threat to bahrain in a version of protection racket politics 9 the regime portrays democracy as dangerous to the sunni minority and stirs up fear that the shia majority could vote in an iranian style government the bahraini regime can also point to the results of other arab spring revolutions in places like syria where civil war and chaos resulted the regime can thus win the allegiance of its key supporters by highlighting that it is better for sunnis to remain under the security umbrella of an oppressive state and receive the regime s largesse rather than risk civil war or subservience under shia rule 10 given its reliance on the three pillars of coercion patronage and sectarianism the bahraini regime has created three distinct groups first is the sunni monarchy and the inner circle of key supporters including elites within the security sector who receive an outsize share of the overall rents second is the larger sunni population who are generally supportive of the regime though this group receives a greater share of rents than shia it is still rather poorly compensated by the regime for its support last are the shia who make up the majority of the country but receive the fewest benefits 11 the privy purse the monarchy s dominance over bahrain s economy control of state resources including the massive security procurement budget is at the core of this model the same people who control bahrain s economy and especially its oil and natural gas wealth also control the security sector 12 a key aspect of maintaining control for authoritarian regimes is restricting access to information on state finances and economic activity and bahrain is no different it is thus unclear how much money is actually in state coffers and how much of the state s resources are expropriated by the monarchy and its key supporters 13 it is clear however that the royal family can extract billions in rents each year from sources as diverse as oil revenues land titles a sovereign wealth fund shares in companies and tax revenues there are some specifics available public debt is 88 percent of gdp and the 2 3 billion bahrain has in foreign reserves is barely enough to cover a month of imports 14 all three major rating companies rate its debt as junk and investors are betting that the bahraini dinar is likely to be unpegged from the dollar 15 it does not help that 70 percent of government revenue is based on oil 16 with its highly volatile price swings or that bahrain needs oil prices to rise to 125 a barrel to balance its budget oil has hovered over 60 per barrel so far in 2019 17 as a result hydrocarbons are critical to the budget 18 all mineral wealth on the surface and underground in bahrain is owned by the state 19 historically in an agreement originally reached among the british colonial administrators oil companies and the monarchy one third of oil revenues went to the privy purse another third to the state budget and the final third to a reserved fund 20 however when the abu sa afa oil field was discovered in 1966 which at the time became the largest source of oil revenue for bahrain its revenues went straight to the privy purse rather than the government budget in addition to the previously allocated third of oil revenues 21 this lopsided distribution of oil rents between the privy purse and the public budget was typical of countries that now comprise the gcc prior to their independence and the 1973 oil crisis when most countries ceased to publicly account for revenues 22 it is impossible to know with any surety how much oil revenue the monarchy receives but a 2016 study found the total value of bahrain s oil exports to be 92 8 billion dollars between 2002 and 2011 compared to total declared public oil and gas revenues over the same period of 39 billion dollars that leaves a gap of 53 8 billion in most of those years the value of the oil exported was at least double the declared public revenue while these estimates do not provide a definitive number for how much money is off budget in bahrain they do highlight the large gaps between publicly listed amounts and the actual value of exports 23 but the monarchy has more resources available than just oil and natural gas the next most obvious is land because especially in a place as small as bahrain large landowners are particularly noticeable the king and the prime minister the king s uncle own two relatively large islands off the coast of bahrain as well as a number of other palace compounds 24 a 2010 bahraini parliamentary investigation documented that about one quarter of the country s land did not have complete records the land registration board whose director is appointed by the king is accused of re registering public and sometimes even private lands to the royal family which has then turned over the deeds to developers for new offices or hotels prime minister khalifa bin salman al khalifa is reportedly known as mr 50 percent because he takes that share in the businesses to which he provides public land 25 the monarchy also controls mumtalakat bahrain s sovereign wealth fund which holds 11 billion in assets worldwide established in 2006 the organization has twenty nine commercial assets including some of the largest firms in the country such as gulf air the bahrain telecommunications company batelco and the national bank of bahrain 26 the revenue from mumtalakat does not go into the government budget 27 and though the fund is recognized for the transparency of its accounts as ravi shankar chaturvedi of tufts university noted in 2016 the fund s transparency is of little good when its parent the sovereign is shrouded in a veil of corruption 28 beyond its official holding company the royal family is believed to have a stake in a number of other companies often secretly held through cut outs a 2014 investigation by the financial times showed for instance that a private investment vehicle called premier group believed to be owned by the royal family had shares in projects worth at least 22 billion 29 in other cases the monarchy s role in various businesses is public for example shaikh mohammed bin isa bin mohammed al khalifa described as a political and economic adviser to the crown prince is the executive chairman of the mclaren group limited holding company which includes the mclaren luxury car brand and formula one racing team the largest shareholder with a 62 6 percent share of this 3 1 billion business is mumtalakat 30 on top of all of this the royal family ultimately controls the tax revenues to further help plug gaps in the budget the government announced a 5 percent value added tax that is beginning a phased rollout in 2019 bahrain has received loans and other direct financial assistance from saudi arabia in the past 31 the country will presumably receive more direct assistance as part of the 10 billion bailout yet even that may not be enough as the chief middle east economist for bloomberg economics ziad daoud estimates bahrain will need at least 12 7 billion to cover its expenditures and possibly quite a bit more 32 thus while it is impossible to know exactly how much money is going to the bahraini monarchy s inner circle it is clearly many billions more than the billions estimated to be derived just from oil rents this creates a massive unaccountable slush fund for whatever the monarchy chooses to spend it on including expensive security sector purchases and amid all of this average bahraini citizens are being asked to tighten their belts the regime s discontents sectarian and cross sectarian grievances during the arab spring bahrain was often a center of global attention as over one hundred thousand protesters demanded democratic reforms many of which had been previously promised by the royal family the bahraini protests began on february 14 2011 33 and at first they were largely nonsectarian with broad calls to reform the bahraini regime though as the protests continued they became increasingly more sectarian the monarchy soon found itself unable to cope and on march 14 saudi troops and emirati policemen from the gcc peninsula shield force arrived in bahrain the government soon declared martial law with mass arrests a curfew a ban on rallies and other repressive measures 34 this crackdown became a symbol of how brutal a regime s response could be not only were the protester camps bulldozed and protest leaders imprisoned but even the doctors who treated the wounded were arrested more broadly thousands of workers were fired nearly all of them from state or semi state entities 35 since then small scale protests have occurred regularly in shia areas and low level attacks against police and other security forces continue 36 but 2011 was hardly the first time there had been mass mobilization against the regime the majority shia had engaged in waves of uprisings and protests against the khalifa regime for decades 37 the current protest movement is made up largely of shia groups though wa ad a recently disbanded leftist group with both sunni and shia participation is also prominent a small number of shia groups are solidly pro iranian and some of them are willing to use violence the vast majority however eschew violence and instead seek reforms to allow greater representation accountability and equality shia grievances shia grievances center primarily on their political and economic marginalization under the bahraini regime particularly a lack of voice and representation bahrain s political system has been designed to exclude the shia majority as well as the regime s opponents more generally while bahrain has a parliament it is advisory only and its upper house is entirely appointed moreover severe gerrymandering has been used to ensure the election of supposed independents who are friendly to the royal family 38 when even that was not enough the bahraini government made it illegal for anyone in the opposition to actually run for parliament opposition leaders of peaceful political societies since political parties are illegal are regularly imprisoned stripped of their citizenship or sent into exile the prominent political societies have all been dissolved by the government sunni and shia communities are very segregated 39 so another significant grievance involves the lack of housing and access to basic public services with many shia villages missing even paved roads furthermore in shia communities many basic services are supplied by local charities rather than the state 40 according to a 2009 poll shia respondents were much more likely than sunnis to report difficulty in claiming official documents enrolling a child in public school receiving medical treatment or receiving help from the police when needed 41 the ghettoization of many shia also has a secondary benefit for the regime by pushing most shia into isolated villages protest movements are easy to contain in local areas with a few roadblocks preventing larger protests from reaching the city center as they did in 2011 42 the lack of employment opportunities is also a major grievance shia are explicitly forbidden from working in some sectors and informally barred from others 43 anyone seeking a sensitive job position in the bureaucracy needs a certificate of good history and conduct from the police to show they have never been arrested or detained including for political reasons this discourages many shia applicants and restricts many others to only the lower rungs of state jobs 44 shia have many fewer opportunities for public sector employment than sunnis with identical employment attributes while shia were likely to be in lower paying lower prestige jobs than equally qualified sunnis 45 a 2003 survey found that shia held only 18 percent of the 572 high ranking government posts 46 and in a 2009 survey all those surveyed who were employed in semi skilled unskilled or agricultural labor were shia 47 one of the job sectors largely unavailable to shia is the security sector 48 a leaked march 2009 confidential list of over 1 000 employees in bahrain s security sector showed that only 4 percent of employees were shia while 64 percent were non citizens most of asian nationalities the aforementioned 2009 survey did not find a single shia who worked for the police or armed forces despite the fact that the security sector is one of the largest employers on the island 49 the ministry of interior is believed to employ the most shia of any security agency yet even here the personnel is only estimated to be about 10 percent shia 50 furthermore the bahraini regime has stocked the lower ranks of the security sector with non bahrainis 51 as early as 1998 a financial times article reported that 8 000 to 10 000 sunnis and their families had been brought from jordan pakistan syria and yemen into the bahraini security sector 52 and they continue to be the most common groups along with a smattering of british in senior positions in 2011 a pro government media outlet reported that about 40 percent of the ministry of interior was composed of foreign nationals 53 in addition the national guard and police force are thought to be primarily staffed by foreigners especially pakistanis and yemenis in 2009 the bahrain center for human rights reported that almost two thirds of the national security agency s personnel were non bahraini 54 shia are also concerned that foreign sunnis are being brought in to change the sectarian makeup of bahrain in a country of less than 1 4 million people it does not take many new immigrants to change the sectarian balance especially when shia hold only a slight majority of the country 55 grievances over the security services were a major motivator in the 2011 uprisings and thus were a central aspect of the reforms promised by the monarchy in 2012 these reforms quickly stalled however in part because the exclusion of shia from the security sector is fundamental to the bahraini regime s strategy of survival 56 according to a leaked 2006 u s diplomatic cable the king noted that many shia complain that there are no shia in the military leadership of the country this is a question of loyalty he stated as long as khamenei has the title of commander in chief bahrain must worry about the loyalty of shia who maintain ties and allegiance to iran 57 shia exclusion from the security sector exacerbates discontent with the bahraini state overall in three ways first it ensures sunnis especially the royal family maintain control over the organs of power despite being a minority of the population second the bahraini security sector is a major employer in the country and exclusion from that sector means fewer good middle class jobs for shia and third with an enlisted force largely made up of noncitizens and very recently naturalized citizens who speak little or no arabic and have no social ties to the areas they patrol the bahraini security sector leadership can better oppress civilians where locals might balk locals blamed non bahraini security members for much of the violence during the arab spring protests 58 cross sectarian grievances more worrying still for the bahraini regime is that it is not just the shia who have grievances against the monarchy many concerns are cross sectarian issues such as repression corruption and the naturalization of noncitizens including in the security services anger sunnis as well 59 the regime s increasingly authoritarian behavior in particular has caused discontent across sectarian lines while shia have suffered the bulk of the repression sunnis protesting the regime were also arrested during the 2011 uprising 60 as of 2018 the number of sunnis being arrested interrogated and censored on social media seemed to be increasing 61 and even pro government groups especially those that had spoken out on corruption issues were under increasing pressure parliamentary elections were held on november 24 2018 with a runoff on december 1 but political opposition was not allowed 62 and many leaders both sunni and shia have been imprisoned new laws passed in 2018 prohibit anyone who has ever been a member of any illegal political societies or who has been sentenced to prison for more than six months from seeking to hold office thereby disqualifying many protesters and political prisoners 63 and while the standard of living for sunnis is higher than that of most local shia they too suffer from the poor economy the 5 percent value added tax will further add to that burden 64 and subsidies for meat cooking oil and other necessities have been eliminated 65 despite the roughly 50 000 per capita gdp wages have been flat and the median income is only 13 300 per year for private sector jobs and 18 600 for public sector ones 66 furthermore the lack of affordable housing is ranked as one of the leading issues facing all bahraini families regardless of religion or tribe 67 bahrain has the world s second highest population density 68 over 1 million people are crammed into a location one quarter the size of the u s state of rhode island which would make for a tight fit under the best of circumstances but half the island is reserved for vast royal properties and military facilities in a 2011 gallup poll 41 percent of bahrainis said they did not have the money they needed for shelter 69 in 2016 50 000 bahrainis were on a waiting list for public housing with a backlog of applications that would need at least fifteen years to process 70 the naturalization of non nationals further exacerbates this problem sunnis as well as shia resent how non nationals receive free housing and can jump to the head of the queue for scarce housing as members of the security services get automatic priority 71 bahrain s security sector and risks to stability the bahraini security state the bahraini security sector is essential to maintaining the monarchy s power a tiny coterie of the closest members of the monarchy and key supporters firmly control all major security sector bodies via the fourteen member supreme defense council which is chaired by the king and consists almost entirely of members of the royal family 72 domestic security sector bodies the security sector is divided into four parts the bahrain defense forces bdf ministry of interior moi national guard and national security agency nsa the bahraini government does not publish much basic information on its security sector but sources have put the combined security sector forces at over 21 000 of which approximately 8 200 are in the bdf and the rest in the other three branches 73 the regime also does not disclose basic personnel issues like salaries and promotion standards 74 there is no evidence of promotion boards and rank seems to be associated with sect and citizenship rather than merit 75 in the past the regime has imprisoned those publishing the names and salaries of public sector officials 76 the bdf is generally well equipped professional and well compensated given bahrain s military weakness relative to potential aggressors the bdf s role has always been less about protecting the island from invasion and instead it is to protect the regime from internal foes and stave off any attackers for forty eight hours until outside help arrives 77 the royal family occupies the most senior positions in the bdf while the rest of the officer corps consists of a princely class of bahraini sunnis who are carefully vetted according to their family background history and political orientation 78 the moi includes the coast guard traffic police customs and immigration officials and the special security forces command the moi also runs the community policing program this program with at least 1 500 members was established in 2005 and is the only branch to allow bahraini shia to join though its members are unarmed 79 however according to a 2016 u s state department report it does not appear that a significant segment of the force is shia 80 the third branch in the bahraini security sector is the national guard whose main mission is to guard critical infrastructure such as the airport and oil fields it can provide extra forces to the ministry of interior if needed and a 2016 report put the number of personnel at about 2 000 81 it is commanded by the king s brother who reports directly to the king 82 the fourth branch is the nsa which conducts both domestic and foreign espionage it is headed by lieutenant general adel bin khalifa al fadhel the only senior leader of the various branches who is not a member of the royal family 83 the nsa was largely blamed for the worst civil rights abuses in the 2011 uprisings and was subsequently stripped of much of its authority but in january 2017 the agency had its powers reinstated including its authority to conduct arrests 84 the demographics of the nsa are unclear but a leaked 2009 report indicated that shia did not make up more than 4 percent of it 85 further bolstering the security sector are an unknown number of private security contractors many of whom appear to provide state like security services involving guarding key infrastructure such as oil gas and industrial enterprises plus major airports and seaports some also advertise expertise in electronic security their customers include most bahraini security agencies the u s navy and bahrain s royal court 86 key foreign backers despite multi billion dollar investments in the domestic security sector it is foreign powers who play an outsized role in bahrain s security and have since its earliest days great britain occupied bahrain in the late nineteenth century and signed a treaty with the ruling al khalifa family britain ensured that the pro british monarchy was fully entrenched when it established a naval base there when britain withdrew from the region in 1971 as bahrain and other british protectorates became independent the united states stepped in as the security guarantor and the u s navy fifth fleet took over the british base 87 now however britain is making a comeback in early 2018 it opened a new naval facility in bahrain the hms juffair 88 bahrain s most important regional protector is saudi arabia whose support is supplemented by the other members of the gcc the bahraini monarchy reportedly runs all major policy decisions past the saudi regime and the bahraini economy is largely propped up by saudi arabia 89 today bahrain s oil production predominantly relies on saudi arabia s economic largesse it receives half of the net proceeds of the abu sa afa oil field located on the maritime boundary between the two these profits make up between one half and two thirds of total government revenue 90 bahrain also refines saudi crude oil which it receives at discounted prices 91 of equal importance in march 2011 as bahrain s monarchy teetered under the strain of arab spring protests saudi arabia and the united arab emirates uae deployed security forces to help stabilize the regime these forces secured strategic locations allowing the bahraini police to use its manpower against the protesters 92 but bahrain s ultimate security guarantor is the united states besides hosting the u s naval support activity with the u s naval forces central command and fifth fleet headquarters 93 bahrain has received preferential status for arms procurement from the united states since 1987 and the united states officially designated bahrain a major ally in march 2002 94 the two nations extended the defense cooperation agreement for an unspecified period of time during the monarch s visit to washington dc in november 2017 95 though prior agreements have been extended for ten year periods 96 as part of its relations with the united states bahrain has long seen its security related purchases from the united states and to a lesser extent other western countries as a form of insurance as noted in a leaked diplomatic cable reporting on a 2006 luncheon between the bahraini king the u s ambassador and the then u s naval component commander for central command admiral patrick walsh turning to admiral walsh the king noted the us navy s long presence in bahrain and the vital role it has played in preserving bahrain s security in a difficult regional environment we feel we are protected by your presence he said without you we would be squashed returning to this theme later in the conversation he also had high praise for the us military equipment that the us has provided to bahrain under fms fmf programs other countries might be able to match the us in terms of price and quality he stated but nobody comes close in terms of support 97 since 2006 the regime s belief in their need for u s support has not diminished 98 not surprisingly about 85 percent of its weapons come from the united states 99 extravagant security sector procurement while the budget for defense spending and procurement in bahrain is described by jane s defence weekly as opaque at best 100 the publicly declared portions of the security sector budget are significant and have continued to rise over the past few decades the declared bdf budget has risen from 308 million in 1988 to 958 million on the eve of the arab spring in 2010 to 1 397 billion in 2017 all in constant 2016 dollars or 11 8 percent of all government spending 101 these totals do not include money for the other three branches of the security services nor for the off budget portions of the security sector like procurement and construction 102 and yet even with this large chunk of the bahraini budget defense spending still exceeds its officially budgeted amount although the bahraini government does not publish figures on procurement the limited information available indicates that the procurement budget dwarfs that of overall declared security spending much information can be gleaned from sales notifications from other countries especially the united states and from leaks and other defense analysis one trend is that the procurement budget does not seem to match the overall defense budget nor move in any smooth predictable pattern instead it appears to spike whenever aid or other funding is available procurement spending has skyrocketed recently due in large part to the trump administration s decision in september 2017 to end export conditions related to bahrain s human rights record that were enacted under former president barack obama 103 the amount of weapons and the cost of bahrain s current spending spree are very high as the list of u s sales since 2017 indicates see table 1 just the known u s purchases between september 2017 and september 2018 amount to 6 22 billion or over four and a half times the publicly declared 1 4 billion defense budget for 2017 adding the declared budget to the cost of u s purchases yields a total of 7 62 billion or over three quarters of the entire 10 billion government budget for a typical year 104 and this number still does not include the other three security services construction and research and development budgets or any other secret procurement spending these purchases are in addition to other significant recent purchases for bahrain s navy there was also the sale of two 35 meter fast patrol boats from the united states for 60 million and a 70 million contract with the italian firm leonardo to upgrade six naval vessels both signed in 2015 105 bahrain also bought two c 130j transports from great britain for an unknown amount these are bahrain s first transport aircraft 106 in 2015 bahrain purchased upgrades to its ah 1 cobra helicopters from turkey worth 24 8 million 107 mortars from spain at an unknown cost 108 and unknown quantities of anti tank missiles from russia 109 in addition to these expensive procurements the bdf spends significant sums on infrastructure and personnel for instance the bdf is currently building a new base and a new hospital 110 moreover the gcc announced in 2014 that it would establish a joint naval force based in bahrain which will presumably require additional infrastructure 111 finally there is purely domestic procurement such as massive housing compounds with high concentrations of security personnel and their families including foreigners with no public oversight of the sector however it is impossible for bahraini citizens to know how many units are being built at what cost and for how many troops and their families 112 the high potential for security sector corruption the lack of transparency and oversight in bahrain s defense procurement process raises the likelihood that this multi billion dollar budget is rife with corruption according to the 2015 edition of transparency international s government defence anti corruption index bahrain was in the highest risk category for corruption in the defense and security sector with procurement as the highest risk within that though the monarchy provides a total defense budget expenditure to the public there is no further breakdown of it 113 bahrain exempts all military procurement from public tender and information on military procurement can only be shared with the supreme defense council neither parliament nor the national audit court is permitted to examine the security sector nor does the ministry of defense have its own audit function there are also no restrictions on the use of agents or intermediaries in procurement contracts a key pathway for defense corruption around the world and no anticorruption requirements for suppliers 114 with the security sector consuming so much government spending with no independent oversight or accountability the potential for corruption is very high aggravating the risk of corruption is that anyone in the country publicizing any information about corruption associated with the security sector is punished severely while there is an ombudsman in the ministry of interior there are credible reports that people have been arrested and tortured for reporting corruption to it 115 arrests in march 2018 of five individuals who had previously reported corruption and government abuses along with new restrictions on social media indicate that corruption is likely to be significantly underreported 116 and if other bahraini economic sectors are a guide there is reason to suspect malfeasance aside from the aforementioned corrupt land deals there was also a major scandal that first broke in 2011 involving the state owned aluminum company alba when a forensic audit uncovered tens of millions of dollars in bribes the chairman of alba at the time sheikh isa bin ali al khalifa a member of the royal family was a co conspirator yet did not face charges 117 there were also allegations that the prime minister was involved though these were never investigated 118 the risk of instability the very high levels of spending for bahrain s security sector and significant risk of corruption therein pose a risk to the country s economic and political stability in the short term military procurements sustain the regime s capacity for coercion provide patronage for key regime allies and entrench sectarian divisions while buying the monarchy continued support from the united states all three pillars of the regime coercion sectarianism and patronage are at least in part bolstered by the lack of transparency and accountability in security sector procurement yet in the long run unchecked security sector spending threatens to aggravate sources of discontent that could put the bahraini regime s stability at risk short term stability spending in the security sector provide near term stability in four ways first and foremost this largesse serves to maintain the monarchy s capacity for coercion a key pillar of the regime with a need for a large coercive apparatus it is no surprise that the security budget consumes a remarkable amount of the state s declared and undeclared resources as zoltan barany notes bahrain s military is the servant of the absolute monarchy it is not a national army but rather the army of the sunni muslim state and the regime 119 second unaccountable security spending serves as a source of patronage for regime supporters the security sector consumes by far the largest part of bahrain s public budget and is also one of the largest employers of sunnis a 2009 survey found that 13 percent of households that provided occupational data had someone working in the bahraini security sector 120 the good salaries and retirement plans ensure that members of the security forces themselves are invested in the regime and by ensuring that many sunni extended families have someone in the security sector the government ensures that these families have a continued stake in the monarchy s survival 121 furthermore big ticket defense contracts provide ample opportunity to divert revenue to key regime supporters to help buy their loyalty such patronage can come from artificially inflating prices and using that for kickbacks to various actors it can also come from hiring local companies especially via offset contracts who may provide overpriced contracts for poor quality work or even no work third security sector spending plays a crucial role in maintaining sectarian animosities the exclusion of shia from these contracts is a major source of grievance and enables an us versus them mentality on the island moreover the contracts for security services performed by various foreign members from places like jordan and pakistan as well as the procurement contracts to support them divorce the enlisted and noncommissioned officer corps in particular from the bahraini population writ large finally and of particular importance bahrain s procurement budget keeps the united states and other patrons committed to the monarchy s survival the united states not only relies on the regime for continued basing rights but also benefits from lucrative arms sales while bahrain may not necessarily need so many u s supplied f 16v fighter jets for defense it is clear the regime sees these aircraft purchases as a sound investment for ensuring continued backing from the united states long term vulnerability in the long term however bahrain s procurement practices are causing fiscal problems aggravating societal grievances and obstructing reforms that would shore up the monarchy s legitimacy first very high levels of security sector spending and the associated potential for corruption have imperiled bahrain s long term fiscal stability it is unclear where bahrain s regime will get the money for the purchases whether from the privy purse saudi arabia or some other donor in addition neither parliament nor the populace know whether the country will need to make an immediate one time payment or pay in various installments 122 the needed funds will not be coming from the united states all u s assistance to bahrain amounted to just a bit more than 1 million in 2017 123 second excessive spending on security depletes funding for social programs that could address sectarian and cross sectarian grievances only the leftovers from defense spending are available to provide housing education or infrastructure for the average bahraini citizen within even that paltry allocation to larger social needs shia then receive the barest minimum state resources required for basic social order third arms purchases have been used to put down protests and peaceful calls for reform thereby preventing democratic and economic reforms that would enhance the regime s legitimacy despite the repression the protests continue to pressure the current bahraini political settlement bahrain s monarchy has thus backed itself into a corner in order to achieve its primary goal of maintaining an absolute monarchy it fears opening up even a bit to the needed democratic and economic reforms that would give the regime greater legitimacy the royal family must therefore rely on a combination of coercion patronage and sectarianism a regime reliant on such a foundation is threatened if any of those three pillars should fall should the coercive apparatus of the state fail for any reason localized demonstrations might swell again as witnessed in 2011 without patronage to key actors those actors may seek other better options sectarianism in particular is far from a sturdy pillar for the regime sunni and shia could overcome the animosity by rallying around grievances common to both groups there have been several occasions when reformists from the two sects have worked together including in 1996 when both jointly protested the bahraini government s decision to renege on promised democratic reforms 124 during the initial days of the 2011 uprisings the protests were largely nonsectarian and the general federation of bahrain trade unions the main trade union in the country which has both sunni and shia members twice called for general strikes to protest the use of force against demonstrators 125 the wa ad society a left leaning secular opposition society that was disbanded in may 2017 by the government 126 included both shia and sunnis and continued a long running trend of cross sectarian movements that advocate for unity across religions being especially targeted by the bahraini security sector 127 reformists have overcome sectarian divides to demand government action and could do so again it would not be easy but it is also not impossible alternatively if the regime increases its demonization of shia especially in the armed forces it could accidentally ignite a sectarian conflict in a country where its co religionists are the minority 128 the regime has been publishing and distributing hyper sectarian material to the bdf that encourages discrimination against non sunnis and even labels shia as heretics who must repent or be killed 129 one indicator of rising anti shia extremism is that over 100 bahrainis joined the self proclaimed islamic state including a former police lieutenant from a family close to the monarchy 130 by relying excessively on sectarianism to maintain its power the monarchy combined with various sectarian identity entrepreneurs on all sides could accidentally light the very spark of an uprising it seeks to avoid policy recommendations for the united states under the obama administration the united states made some limited steps to check the bahraini regime s authoritarianism his administration withheld some arms purchases from bahrain following the 2011 uprisings and publicly chastised the bahraini regime in 2016 though no sanctions were imposed on any bahraini officials nor was military cooperation interrupted since 2012 the united states had an administrative hold on providing weapons to the ministry of interior though that hold did not apply to the coast guard or to the military nor did it affect u s training for the moi 131 in 2017 the trump administration dropped human rights conditions for arms sales though some restrictions remain on weapons that can be used for crowd control 132 the united states and other western powers have tremendous leverage over bahrain which receives almost all its weapons from the united states and relies on its more powerful security partners to defend it from a major attack by iran the united states can mitigate its strategic risks by using that leverage to nudge the monarchy toward greater reform before it is too late security sector procurement reform will encounter fierce resistance from the monarchy as well as from its local patron saudi arabia but slow painful reforms now can help lessen the chances of popular unrest and political instability in bahrain which would be highly detrimental to u s interests in the region start with security sector procurement reform for decades western governments have usually focused on efforts to integrate the shia into the security sector as a means of enhancing the bahraini government s legitimacy this is a noble goal that western countries should continue to pursue fixing this problem however is a long term task even if shia were recruited into the security services today it would be a decade until they made it to mid level ranks and many shia may not even apply given the poor opinion they hold of the regime and the likelihood of being seen as traitors by their own communities efforts to foster shia integration will also be wrenching for society and have encountered resistance from the bahraini monarchy in the meantime working on procurement issues is a less controversial place to start and the results can be seen more quickly without as much social turmoil in order to build the legitimacy of the bahraini monarchy and make it more accountable to the population in a shorter timeframe western governments should use their leverage to influence the bahraini monarchy to improve security sector procurement transparency and accountability procurement reform is a less controversial and more advantageous place for larger government reforms for several reasons first issues of transparency and accountability as well as security sector abuses already crosscut most of bahraini society focusing on common ground can build more trust between sunni and shia communities bahraini society has already shown a clear concern for procurement on social media bahrainis raise doubts about large military purchases especially about where the country will get the money and parliamentarians have tried to raise such questions as well 133 second the procurement sector is so large that even limited reforms would go a long way toward fixing bahrain s fiscal imbalances and freeing up resources for social programs in 2012 the bahraini parliament tried to formulate a strategy to handle the budget deficit and the country s debt and it highlighted that military spending was reducing the resources available for spending on health and education 134 yet without the basic facts and figures of security sector procurement parliament cannot hope to balance the overall budget 135 third procurement reform would be an important start in addressing larger civil military relations issues by gradually bringing the security sector under a level of civilian nonmonarchical control action items for procurement reform the first efforts should focus on influencing bahrain to publish a national security strategy the strategy should be unclassified though there may be a need for some classified annexes with that strategy in hand bahraini citizens and western powers can better evaluate how bahraini security sector procurement contracts are or should be aligned with bahrain s national security goals as well as u s interests such as containing iran and fighting terrorism this step can help ensure that bahrain s budget is more rationally spent ideally leaving more money for economic and social development projects second given how western defense contracts can be abused to bolster the bahraini regime s coercive apparatus western governments should insist on extra scrutiny of all contracts associated with bahrain governments should mandate that all contracts associated with the bahraini state be published to improve transparency and accountability any u s associated contracts or contract licenses that cannot be made public due to national security concerns should have to be reported to congress along with the national security justification offset contracts should be forbidden and the beneficial owners of all subcontractors agents and other intermediaries should be made publicly known all contracts should include corruption clauses to make contract termination easier should malfeasance be discovered thereby incentivizing better contract delivery third western countries should encourage bahrain to develop a timeline and action plan for adherence to international contracting standards like the open contracting partnership standards including their data standards these standards lay out best practices for the entire contracting process from contract tenders to eventual contract completion some contracts will need to be classified but those contracts should be the exceptions not the rule which contracts will remain secret should be explicitly spelled out to the public and approved by parliament parliamentary committees should be established with clearances and the legislative authority to be briefed on and approve secret security contracts just as is done in the united states the timelines involved must be enforced with credible sanctions for noncompliance signing up to such standards would signal to key actors within bahrain that this particular form of patronage would be ending the bahraini government would build legitimacy as the public could better see that bahraini security spending is more accountable and public tendering and fewer secret contracts could improve the bahraini economy as smaller contractors could compete on price and quality rather than on connections helping to bring in new economic actors and bolstering existing smaller ones eventually along with better contracting the government should be required to submit audited statements of security sector procurement with an eye to ultimately putting the entire government budget to public audits with limited specified exceptions for national security concerns bahrain already has a national audit court that produces a professional and detailed annual public report on financial and administrative activities and irregularities unfortunately it does not cover all government revenues nor can it report on royal court expenditures much of the security sector or the sovereign wealth fund 136 various scandals like the aforementioned land scandals indicate it is not capturing all spending either however the example of bahrain s gcc ally kuwait demonstrates that auditing bahrain s expenditures is feasible kuwait has a relatively open and transparent system of publicly available audited accounts while some money may not be accounted for the declared value of oil and gas exports compared to oil and gas revenues showed deviations that were within typical international norms indicating that much less of the country s revenue was being illicitly siphoned off 137 use u s leverage given that security procurement is a key component of the regime s survival strategy the monarchy will fight back with threats to revoke western basing rights or to buy weapons from other suppliers especially russia and china there is precedent for this when congress froze a sale of small arms to bahrain in 2011 bahrain bought the small arms elsewhere 138 when the united states froze sales of humvees that same year bahrain purchased turkish made cobra armored personnel carriers instead though in september 2017 bahrain announced it was purchasing u s humvees again 139 bahrain also publicly stated that it would buy russian s 400 missiles though no details of the purchase were offered 140 bahrain should be reminded that such purchases would endanger the u s security umbrella overall and jeopardize western military aircraft operations there bahrain as well as its patron saudi arabia recognize that they need the u s bases in bahrain at least as much as the united states does and the united states should be willing to use that leverage to push for security procurement related reforms using its leverage over procurement should be coupled with other leverage such as limiting high level engagement additional audits of prior weapons deliveries and heightened congressional scrutiny of purchases to further pressure bahrain at the same time the united states should explore viable alternatives to basing the navy s fifth fleet in bahrain this is prudent planning given the importance of the base and the potential risks to the stability of the regime viable basing alternatives would lessen the bahraini regime s leverage for unconditional support there have been a few proposals in this direction in 2013 a u s navy captain published a paper on fifth fleet basing alternatives 141 that same year former director of national intelligence admiral dennis blair argued for moving the fifth fleet headquarters back aboard a u s navy flagship as it was before 1993 both to signal u s resolve for the need for bahraini government reforms and because of the vulnerability of u s bases there given prior instability 142 the house version of the fy2016 national defense authorization act ndaa contained a provision to require the department of defense to report on alternative locations for the u s navy but the final bill did not contain the provision 143 that provision should be reinstated in the fy2020 ndaa after all bahrain does not have a viable external protector besides the united states neither china nor russia at this time has the willingness or capability to take on that role thus the time is now while the balance of power is in the united states favor the united states continues to support the bahraini regime without demanding reform despite the fact that the monarchy s form of rule violates democratic principles and engenders risks to bahrain s stability as the united states learned from the arab spring deals with such dictatorships can rapidly collapse and the domestic conflicts that ensue can lead to much larger strategic dilemmas thus though fraught and difficult the reasonable approach is to use existing western leverage to push for gradual reforms that give the bahraini people hope for a better future under a constitutional monarchy a relatively stable legitimate constitutional monarchy will be a better guarantee of western interests in the region in the long run especially when compared to the potential results of continuing to support a brittle absolute monarchy given the size of the security sector procurement budget the importance of these purchases in sustaining coercion the role the security sector plays in the bahraini people s grievances and the leverage western governments have security sector procurement reform is a good place to start gradual reform can act as a catalyst to rein in a free spending regime giving foreign investors more confidence that bahraini debt may be worth purchasing and keeping the state better afloat it can also help bring more accountability to the regime and reduce human rights abuses thereby improving the legitimacy of the monarchy such measures to mitigate against popular unrest can help better ensure in the long term that the united states maintains its basing rights and freedom of movement in the persian gulf region the reforms will not be easy but the rewards can be substantial and the consequences of not doing so disastrous notes 1 richard mcdaniel no plan b us strategic access in the middle

overview the increased likelihood that brexit is delayed and the possibility of a second referendum is helping lift sterling as has been the case for most of the time since the june 2016 referendum the prospects of a softer and or later brexit is understood as sterling positive the other key focus is us chinese trade the delay of the tariff escalation and the prospects for a deal helped lift equity markets yesterday but profit taking is cutting those gains today the msci asia pacific index ended a six day advance today with nearly all the regional markets lower the dow jones stoxx 600 in europe is giving back all of yesterday s gains us shares are trading lower in europe and the early call looks like a 0 25 lower for the s p 500 asia pacific bonds reacted to higher rates in the us yesterday but european bond yields are softer with the exception of uk gilts outside of sterling the yen and swiss franc are firm as the use of funding is unwound on the margins the dollar bloc currencies and scandis are lower oil prices are consolidating yesterday s losses which appear to have been sparked by a presidential tweet asia pacific the euphoric response to the extension of the tariff freeze between the us and china was not sustained yesterday s rally was exaggerated the csi 300 which was up 6 yesterday fell 1 2 today the dramatic rise spooked officials today they warned an increase in unregulated margin debt there are two other considerations first china s banking and insurance regulatory commission cbirc has called for 30 of new lending to be targeted to the private sector second a politburo meeting at the end of the week will reportedly focus on financial market reforms economic reports from the region are mixed industrial output rose in singapore by 0 9 in january though the year over year pace slumped to 3 1 from 1 7 in december in taiwan industrial production was 1 86 lower than a year ago a bit worse than expected the market had expected hong kong s january exports to have fallen by 2 8 after december s 5 8 year over year decline instead they slipped 0 4 the smallest decline in three months consumer confidence in south korea rose for the fourth consecutive month in february the takeaway is that weakness from the end of last year has carried over into 2019 but the stage appears to be being set for better economic traction in the coming months the dollar firmed to a marginal new high for the year against the yen yesterday near jpy111 25 it stopped a little shy of the high from december 26 and the 100 day moving average both found near jpy111 40 jpy111 45 the dollar has found support on the pullback near jpy110 75 and yesterday s low was around jpy110 60 there are three sets of expiring options to note today the first is a 420 mln option at jpy110 70 the second is for 1 2 bln at jpy111 00 the third is jpy111 30 and jpy111 50 options for a total notional amount of 1 54 bln the australian dollar is pushing back after reaching about 0 7185 yesterday we anticipated the recovery from the china embargo story that saw the aussie drop hard last thursday we suggested selling into the corrective upticks that could run toward 0 7200 expiring options are struck at 0 7200 and 0 7175 today a 516 mln and a 782 mln respectively initial support is seen near 0 7140 and then 0 7125 we note that india s airstrike on a reported terrorist camp in pakistan is weighing on the rupee note that these are two nuclear armed powers using conventional weapons europe there is one story in europe today and that is brexit the economic and events diary is otherwise sparse and there have a few developments in the past 24 hours first labour leader corbyn as moved in line with his party s platform and endorsed a call for a second referendum labour like the conservatives were seeing defections and more have been threatened corbyn s tact was arguably necessary to try to outflank his critics within the party to be sure even if the entire party were to vote for a second referendum it would not be sufficient to carry the day by itself and there are thought to be around two dozen labour mps that would likely vote against a second referendum if perchance a second referendum would be agreed depending on the options voters would have it could be a way to overturn the 2016 referendum results such prospects would likely lift sterling second in order to try to maintain some control over her party may is allowing the cabinet to discuss a postponement in brexit from the end of next month as recently as yesterday reports indicated may was opposed to an extension and told merkel as much initially a couple month delay until around the eu parliament election at the end of may seemed possible but subsequent signals from brussels suggest that too short of a delay may not accomplish anything and a longer delay may be warranted third the bank of england will step up its liquidity provisions to british banks over the next month the boe will provide indexed long term repos on a weekly basis rather than monthly carney and others are emphasizing that the central bank will provide any and all liquidity that may be needed separately carney has signaled that the boe has no intention to reduce its balance sheet until the base rate is at 1 50 currently it sits at 0 75 sterling is testing the 1 32 area last thursday it briefly dipped below 1 2970 the 1 32 area has blocked the upside earlier this year and last november the penetration was deeper last october and november reaching almost 1 33 but it proved equally unsustainable we are looking at potential toward 1 34 1 35 on a confirmation of a delay in brexit the euro has slumped to gbp0 8600 its lowest level in a bit more than 20 months the next important technical target is around gbp0 8470 0 8500 the euro is in a quarter cent range mostly below 1 1370 it is trapped between large expiring options at 1 1330 1 1335 are options for 1 8 bln euros that will be cut today there is another 1 5 bln euros struck 1 1390 1 1400 that said the intra day technicals warn north american operators may try taking the single currency lower america the us reports housing starts and permits which expected to have remained soft in december the conference board s measure of consumer confidence will be reported today it declined in the three months through january but is expected to have risen this month the main feature though is powell s first leg of his congressional testimony when testifying powell speaks for the fed rather than himself and this will allow the fed to talk in a single voice even though there are of course a range of opinions and views powell will get pressed on the economic assessment and the balance sheet what appears to many to be a sharp reversal in the fed s stance may also come under scrutiny perhaps some may point to the rally in stocks this year and wonder if the fed did not over react to the tightening of financial conditions at the end of last year powell has found the right tone for investors apparently with the patience and flexibility manta no need to innovate today mexico report december retail sales after yesterday s slightly softer than expected q4 gdp there is more talk today that the central bank of mexico could begin cutting rates in h2 19 it hiked rates four times last year including in december the overnight rate stands at 8 25 trump s tweet about oil and the subsequent decline stole the wind from the canadian dollar sails yesterday the us dollar rose from near cad1 3115 to almost cad1 3200

fed repo manâ s valentineâ s day present the new york federal reserve recently sent out an early valentine s day present to a certain group of individuals however this gift wasn t to overleveraged american consumers but rather to those who are employed repossessing one of those goodies they can t afford on february 12th the ny fed made the announcement that a record number of consumers are falling behind on their car payments there are now over 7 million car loans past due by at least 90 days as of q4 2018 along with a record 89 million loans that are outstanding for subprime auto borrowers with credit scores below 620 the delinquency rate spiked to over 16 and the number of subprime borrowers jumped to 20 of loans outstanding the amount of overdue loans has spiked by 1 3 million since its previous high set in 2011 when the unemployment rate was at 9 the total market for auto loans now stands at 1 2 trillion some may take solace in the fact this level is much smaller than the 9 trillion home mortgage market that brought down the global economy in 2008 however when you combine car loans with all the other debt consumers have accumulated due to the fed s nearly decade long zero interest rate policy the numbers become daunting household debt is now at an all time record high of 13 5 trillion this number includes a record 1 trillion in c c loans and 1 5 trillion of student loan debt and while that 9 trillion mortgage market isn t in as bad shape as it was a decade ago home prices have climbed back into an echo bubble and have become extremely susceptible to rising interest rates and the credit cycle in addition when you add in the boom in corporate credit rising from 6 trillion in 08 to 9 6 trillion today along with the 22 trillion national debt you can clearly see the state of the us consumer has never been more precarious in fact these debt holders are desperately clinging to their jobs and hoping the economy avoids even a mild contraction in growth or any further advance in debt service payment costs considering all of these mindboggling obligations owed by consumers and tax payers is it really much of a mystery as to why the fed is so panicked about even the slightest hint of a recession a recent federal reserve survey also reported that 40 of american adults say they couldn t produce 400 in an emergency without sliding into debt or selling some assets that is if they have any to sell in the first place the state of the us economy and indeed that of the entire globe now depends upon the conditions of zirp and asset bubbles that are made permanent this shouldn t be a shocking conclusion after all central banks wanted to re leverage the economy after the great recession hit in 2008 and concluded the only way to accomplish this was to make money virtually free for the past 10 years of course one of the consequences from manipulating the cost of money in such an unprecedented manner was to force buyers into new vehicles at record numbers this in turn drove the price of a new vehicles to record highs while it also significantly raised the residual values of new auto leases and thus made monthly payments much more affordable as long as zero percent financing was available to those with lower and lower credit ratings the bull market in car sales and prices continued however much like what occurred at the apex of the real estate bubble circa 2006 all bubbles inevitably pop auto prices eventually increased to a level that became unaffordable to most buyers dealers ran out of subprime borrowers and the central bank began to normalize monetary policy and then the car market goes into reverse as the economy slows due to the inevitable turn in the business cycle what follows is a huge number of cars start heading back to the dealership think jingle mail 2 0 but with car keys instead of front door keys causing the price of used vehicles to drop sharply this in turn causes residual lease values to plummet and as a consequence the cost of new leases begins to surge the collapse of the auto bubble happens to be just one small example of the unintended consequences and massive distortions created by central banks gone rogue economic growth has slowed from 4 2 in q2 of last year to just 1 5 in q4 estimated by the atlanta fed as the u s economy continues to slow and the global economy waxes towards recession what is happening in the auto sector should also occur with student loans credit card debt mortgage backed securities leveraged loans clo s and so on of course banks are the primary holders of all this debt and their balance sheets will once again become an issue in 2019 2020 the next recession will cause tax receipts to plunge and push annual deficits to spike above 2 trillion or an incredible 10 of gdp adding another two trillion dollars per year to an already unmanageable 22 trillion national debt is not something our bond market or world s reserve currency can easily withstand in other words the us tax payer will be required to perform yet another bailout of the banking system inflation is the primary tool governments use to accomplish its economic rescue plans and that means investors will need to flock into the economic freedom that can only be found in the ownership of gold michael pento produces the weekly podcast the mid week

chairman president and chief operating officer john isakson our chief financial officer mike cronin our chief accounting officer and the leaders of our business subsidiaries jeff sherman paul cullen joel murphy and boone dupree following the conclusion of our prepared remarks we ll be pleased to answer any questions you might have before we begin i d like everyone to note that forward looking statements may be made during our call these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve various risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially there is a discussion about these risks and uncertainties in yesterday s press release our press release can be found on our website at pacapts com the press release also includes our supplemental financial data report for the fourth quarter and year ended 2018 with definitions and reconciliations of non gaap financial measures and other terms that maybe used in today s discussion we encourage you to refer this to this information during the review of our operating results and financial performance unless we otherwise indicate all per share results that we discuss this morning are based on the basic weighted average shares of common stock and class a partnership units outstanding for the period i now would like to turn the call over to dan dupree dan daniel m dupree chairman of the board and chief executive officer thanks jared we had a really strong fourth quarter in terms of ffo growth and for the year again produced solid dividend and same store results for our stockholders we also continued our asset acquisition strategy during 2018 for the year we acquired a total of five multifamily communities three student housing communities six grocery anchored shopping centers and three class a office buildings to keep our portfolio fresh we sold four of our older multifamily communities aggregating almost 70 million of gain on a gaap basis and we deploy those net proceeds into newer properties our combined irr on those four transactions was over 20 these sales clearly impacted our balance sheet and cash flow positively but had a limited near term impact on our ffo per share our real estate loan investment program continues to be a mainstay of our growth strategy during 2018 we acquired three multifamily communities through this program representing an aggregate of 151 million of investment as of the end of 2018 our loan book contained over 501 million of real estate loan commitments of which approximately 336 million has been funded this represents a pipeline of over 800 million of prospective assets all in all we are able to generate irrs of approximately 14 to 15 through this program while getting off market access to new quality assets through the purchase options which are embedded in these loans we have a distinct competitive advantage in pursuing investments due to the consistency of capital availability provided through our series a and series m preferred stock that is sold through preferred capital securities which is our affiliated broker dealer during 2018 we sold an aggregate of almost 453 million of preferred stock through this innovated capital raising program this past february i guess we re still in february alone we have raised over 52 million and we expect to continue a strong pace of sales throughout the balance of 2019 as you ve heard us say before the measure of a company s success is not simply reflected in its financial performance for just one year or just one quarter for that matter but the company s performance over time with this in mind if you had invested 1 000 in our ipo in april of 2011 and automatically reinvested all dividends received on your common stock your average annualized return on investment with us would have been 16 7 as of december 31 2018 as for dividends we have increased our common stock dividend 14 times since the first dividend following our ipo producing an annualized dividend growth rate of 14 4 we function as a team and you re going to hear from a number of our key people this morning who have responsibility over important parts of our strategy we ll start with our president and chief operating officer lenny silverstein who will talk about fourth quarter and 2018 results lenny leonard a silverstein vice chairman of the board president and chief operating officer thanks dan we once again produced outstanding operating results for the fourth quarter revenues for the fourth quarter were 106 3 million or over 30 greater than the revenues earned for the fourth quarter last year our ffo for the fourth quarter 2018 was approximately 16 1 million or 0 38 per share which represents a 22 6 increase in ffo per share compared to the fourth quarter of last year these outstanding operating results for the fourth quarter 2018 allowed us to again increase our common stock dividend payable for the quarter to 0 26 per share or 4 greater than the dividend paid to our stockholders for the fourth quarter of 2017 for the full year our revenues were 397 million or 35 1 greater than our revenues for 2017 our 2018 ffo was 1 41 per share representing a 6 8 increase over 2017 and our total common stock dividends paid for 2018 were 1 02 per share representing an 8 5 increase over the dividends paid in 2017 in all we are pleased to report these very strong growth metrics across the board during the fourth quarter of this year we also issued an aggregate of approximately 1 2 million shares of our common stock for approximately 16 1 million in connection with the exercise of warrants previously issued under our series a preferred stock and unit offering overall we had approximately 41 8 million shares of common stock outstanding as of december 31 2018 representing an increase of approximately 3 2 million shares or 8 3 compared to the end of 2017 as we have previously disclosed we will continue to focus on increasing the outstanding number of shares of our common stock and switching to other financial statement metrics we continue to add quality assets to our portfolio in a meaningful way for 2018 our total assets net of depreciation were approximately 4 4 billion or an increase of approximately 1 1 billion or 35 6 compared to 2017 this growth in 2018 was driven primarily by the acquisition of 17 properties partially offset by the sale of four properties in addition to increasing total assets our cash flow from operations for 2018 was approximately 145 4 million which represents a 68 4 increase in cash flow compared to 2017 john isakson our chief financial officer will now discuss our capital market strategy john john isakson chief financial officer thanks lenny for 2019 we expect the cap rates on multifamily acquisitions will remain low with grocery anchored shopping center and class a office acquisition cap rates higher interest rates which have been volatile in the last 12 months have the potential to stabilize but the current environment remains uncertain while interest rates in 2018 saw an anticipated rise what was unexpected however was the sudden and dramatic retreat at the end of the year with the fed potentially tempering its rate hikes and the equity markets cooling we can see a more stable rate environment in 2019 given the recent volatility and the uncertainty in the environment we have taken a cautious approach to our acquisition and portfolio financing strategy approximately 96 of our permanent property level mortgage debt has fixed interest rates or variable interest rates that are capped you may note that this represents a decline in the percentage of floating rate debt in our portfolio as we refinanced a good portion of our floating rate debt to fixed rate debt in 2018 and we ll look to do more floating to fixed conversions in 2019 we recently closed on the expansion of our 200 million corporate line of credit extending the maturity for 3 years and giving us flexibility for an additional year at the end of the term our borrowings under the line of credit as of today are zero and we believe the current capacity of the line will serve us well for the foreseeable future in any event we would need to increase the capacity of the line we have an accordion feature that allows us to expand up to a total of 300 million on the acquisition front we have been utilizing longer term fixed rate debt for all of our property types and have taken advantage of the recent drop in rates to refinance maturing loans with attractive terms we have approximately 88 million of maturing debt in 2019 remaining to refinance we have already begun the process of securing new debt for these assets and given the current rate environment we will look to lock in our interest rates as soon as practicable for our multifamily portfolio freddie mac and fannie mae remain our primary lenders we enjoy preferred borrower status and have excellent relationships with both agencies retail assets are financial life companies and typically for terms equal to our multifamily assets our office transactions are also financed primarily through life insurance companies with terms that are generally comparable to retail and multifamily although the maturities maybe longer jeff sherman who is responsible for all aspects of our multifamily business will now discuss our fourth quarter and 2018 results jeff jeffery d sherman executive vice president director of multifamily investments thanks john as we look back at 2018 our multifamily portfolio performed very well for the year ended december 31 2018 our same store set achieved year over year rental revenue and total revenue growth of 2 9 and 3 2 respectively same store net operating income for the year ended december 31 2018 achieved 3 4 year over year growth reflecting our intensified focus on operational results property management was successful in holding variable expense growth under 3 year over year while our asset management team was able to limit property tax growth to 2 9 year over year this all in an environment in which operational expenses and property taxes were experiencing significant inflation we believe our 2018 revenue and net operating income results place us in a top group of performance among our multifamily reit peers it is also worth noting that in 2019 our same store set were more than doubled from 10 properties to 21 properties this new composition covers eight states and 13 msas versus the 2018 same store set which included four states and 7 msas moving to investments we remained active in the fourth quarter with two acquisitions two dispositions and one real estate loan investment our first acquisition citypark view south is a 200 unit class a community located in charlotte north carolina and built in 2017 our second acquisition the vestavia reserve is a 272 unit class a community completed in 2017 and located in the birmingham alabama suburb of vestavia hills this acquisition checked so many boxes for us vestavia hills is a high barrier to entry market with excellent schools and affluent demographic as previously mentioned we also sold two assets in the fourth quarter mcneil ranch was located in austin texas and built in 1999 making it the oldest property in our portfolio it s sold for close to a 4 4 cap rate on trailing financials which resulted in approximate 19 annualized return and generated a gain on sale of approximately 13 9 million additionally we sold stoneridge farms a 2005 vintage property located in nashville tennessee this sale resulted in an approximate 21 annualized return and generated a gain on sale of approximately 16 8 million the sale of these properties continues to demonstrate our ability to acquire operate and dispose of assets to maximize returns to our stockholders further these sales decreased the average age of our multifamily portfolio at 4 3 years old at the time of sale as we ve outlined previously our strategy to maintain the youngest portfolio in the industry limits our exposure to capital expenditures over time and shows that our product maintains a competitive advantage in design function and technology over older product finally turning to our real estate loan investment program we close on an aggregate loan investment of up to 16 7 million for the construction of a 332 unit class a multifamily community located in jacksonville florida with the addition of this investment pac s multifamily investment portfolio now consists of 13 multifamily projects totaling over 4100 units let me now call paul cullen the head of preferred campus communities our student housing division paul paul cullen chief marketing officer thanks jeff our student housing strategy remains focused on acquiring best in class properties at tier 1 universities that are located within walking distance to the center of the respective campus our portfolio as of the end of 2018 now consists of 7 properties in 4 states across 7 different universities totaling 5 208 beds starting with the successful move in season this past fall the fourth quarter s activities reflect the strong start to the 2018 2019 academic year our stabilized student portfolio has an average physical occupancy of 97 8 as of december 31 with the entire portfolio having an average physical occupancy of 94 8 in addition we continue to see strong operating results with our stabilized properties performing in line with expectations not surprisingly with rental rate set for 2019 2020 academic year we now also focus on renewing leasing on our existing residents and signing new resident leases we re working hard to produce another strong lease up we continue to actively seek new acquisition and originate real estate loan investments which we sometimes call mezzanine loans for our student housing developments preferred campus management are affiliated student housing property management company currently is leasing up a new third party 816 bed student housing development near kennesaw state university in atlanta and the master planned time districts where preferred campus communities currently has stadium village student housing community this new community as of today is now approximately 94 pre leased for the 2019 2020 academic year ksu has currently an enrollment of approximately 33 000 students during the fourth quarter last year pac also originated another mezzanine loan with the same developer to build the second phase with ksu student housing community currently in lease up this 543 bed community will be a 5 storey mid rise property the mezzanine loan community for this second phase is 13 6 million in all we look at our student housing division to produce consistent rent growth steady occupancy metrics for the foreseeable future let me now call on joel murphy the head of new market grocery anchored shopping centers division joel joel murphy president and chief executive officer of new market properties thank you paul we are pleased to report another strong quarter and year of overall operating performance we continue to execute our strategy to acquire invest in and operate grocery anchored centers that fit our investment criteria in quality suburban submarkets within the top 100 metros from the mid atlantic southeast and austin texas we target centers that are market dominant grocery store anchors that maintain a number one or number two market share in that submarket and have high and growing sales volume stores in that particular center as a result of this focused product type strategy we had zero exposure to the 2018 and early 2019 highly publicized bankruptcy filings at sears which includes kmart mattress firm toys r us and payless shoes leasing space for new tenants and keeping tenants happy are our daily focus at the end of 2018 our total portfolio consisting of 45 grocery anchored centers aggregating approximately 4 7 million square feet was 94 3 leased the portfolio excluding two centers in redevelopment was 95 9 leased we are also particularly pleased with the momentum of our lease renewals this past quarter and year both on anchors and in line tenants every grocery store anchor on our portfolio that had a lease rolling in 2018 four of them renewed their leases at their contractual rates as of 2019 we have seven grocery store anchors that have leases rolling and four of them have already renewed their leases again at their contractual rates in december of 2018 we closed on hollymead town center in the affluent high barrier to entry market in charlottesville virginia center is anchored by a 60 000 square foot harris teeter inaudible anchored by 142 000 square foot target store the acquisition of hollymead is our first asset in virginia and is also our first center occupied by target after the close of the quarter in early january we acquired gayton crossing a kroger shadow anchored shopping center in richmond this is our second asset in virginia and our first in richmond it is located in highly desirable west end submarket and kroger has a very high volume store in this center both of these centers are excellent examples of our focused strategy anchored by a market leading grocer that has a high sales per square foot store and located in quality sunbelt the mid atlantic suburban submarket with solid demographics in addition to excellent operating performance we achieved several strategic goals with our portfolio during 2018 first we made a market into market entry into virginia with these two acquisitions second we expanded our presence in north carolina with one publix anchored center and third we further penetrated central and south florida with two publix anchored centers all of these initiatives enhance our portfolio three mile demographic metrics of density average household income and educational attainment we executed on all cylinders in the fourth quarter and throughout the year released vacant space we kept our centers leased we renewed at higher rates we managed our expenses had very little bad debt expense and we grew our portfolio the combination of these positive trends allowed our new market subsidiary to upstream outstanding results to pac as of today we now own 46 grocery anchored centers in 8 states in 19 markets totaling approximately 4 8 million square feet with more than 700 independent operating leases 23 of these centers are anchored by publix and 13 are anchored by the kroger harris teeter banners both publix and kroger are market share leaders although they have not yet announced 2018 results each generated approximately 2 billion in earnings in 2017 now let me turn the call over to boone dupree the head of our office division boone boone dupree chief executive officer of preferred office properties thanks joel in the fourth quarter last year the office division closed two new investments buying capitol towers in south park charlotte and originating a development loan for a project called 8 west next to georgia tech in atlanta 7 days after closing capitol towers we signed a new 33 000 square foot customer to bring that property to 95 leased the economic terms and the timing of the deal were substantially ahead of our underwriting so it s nice win for the company and a reflection of our strategic local relationships and ability to be nimble 8 west was an equally positive result for the quarter marking our first office development loan closing this is a category of investment that s been highly profitable for pac the one we ve been selective in entering on the office side besides the order qualifiers of high quality location product and sponsor we like the risk reward of 8 west for a couple of reasons first it benefits from a cost basis 20 below other projects coming to market which means the developer team can offer space for lease at more competitive terms and second our investment sits behind 17 million of cash equity insulating the first loan dollar as of this call the developer team is under construction completing site work and targeting a middle of 2020 delivery for the 7 storey building we have over 1 million square feet of leased prospects in the pipeline and expect to have good news to report on that front soon like our other pac loan investments we have an option to purchase the property once it achieves stabilized occupancy excluding 8 west which is under construction pac ended q4 with 2 6 million square feet of class a office across the southeast and texas that portfolio was 93 leased with more than 8 years of weighted average lease term remaining our top 5 tenants ihg albemarle state farm usaa and harley clarke represent 43 of the portfolio total base rent and together carry more than 10 years of remaining lease term the portfolio is financed mostly long term fixed rate life company debt and excluding our galleria 75 property which is planned for redevelopment the earliest maturity comes in 2028 we re currently in the pick of several key asset management initiatives most notably a repositioning of 150 fayetteville in raleigh north carolina we acquired this 560 000 square foot property last july and immediately kicked off design for a full renovation of the building s lobby plaza elevators and amenities construction will begin in the first quarter of 2019 and is expected to be substantially delivered this summer for some context 150 fayetteville is one of the tallest and most recognizable buildings in downtown raleigh these enhancements will reaffirm its iconic stature in raleigh which we believe will drive absorption retention and accelerating lease economics in building within the portfolio and with each new investment our goal is to find accretive real estate opportunities budget to beat underwriting and execute to beat our budget our results today reflect that commitment the weighted average cap rate or initial noi yield on purchase price for the portfolio is 7 4 on a gaap basis and total gaap noi earned through q4 is approximately 4 million ahead of our internal underwriting on less than a two year average life of investment we will continue to bring this level of focus to identifying and executing profitable investments managing risk within our portfolio and outperforming expectations while implementing our strategy to build scale in high growth southeastern texas major markets where we have relationships and operating expertise i look forward to providing you updates in coming quarters and with that we ll turn the call back to dan daniel m dupree chairman of the board and chief executive officer thanks boone our team has continued to do an excellent job building a carefully constructed portfolio executing on our strategies and vision and delivering consistently strong financial results each operating vertical subsidiary has a distinct investment strategy which continues to allow us to be targeted within this strategy our investments in student housing grocery anchored shopping centers and office buildings have proven to complement our core focus on multifamily very well we continue to believe that all of these investments together with the cash flow generated from our real estate loan investment program and the line of sight these loans afford us to future acquisitions place pac in a sustainable position to continue to deliver outsized results for our stockholders that having been said we re running an irr business and attempting to fit it into a quarter to quarter structure particularly due to the often unpredictable nature of our mezzanine loan payoffs our quarterly results can have outsized swings with this in mind we are providing ffo per share guidance in a range for 2019 of 1 44 per share to 1 50 per share with the caveat that our better quarterly results will come later in 2019 as to the swings referenced above let me give you an example our urban mezzanine loans that paid off at the end of q3 last year was extremely lucrative for us the 68 million loan one of our largest actually our second largest allowed us to book our highest annual interest rate at 16 net of our weighted average cost of equity we estimate this one loan represented a quarterly contribution in ffo in q1 and q2 last year of approximately 2 5 million or 0 06 a share the loan paid off at the end of q3 and it will take us through the first half of 19 to replace the lost ffo the good news is that we have new mezzanine loans that we ll be funding over the course of the year and we expect that by the second half of the year these new loans will largely have backfilled the urban loans with that i d like to thank you for joining us on our earnings call this morning i d like to turn the call back to our operator so that she might open the floor for any questions or thoughts you may have operator questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions our first question today will come from michael lewis of suntrust please go ahead michael lewis suntrust analyst great thank you dan i wanted to ask a little bit more about the guidance are you able to get provide any details on some of the underlying assumptions such as purchase option income and maybe acquisitions dispositions new loan and volume kind of what underlies that ffo range daniel m dupree chairman of the board and chief executive officer well i think i mean the big thing is the lumpiness of the pay off of the mezz loans and the example i gave that was it s kind of ironic we at the end of the third quarter we had the issue with the over accrual and it kind of confuses the issue that was probably no that s not probably it has been our most successful mezz loan to date in part because of the size but more so because of the interest rate on it at 16 which is 3 to 4 greater than our typical deals but when these things pay off and i can t tell you we didn t see this thing paying off we knew it was going to pay off candidly a mezz loan that we initiated last year in san jose california we expected that that would go further to offset the loss of revenue from the irvine deal and it kind of morphed into a deal that did not offer us quite the return we thought but it s the lumpiness of the mezz loan deal i think when we get through irvine and candidly get through san jose ultimately most of our mezz loans are fairly generic in size and they are fairly generic in structure we ve been talking about 500 million book for probably the last 18 months that s where we ve been we re funded at about 60 of the book but we some deals are going to deliver quick some are going to take a little longer to lease up they re going to deliver later and what really is happening in 2019 is we re really feeling the impact first of the irvine loan and then of others so when we get to the second half of the year i think our ffo per share will be much more consistent with what it s been in the past and but i will tell you this also the days of us telling you on a regular basis that we re going to grow earnings per share in excess of 10 that was a fairly easy goal for us to achieve when we were 1 billion company or a 2 billion company but it s the law of big numbers and we re not going to be increasing the size of the book by much overtime may run in a range of 400 million to 600 million but i think a more reasonable run rate is going to be somewhere between 7 and 8 or 9 michael lewis suntrust analyst okay does your 2019 guidance include any material purchase option termination income and then i also wanted to ask about the equity compensation what the assumption is for that it was obviously a negative that helped you in 4q what s kind of built into the guidance for that as well daniel m dupree chairman of the board and chief executive officer in terms of one of the things we re trying to do with our purchase options in order in part to smooth out the lumpiness and become somewhat more predictable is convert the discount into additional accrued interest it s paid similarly in the waterfall and so we re in the process of doing that and i didn t understand the second half of the question could you repeat that michael lewis suntrust analyst yeah i guess it s sort of a g a run rate question right the equity kind of realized your stock is has been volatile but you had a negative equity compensation cost in 4q and so depending how you include that in your guidance for next year that could be impactful as well i was just curious daniel m dupree chairman of the board and chief executive officer go ahead john why don t you answer that john isakson chief financial officer mike the stock awards that were given up by the executive management team whether we don t have that particularly budgeted for 2019 one way or the other and how that works and what we do is going to largely depend on performance so i think it s really hard to estimate michael lewis suntrust analyst okay what i m trying to get at here is when i strip out the loan loss reserve in 2018 it looks like your ffo isn t growing at all next year and i guess i m just kind of wondering what first of all if that s correct and then second of all what are the factors that are causing that so i understand the loss on the loan and that s going to hurt you in the first half of this year especially the rest of these numbers i don t know anyway i don t know maybe this is something to follow up with offline john isakson chief financial officer yes mike i think it s why don t you give me a call and let s follow up offline because i do think there are some factors in there that are more complicated and maybe are worth going through in the call michael lewis suntrust analyst sure could i just ask do you expect your affo to grow in 2019 and can i assume you expect the dividends will be covered by affo john isakson chief financial officer well first of all yes you can expect affo to grow in 2019 and over the course of the year our dividend will be covered by affo as it has every year and not just marginally so but comfortably so but as we ve had in the past there may be quarters within the year where we don t cover and it goes back to the mezz loans and the accrued piece which is booked as ffo but is not cash received so it s not affo but i don t have the number in front of me but i think our affo coverage for 18 was around 73 michael lewis suntrust analyst okay i may follow up with that too the reason i asked that is because it looks like in 3q it wasn t covered and then in 4q you had this big accrued interest benefit and if you back that out i m not sure it s recovered john isakson chief financial officer yeah we are going to well you can t back it out i mean we get the accrued that s cash coming in it s earned but that s always been sort of a deal with us because of the mezz loans and the amount of accrued interest that we have when they pay off numbers are pretty significant and then particularly and probably in q3 when irvine settled there was there was a even though we had over accrued there was a big accrued payment so we re going to as long as we have the mezz loans we re going to be lumpy on affo coverage but the expectation is as it has been in the past that we comfortably cover our dividends with affo sort of i mean it s a big deal that we make out in the marketplace that in the unlisted reit field where we are active raising money and so few of the sponsors cover their dividend with cash ffo that we do so significantly michael lewis suntrust analyst okay thank you operator our next question will come from jim lykins of da davidson please go ahead james lykins d a davidson co analyst good morning guys first a question about the series a and preferreds you mentioned 50 million or 52 million in february can you give us a sense for how to be thinking about that throughout 19 is 52 million a good monthly run rate now daniel m dupree chairman of the board and chief executive officer well it s a good monthly run rate i don t know that it s a sustainable run rate our budget for the year is to raise 0 5 billion in that space obviously 52 million with 75 something would signal something greater than that yeah the real challenge for us and this is not an insignificant point is that this is very very cheap capital it gives us a huge competitive edge you may not we may not feel it so much right now but the thing about the public market that i ve seen over and over again during my career is that when the public market spigot is on there is no limit to how much money you can raise as a general rule but when the spigot is cut off there is nothing there and during the period of 2009 10 and 11 they were the run rate of capital raise in the broker dealer channel was in the neighborhood of 20 billion to 25 billion a year i mean a huge amount of money so we really like what we ve been able to do i think beyond blackstone and then maybe an interval fund or two we re raising more money in that space than anybody and i think that s testament to an incredible team that we have both here and out of the field selling our preferred stock but as we raise this money we are paying out dividends on it we re paying out a 6 dividend the overall cost to us is about 7 so really puts pressure on us to find accretive ways within our areas of expertise to invest the dollars in an accretive way i don t have any hesitation thinking that any multifamily property for example is going to be a big that we could buy at cap rates that are available today i have no hesitation saying that those will be very very strong 10 year performers for us the irrs and multifamily are as good as any product type that we re involved with but it does put pressure early on because of the compressed cap rates so the fact that we re raising all that money increases the pressure on us to i mean and frankly it drives the fact that we re a diversified company because we need to be a diversified to deal with both quarterly returns as well as what real estate really should function on which is longer term irrs james lykins d a davidson co analyst okay that is all i m sorry go ahead dan daniel m dupree chairman of the board and chief executive officer i was just going to say i ve probably answered two or three questions there i got going on that one james lykins d a davidson co analyst and yeah that s extremely helpful and also a retail question so i guess this one is for joel but any color on how store leasing trends or housing start leasing is trending how we should be thinking about 2019 and if you could tell us what assumptions might be in your guidance joel murphy president and chief executive officer of new market properties so jim that is an initiative that we are working on and we ll be delivering more of that during the one quarter call for 19 it sounds we ve had is the portfolio is growing and the pool was so small that you even really talk about same store was interesting but maybe really not even relevant to the trajectory of the business and like on the multifamily side what there is now is that our pools are going to growth from 10 assets to 21 assets we ll have now going into 19 i think i ll try think we would have 39 assets in our same store pool so we re now to the point that next quarter you can look forward to us delivering you some metrics as it relates to same store james lykins d a davidson co analyst okay and how are you thinking about capital recycling for the retail portfolio you ve been on a pretty robust acquisition pace the past few years are there any properties that could be candidates to sell daniel m dupree chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes there is i think you always need to think about that and obviously the time of his the way we finance these with mid or long range debt this property related that does give you a win when that debt matures that you then have to run an analysis and say do we want to sell this or do we want to roll it over and refinance it and as john mentioned in his remarks there are a number of deals i believe 8 that a lot of which are the ones we acquired in 2014 that are coming up in the third quarter for renewal and right now our sense is based on the financing market and based on how we ve been able to grow the noi and what we think the future of the noi is we re going to roll those over and refine now if something came up on looking at an asset and thought well it s not core to us or we think we ve really gotten the noi we can inaudible we could easily make a decision to sell that asset and so forth now james lykins d a davidson co analyst okay thanks guys operator ladies and gentlemen this will conclude our question and answer session at this time i d like to turn the conference back over to dan dupree for any closing remarks daniel m dupree chairman of the board and chief executive officer just wanted to tell you that we appreciate your interest in our company we have a group of people sitting around the table here in atlanta i would put these folks up against anybody i ve ever had the pleasure dealing with in my 40 plus year career we are laser focused on creating value for our

looking statements may be made during our call these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve various risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially there is a discussion about these risks and uncertainties in yesterday s press release our press release can be found on our website at pacapts com the press release also includes our supplemental financial data report for the fourth quarter and year ended 2018 with definitions and reconciliations of non gaap financial measures and other terms that maybe used in today s discussion we encourage you to refer this to this information during the review of our operating results and financial performance unless we otherwise indicate all per share results that we discuss this morning are based on the basic weighted average shares of common stock and class a partnership units outstanding for the period i now would like to turn the call over to dan dupree dan daniel m dupree chairman of the board and chief executive officer advertisement advertisement thanks jared we had a really strong fourth quarter in terms of ffo growth and for the year again produced solid dividend and same store results for our stockholders we also continued our asset acquisition strategy during 2018 for the year we acquired a total of five multifamily communities three student housing communities six grocery anchored shopping centers and three class a office buildings to keep our portfolio fresh we sold four of our older multifamily communities aggregating almost 70 million of gain on a gaap basis and we deploy those net proceeds into newer properties our combined irr on those four transactions was over 20 these sales clearly impacted our balance sheet and cash flow positively but had a limited near term impact on our ffo per share our real estate loan investment program continues to be a mainstay of our growth strategy during 2018 we acquired three multifamily communities through this program representing an aggregate of 151 million of investment as of the end of 2018 our loan book contained over 501 million of real estate loan commitments of which approximately 336 million has been funded this represents a pipeline of over 800 million of prospective assets all in all we are able to generate irrs of approximately 14 to 15 through this program while getting off market access to new quality assets through the purchase options which are embedded in these loans we have a distinct competitive advantage in pursuing investments due to the consistency of capital availability provided through our series a and series m preferred stock that is sold through preferred capital securities which is our affiliated broker dealer during 2018 we sold an aggregate of almost 453 million of preferred stock through this innovated capital raising program this past february i guess we re still in february alone we have raised over 52 million and we expect to continue a strong pace of sales throughout the balance of 2019 as you ve heard us say before the measure of a company s success is not simply reflected in its financial performance for just one year or just one quarter for that matter but the company s performance over time with this in mind if you had invested 1 000 in our ipo in april of 2011 and automatically reinvested all dividends received on your common stock your average annualized return on investment with us would have been 16 7 as of december 31 2018 as for dividends we have increased our common stock dividend 14 times since the first dividend following our ipo producing an annualized dividend growth rate of 14 4 we function as a team and you re going to hear from a number of our key people this morning who have responsibility over important parts of our strategy advertisement advertisement we ll start with our president and chief operating officer lenny silverstein who will talk about fourth quarter and 2018 results lenny leonard a silverstein vice chairman of the board president and chief operating officer thanks dan we once again produced outstanding operating results for the fourth quarter revenues for the fourth quarter were 106 3 million or over 30 greater than the revenues earned for the fourth quarter last year our ffo for the fourth quarter 2018 was approximately 16 1 million or 0 38 per share which represents a 22 6 increase in ffo per share compared to the fourth quarter of last year these outstanding operating results for the fourth quarter 2018 allowed us to again increase our common stock dividend payable for the quarter to 0 26 per share or 4 greater than the dividend paid to our stockholders for the fourth quarter of 2017 for the full year our revenues were 397 million or 35 1 greater than our revenues for 2017 our 2018 ffo was 1 41 per share representing a 6 8 increase over 2017 and our total common stock dividends paid for 2018 were 1 02 per share representing an 8 5 increase over the dividends paid in 2017 in all we are pleased to report these very strong growth metrics across the board during the fourth quarter of this year we also issued an aggregate of approximately 1 2 million shares of our common stock for approximately 16 1 million in connection with the exercise of warrants previously issued under our series a preferred stock and unit offering advertisement advertisement overall we had approximately 41 8 million shares of common stock outstanding as of december 31 2018 representing an increase of approximately 3 2 million shares or 8 3 compared to the end of 2017 as we have previously disclosed we will continue to focus on increasing the outstanding number of shares of our common stock and switching to other financial statement metrics we continue to add quality assets to our portfolio in a meaningful way for 2018 our total assets net of depreciation were approximately 4 4 billion or an increase of approximately 1 1 billion or 35 6 compared to 2017 this growth in 2018 was driven primarily by the acquisition of 17 properties partially offset by the sale of four properties in addition to increasing total assets our cash flow from operations for 2018 was approximately 145 4 million which represents a 68 4 increase in cash flow compared to 2017 john isakson our chief financial officer will now discuss our capital market strategy john john isakson chief financial officer advertisement advertisement thanks lenny for 2019 we expect the cap rates on multifamily acquisitions will remain low with grocery anchored shopping center and class a office acquisition cap rates higher interest rates which have been volatile in the last 12 months have the potential to stabilize but the current environment remains uncertain while interest rates in 2018 saw an anticipated rise what was unexpected however was the sudden and dramatic retreat at the end of the year with the fed potentially tempering its rate hikes and the equity markets cooling we can see a more stable rate environment in 2019 given the recent volatility and the uncertainty in the environment we have taken a cautious approach to our acquisition and portfolio financing strategy approximately 96 of our permanent property level mortgage debt has fixed interest rates or variable interest rates that are capped you may note that this represents a decline in the percentage of floating rate debt in our portfolio as we refinanced a good portion of our floating rate debt to fixed rate debt in 2018 and we ll look to do more floating to fixed conversions in 2019 we recently closed on the expansion of our 200 million corporate line of credit extending the maturity for 3 years and giving us flexibility for an additional year at the end of the term our borrowings under the line of credit as of today are zero and we believe the current capacity of the line will serve us well for the foreseeable future in any event we would need to increase the capacity of the line we have an accordion feature that allows us to expand up to a total of 300 million on the acquisition front we have been utilizing longer term fixed rate debt for all of our property types and have taken advantage of the recent drop in rates to refinance maturing loans with attractive terms we have approximately 88 million of maturing debt in 2019 remaining to refinance we have already begun the process of securing new debt for these assets and given the current rate environment we will look to lock in our interest rates as soon as practicable for our multifamily portfolio freddie mac and fannie mae remain our primary lenders advertisement advertisement we enjoy preferred borrower status and have excellent relationships with both agencies retail assets are financial life companies and typically for terms equal to our multifamily assets our office transactions are also financed primarily through life insurance companies with terms that are generally comparable to retail and multifamily although the maturities maybe longer jeff sherman who is responsible for all aspects of our multifamily business will now discuss our fourth quarter and 2018 results jeff jeffery d sherman executive vice president director of multifamily investments thanks john as we look back at 2018 our multifamily portfolio performed very well for the year ended december 31 2018 our same store set achieved year over year rental revenue and total revenue growth of 2 9 and 3 2 respectively same store net operating income for the year ended december 31 2018 achieved 3 4 year over year growth reflecting our intensified focus on operational results property management was successful in holding variable expense growth under 3 year over year while our asset management team was able to limit property tax growth to 2 9 year over year this all in an environment in which operational expenses and property taxes were experiencing significant inflation we believe our 2018 revenue and net operating income results place us in a top group of performance among our multifamily reit peers it is also worth noting that in 2019 our same store set were more than doubled from 10 properties to 21 properties this new composition covers eight states and 13 msas versus the 2018 same store set which included four states and 7 msas advertisement advertisement moving to investments we remained active in the fourth quarter with two acquisitions two dispositions and one real estate loan investment our first acquisition citypark view south is a 200 unit class a community located in charlotte north carolina and built in 2017 our second acquisition the vestavia reserve is a 272 unit class a community completed in 2017 and located in the birmingham alabama suburb of vestavia hills this acquisition checked so many boxes for us vestavia hills is a high barrier to entry market with excellent schools and affluent demographic as previously mentioned we also sold two assets in the fourth quarter mcneil ranch was located in austin texas and built in 1999 making it the oldest property in our portfolio it s sold for close to a 4 4 cap rate on trailing financials which resulted in approximate 19 annualized return and generated a gain on sale of approximately 13 9 million additionally we sold stoneridge farms a 2005 vintage property located in nashville tennessee this sale resulted in an approximate 21 annualized return and generated a gain on sale of approximately 16 8 million the sale of these properties continues to demonstrate our ability to acquire operate and dispose of assets to maximize returns to our stockholders further these sales decreased the average age of our multifamily portfolio at 4 3 years old at the time of sale as we ve outlined previously our strategy to maintain the youngest portfolio in the industry limits our exposure to capital expenditures over time and shows that our product maintains a competitive advantage in design function and technology over older product finally turning to our real estate loan investment program we close on an aggregate loan investment of up to 16 7 million for the construction of a 332 unit class a multifamily community located in jacksonville florida with the addition of this investment pac s multifamily investment portfolio now consists of 13 multifamily projects totaling over 4100 units

texas we target centers that are market dominant grocery store anchors that maintain a number one or number two market share in that submarket and have high and growing sales volume stores in that particular center as a result of this focused product type strategy we had zero exposure to the 2018 and early 2019 highly publicized bankruptcy filings at sears which includes kmart mattress firm toys r us and payless shoes leasing space for new tenants and keeping tenants happy are our daily focus at the end of 2018 our total portfolio consisting of 45 grocery anchored centers aggregating approximately 4 7 million square feet was 94 3 leased the portfolio excluding two centers in redevelopment was 95 9 leased we are also particularly pleased with the momentum of our lease renewals this past quarter and year both on anchors and in line tenants every grocery store anchor on our portfolio that had a lease rolling in 2018 four of them renewed their leases at their contractual rates as of 2019 we have seven grocery store anchors that have leases rolling and four of them have already renewed their leases again at their contractual rates in december of 2018 we closed on hollymead town center in the affluent high barrier to entry market in charlottesville virginia center is anchored by a 60 000 square foot harris teeter inaudible anchored by 142 000 square foot target store the acquisition of hollymead is our first asset in virginia and is also our first center occupied by target after the close of the quarter in early january we acquired gayton crossing a kroger shadow anchored shopping center in richmond this is our second asset in virginia and our first in richmond it is located in highly desirable west end submarket and kroger has a very high volume store in this center both of these centers are excellent examples of our focused strategy anchored by a market leading grocer that has a high sales per square foot store and located in quality sunbelt the mid atlantic suburban submarket with solid demographics in addition to excellent operating performance we achieved several strategic goals with our portfolio during 2018 first we made a market into market entry into virginia with these two acquisitions second we expanded our presence in north carolina with one publix anchored center and third we further penetrated central and south florida with two publix anchored centers all of these initiatives enhance our portfolio three mile demographic metrics of density average household income and educational attainment we executed on all cylinders in the fourth quarter and throughout the year released vacant space we kept our centers leased we renewed at higher rates we managed our expenses had very little bad debt expense and we grew our portfolio the combination of these positive trends allowed our new market subsidiary to upstream outstanding results to pac as of today we now own 46 grocery anchored centers in 8 states in 19 markets totaling approximately 4 8 million square feet with more than 700 independent operating leases 23 of these centers are anchored by publix and 13 are anchored by the kroger harris teeter banners both publix and kroger are market share leaders although they have not yet announced 2018 results each generated approximately 2 billion in earnings in 2017 now let me turn the call over to boone dupree the head of our office division boone boone dupree chief executive officer of preferred office properties thanks joel in the fourth quarter last year the office division closed two new investments buying capitol towers in south park charlotte and originating a development loan for a project called 8 west next to georgia tech in atlanta 7 days after closing capitol towers we signed a new 33 000 square foot customer to bring that property to 95 leased the economic terms and the timing of the deal were substantially ahead of our underwriting so it s nice win for the company and a reflection of our strategic local relationships and ability to be nimble 8 west was an equally positive result for the quarter marking our first office development loan closing this is a category of investment that s been highly profitable for pac the one we ve been selective in entering on the office side besides the order qualifiers of high quality location product and sponsor we like the risk reward of 8 west for a couple of reasons first it benefits from a cost basis 20 below other projects coming to market which means the developer team can offer space for lease at more competitive terms and second our investment sits behind 17 million of cash equity insulating the first loan dollar as of this call the developer team is under construction completing site work and targeting a middle of 2020 delivery for the 7 storey building we have over 1 million square feet of leased prospects in the pipeline and expect to have good news to report on that front soon like our other pac loan investments we have an option to purchase the property once it achieves stabilized occupancy excluding 8 west which is under construction pac ended q4 with 2 6 million square feet of class a office across the southeast and texas that portfolio was 93 leased with more than 8 years of weighted average lease term remaining our top 5 tenants ihg albemarle state farm usaa and harley clarke represent 43 of the portfolio total base rent and together carry more than 10 years of remaining lease term the portfolio is financed mostly long term fixed rate life company debt and excluding our galleria 75 property which is planned for redevelopment the earliest maturity comes in 2028 we re currently in the pick of several key asset management initiatives most notably a repositioning of 150 fayetteville in raleigh north carolina we acquired this 560 000 square foot property last july and immediately kicked off design for a full renovation of the building s lobby plaza elevators and amenities construction will begin in the first quarter of 2019 and is expected to be substantially delivered this summer for some context 150 fayetteville is one of the tallest and most recognizable buildings in downtown raleigh these enhancements will reaffirm its iconic stature in raleigh which we believe will drive absorption retention and accelerating lease economics in building within the portfolio and with each new investment our goal is to find accretive real estate opportunities budget to beat underwriting and execute to beat our budget our results today reflect that commitment the weighted average cap rate or initial noi yield on purchase price for the portfolio is 7 4 on a gaap basis and total gaap noi earned through q4 is approximately 4 million ahead of our internal underwriting on less than a two year average life of investment we will continue to bring this level of focus to identifying and executing profitable investments managing risk within our portfolio and outperforming expectations while implementing our strategy to build scale in high growth southeastern texas major markets where we have relationships and operating expertise i look forward to providing you updates in coming quarters and with that we ll turn the call back to dan daniel m dupree chairman of the board and chief executive officer thanks boone our team has continued to do an excellent job building a carefully constructed portfolio executing on our strategies and vision and delivering consistently strong financial results each operating vertical subsidiary has a distinct investment strategy which continues to allow us to be targeted within this strategy our investments in student housing grocery anchored shopping centers and office buildings have proven to complement our core focus on multifamily very well we continue to believe that all of these investments together with the cash flow generated from our real estate loan investment program and the line of sight these loans afford us to future acquisitions place pac in a sustainable position to continue to deliver outsized results for our stockholders that having been said we re running an irr business and attempting to fit it into a quarter to quarter structure particularly due to the often unpredictable nature of our mezzanine loan payoffs our quarterly results can have outsized swings with this in mind we are providing ffo per share guidance in a range for 2019 of 1 44 per share to 1 50 per share with the caveat that our better quarterly results will come later in 2019 as to the swings referenced above let me give you an example our urban mezzanine loans that paid off at the end of q3 last year was extremely lucrative for us the 68 million loan one of our largest actually our second largest allowed us to book our highest annual interest rate at 16 net of our weighted average cost of equity we estimate this one loan represented a quarterly contribution in ffo in q1 and q2 last year of approximately 2 5 million or 0 06 a share the loan paid off at the end of q3 and it will take us through the first half of 19 to replace the lost ffo the good news is that we have new mezzanine loans that we ll be funding over the course of the year and we expect that by the second half of the year these new loans will largely have backfilled the urban loans with that i d like to thank you for joining us on our earnings call this morning i d like to turn the call back to our operator so that she might open the floor for any questions or thoughts you may have operator questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions our first question today will come from michael lewis of suntrust please go ahead michael lewis suntrust analyst great thank you dan i wanted to ask a little bit more about the guidance are you able to get provide any details on some of the underlying assumptions such as purchase option income and maybe acquisitions dispositions new loan and volume kind of what underlies that ffo range daniel m dupree chairman of the board and chief executive officer well i think i mean the big thing is the lumpiness of the pay off of the mezz loans and the example i gave that was it s kind of ironic we at the end of the third quarter we had the issue with the over accrual and it kind of confuses the issue that was probably no that s not probably it has been our most successful mezz loan to date in part because of the size but more so because of the interest rate on it at 16 which is 3 to 4 greater than our typical deals but when these things pay off and i can t tell you we didn t see this thing paying off we knew it was going to pay off candidly a mezz loan that we initiated last year in san jose california we expected that that would go further to offset the loss of revenue from the irvine deal and it kind of morphed into a deal that did not offer us quite the return we thought but it s the lumpiness of the mezz loan deal i think when we get through irvine and candidly get through san jose ultimately most of our mezz loans are fairly generic in size and they are fairly generic in structure we ve been talking about 500 million book for probably the last 18 months that s where we ve been we re funded at about 60 of the book but we some deals are going to deliver quick some are going to take a little longer to lease up they re going to deliver later and what really is happening in 2019 is we re really feeling the impact first of the irvine loan and then of others so when we get to the second half of the year i think our ffo per share will be much more consistent with what it s been in the past and but i will tell you this also the days of us telling you on a regular basis that we re going to grow earnings per share in excess of 10 that was a fairly easy goal for us to achieve when we were 1 billion company or a 2 billion company but it s the law of big numbers and we re not going to be increasing the size of the book by much overtime may run in a range of 400 million to 600 million but i think a more reasonable run rate is going to be somewhere between 7 and 8 or 9 michael lewis suntrust analyst okay does your 2019 guidance include any material purchase option termination income and then i also wanted to ask about the equity compensation what the assumption is for that it was obviously a negative that helped you in 4q what s kind of built into the guidance for that as well daniel m dupree chairman of the board and chief executive officer in terms of one of the things we re trying to do with our purchase options in order in part to smooth out the lumpiness and become somewhat more predictable is convert the discount into additional accrued interest it s paid similarly in the waterfall and so we re in the process of doing that and i didn t understand the second half of the question could you repeat that michael lewis suntrust analyst yeah i guess it s sort of a g a run rate question right the equity kind of realized your stock is has been volatile but you had a negative equity compensation cost in 4q and so depending how you include that in your guidance for next year that could be impactful as well i was just curious daniel m dupree chairman of the board and chief executive officer go ahead john why don t you answer that john isakson chief financial officer mike the stock awards that were given up by the executive management team whether we don t have that particularly budgeted for 2019 one way or the other and how that works and what we do is going to largely depend on performance so i think it s really hard to estimate michael lewis suntrust analyst okay what i m trying to get at here is when i strip out the loan loss reserve in 2018 it looks like your ffo isn t growing at all next year and i guess i m just kind of wondering what first of all if that s correct and then second of all what are the factors that are causing that so i understand the loss on the loan and that s going to hurt you in the first half of this year especially the rest of these numbers i don t know anyway i don t know maybe this is something to follow up with offline john isakson chief financial officer yes mike i think it s why don t you give me a call and let s follow up offline because i do think there are some factors in there that are more complicated and maybe are worth going through in the call michael lewis suntrust analyst sure could i just ask do you expect your affo to grow in 2019 and can i assume you expect the dividends will be covered by affo john isakson chief financial officer well first of all yes you can expect affo to grow in 2019 and over the course of the year our dividend will be covered by affo as it has every year and not just marginally so but comfortably so but as we ve had in the past there may be quarters within the year where we don t cover and it goes back to the mezz loans and the accrued piece which is booked as ffo but is not cash received so it s not affo but i don t have the number in front of me but i think our affo coverage for 18 was around 73 michael lewis suntrust analyst okay i may follow up with that too the reason i asked that is because it looks like in 3q it wasn t covered and then in 4q you had this big accrued interest benefit and if you back that out i m not sure it s recovered john isakson chief financial officer yeah we are going to well you can t back it out i mean we get the accrued that s cash coming in it s earned but that s always been sort of a deal with us because of the mezz loans and the amount of accrued interest that we have when they pay off numbers are pretty significant and then particularly and probably in q3 when irvine settled there was there was a even though we had over accrued there was a big accrued payment so we re going to as long as we have the mezz loans we re going to be lumpy on affo coverage but the expectation is as it has been in the past that we comfortably cover our dividends with affo sort of i mean it s a big deal that we make out in the marketplace that in the unlisted reit field where we are active raising money and so few of the sponsors cover their dividend with cash ffo that we do so significantly michael lewis suntrust analyst okay thank you operator our next question will come from jim lykins of da davidson please go ahead james lykins d a davidson co analyst good morning guys first a question about the series a and preferreds you mentioned 50 million or 52 million in february can you give us a sense for how to be thinking about that throughout 19 is 52 million a good monthly run rate now daniel m dupree chairman of the board and chief executive officer well it s a good monthly run rate i don t know that it s a sustainable run rate our budget for the year is to raise 0 5 billion in that space obviously 52 million with 75 something would signal something greater than that yeah the real challenge for us and this is not an insignificant point is that this is very very cheap capital it gives us a huge competitive edge you may not we may not feel it so much right now but the thing about the public market that i ve seen over and over again during my career is that when the public market spigot is on there is no limit to how much money you can raise as a general rule but when the spigot is cut off there is nothing there and during the period of 2009 10 and 11 they were the run rate of capital raise in the broker dealer channel was in the neighborhood of 20 billion to 25 billion a year i mean a huge amount of money so we really like what we ve been able to do i think beyond blackstone and then maybe an interval fund or two we re raising more money in that space than anybody and i think that s testament to an incredible team that we have both here and out of the field selling our preferred stock but as we raise this money we are paying out dividends on it we re paying out a 6 dividend the overall cost to us is about 7 so really puts pressure on us to find accretive ways within our areas of expertise to invest the dollars in an accretive way i don t have any hesitation thinking that any multifamily property for example is going to be a big that we could buy at cap rates that are available today i have no hesitation saying that those will be very very strong 10 year performers for us the irrs and multifamily are as good as any product type that we re involved with but it does put pressure early on because of the compressed cap rates so the fact that we re raising all that money increases the pressure on us to i mean and frankly it drives the fact that we re a diversified company because we need to be a diversified to deal with both quarterly returns as well as what real estate really should function on which is longer term irrs james lykins d a davidson co analyst okay that is all i m sorry go ahead dan daniel m dupree chairman of the board and chief executive officer i was just going to say i ve probably answered two or three questions there i got going on that one james lykins d a davidson co analyst and yeah that s extremely helpful and also a retail question so i guess this one is for joel but any color on how store leasing trends or housing start leasing is trending how we should be thinking about 2019 and if you could tell us what assumptions might be in your guidance joel murphy president and chief executive officer of new market properties so jim that is an initiative that we are working on and we ll be delivering more of that during the one quarter call for 19 it sounds we ve had is the portfolio is growing and the pool was so small that you even really talk about same store was interesting but maybe really not even relevant to the trajectory of the business and like on the multifamily side what there is now is that our pools are going to growth from 10 assets to 21 assets we ll have now going into 19 i think i ll try think we would have 39 assets in our same store pool so we re now to the point that next quarter you can look forward to us delivering you some metrics as it relates to same store james lykins d a davidson co analyst okay and how are you thinking about capital recycling for the retail portfolio you ve been on a pretty robust acquisition pace the past few years are there any properties that could be candidates to sell daniel m dupree chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes there is i think you always need to think about that and obviously the time of his the way we finance these with mid or long range debt this property related that does give you a win when that debt matures that you then have to run an analysis and say do we want to sell this or do we want to roll it over and refinance it and as john mentioned in his remarks there are a number of deals i believe 8 that a lot of which are the ones we acquired in 2014 that are coming up in the third quarter for renewal and right now our sense is based on the financing market and based on how we ve been able to grow the noi and what we think the future of the noi is we re going to roll those over and refine now if something came up on looking at an asset and thought well it s not core to us or we think we ve really gotten the noi we can inaudible we could easily make a decision to sell that asset and so forth now james lykins d a davidson co analyst okay thanks guys operator ladies and gentlemen this will conclude our question and answer session at this time i d like to turn the conference back over to dan dupree for any closing remarks daniel m dupree chairman of the board and chief executive officer just wanted to tell you that we appreciate your interest in our company we have a group of people sitting around the table here in atlanta i would put these folks up against anybody i ve ever had the pleasure dealing with in my 40 plus year career we are laser focused on creating value for our

the following is based on a new discussion paper 18 strategies for a green new deal how to make the climate mobilization work pdf from the labor network for sustainability the green new deal resolution recently submitted by rep alexandra ocasio cortez d ny and sen ed markey d mass proposes a broad vision to transform america it calls for a mobilization to create a climate safe america and thereby create millions of good high wage jobs virtually eliminate poverty provide unprecedented levels of prosperity and economic securing for all u s persons and counteract systemic injustices here s a strategy for how it can succeed mobilize government global warming has rightly been called history s greatest market failure correcting it cannot be left to the market the gnd will need bold economic planning industrial policies and public investment to guide and facilitate the process it will need full employment macroeconomic policies that prevent unemployment assure prosperity and encourage full use of economic resources during the transition and it will need public mobilization and redirection of human and material resources that are required for the transition therefore the gnd requires government institutions specifically designed to implement the transition to climate protection establish government agencies to oversee the transition mobilization for the gnd is an emergency that like mobilization for world war ii requires powerful governmental agencies dedicated to the purpose that can plan and implement the transition to a climate safe economy the green new deal agencies established by act of congress will raise capital implement labor force strategies organize funding for infrastructure such as transmission lines railways and pipelines fund research and development set and monitor energy efficiency standards for buildings appliances and equipment train and retrain workers and professionals set industrial location policies and coordinate the multifaceted activities of federal agencies state and municipal governments corporations and civil society organizations government initiative is necessary to cut through inertia bottlenecks and bureaucratic red tape use government to plan the transition climate protection requires the capacity to make long range plans that affect many aspects of life planning climate protection is in some ways similar to planning the nation s transportation system it requires making decisions such as whether to build highways or railways that will shape the life of the country for decades to come it requires the technical capacity to design and engineer such complex systems it requires taking into account a wide range of economic environmental and social factors and maximizing beneficial side effects while minimizing undesirable ones use regulatory powers to freeze phase out and replace all fossil fuel infrastructure in 1942 president franklin roosevelt banned the production of passenger cars to allow the reorganization of industry for war production the goals of the gnd require a similar though more gradual managed decline in fossil fuel production and use and its replacement by fossil free energy such a transition should be enforced by the regulatory powers of government state renewable portfolio standards rps provide an example a national rps should require replacement of fossil fuel energy by renewable energy at the annual rate necessary to meet gnd goals similar standards should be developed for conversion of transportation buildings industry and all other ghg producing sectors establish green new deal agencies for reorganizing economic sectors a fossil free economy will require transformation not just of individual workplaces and companies nor just of the economy as a whole but of specific industries and economic sectors industry wide planning is necessary to capture synergies and economies of scale establish level playing fields and ensure that different parts of an emerging climate protection system work together large scale long term coordinations that cannot be provided by the market here public climate policies industry wide collective bargaining and cooperation among businesses in the same industry need to go hand in hand a prime example of such cooperation was the reconstruction of the u s auto industry under president obama s economic recovery plan auto corporations and the uaw agreed to a large long term increase in energy efficiency to cut carbon emissions this involved cooperative planning for retooling the industry large scale federal support for developing new technology and substantial public investment in modernizing the industry on a low carbon basis the result was a steady decrease in carbon pollution rates an increase of jobs for auto workers and an end to the crisis that threatened to nearly eliminate auto production in the united states similar sectoral programs are necessary for electricity transportation agriculture forestry manufacturing waste management finance and many other industries use the tools of macroeconomic policy the new deal used the tools of what came to be known as macroeconomic or keynesian economic policy to steer the economy as a whole to fight unemployment and support new deal programs it used fiscal policy such as budget deficits and monetary policy such as low interest rates while neoliberalism has condemned keynesian macroeconomic policies designed to provide full employment the abandonment of such steering led to the deepest economic crisis since the great depression and an ongoing aftermath of income polarization and impoverishment for working people the gnd should apply macroeconomic policies that ensure full employment to reduce the fear that climate protection may threaten prosperity and also to give working people a greater stake in the transition use the powers of government to rectify past and present injustices jobs protecting the climate will be made available to those individuals and groups who have been denied equal access to good jobs job recruitment should include strong racial gender age and locational affirmative action to counter our current employment inequalities programs will require standards for local hiring and minority business enterprises programs need to provide job ladders within and across employers lest those who currently face only dead end jobs continue to face only dead end jobs in the climate protection economy gnd projects will remedy the concentration of pollution in marginalized and low income communities and counter the deprivation of transportation education health and other facilities in poor neighborhoods protect low income energy consumers current fossil fuel energy costs are themselves a prime source of poverty and economic inequality the gnd should ensure that the energy bills of low income families are affordable generally defined as 6 percent of gross household income the combination of investments in solar energy efficiency and weatherization will reduce the amount of assistance needed in many cases the bills will be below six percent of income eliminating the need for assistance all new public and publicly subsidized low income housing should be net zero with solar panels onsite and or offsite empower community led initiatives today a large swath of community based local and regional programs are already engaged in promoting the transition to a climate safe economy and society even in a government led transition they can on their own initiative implement community based renewable energy production such as rooftop solar collectors energy use reduction measures such as residential weatherization financial mobilization through community investment funds and new patterns of consumption such as shared bicycles perhaps most important they can provide both popular participation in the transition to climate protection and a means to hold the institutions of transition accountable democratize democracy the green new deal agencies need to meet the highest level of transparency and be subject to internal inspectors general and the government accountability office and specialized equivalents an oversight agency independent of the executive branch should supervise the agencies and report to congress and the public on their progress identify problems and failures and initiate course corrections the gnd should establish standards for democratically determined climate action plans at every level similar to the environmental impact statements legally mandated by many environmental laws the gnd should encourage local community groups coalitions and governments to develop and implement their own climate action plans at the community level and require such plans for all projects it funds mobilize labor a green new deal mobilization will require millions of workers during world war ii the war labor board actively recruited workers to regions and industries where they were most needed and government took the leading role in the rapid expansion of education training child care and housing for the new workforce today a labor reserve of more than 20 million people who are unemployed underemployed or outside the labor force could be available to go to work protecting the climate the gnd will need to match these workers to the employment sectors where they are needed and match the jobs to the needs of the workers leave no worker behind while climate protection will produce far more jobs than it eliminates it may also threaten the jobs of some workers in fossil fuel producing and using industries it is unjust that any worker should suffer through no fault of their own because of a policy that is necessary to protect society a green new deal must create alternative jobs and or livelihoods or face mass unemployment and a resulting rebellion against climate protection generally jobs should be made available in the locations where workers are or want to be using their existing skills and providing comparable wages and conditions employers must retrain and find jobs for those affected give them priority for new jobs provide economic benefits that allow not only a decent livelihood but a start on a new life ensure decent retirement benefits for those who choose it and invest in local communities to provide them a future beyond fossil fuels all impacted workers and communities should be included in a deliberative process and have a voice in shaping transition plans protecting threatened workers and communities dependent on fossil fuel jobs needs to start beforedevastating economic disruption begins the green new deal will establish community and worker protection funds to collect money in advance to replace taxes and fees paid by fossil fuel facilities and to invest in good jobs in affected communities it will target investments in fossil fuel energy communities designed to create jobs before or at the pace that fossil fuel jobs are declining guarantee jobs for all to counter the insecurity of working class life in general and the specific fear that climate protection may lead to job loss climate protection policies need to incorporate the principle of a job for everyone who wants one where other policies have not led to full employment government should serve as the employer of last resort for all who want to work putting them to work on climate protection and other socially needed activities the federal jobs guarantee jg envisions a federal program somewhat like the new deal s works progress administration wpa that would provide funds for non profit organizations local governments and other agencies serving the public to employ anyone who wants a job at a wage roughly comparable to the demands of the fight for 15 campaign the jg will not exclude any individual or group of people who want to work it will make whatever special provisions are necessary to employ veterans at risk youth ex convicts people with disabilities and other people with special needs and or barriers to employment the jobs provided by this program will pay an estimated 15 per hour plus benefits including health insurance because it guarantees that every person who wishes to work can find a public option job with a wage twice the current federal minimum wage plus benefits the jg will establish a standard that must be met by all employers in the private public or nonprofit sectors ensuring that no working person will live in poverty it will provide education training and apprenticeship opportunities ensure worker rights and good union jobs the green new deal needs to include pay and benefit standards that provide a decent life and future for working families it needs to support high road employers prevailing wage provisions like those required by the davis bacon act and project labor agreements negotiated between unions and employers to ensure that climate protection jobs elevate rather than depress wages and working conditions the green new deal like the original new deal must establish a new framework that protects workers fundamental constitutional and human rights reinforcing the rights of workers to express themselves freely organize bargain collectively and engage in concerted action on the jobshould be an explicit part of gnd as it was for war industries during mobilization for world war ii mobilize money and material resources when people hear about the green new deal they are likely to wonder where will the money come from they understandably fear that the costs will be enormous and that they will have to bear that burden through higher taxes but this ignores the fact that a fossil free economy will be much cheaper than the current fossil fuel model it also fails to take into account the opportunity for correcting our extreme inequality by taxing the rich to help pay for climate protection it disregards the trillions of dollars that american banks corporations and investors have lying unused in their bank accounts much of it from government giveaways they have received as economic stimulus and it ignores the enormous resources of the fossil fuel industry that should be used to pay for the damage they have done to the earth and every one of its people the gnd will use the financial benefits of fossil free energy the trillions of dollars given away to corporations and the wealthy in tax breaks and subsidies and the wealth of the fossil fuel industry itself to ensure that ordinary americans are far better off as a result of the transition to climate safety capture the benefits of the transition to fossil free energy fossil free energy is now cost efficient it is cheaper and provides more benefits than burning fossil fuels in the long run climate protection will pay for itself large investments currently go to maintaining replacing and expanding fossil fuel infrastructure the gnd will redirect that investment stream to building a fossil free economy replacing lost energy jobs and other gnd programs likewise all the money that would have been spent on coal oil and gas can go into the pockets of consumers and help pay for the gnd make the polluters pay the fossil fuel industry can and should bear much of the burden for the damage it does to humanity and the planet through taxes fees permit costs and other charges which can be used to pay for the gnd tax policy can help discourage carbon emissions while reversing our growing income inequality progressive taxation particularly on carbon wasting luxury goods like private jets can counteract negative effects on income equality another potential source for funding the transition to climate safety can be legal damages and fines collected from corporations for environmentally harmful practices the gnd should include litigation and legislation to hold fossil fuel producers and emitters responsible for their colossal damage to the atmosphere and the colossal cost of remediating it cut wasteful and unnecessary spending the united states now spends as much on the military as the next seven highest spenders combined the use of this money aside from pure waste has been for a series of wars many of them illegal under national and international law none of which has been successful all of which have caused incalculable human and material harm and none of which has contributed to the security of the american people many of them have been motivated by the pursuit of fossil fuels and all have contributed to global warming confronting climate change will reduce conflict and promote global peace and security transfer of funds from the military budget to the gnd would enhance the security of individuals and our country mobilize investment public borrowing through bond sales can provide substantial and inexpensive funds due to the ability of the federal reserve to buy public infrastructure bonds at low rates public purpose banks credit unions and investment and loan funds can provide more decentralized financial resources especially for smaller scale and community based projects if need be the federal reservecan simply buy infrastructure bonds just as it did with treasury securities in 1940 to finance the war effort the gnd will establish a program of climate bonds for the public like the war bonds of world war ii these should be a good investment for individuals particularly as an alternative to today s gutted pension plans and unattractive retirement investments if we are to subsidize energy investment the benefits should go first and foremost not to the 1 but to ordinary citizens who can use them to increase their economic security and retirement savings support and fund a global green new deal realizing the goals of the gnd requires global cooperation governments must work together to create a global framework that supports climate friendly jobs and development what has been called a global green new deal that requires the world to abandon neoliberalism and adopt a new strategy that puts the world s human resources to work meeting the world s desperate need for economic transformation that radically reduces ghg emissions a global climate protection investment fund is necessary on a scale that mobilizes all under utilized human and material resources worldwide rather than fighting each other for climate protecting jobs workers in different countries will benefit from national policies and international agreements that encourage countries to cooperate in sharing green technologies and expanding production for climate protection legally binding international agreements must phase out and ban the use of fossil fuels worldwide both climate protection and economic cooperation ultimately require demilitarization and policies of global common security globalization neoliberalism and free trade agreements have pitted the workers of the world against each other in a fight for climate protecting jobs a gnd will not pit workers against workers and discourage the growth of climate protecting industries and jobs abroad it will oppose both escalating trade wars and the free trade utopia of neoliberalism instead it will pursue mutually managed trade that encourages all countries to develop their climate protection industries and technologies as rapidly as possible while allowing the benefits to be shared in a way that protects workers in both developing countries and developed countries not to mention the planet as a whole conclusion the original new deal of the 1930s was not a single program or piece of legislation it was a whole era of turmoil in which contesting forces tried to meet a devastating crisis and shape the future of american society the new deal was part of a process of social change that included experimentation at a state regional and local level organization among labor unemployed rural urban elderly and other grassroots constituencies and lively debate on future alternatives that went far beyond the policies actually implemented in practice the gnd will similarly involve competing ideas and programs pushed in alliance and opposition by a wide range of constituencies and organizations that support the broad concept but disagree about details like the original new deal the gnd is trying to do something that has never been done before we will have to learn from experience and experiment and correct the mistakes we will inevitably make along the way but with these strategies we can make a start in the right direction

much to the consternation of bears everywhere the dow jones industrials have been on an absolutely torrid run since the markets opened up after christmas what started with donald trump backing off rumors of more cabinet upheaval starting a trade war with china and criticizing the fed has turned into a historic run of near unprecedented length only once in the past 10 years has the dow gone on a nine week uninterrupted rally with this one wiping out all of the losses in the wake of the fed raising interest rates at its december meeting trump may have kicked off the rally but it was the fed s punt with its january statement that put the wind under the market s sails and kept the party going the fed listened to the market s fears over raising rates too quickly and even removed language pertaining to its balance sheet reduction program so here we are at the end of february and trade talks between trump s merry band of mercantilists and china s are going nowhere the march 1 deadline for trump s proposed 25 percent import tariffs on 200 billion in chinese goods was extended indefinitely personally i never doubted for a second that the deadline would be extended and the reason is that trump the master of leverage has none in his talks with china it s the deficit stupid recently in a piece for strategic culture foundation i talked about the fundamental problem trump is facing is of his own doing our budget deficit and need to continue printing money to keep gdp from collapsing that fuels nearly all of trump s complaints about china we export debt and receive goods in return he thinks trashing the dollar automatically should cause the yuan to rise and that will balance out the trade but it doesn t have to work that way and it s not because china manipulates the yuan though they do just like everyone else it s because trump s sanctions and tariff regime around the world have increased the demand for dollars china s trade surplus dollars can be recycled back into emerging market trade partners without affecting the yuan exchange rate since the demand for dollars is rising globally as interest rates have begun to rise there is more than 9 trillion in foreign non bank corporate debt out there that has its coupons paid in dollars turkey for example last year had more than 220 billion in such debt that s why it was so vulnerable to a collapse of the lira but china and qatar happily supplied dollars into turkey to help get them past the worst of the crisis some of those debts were paid off and redenominated today the lira is stronger and president recep erdogan publicly refuses to take any money from the imf because he doesn t have to he knows he has other sources of emergency funding while turkey bleeds this dollar debt off and one of those sources is china russia went through a similar situation in 2015 after the ruble collapsed along with oil prices the main source of the pain was bond maturities at companies like gazprom and rosneft who were barred from dollar funding markets thanks to sanctions the bonds were paid out in dollars and the debts either reissued in euros rubles or yuan or simply retired and russia s forex reserves took the hit but once they were past those moments with help from the russian government getting access to china s foreign exchange reserves through swap arrangements the crisis ended what does this have to do ultimately with the dow a lot the deficit doom loop because the dow is the u s equity index most sensitive to the global macro situation it also is the most sensitive to political upheaval as it represents a relative safe haven play for international investors these stocks are big and liquid they can take inflows and still pay a real positive yield so in this environment trump can flail and fulminate all he wants but the reality is we need china as much if not more than they need us he needs to fund that 1 2 trillion deficit he s running 500 600 billion of which comes from the trade deficit with china if that trade stops because of trump s 25 percent tariffs then interest rates will rise because the demand for dollars will skyrocket this will cause the budget deficit to widen asset prices to plunge alongside velocity of money and collateral chains to break like they re made of spun sugar we saw this story in december and trump didn t like it the first time he loves a rising dow he thinks it s a vote of confidence of his performance as president he s wrong but what else is new with the narcissist in chief what he has to face is that china holds most of the cards here at the margin the chinese no more want to see the united states fail then trump does so they will give him some small wins to save face which he will spin to high heaven just like he did with the nafta renegotiations it s what he does but the fundamental problems facing the united states that he is not addressing pension under funding a demographic time bomb and latent exploding debt servicing costs are all the leverage china needs to stand its ground on all of the most important issues so expect this historic rally to continue a bit longer if trump backs downs and averts a trade war for now there is little to fear of a repeat of december once this rally ends the fed has caved and so will trump after china recedes from the headlines the dow will take a brief pause before challenging the all time high after that global investors will refocus their attention on the real crisis brewing today the political breakdown of the european union thanks to brexit and the european parliamentary elections in may but that is a story for another day money markets contributor tom luongo is the publisher of the gold goats n guns newsletter his work also is published at strategic culture foundation lewrockwell com zerohedge and russia insider a libertarian adherent to austrian economics he applies those lessons to geopolitics gold and central bank policy
london feb 26 2019 globe newswire verona pharma plc aim vrp nasdaq vrna verona pharma a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapies for respiratory diseases announces its audited results for the full year ended december 31 2018 and provides a clinical development update operational and development highlights solid clinical progress with ensifentrine rpl554 nebulizer formulation demonstrating efficacy and tolerability in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd reported positive top line data from a phase 2b four week 403 patient clinical trial for maintenance treatment of copd ensifentrine met the primary endpoint at all doses p200ml in peak fev 1 after 4 weeks of dosing no minimum effective dose could be determined after 4 weeks of dosing no minimum effective dose could be determined this peak bronchodilator effect was observed at the first dose and was sustained over four weeks p2 5 units was observed in all dose groups after four weeks patients global impression of change a scale reflecting the patient s belief about the efficacy of treatment indicates that patients felt better on ensifentrine compared to placebo p 0 01 ensifentrine was well tolerated at all doses with an adverse event profile similar to placebo on january 14 2019 we announced top line data from an exploratory phase 2a double blind placebo controlled three way cross over trial in 79 subjects with copd which included two different doses of ensifentrine 1 5 mg and 6 mg or placebo dosed twice daily for three days in addition to a dual bronchodilator therapy comprising tiotropium and olodaterol a commonly used lama laba dosed once daily this clinical trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of ensifentrine dosed on top of lama laba and lama laba ics a high hurdle as patients already on maximum bronchodilator treatment have very few treatment alternatives which was conducted at sites in the united states and in the united kingdom we reported top line data from this trial earlier than expected in january 2019 the data from this phase 2a trial demonstrated significantly improved evening peak lung function when ensifentrine was added to tiotropium and olodaterol in patients with moderate to severe copd although the data did not achieve statistical significance in respect of an improvement in the morning peak lung function improvement in average fev 1 additional bronchodilation following morning dose on the third day 0 4 hours with 1 5 mg of ensifentrine was statistically significant when added on top of stiolto tiotropium plus olodaterol or lama laba compared to placebo 1 5 mg p 0 039 although the improvement in morning peak fev 1 on the third day of dosing the primary endpoint was not statistically significant additional bronchodilation following morning dose on the third day 0 4 hours with 1 5 mg of ensifentrine was statistically significant when added on top of stiolto tiotropium plus olodaterol or lama laba compared to placebo 1 5 mg p 0 039 although the improvement in morning peak fev on the third day of dosing the primary endpoint was not statistically significant ensifentrine compared to placebo produced a statistically significant improvement in evening peak fev 1 on the third day of dosing additional bronchodilation when administered on top of the standard bronchodilator tiotropium plus olodaterol stiolto 1 5 mg p 0 001 6 mg p 0 002 on the third day of dosing additional bronchodilation when administered on top of the standard bronchodilator tiotropium plus olodaterol stiolto 1 5 mg p 0 001 6 mg p 0 002 ensifentrine compared to placebo produced a statistically significant improvement in residual volume following the evening dose on the third day of dosing when administered on top of the standard bronchodilator tiotropium plus olodaterol stiolto 1 5 mg p 0 002 6 mg p 0 036 copd successful development of dpi and pmdi formulations in addition to our nebulized formulation of ensifentrine we have developed both pressurized metered dose inhaler or pmdi and dry powder inhaler or dpi formulations of ensifentrine for the maintenance treatment of copd development of pmdi and dpi formulations could enable us to expand the ensifentrine clinical development program to include those patients with moderate to severe copd for whom nebulizer treatment is less attractive delivery of orally inhaled drugs by pmdi or dpi is a mainstay of maintenance treatment for patients with moderate to severe copd we believe that over 90 of patients with diagnosed copd use inhalers such as a pmdi or dpi rather than a nebulizer to administer treatment it is estimated that in the united states approximately 5 5 million patients with moderate to severe copd use inhalers for maintenance therapy successful development of a pmdi or dpi formulation of ensifentrine for moderate disease would greatly expand the addressable market for the drug and represents a multi billion dollar potential opportunity we have completed enrollment in part 1 of our 2 part phase 2 clinical study using the dpi formulation to treat copd patients and we now expect interim efficacy and safety data from part 1 of this study in the first quarter of 2019 part 1 of this study comprises measurement of lung function safety and pharmacokinetic profiling in copd patients following a single dose of inhaled ensifentrine over a dose range part 2 of this study will comprise a crossover study evaluating a range of ensifentrine doses in this same patient cohort dosed over one week we expect to initiate part 2 of the study in the first quarter of 2019 and to report data in the second half of 2019 we expect to initiate a phase 2 clinical study using the pmdi formulation to treat copd patients during the first half of 2019 with data expected in 2020 the clinical trial design will be similar to the dpi clinical trial we may also explore the development of ensifentrine in pmdi and or dpi formulations for the treatment of asthma and other respiratory diseases ensifentrine is effective in a short proof of concept study in patients with cystic fibrosis in march 2018 we also announced top line data from a phase 2a clinical trial to study pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of nebulized ensifentrine in cf patients ensifentrine demonstrated a statistically significant bronchodilator effect pk profile was consistent with that observed in patients with copd ensifentrine was well tolerated with a strong focus on moving towards phase 3 clinical trials with nebulized ensifentrine for the maintenance treatment of copd we are prioritizing our resources and funding initially on the maintenance market in the short term over progressing our planned trials to evaluate nebulized ensifentrine as a treatment for acute exacerbations of copd in hospitalized patients and as a treatment for cf patients corporate ensifentrine is protected by granted and pending patents we believe that medicinal products containing ensifentrine are protected by our ip beyond 2035 we have worldwide commercialization rights for ensifentrine we raised 70m in gross proceeds from investors from our april 2017 global offering comprising an initial public offering ipo on the nasdaq global market nasdaq and a concurrent european private placement together with a shareholder private placement members of our management team which we have strengthened and expanded during the year and our board of directors have extensive experience in large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies particularly in respiratory product development from drug discovery through commercialization and have played important roles in the development and commercialization of several approved respiratory treatments including symbicort daliresp daxas flutiform advair breo ellipta and anoro ellipta financials the operating loss for the year ended december 31 2018 was 25 6 million 2017 29 8 million and the loss after tax for the year ended december 31 2018 was 19 9 million 2017 20 5 million research and development costs research and development costs were 19 3 million for the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to 23 7 million for the year ended december 31 2017 a decrease of 4 4 million the cost of clinical trials reduced by 5 9 million as there were four active trials in the year ended december 31 2017 including a four week phase 2b trial for copd maintenance treatment compared to two clinical trials in the year ended december 31 2018 pre clinical costs also reduced by 0 4 million these reductions were offset by a 2 0 million increase in contract manufacturing and formulation development costs personnel related costs increased by 0 1 million in the year ended december 31 2018 compared to the prior year general and administrative costs general and administrative costs were 6 3 million for the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to 6 0 million for the year ended december 31 2017 an increase of 0 3 million the increase was primarily attributable to a 0 3 million increase in the non cash share based payment charge a 0 2 million increase in personnel related costs and a 0 4 million increase in other overhead costs this was offset by a 0 6 million decrease in commercial research costs and a decrease in professional fees related to the global offering and shareholder private placement which occurred in 2017 finance income and expense finance income was 2 8 million for the year ended december 31 2018 and 7 0 million for the year ended december 31 2017 the decrease was primarily due to an increase in the fair value of the warrant liability in the year ended december 31 2018 which is a non cash item recorded as a finance expense compared to a decrease in the liability in the year ended december 31 2017 which resulted in a non cash gain recorded as finance income of 6 7 million in 2017 there was a foreign exchange gain on cash and short term investments of 1 9 million in the year ended december 31 2018 and a loss in the prior year recorded in finance expense furthermore 0 9 million of interest was received in the year ended december 31 2018 2017 0 3 million finance expense was 1 3 million for the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to 2 5 million for the year ended december 31 2017 the movement was due to an increase in the fair value of the warrant liability of 1 2 million recorded in finance expense compared to a reduction in the value of the liability in 2017 recorded in finance income both non cash items in addition there was a foreign exchange loss on cash and short term investments in 2017 of 2 4 million in the year ended december 31 2018 there was a foreign exchange gain recorded in finance income as at december 31 2018 there was approximately 19 8 million in cash and cash equivalents 2017 31 4 million and 44 9 million in short term investments 2017 48 8 million taxation taxation for the year ended december 31 2018 amounted to a credit of 4 2 million as compared to a credit of 4 7 million for the year ended december 31 2017 a decrease in the credit amount of 0 5 million the credits are obtained at a rate of 14 5 of 230 of our qualifying research and development expenditure and the decrease in the credit amount was primarily attributable to our reduced expenditure on research and development outlook and strategy we intend to become a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on the treatment of respiratory diseases with significant unmet medical needs the key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal include rapidly advance the development of nebulized ensifentrine for the maintenance treatment of copd in moderate and severe patients for the maintenance treatment of copd patients we plan to conduct a further four week dose range finding phase 2b clinical trial to evaluate ensifentrine when dosed in addition to lama therapy compared to placebo we expect to commence this study in the second quarter of 2019 with top line data expected by the end of 2019 we will discuss the outcome with the fda prior to the planned initiation of phase 3 clinical trials in 2020 ensifentrine for nebulized administration is currently presented in a glass vial with a flip tear up cap this format is adequate for clinical trials but patient acceptance in a commercial setting is expected to be improved by a switch to presenting the suspension formulation of ensifentrine in plastic ampules which is also more cost effective for manufacturing in larger volumes this development work is ongoing for the treatment of copd patients who may prefer the more convenient administration of an inhaler device we are developing ensifentrine in inhaler formulations we have commenced a clinical trial in copd patients with a dpi formulation of ensifentrine and in the first half of 2019 we plan to commence a clinical trial in copd patients with a pmdi formulation of ensifentrine proceeding more rapidly towards phase 3 clinical trials with nebulized ensifentrine for the maintenance treatment of copd may require us to focus our financial and other resources on maintenance treatment of copd with nebulized and inhaled formulations of ensifentrine in the short term which may alter our timing to commence further trials using ensifentrine in other indications advance the development of nebulized ensifentrine for the treatment of acute exacerbations of copd we are developing ensifentrine as an add on therapy to short acting bronchodilators and other commonly used therapies for the treatment of hospitalized patients with acute exacerbations of copd the timing for future studies in this indication will remain subject to our decision to move more rapidly towards phase 3 clinical trials with nebulized ensifentrine for the maintenance treatment of copd develop ensifentrine for the treatment of cf the timing for future studies in this indication will remain subject to our decision to move more rapidly towards phase 3 clinical trials with nebulized ensifentrine for the maintenance treatment of copd pursue development of ensifentrine for other respiratory diseases we believe that ensifentrine s properties as an inhaled dual inhibitor of pde3 and pde4 give it broad potential applicability in the treatment of other respiratory diseases such as severe asthma we may explore development of ensifentrine to treat other forms of respiratory disease following development of ensifentrine for the treatment of copd and cf seek strategic collaborative relationships we may seek strategic collaborations with market leading biopharmaceutical companies to develop and commercialize ensifentrine we believe these collaborations could provide significant funding to advance the development of ensifentrine while allowing us to benefit from the development or commercialization expertise of our collaborators acquire or in license product candidates for the treatment of respiratory diseases we plan to leverage our respiratory disease expertise to identify and in license or acquire additional clinical stage product candidates that we believe have the potential to become novel treatments for respiratory diseases with significant unmet medical needs we would like to thank the staff and board members for all their contributions and shareholders for their

2006 applicable to companies reporting under ifrs the consolidated financial statements of the group and the financial statements of the company have been prepared under the historical cost convention with the exception of derivative financial instruments which have been measured at fair value the preparation of financial statements in conformity with ifrs requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates it also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the group s and company s accounting policies the areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in note 4 going concern during the year ended december 31 2018 the group had a loss of 19 9 million 2017 20 5 million as of december 31 2018 the company had net assets of 62 9 million 2017 79 9 million of which 64 7 million 2017 80 3 million was cash and cash equivalents and short term investments the operation of the group is currently being financed from funds that the company raised from share placings in april and may 2017 the company raised 90 3 million 70 3 million from the global offering and the shareholder private placement on july 29 2016 the company raised gross proceeds of 44 7 million from a placing subscription and open offer the july 2016 placement these funds are being used primarily to support the development of ensifentrine in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd and other chronic respiratory diseases as well as corporate and general administrative expenditures the directors believe that the group has sufficient funds to complete the current clinical trials to cover corporate and general administration costs and for it to comply with all commitments for at least 12 months from the end of the reporting date and accordingly are satisfied that the going concern basis remains appropriate for the preparation of these consolidated financial statements business combination the group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations the consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the group the consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement and the fair value of any pre existing equity interest in the subsidiary the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the group s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalized and is subject to an impairment review both annually and when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred and included in administrative expenses basis of consolidation these consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of verona pharma plc and its wholly owned subsidiaries verona pharma inc and rhinopharma the acquisition method of accounting was used to account for the acquisition of rhinopharma inter company transactions balances and unrealized gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated verona pharma inc and rhinopharma adopt the same accounting policies as the company 2 2 foreign currency translation items included in the company s consolidated financial statements are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency the consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling which is the functional and presentational currency of the group transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on translation are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income non monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the original transactions non monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into pounds sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date income and expenses are translated at weighted average exchange rates for the period the exchange differences arising on translation for consolidation are recognized in other comprehensive income 2 3 cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand deposits held at call with banks and other short term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less 2 4 deferred taxation deferred tax is provided in full using the liability method on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and expected to apply when the related deferred tax is realized or the deferred liability is settled deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that the future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized 2 5 research and development costs capitalization of expenditure on product development commences from the point at which technical feasibility and commercial viability of the product can be demonstrated and the group is satisfied that it is probable that future economic benefits will result from the product once completed no such costs have been capitalized to date given the early stage of the group s product candidate development expenditure on research and development activities that do not meet the above criteria is charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as incurred 2 6 property plant and equipment property plant and equipment are stated at cost net of depreciation and any provision for impairment cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost less their estimated residual values on a straight line basis over the expected useful economic lives of the assets concerned the principal annual periods used for this purpose are computer hardware 3 years office equipment 5 years 2 7 intangible assets and goodwill a goodwill goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired b patents patent costs associated with the preparation filing and obtaining of patents are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the patents of ten years c computer software amortization is calculated so as to write off the cost less estimated residual values on a straight line basis over the expected useful economic life of two years d in process research development ip r d ip r d assets acquired through business combinations which at the time of acquisition have not reached technical feasibility are recognized at fair value the amounts are capitalized and are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing until completion abandonment of the projects or when the research findings are commercialized through a revenue generating project the group determines whether intangible assets including goodwill are impaired on an annual basis or where there is an impairment indicator and this requires the estimation of the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use upon successful completion or commercialization of the relevant project ip r d will be reclassified to developed technology the group will make a determination as to the then useful life of the developed technology generally determined by the period in which the substantial majority of the cash flows are expected to be generated and begin amortization in case of abandonment the asset will be impaired 2 8 impairment of intangible assets goodwill and non financial assets goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life and intangible assets not ready to use are not subject to amortization these assets are tested annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators exist non financial assets that are subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount the recoverable amount is the higher of an asset s fair value less costs of disposal and value in use for the purpose of assessing impairment assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows which are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets or group of assets cash generating units cgus 2 8 impairment of intangible assets goodwill and non financial assets continued goodwill is allocated to cgus for the purpose of impairment testing the allocation is made to those cgus or groups of cgus that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose the units or group of units are identified at the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes being the operating segments the group is a single cash generating unit goodwill that arose on the acquisition of rhinopharma has been thus allocated to this single cgu ip r d is tested for impairment at this level as well since it is the lowest level at which independent cash flows can be identified non financial assets other than goodwill that have been previously impaired are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each subsequent reporting date 2 9 employee benefits a pension the group operates a defined contribution pension scheme for uk employees contributions payable for the year are charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income the contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense when they are due differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the consolidated statement of financial position the group has no further payment obligation once the contributions have been paid b bonus plans the group recognizes a liability and an expense for bonus plans if contractually obligated or if there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation 2 10 share based payments the group operates a number of equity settled share based compensation schemes the fair value of share based payments under such schemes is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period based on the group s estimate of shares that will eventually vest where equity settled transactions are entered into with third party service providers fair value is determined by reference to the value of the services provided in lieu of payment the expense is measured based on the services received at the date of receipt of those services and is charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the period for which the services are received and a corresponding credit is made to reserves for other equity settled transactions fair value is determined using the black scholes model and requires several assumptions and estimates as disclosed in note 17 2 11 provisions provisions are recognized when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation 2 12 assumed contingent obligation related to the business combinations on september 19 2006 the group acquired rhinopharma for a total consideration of 1 52 million payable in ordinary shares in addition the group assumed certain contingent obligations owed by rhinopharma to vernalis pharmaceuticals limited vernalis which was subsequently acquired by ligand pharmaceuticals inc ligand under an assignment and license agreement the assumed contingent consideration following the sale of ip by vernalis to rhinopharma in october 2018 vernalis was acquired by and became a wholly owned subsidiary of ligand pharmaceuticals inc or ligand the group refers to the assignment and license agreement as the ligand agreement and now refers to vernalis as ligand pursuant to the agreement ligand i assigned to the group all of its rights to certain patents and patent applications relating to ensifentrine and related compounds the ligand patents and ii granted to the group an exclusive worldwide royalty bearing license under certain ligand know how to develop manufacture and commercialize products the licensed products developed using ligand patents ligand know how and the physical stock of certain compounds the assumed contingent obligation comprises a a milestone payment on obtaining the first approval of any regulatory authority for the commercialization of a licensed product b low to mid single digit royalties based on the future sales performance of all licensed products and c a portion equal to a mid twenty percent of any consideration received from any sub licensees for the ligand patents and for ligand know how on the date of acquisition the fair value of the assumed contingent obligation was estimated as the expected value of the milestone payment royalty payments and sub license payments based on an assessment of the probability of success using standard market probabilities for respiratory drug development the risk weighted value of the assumed contingent arrangement was then discounted back to its net present value applying an effective interest rate of 12 the initial fair value of the assumed contingent obligation as of december 31 2006 was deemed to be insignificant at the date of the acquisition so it was not recorded the amount of royalties payable under the agreement is based on the future sales performance of certain products and so the total amount payable is unlimited the level of sales that may be achieved under the agreement is difficult to predict and subject to estimate which is inherently uncertain the value of this assumed contingent obligation is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method and is re measured for changes in estimated cash flows when the probability of success changes the assumed contingent obligation is accounted for as a liability and any adjustments made to the value of the liability will be recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the period 2 13 government and other grants the group may receive government regional or charitable grants to support its research efforts in defined projects where these grants provide for reimbursement of approved costs incurred as defined in the respective grants income in respect of such grants would include contributions towards the costs of research and development income would be recognized when costs under each grant are incurred in accordance with the terms and conditions of the grant and the collectability of the receivable is reasonably assured government regional and charitable grants relating to costs would be deferred and recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the period necessary to match them with the costs they are intended to compensate when the cash in relation to recognized government regional or charitable grants is not yet received the amount is included as a receivable on the consolidated statement of financial position where the grant income is directly related to the specific items of expenditure incurred the income would be netted against such expenditure where the grant income is not a specific reimbursement of expenditure incurred the group would include such income under other income in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 2 14 financial instruments initial recognition and subsequent measurement the group classifies a financial instrument or its component parts as a financial liability a financial asset or an equity instrument in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement and the definitions of a financial liability a financial asset and an equity instrument the group evaluates the terms of the financial instrument to determine whether it contains an asset a liability or an equity component such components shall be classified separately as financial assets financial liabilities or equity instruments a financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity a financial assets initial recognition and measurement and subsequent measurement all financial assets not recorded at fair value through profit or loss such as receivables and deposits are recognized initially at fair value plus transaction costs financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognized at fair value and transaction costs are expensed in the income statement the measurement of financial assets depends on their classification financial assets such as receivables and deposits are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method less loss allowance the group does not hold any financial assets at fair value through profit or loss or fair value through other comprehensive income b financial liabilities initial recognition and measurement and subsequent measurement financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortized cost or fvtpl a financial liability is classified as at fvtpl if it is a derivative financial liabilities at fvtpl are measured at fair value and net gains and losses including any interest expense are recognized in profit or loss other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognized in profit or loss the group s financial liabilities include trade and other payables and derivative financial instruments c derivative financial instruments derivatives are initially recognized at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re measured at fair value at the end of each reporting date the group holds only one type of derivative financial instrument the warrants as explained in note 2 15 the full fair value of the derivative is classified as a non current liability when the warrants are exercisable in more than 12 months and as a current liability when the warrants are exercisable in less than 12 months changes in fair value of a derivative financial liability when related to a financing arrangement are recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income within finance income or finance expense fair value gains or losses on derivatives used for non financing arrangements are recognized in other operating income or expense 2 15 warrants warrants issued by the group to investors as part of a share subscription are compound financial instruments where the warrant meets the definition of a financial liability the financial liability component is initially measured at fair value in the consolidated statement of financial position equity is measured at the residual between the subscription price for the entire instrument and the liability component the financial liability component is remeasured depending on its classification equity is not remeasured 2 16 short term investments short term investments include fixed term deposits held at banks with original maturities of more than three months but less than a year they are classified as loans and receivables and are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method 2 17 transaction costs qualifying transaction costs might be incurred in anticipation of an issuance of equity instruments and may cross reporting periods the entity defers these costs on the balance sheet until the equity instrument is recognized deferred costs are subsequently reclassified as a deduction from equity when the equity instruments are recognized as the costs are directly attributable to the equity transaction if the equity instruments are not subsequently issued the transaction costs are expensed any costs not directly attributable to the equity transaction are expensed transaction costs that relate to the issue of a compound financial instrument are allocated to the liability and equity components of the instrument in proportion to the allocation of proceeds where the liability component is held at fair value through profit or loss the transaction costs are expensed to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for liabilities held at amortized cost transaction costs are deducted from the liability and subsequently amortized the amount of transaction costs accounted for as a deduction from equity in the period is disclosed separately in accordance with international accounting standard ias 1 2 18 investments in subsidiaries investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less any provision for impairment 2 19 new standards amendments and interpretations adopted by the group the following amendments have been adopted by the group for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after january 1 2018 ifrs 9 financial instruments ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers ifrs 9 had no material impact on the accounting or measurement of any of the financial instruments the group currently holds ifrs 15 had no impact on the financial statements of the group as it is not currently revenue generating 2 20 new standards amendments and interpretations issued but not effective for the financial year beginning january 1 2018 and not early adopted new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued but are not yet effective for annual periods beginning after january 1 2018 noted below and have not been adopted in preparing these consolidated financial statements ifrs 16 leases effective for annual periods beginning on or after january 1 2019 ifrs 16 is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after january 1 2019 and will replace ias 17 leases it eliminates the classification of leases as either operating leases or finance leases and instead introduces a single lessee accounting model the group will recognize new assets and liabilities for its operating leases of office leases see note 20 the nature of expenses related to those leases will now change because the group will recognize a depreciation charge for right of use assets and interest expense on lease liabilities previously the group recognized operating lease expense on a straight line basis over the term of the lease and recognize assets and liabilities only to the extent that there was a timing difference between actual lease payments and the expense recognized instead the group will include the payments due under the lease in its lease liability based on the information currently available using the modified retrospective method the group estimates that it will recognize additional lease liabilities of 316 thousand and assets of 325 thousand as of january 1 2019 there will be no material impact on other lines in the financial statements 3 financial instruments 3 1 financial risk factors the group s activities have exposed it to a variety of financial risks market risk including currency risk and interest rate risk credit risk and liquidity risk the group s overall risk management program is focused on preservation of capital and the unpredictability of financial markets and has sought to minimize potential adverse effects on the group s financial performance and position a currency risk foreign currency risk reflects the risk that the group s net assets will be negatively impacted due to fluctuations in exchange rates the group has not entered into foreign exchange contracts to hedge against gains or losses from foreign exchange fluctuations the summary quantitative date about the group s exposure to

as the group is still in the development stage no policies are currently required to mitigate this risk for banks and financial institutions only independently rated parties with a minimum rating of b are accepted the directors recognize that this is an area in which they may need to develop specific policies should the group become exposed to further financial risks as the business develops as of

to their short term nature the carrying amount of the assumed contingent liability approximates to fair value as the underlying assumptions are currently similar for financial instruments that are measured in the consolidated statement of financial position at fair value ifrs 7 requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly level 2 and inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data level 3 for the year ended december 31 2018 and 2017 fair value adjustments to financial instruments through profit and loss resulted in the recognition of finance loss of 1 2 million in 2018 and a finance income of 6 7 million in 2017 the fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques these valuation techniques maximize the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates if all significant inputs required to ascertain the fair value of an instrument are observable the instrument is included in level 2 if one or more of the significant inputs are not based on observable market data the instrument is included in level 3 level 3 total 000s 000s at december 31 2018 derivative financial instrument 2 492 2 492 total 2 492 2 492 movements in

value of the derivative financial instrument the group applied the black scholes model key inputs include the share price at reporting date estimations on timelines volatility and risk free rates these assumptions and the impact of changes in these assumptions where material are disclosed in note 18 3 3 change in liabilities arising from financing activities the group has provided a

instrument 000s at january 1 1 273 fair value adjustments non cash 1 219 at december 31 2 492 see note 18 for information relating to the derivative financial instrument 4 critical accounting estimates and judgments the preparation of financial statements in conformity with ifrs requires the use of accounting estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates ifrs also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the group s accounting policies the areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are as follows a assumed contingent obligation the group has a material obligation for the future payment of royalties and milestones associated with contractual obligations on ensifentrine a development product acquired as part of the acquisition of rhinopharma the estimation of the fair value of the assumed contingent obligation on acquisition requires the selection of an appropriate valuation model consideration as to the inputs necessary for the valuation model chosen the estimation of the likelihood that the regulatory approval milestone will be achieved and estimates of the future cash flows and their timing for further detail see note 20 the estimates for the assumed contingent obligation are based on a discounted cash flow model key estimates included in the fair value calculation of deferred consideration are development regulatory and marketing risks associated with progressing the product to market approval in key target territories market size and product acceptance by clinicians patients and reimbursement bodies gross and net selling price costs of manufacturing product distribution and marketing support launch of competitive products and discount rate and time to crystallization of contingent consideration when there is a change in the expected cash flows the assumed contingent obligation is re measured with the change in value going through the consolidated statement of comprehensive income cash flow estimates are revised when the probability of success changes the assumed contingent obligation is measured at amortized cost with the discount unwinding in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income throughout the year actual outcomes could differ significantly from the estimates made the value of the assumed contingent obligation as of december 31 2018 amounted to 1 0 million 2017 0 9 million the increase in value of the assumed contingent obligation during 2018 amounted to 0 1 million 2017 0 1 million and the movement relates to unwinding the discount on the liability and retranslating for changes in u s dollar exchange rates the expense relating to the unwinding of the discount was recorded in finance expense there was no change in the year to the probability of success and consequently cash flow estimates were not revised the discount percentage applied is 12 b valuation of the july 2016 warrants pursuant to the july 2016 placement the company issued 31 115 926 units to new and existing investors at the placing price of 1 4365 per unit each unit comprises one ordinary share and one warrant the warrants entitle the investors to subscribe for in aggregate a maximum of 12 401 262 ordinary shares in accordance with ias 32 and the group s accounting policy as disclosed in note 2 15 the group classified the warrants as a derivative financial liability to be presented on the group s consolidated statement of financial position the fair value of these warrants is determined by applying the black scholes model assumptions are made on inputs such as time to maturity the share price volatility and risk free rate in order to determine the fair value per warrant for further details see note 18 c recognition of research and development expenditure the group incurs research and development expenditure from third parties the group recognizes this expenditure in line with the management s best estimation of the stage of completion of each research and development project this includes the calculation of accrued costs at each period end to account for expenditure that has been incurred this requires management to estimate full costs to complete for each project and also to estimate its current stage of completion costs relating to clinical research organization expenses in the year were 14 0 million the related accruals and prepayments were 3 4 million and 0 7 million respectively d transaction costs related to the global offering in 2017 the group incurred various transaction costs relating to the global offering including commissions professional advisor fees financial advice listing fees and other costs when management judged them to be incremental costs directly attributable to the transaction they were accounted for as a deduction from equity otherwise the costs were expensed to the consolidated income statement as incurred 5 earnings per share basic loss per ordinary share of 18 9p 2017 23 4p for the group is calculated by dividing the loss for the year ended december 31 2018 by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue of 105 110 504 as of december

craig menear chairman president and chief executive officer thank you isabel and good morning everyone fiscal 2018 was another record year for our business as we achieved the highest sales and net earnings in company history fiscal 2018 sales grew 7 3 billion to 108 2 billion an increase of 7 2 from fiscal 2017 while diluted earnings per share grew 33 5 to 9 73 and although fiscal 2018 was a record year for our business our fourth quarter comp sales were slightly below our expectations as the quarter experienced some unfavorable weather sales for the fourth quarter were 26 5 billion up 10 9 from last year comp sales were up 3 2 from last year and our u s comps were positive 3 7 diluted earnings per share were 2 09 in the fourth quarter internationally mexico posted another quarter of positive comps in local currency while canada was essentially flat as we mentioned on last quarter s call our fourth quarter faced tough comparisons given the prior year s approximately 400 million in hurricane related sales that would not repeat and we planned for this in our outlook but as carol will detail what we did not plan for was the extent of the unfavorable weather we experienced in all regions throughout the quarter it was cold it was snowy and perhaps worst of all it was wet wet weather delays projects and this was evidenced in our sales performance in the quarter in fact as carol will detail ex weather our business performed in line with our expectations as ted will discuss both ticket and transactions grew in the quarter and we saw growth in both pro and diy categories pro sales once again outpaced diy sales in the quarter and the work that we re doing to enhance the service capabilities for our pros continues to resonate i am very proud of our associates for continuing to do what they do best serving our customers our merchants store teams supplier partners and supply chain teams did an outstanding job of delivering value and service to our customers throughout the quarter both in stores and online in fact several key accomplishments took place during the quarter we set record performances on black friday and during cyber week our holiday décor offering and gift center events set new all time highs and during the quarter we reached a new watermark of approximately 2 billion annual visits on homedepot com with many of these visitors indicating that their next stop is a home depot store in fiscal 2018 we made progress with regard to the one home depot investment plan but we are still in the early days of our journey our strategic effort to drive an enhanced interconnected customer experience through investments in both the physical and digital worlds are yielding solid returns we also continue to focus on productivity as a virtuous cycle by leveraging technology and improving processes throughout the value chain of our business fiscal 2018 provided a lot of great learnings and momentum that we will continue to build on in 2019 i m particularly excited about the investments we re making for our pros in the quarter we announced the consolidated go to market approach for our pro customers under the banner home depot pro and we continue to invest in a more personalized offering for our pro customers with a new b2b website experience we have now onboarded over 100 000 pro customers and the reception has been positive our plan is for continuous enhancements with new features and capabilities for example in response to customer feedback we are adding the ability for businesses to enhance account management and ordering capabilities with improved tools our intent is to roll out this new pro online experience to over 1 million pros in 2019 beyond b2b personalization we continue to make great strides in driving our digital experience this year we invested in our website and mobile applications improving search capabilities site functionality and product content this ongoing investment in our digital properties has increased traffic and conversion versus prior year on a like for like basis online sales grew 22 7 in the fourth quarter and 24 1 in fiscal 2018 now representing 7 9 of our total sales while we are seeing significant growth in our online sales these online shoppers see the relevance of our stores as approximately 50 of our online u s orders are picked up in our stores a testament to the power of our interconnected retail strategy we continue to roll out automated lockers in our stores to make picking up an online order easier and more convenient to date approximately 1 000 stores have lockers with more to come in 2019 customer response to the lockers has been very positive as almost 94 of customers rated their locker pickup experience a 5 out of 5 stars we fundamentally believe that when a customer comes to one of our stores it has to be a great experience with our investment program approximately 40 of our u s stores now have a new look and feel and customer response has been very positive the store investments are not just about the customer response as we are also seeing increased associate engagement and higher productivity another key component of a best in class interconnected shopping experience centers on enhanced delivery and fulfillment options fiscal 2018 was the year of the pilot as we kicked off our 1 2 billion investment journey to create the fastest most efficient delivery network for home improvement goods we are now live with a number of these pilot facilities we look to fiscal 2019 as a year to take what we have learned in pilot and begin the rollout that we expect to complete by 2022 as a demonstration of the confidence in the business going forward today our board announced a 32 increase in our quarterly dividend to 1 36 per share the board also authorized a new share repurchase program with 15 billion replacing our existing authorization we remain committed to maintaining disciplined capital allocation to create value for our shareholders turning to 2019 and beyond i m excited about the opportunities that are ahead of us carol will take you through the details but we expect 2019 to be another year of growth with sales growth of approximately 3 3 comp sales of 5 and diluted earnings per share of approximately 10 03 our strong performance in fiscal 2018 also positions us well with respect to our 2020 financial targets and today we are reaffirming those targets it s an exciting time to be a part of the home depot and we look forward to the work ahead as we continue our journey to create the one home depot experience there s a great deal of change being introduced throughout the business but as they always do our associates are rising to the occasion meeting new challenges head on without losing the passion to serve our customers that has made the home depot what it is today i want to close by thanking our associates for their hard work and dedication to our customers in the fourth quarter and throughout the year for the second half of the year 100 of our stores will receive success sharing our bonus program for our hourly associates we look forward to continuing our momentum in 2019 and with that let me turn the call over to ted ted decker executive vice president of merchandising thanks craig and good morning everyone when we look through the unfavorable weather we experienced in the fourth quarter we were pleased with how the business performed looking at our departments comps in tools appliances décor indoor garden building materials outdoor garden hardware and paint were above the company average electrical plumbing flooring millwork and kitchen and bath were positive but below the company average due primarily to price deflation lighting and lumber reported low to mid single digit negative comps in the fourth quarter average ticket increased 2 3 and comp transactions increased 0 9 the fourth quarter finished what was a volatile year in many commodity markets particularly lumber for example during the second quarter we saw lumber prices that were more than 40 higher than they were in the year prior these prices fell significantly during the third and fourth quarter and now sit approximately 25 below last year s prices while this deflation pressures sales we have seen strong unit growth as prices have come down and this unit productivity drives activity across the store during the fourth quarter deflation in lumber negatively impacted average ticket growth by approximately 41 basis points however this deflation was largely offset by inflation in other core commodity categories for a net impact to average ticket from core commodities of negative eight basis points during the fourth quarter big ticket transactions or those over 1 000 00 which represent approximately 20 of u s sales were up 4 8 a number of factors served as headwinds to big ticket sales in the fourth quarter notably unexpected wet weather across the u s and lapping last year s hurricane related sales excluding hurricane effected markets we see that january s big ticket comp was up almost double digits in line with what we saw throughout 2018 big ticket categories like vinyl plank flooring roofing and appliances all had comps above the company average in the fourth quarter we saw growth with both our pro and do it yourself customers in the fourth quarter with pro sales growing faster than the company s average comp we continue to see strong performance in pro heavy categories like power tools water heaters and commercial and industrial lighting sales to our diy customers grew year over year as our customers completed a variety of interior projects categories like hard window coverings safety and security and cleaning all posted strong growth in the quarter we also saw record performance with our annual gift center and holiday sets additionally the combination of outstanding values from our suppliers the right assortments from our merchants and phenomenal execution in our stores led to the single highest sales day in our company s history on black friday as part of our journey to enhance the one home depot experience we are significantly investing in our digital assets to provide a frictionless interconnected shopping experience earlier this year we formed approximately 50 cross functional squads focused on agile development to improve our online customer experience these teams have accomplished a great deal in a short period and are driving results in 2018 we hit a milestone of approximately 2 billion online visits and our ongoing efforts to improve the interconnected customer experience have led to a consistent improvement in our conversion rates throughout the year however our work is not done in 2019 we will continue to roll out enhancements across our digital assets as you heard from craig we are excited to be rolling out a new b2b online experience for our pro customers to provide a more tailored personalized offering and for consumers we will continue to focus on improving the way we bring our assortments to life in the digital world as we look to 2019 we are excited to build on our momentum we are the no 1 retailer for product authority in home improvement and together with our supplier partners we will work to offer the best products at the best value for our customers every day a great example of our strong partnerships is in our paint business our exclusive partners behr and ppg bring the two highest rated consumer paint and stain brands to the home depot these strong brands along with the great execution in our stores help drive paint comps above the company average in the fourth quarter we were particularly pleased with our sales to our pro painters as our investments and initiatives are gaining traction in addition to having the best products we are investing to improve the in store paint experience for our customers in 2019 we plan to roll out a new color solutions center to all stores and will do a full reset in exterior stains we were thrilled with the results we are driving in our paint business and look forward to building on our momentum in 2019 product innovation is resonating with our customers as we see them trade up to new features and innovation across the store one example where we are seeing this is with traeger in our grill category traeger is one of the fastest growing brands in the grilling category in their innovative pellet grills traeger offers the versatility and convenience of being able to grill smoke bake roast braise or barbecue all on the same grill given the strong sales we are introducing traeger s new lineup of wifire grills this technology connects the grill directly to your smartphone so you can monitor your grill or adjust the temperature remotely we are excited to be traeger s exclusive partner in the big box home improvement channel another example of innovation is in our pro heavy roofing category over the last several years we have seen both residential and commercial roofers trade up for innovative products that same them time and money in the residential space we have seen a significant shift from strip shingles to laminate architectural shingles these laminate shingles last longer have a lifetime warranty are easier to install and offer dramatic color contrast and dimension which is important from a decorative perspective in the commercial segment the trend has shifted from asphalt and aluminum roof coatings to elastomeric roof coverings that are more water and dirt resistant a great example of this is henry tropi cool silicone an exclusive to the home depot in the home improvement channel no primer coat is needed so the one coat application saves time and money we are excited about the year ahead particularly with the spring selling season right around the corner our investments in localized assortments and innovative product at an everyday low price will continue to position us as the product authority in home improvement with that i d like to turn the call over to carol carole tomé executive vice president corporate services and chief financial officer thank you ted and good morning everyone in the fourth quarter total sales were 26 5 billion a 10 9 increase from last year and for the year our sales totaled a record 108 2 billion a 7 2 increase from last year fiscal 2018 included a 53rd week which added approximately 1 7 billion in sales to the fourth quarter and the year the extra week is not included in our comp sales calculation our fourth quarter results also include the impact of a new revenue recognition standard that we adopted at the beginning of the year in the fourth quarter the change in revenue recognition positively affected sales growth by 86 million our total company comps were positive 3 2 for the quarter with positive comps of 3 1 in november 3 1 in december and 3 3 in january comps in the u s were positive 3 7 for the quarter with positive comps of 3 4 in november 3 5 in december and 4 1 in january there were a few notable factors that affected our comp performance in the quarter first a stronger u s dollar negatively impacted total company comp sales growth in the quarter by approximately 96 million or 0 4 second the commodity price inflation we experienced in the first three quarters of the year disappeared in the fourth quarter finally as you know we were up against nearly 400 million of hurricane related sales we expected that but we did not expect such a wet winter sometimes weather driven demand can help sales growth and sometimes hurt relative to our expectations we estimate weather driven demand negatively impacted fourth quarter comp sales by roughly 85 basis points in the fourth quarter our gross margin was 34 1 an increase of 19 basis points from last year the year over year change in our gross margin reflects the following factors first the new accounting standard drove 168 million of gross profit or 53 basis points of gross margin expansion second higher supply chain and fulfillment expense caused approximately 19 basis points of gross margin contraction third higher shrink than one year ago resulted in 10 basis points of contraction and finally changes in the mix of products sold drove five basis points of contraction for the year we experienced 29 basis points of gross margin expansion in the fourth quarter operating expense as a percent of sales increased by 79 basis points to 21 3 due to the following factors first we experienced 152 basis points of expense leverage in bau or business as usual expenses the strong leverage in the core of our business was driven by solid expense control but also reflects certain expense items that did not repeat this year most notably a one time bonus of 117 million that was granted to our hourly associates last year our bau expense leverage was offset by the following first as we called out in our press release as we move forward with our b2b experience we recognized an impairment loss of 247 million or 93 basis points of expense de leverage related to the write off of several trade names associated with interline brands second the new accounting standard resulted in a 168 million increase to our operating expenses and caused 63 basis points of operating expense de leverage and third expenses related to our strategic investment plan of roughly 198 million resulted in approximately 75 basis points of operating expense de leverage fiscal 2018 operating expense as a percent of sales was 20 an increase of 49 basis points from last year our fiscal 2019 expense performance was better than our initial expectations driven by productivity and bau for the year we incurred almost 700 million of expenses related to our strategic initiatives in line with our plan our operating margin for the fourth quarter was 12 8 and for the year it was 14 4 interest and other expense for the fourth quarter grew by 19 million to 265 million reflecting for the most part a loss on the sale of a non strategic asset in the fourth quarter our effective tax rate was 24 7 and for fiscal 2018 was 23 6 our effective tax rate for the quarter and the year reflects the close out of the provisional charge we took last year related to tax reform and certain positive audit settlements our diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were 2 09 an increase of 37 5 from last year for the year diluted earnings per share were 9 73 an increase of 33 5 compared to fiscal 2017 our fourth quarter and fiscal 2018 diluted earnings per share were negatively impacted by approximately 0 16 due to the impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter now moving on to some additional highlights during the year we opened three new stores including one in the u s and two in mexico for an ending store count of 2 287 selling square footage at the end of the year was 238 million square feet for the fiscal year total sales per square foot increased 7 2 to 447 00 the highest in our company history at the end of the quarter merchandise inventories grew 1 2 billion to 13 9 billion and inventory turns were 5 1 times flat with last year the growth in our inventory versus last year reflects the investments we are making to accelerate merchandising resets and higher in stock levels than we had one year ago moving on to capital allocation in fiscal 2018 we generated approximately 13 3 billion of cash from the business and used that cash as well as the proceeds from 2 2 billion of net debt issuances and cash on hand to invest in the business pay dividends to our shareholders and repurchase our shares during the year we invested approximately 2 4 billion back into the business through capital expenditures further we paid 4 7 billion in dividends to our shareholders and finally during the year we repurchased approximately 10 billion or about 54 3 million of our outstanding shares including roughly 4 5 billion or 27 5 million shares in the fourth quarter computed on the average of beginning and ending long term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months return on invested capital was approximately 44 8 1 060 basis points higher than the end of fiscal 2017 today s press release includes our guidance for fiscal 2019 and i want to take a few moments to comment on the main points remember that we guide off gaap so fiscal 2019 guidance will launch from our reported results for fiscal 2018 which includes sales and earnings associated with the 53rd week when we report our quarterly comp sales results we will compare weeks 1 52 in fiscal 2019 against weeks 2 53 in fiscal 2018 so with that turning to our sales growth projections as you know we use a directionally correct but imperfect model to project our sales growth it starts with gdp while we are in the 10th year of economic recovery u s gdp is expected to grow in 2019 and for our model we are using 2 6 gdp growth to gdp we add the expected spending impact from key housing metrics including home price appreciation housing turnover household formation and the age of the housing stock as we look to 2019 most housing metrics are trending positive albeit heading toward stability two of these metrics worth highlighting are home equity which is a function of home price appreciation and the age of the housing stock home equity has more than doubled since 2011 and 52 of the homes in the u s are greater than 40 years old and you will recall that the three year sales target we established in 2017 started with a base comp of 4 the sales forecasting model that we built for 2019 doesn t move us materially off that base for 2019 we are planning a 5 comp which includes our base model plus growth emanating from our strategic investments for fiscal 2019 we expect total sales growth of approximately 3 3 reflecting the compare to 53 weeks last year two more comments for your models first when you are thinking about the shape of the year we would expect the comps for the first half of 2019 to be about 250 basis points lower than the second half of the year because of the hurricane related sales overlap on a two year stack basis we expect that our first half and second half comp will be relatively similar second because of the shift in the year and the seasonality of our business our 2019 comp sales will not match our sales growth rates in three of four quarters during the year we plan to open five net new stores four in the u s and one in mexico for fiscal 2019 we are projecting our gross margin rate to be approximately 34 in line with the 2020 target we set forth during our december 2017 investor conference at this time we are not expecting further gross margin contraction in fiscal 2020 we expect our fiscal 2019 operating expenses to grow at approximately 53 the rate of our sales growth on a 52 to 52 week basis and ignoring the impairment charge we recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 we expect our fiscal 2019 operating expenses to grow at approximately 90 of the rate of our sales growth for the year we expect that our operating margin will be essentially flat with what we reported in fiscal 2018 for fiscal 2019 we estimate our effective tax rate to be approximately 25 5 we expect fiscal 2019 diluted earnings per share to grow approximately 3 1 to 10 03 our earnings per share guidance includes our plan to repurchase approximately 5 billion of outstanding shares during the year for the year we project cash flow from the business of roughly 14 billion we will invest 2 7 billion of this cash back into the business in support of our strategic initiative we also plan to use this cash to pay 6 billion of dividends as craig mentioned we just announced a 32 increase in our quarterly dividend which equates to an annual dividend of 5 44 in line with our targeted dividend ratio of 55 of earnings finally we plan to repurchase 5 billion of outstanding shares using excess cash at our last investor conference in december 2017 we shared with you our long term financial targets and our strategy to create the one home depot by the end of fiscal 2020 we are aiming to grow our sales to a range of 115 billion to 120 billion with an operating margin range of 14 4 to 15 and return on invested capital of more than 40 as evidenced by our fiscal 2018 results and our guidance for 2019 today we are reaffirming our long term targets thank you for your participation in today s call and christine we are now ready for questions questions and answers operator thank you the question and answer session will be conducted electronically if you would like to ask a question please press 1 if you are using a speaker phone please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment once again 1 to ask your question our first question comes from the line of simeon gutman with morgan stanley please proceed with your question simeon gutman morgan stanley analyst thanks good morning my first question is two parts on gross margin so getting to the 34 level in 2019 was that always part of your plan and the street maybe just looked like it was mis modeling or is something changing on your investment cadence and then the second part of that gross margin question is can you split the it looks like about 30 basis points of contraction into fixed versus variable cost and how much would gross margin flex if comps are better or worse than 100 basis points of your forecast craig menear chairman president and chief executive officer simeon i think the first comment i d have is as it relates to the margin rate and was it different than what we anticipated a little bit more sustained pressure in supply chain maybe than what we had initially anticipated in 2017 carole tomé executive vice president corporate services and chief financial officer but as we look at our model both for 19 and 20 let me break apart the gross margin performance for you in our expectations first as you know productivity is a virtuous cycle at the home depot and we have productivity in our cost of goods and we project productivity into 19 and 20 offsetting the productivity in 19 is some pressure that i mentioned in supply chain as well as our supply chain rollout there s a little bit of shrink pressure in 2019 but we re going to cover that off with productivity and then there s a mix pressure mix that was always in our plan as we see relative outperformance of growth in lower margin categories so as we look through 19 into 20 nothing comes to our attention at this point that the margin will contract further because productivity will continue into 20 on the second part of your question in terms of fixed variable nature of our gross margin or of our cost of goods we actually don t look through that lens but i will tell you within the performance in the fourth quarter there were a few surprises relative to the guidance that we gave at the end of the third quarter first the supply chain contraction of 19 basis points was a bit higher than we had anticipated we had three basis points of fuel pressure come through and about five basis points of higher fees related to third party delivery agents and then we had a bit higher shrink than we anticipated hopefully that s helpful simeon gutman morgan stanley analyst yeah it s helpful my follow up is on the demand side can you tell us if there were any markets that were normal not meaning ex weather did they perform in line or did they perform better than you thought and then you told us in the past where housing turnover markets have been soft you ve called out that the business has been solid just checking if that s still the case carole tomé executive vice president corporate services and chief financial officer yes we saw great performance in areas that had good weather i must say the weather was across the country but you can find pockets of relative outperformance and if you look at the housing related markets let s take seattle as an example seattle is talked about a lot as a place where there s been huge home price appreciation the comp in seattle for the fourth quarter was at 6 3 let s take dallas dallas is another area of the country where home prices have seen significant home price appreciation the comp in dallas was in line with the company average so we re not seeing any impact to our performance in a negative way because of the housing environment craig menear chairman president and chief executive officer if you looked at a market like l a when the weather shifted we see a 1 400 basis point swing week to week based on weather so when the weather was positive it was lift of 1 400 basis points simeon gutman morgan stanley analyst okay thank you operator and our next question comes from the line of michael lasser with ubs please proceed with your question michael lasser ubs analyst good morning thanks a lot for taking my question you noted that your comp guidance is based on 4 growth from underlying economic conditions and housing is there a way that you could size the potential downside if gdp doesn t meet 2 6 and we see a continued deceleration from the key housing metrics carole tomé executive vice president corporate services and chief financial officer well clearly our base model starts with gdp and the forecasts for gdp next year there s a wide range we landed on 2 6 we think that s the right number to use we added to that about one point coming from the various housing metrics that we look at so that takes our base comps to 3 6 and candidly we rounded up to 4 because we re just not that good at it we really wanted to call out two things that are important in our model and one is home equity there s 15 4 billion what am i saying 15 4 trillion of home equity out there home equity has more than doubled since 2011 and if you look at the home equity per owner occupied household that equity is 193 000 00 and has not been extracted so we think that bodes well it s a wealth effect but that bodes well into 2019 the other aspect of the housing market is just the age of the housing market fifty two percent of the homes are older than 40 years we know that spend for homes that are 40 years and older is 30 greater than spend on homes less than 10 years michael lasser ubs analyst and my follow up question is on the contribution from your initiative shouldn t we expect that the contribution which we sized at 100 basis points shouldn t we expect that that s going to build over the course of the year as you ve had more time to benefit from what you ve put in place over the last 12 18 months and what s the upside risk from those initiatives driving more than 100 basis points of contribution to your comp craig menear chairman president and chief executive officer michael it will build as we go forward you re thinking about that the right way and so we definitely see it building throughout 2019 and then beyond carole tomé executive vice president corporate services and chief financial officer michael i mentioned the back half comp would be greater than the first half comp part of that is due to the hurricane overlap but part of it is due to the build michael lasser ubs analyst and what leading indicators are you looking at within the business that give you confidence that it s going to contribute the 100 basis points that you re expecting craig menear chairman president and chief executive officer well when we look at the initiatives that we ve begun to put in place whether that is the amount of store refreshes that we have done whether it is the interconnected experience with the automated lockers that we ve put in place which is driving obviously a great response from the customers these are things that we tested we piloted and as we roll we ve begun to see a benefit as a result and feel comfortable that those are going to be the driver behind that point of initiative growth carole tomé executive vice president corporate services and chief financial officer we re also seeing outsized growth in our pro business and as we continue to add pros to our website to our pro experience if you will we are adding over a million customers this year we see spend with those customers increasing michael lasser ubs analyst okay thank you very much operator our next question comes from the line of scott ciccarelli with rbc please proceed with your question scott ciccarelli rbc capital markets analyst good morning guys scott ciccarelli so can you help us understand maybe the investment pace a little bit better it sounds like there may be some shifts between your original expectations between 2019 and 2020 just from a timing perspective no 1 no 2 could we end up facing a scenario where the absolute investment amounts what you re doing with the supply chain and in the stores etc maybe exceeds your prior views almost every company out there their investment plan seems to be a moving target carole tomé executive vice president corporate services and chief financial officer well i m happy to take you back to december of 17 when we laid out our investment plan you ll recall we announced an 11 1 billion investment plan which was 5 4 billion over what we would have spent in a bau basis and this is the cash look of the investment so it s both expense and capital then we shared with you a chart back in 2017 that broke that spending down by year we said we would spend 1 4 billion in 18 1 9 billion in 19 and 2 1 billion in 20 if we look at what we spend in 18 we spent 1 4 billion about 540 million in expense and 800 million in capital now on the expenses we also had some depreciation but that wasn t on the chart that we shared with you if you add the depreciation related to our investments in 2018 it was more like 700 million as we look to 19 we are projecting in our guidance that we will spend 1 7 billion 550 million in expense and about 1 1 billion in capital that s roughly 200 million under what we shared with you in 2017 that spending is being pushed to 20 and it might push out a little past 20 the reason for this is because we re just getting smarter about how we re spending our dollars in the past you d change the prioritization of some of our activity to deal with some of our legacy it systems as we look at it today our estimate is we won t exceed our spend in fact we may be able to deliver this under the target but we ve got to space this the appropriate way so that we don t actually deliver an initiative that the foundation can t serve so hopefully that s helpful craig menear chairman president and chief executive officer yeah scott this year was a learning year as it related to the investments and we found that some things we could actually accelerate and other things are going to take us a little bit longer as carol mentioned because of the legacy systems that we have to fix scott ciccarelli rbc capital markets analyst i understand okay thanks guys operator our next question comes from the line of chuck grom with gordon haskett please proceed with your question chuck grom gordon haskett analyst hey thanks good morning carol just on the macro again just trying to connect the dots between your 5 guide and lear s view for 2019 particularly its expectation that gains and renovation spending slows as the year progresses which is kind of counter to what you re speaking to and just also on a follow up to the comp with the shift coming from weeks 1 to 52 to weeks 2 to 53 i know some of the department stores that tends to throw things off a lot is there anything that we should think about in terms of the quarterly cadence because of that carole tomé executive vice president corporate services and chief financial office yeah so let me address the latter part of your question first and then we ll get back to the macro so the shift in the calendar wouldn t be such a big deal if we weren t such a seasonal business but we re a very seasonal business so this year let s take the first quarter we will be comparing weeks 1 through 13 in 19 against weeks 2 through 14 in 18 and that shift will have an impact so you would expect the comp in the first quarter to actually be lower than the actual sales growth that we report that reverses in the second quarter in the second quarter we would expect the comps to be higher than the sales growth we report in the third quarter it ll be about the same and then in the fourth quarter the comp will be higher than the sales growth we report principally because we re up against 14 weeks versus the 13 weeks that we will share i will tell you that the first week difference is about 1 5 billion sales so we re dropping off the compare off of 1 5 billion and we re gaining a compare of over 2 billion so hopefully that helps you kind of model what that first quarter impact will be now going back to the macro questions we use a directionally correct but imperfect model and it s worked for us pretty well since we implemented it and if you ve been following us for a while you ll recall that we set forth stages of housing recovery and the impact it would have on our comps and we had three stages of housing recovery there was sharp there was moderate and then there was stability and if you look through that document i think it s on our website if not we can get it to you you can see in the stability area which is where we think we are trending our models suggest it s gdp plus 1 to 2 we conservatively said gdp plus 1 so if you use a 2 6 gdp and you add 100 basis points to that you get to 3 6 and we rounded up a bit to 4 and then as you heard from craig we added a point relative to our strategic investments there are lots of forces and economic prognoses that you can use and one thing that we use to kind of support our point of view is what the harvard joint center says for remodeling activity and their forecast for remodeling activity in 2019 is 5 growth chuck grom gordon haskett analyst okay great thanks very much and then one more for you carol on the third quarter call you gave some helpful color on tax refunds and the timing impact just curious if your views on that front have changed at all and it looks like february refunds are down a lot which is expected just wondering if that s impacted your business thus far in february carole tomé executive vice president corporate services and chief financial officer yeah no we wouldn t say that there s an impact to our business from tax in february and as you pointed out we wouldn t expect the benefits coming from tax reform to come in later as those filers who have an earned income credit or a child credit they actually haven t filed those returns get filed and processed later chuck grom gordon haskett analyst okay great thanks carol carole tomé executive vice president corporate services and chief financial officer yeah operator our next question comes from the line of christopher horvers with j p morgan please proceed with your question christopher horvers j p morgan analyst thanks good morning everybody so there s a lot of noise in 18 hurricane inflation in the first half of the year a pinch in the fourth quarter of deflation it would be helpful to think about 2018 if we backed out weather on an annual basis and we backed out the net benefit from inflation in the first three quarters what is that underlying rate and how does that compare to the 5 guide that you re putting out for 2019 and does that guide include any benefit or headwind from inflation deflation craig menear chairman president and chief executive officer we looked at that we backed those noise levels out it gets you somewhere in the area of a 5 5 to a 5 7 as a normalized run rate you think about taking out the storms you take out the weather you take out the inflation and that s what we round it to carole tomé executive vice president corporate services and chief financial officer and as you know when we build our plans we are commodity inflation neutral we don t really know how to plan for that based on where commodity prices are there may be a little bit of pressure in the first half of the year but we planned for that christopher horvers j p morgan analyst understood so just to summarize there you re basically saying i mean precise basis points but 70 80 basis points of moderation in the underlying comp from 18 to 19 okay understood carole tomé executive vice president corporate services and chief financial officer which is exactly what you would expect you would expect that where we are in the housing recovery you would expect that christopher horvers j p morgan analyst got it and then in terms of the shift from turnover net then pricing and now home equity and age does that express itself in any way in terms of traffic versus ticket growth do you expect ticket to continue to lead does ticket growth actually become more of a factor versus the traffic growth how are you thinking about that craig menear chairman president and chief executive officer yeah it would impact continue to support ticket growth for sure and if you think about the formations estimated to be increasing in 2019 while turnover is more flattish to where it was in 2018 that would definitely project business christopher horvers j p morgan analyst okay and then one quick go ahead sorry go ahead ted decker executive vice president of merchandising sorry chris i would just add on the ticket the thing that s really encouraging about ticket reasons we called out the innovative product in more premium roofing and a grill like the traeger grill we look at a number of signals very closely one is the line structure where sales are coming from opp through good better best we continue to see stronger productivity as you move up price points and we break that out the second data point we look at very closely is where is ticket growth coming from and we include commodity we include tariff we include new items etc and by far our largest ticket growth is coming from the introduction of new innovative items it s actually much more significant than either inflation or tariff christopher horvers j p morgan analyst got it and then just to sneak one last one in carol any particular cadence around gross margin in sg a versus sales growth obviously the fourth quarter you lap the extra week but anything else to call out on a quarterly basis in margins carole tomé executive vice president corporate services and chief financial officer yes we have a seasonal business as you know and we try to predict when spring will break and we use five year historical averages and forecasts from planalytics and we try to predict when it will break we re usually wrong but we try now based on the way that we built our plan we think that spring is going to break it hasn t yet but we think that spring is going to break in the first quarter so because many of our seasonal categories are lower margin you would expect the margin decline to be the greatest in the first quarter so that s an important thing to get out there as you re building your models chris as you know we re not really good at this but that s how we re planning then from an expense growth factor the real noise will be i guess in the fourth quarter but i think we ve given you enough color there that you can model to that so there s really nothing too goofy on the expense side christopher horvers j p morgan analyst have a great spring thanks very much carole tomé executive vice president corporate services and chief financial officer thanks so much operator and our next question comes from the line of steve forbes with guggenheim please proceed with your question steve forbes guggenheim securities analyst good morning carole tomé executive vice president corporate services and chief financial officer morning steve forbes guggenheim securities analyst i wanted to focus on the enhanced delivery and fulfillment option rollout that you mentioned for 2019 so maybe you can just comment on the number and type of facilities slated to open in 19 and i guess how you re moving along relative to the original plan craig menear chairman president and chief executive officer yeah steve we re excited about the pilots that we put in place in 2018 and the learning that we have and marc is here i ll let him address that but we also would say that we re excited about the options that we ve provided for our customers during the year as well on same day delivery for car and van service on products out of our stores marc brown senior vice president store operations yeah just as a reminder we have our five direct fulfillment centers already up providing one and two day service to over 90 of the population we ve got our interline brands facilities now home depot pro that give us near international coverage with next day delivery via 700 private fleet trucks we ve opened three market delivery operations and we have openings planned and grand openings planned through the year on the various new platforms market delivery operations flatbed delivery centers etc so we re looking forward to that and of course we have our car delivery and van delivery fast options there with 40 coverage of the u s population for low cost car delivery and 70 with van coverage steve forbes guggenheim securities analyst and then just a quick follow up maybe more of a modeling question as it relates to d a specifically because i think if you walk back to the analyst day in 17 there was i guess an average three year d a run rate that was called out can you just update us on what we should be building in as we look out to 2020 carole tomé executive vice president corporate services and chief financial officer so i think in our guidance we gave you a d a number of what did we say 2 3 billion some of that flows through cost of goods sold so on the expense line you could plan about 2 billion of d a on the expense line and the remaining 300 million would be up in the cost of goods sold steve forbes guggenheim securities analyst and any comment as we look out to 2020 relative to the three year plan you laid out during the analyst day for d a carole tomé executive vice president corporate services and chief financial officer just keep it up at about that rate steve forbes guggenheim securities analyst thank you very much carole tomé executive vice president corporate services and chief financial officer yeah operator our next question comes from the line of zach fadem with wells fargo please proceed with your question zachary fadem wells fargo securities analyst hey good morning you talked about some of the dynamics around the transition to the spring selling season with the later spring last year is there anything that gives you confidence this year from either a weather to date or product perspective and just given the calendar shift you gave some helpful color but curious whether you anticipate the q1 comp to be above or below the full year comp growth just given the full shift craig menear chairman president and chief executive officer i mean i d start with what carol said earlier and that is we do use a multiyear average model in terms of planning and when you look at that model it suggests that we ll actually see spring break in q1 carole tomé executive vice president corporate services and chief financial officer we don t provide quarterly guidance as you know so i d like to go back to the halves it s the easiest way to think about our business i would expect the first half comp to be lower than the full year comp zachary fadem wells fargo securities analyst okay fair enough and could you comment on how some of the external factors in 19 like lower gas prices and mortgage rates for the consumer are incorporated in the 19 outlook and then second what are you assuming around the tariff environment craig menear chairman president and chief executive officer yeah we have for years tried to correlate gas prices to our business we ve never been able to draw a correlation on that and so there s nothing built in for that whatsoever and then we ve assumed nothing beyond what is in place today on tariffs we don t try to plan for something that hasn t happened ted decker executive vice president of merchandising as we said with tariffs that s been manageable good news obviously sunday and it looks like negotiations are continuing but all the tariffs that have been put in place to date we have managed through that without any issue isabel janci vice president investor relations christine we have time for one more question operator our final question today will come from seth sigman with credit suisse please proceed with your question seth sigman credit suisse analyst thanks hey guys thanks for taking the question so regarding the weather impact and the impact on exterior projects you gave us the 85 basis point impact i m curious during these types of periods do you actually see an offsetting benefit on indoor projects and then just narrowing in on the exterior projects to what extent are you already starting to see those come back or expect to see those come back in that first half outlook thank you craig menear chairman president and chief executive officer yeah i mean generally as ted mentioned we felt very positive about our paint business and so customers have a tendency to focus inside when they can t do work outside and that is something that happens in the business overall so we felt good about the interior side of the business ted decker executive vice president of merchandising yeah i would say every cycle we have had of bad weather craig mentioned the huge swings in a market like los angeles we ve seen that consistently across all our markets last spring for example we were delayed and as soon as the weather broke our business just exploded and we see that across markets now weekend to weekend so full expectation that when spring comes we re ready for it we ve got great innovative products we re in stock and ready to go for our customers seth sigman credit suisse analyst got you okay and then just one follow up on the pricing environment you talked a lot about commodity prices can you just talk a little bit about price changes that you re seeing in non commodity categories and if you re embedding anything in the guidance thanks ted decker executive vice president of merchandising there s nothing in the guidance for sure across the board not just for tariffs but we ve seen through 18 an increase cost expectation from our suppliers just whether it s wages or transportation supply chain fuel things that they experience but we ve digested all of that and run that across a portfolio basis and we don t see any increased pressure going into 19 if anything as you mentioned things like fuel transportation capacity and hopefully the tariff outlook all those pressures should be fading a bit isabel janci vice president investor relations so thank you for joining us today we look forward to speaking with you on our first quarter earnings call in may operator this will conclude today s call we thank you for your participation duration 61 minutes call participants isabel janci vice president investor relations craig menear chairman president and chief executive officer ted decker executive vice president of merchandising carole tomé executive vice president corporate services

we have a particular focus on and experience in private equity investment in africa and set out below our general high level outlook for investment into africa in 2019 2020 we have a particular focus on and experience in private equity investment in africa and set out below our general high level outlook for investment into africa in 2019 2020 africa is comprised of a range of distinct investment destinations with each region and country having its own appeals and challenges created through differing cultures business practices as well as political and economic circumstances however african private equity activity has remained steady over the past seven years with investors having confidence in the long term attractiveness of africa especially when compared with developed markets according to the african private equity and venture capital association 76 of surveyed investors plan to increase or maintain their allocation to african private equity over the next three years the size of private equity investments in southern africa more than doubled in and from 2017 and private equity has consistently outperformed listed equity while south africa was the traditional powerhouse of the african private equity industry nigeria and kenya have recently overtaken it in attracting the most attention from private equity investments in africa the political and economic uncertainties of 2017 caused some concern in the south african market however stability through 2018 saw investor confidence pick up challenges and impacting factors political risk management is always a factor in driving portfolio trends with elections currency and commodity price volatility being some of the most significantly impacting macro factors in 2019 south africa specifically may see some temporary stalling in investment due to the upcoming presidential elections additionally environmental social and governance esg factors are increasingly becoming important considerations for and drivers in investment decisions some of the usual culprits that cause investors to shy away from investing include corruption and weak governance as well as limited exit opportunities which continue to hamper investor perceptions of and confidence in the continent sourcing quality competitive deals is frequently a challenge for private equity firms in africa as intermediaries on which they depend often have confined geographic and social networks and tend to generalise lacking the necessary sector knowledge to more effectively and suitably match investors with deals another challenge to private equity investment into africa is that there is still a large gap in reliable data pertaining to private companies this makes it difficult to achieve reliable valuations and peer comparisons resulting in african companies being compared to international peers which in turn leads to mispricing in order to maximise their return on investment fund managers are required to adopt a more hands on approach to managing investments this requires time and human capital with the necessary skillset to engage more actively with and nurture portfolio companies this often proves challenging where portfolio companies remain majority family owned and controlled with significant owner resistance to perceived investor interference with the operation of the business local regulatory frameworks often create barriers to investment and place burdensome restrictions on private equity operations including limited access to local capital such as domestic pension funds exchange controls local content requirements and ownership restrictions more developed frameworks in south africa and nigeria are driving change but progress is slow on a positive note intra african trade is set to increase interest in africa looking to generate 22 african nations to support the initiative the african continental free trade agreement aims to stimulate and facilitate intra african trade which should fuel investor confidence particularly in the ever popular consumer goods sector additionally africa s middle class is growing with rising disposable incomes stimulating investment into telecoms consumer and financial services sectors consumer driven industries such as financial services and consumer goods health care and education remain steady and stable investment bets the agricultural sector is set to hold strong as agro processing increases and global food demand spikes lack of efficient infrastructure across africa impacts significantly on per capita growth rate and places significant strain on human development the african development bank s most recent estimation of infrastructure needs is between us 130 and us 170 billion annually a need which is not matched by the continent s capital this creates a substantive opportunity for private equity and infrastructure funds support which is anticipated to continue to grow over the next few years technology has developed as the highest interest emerging sector for private equity investment historically this sector in africa struggled to access funding and capital due to the lack of understanding and backing of the industry and its potential impact on the development of other industries and the economy as a whole another regular challenge for the industry is the poor connectivity that in spite of improvements still plagues the continent however tech enabling solutions in the consumer discretionary spending space as well as technology driven financial solutions are hot topics and on trend for 2019 particularly across africa which is ripe for the industry to explode technological advancements and solutions have a substantial impact on the development and growth of other industries and as this model is repeatedly proven then investment in tech companies becomes an easier decision to justify kenya malawi and rwanda are already deploying technology in the agricultural sector including aerial imagery from drones or satellites weather forecasts and soil sensors all of which are making it easier for farmers to manage their crops in real time while financial solutions are connecting small holder farmers with credit financial institutions and greater market access funding in tech start ups surged by 51 amounting to us 195 million in 2017 and continues to grow exponentially with development capital set to carry the sector to new heights additional trends in 2017 the most popular disposals in value terms were sales to other private equity firms or financial institutions and the most popular method of disposal were sales to management sponsor exits by way of initial public offering have remained stable over the past few years amounting to a total of 16 of all ipos in africa between 2010 and 2017 with an increase from three in 2016 to four in 2017 this trend is anticipated to continue into 2019 particularly with the growth and maturing of africa s stock markets including the nigerian stock exchange and the kenyan capital markets authority as china s domestic growth began to surge at the end of the last century demand for natural resources and job creation forced china to look for markets abroad with africa being an ideal partner with its abundance of commodities and need for infrastructure development chinese investment into infrastructure projects is continuing to increase with investment speculated to reach us 100 billion by 2020 equal to 4 of african gdp this would go a long way to boosting economic growth and addressing needs and deficits specifically in the energy and transport sectors interestingly in 2019 it is anticipated that more private equity firms will participate in later stage million dollar venture capital deals as more businesses look to scale up after proving the viability of their business models clearly we will need to look out for market intelligence and deal reporting to see if this anticipated trend comes to fruition investors china leads in active engagement with africa with seven heads of state summits under its belt to date however chinese support has mainly taken the form of loans to governments and state owned entities in excess of us 86 billion between 2000 and 2014 and growing with foreign direct investment fdi making up only 5 of total global investment in africa regardless two way trade has grown exponentially and now exceeds us 200 billion china has also established more than 10 000 firms across africa becoming the most integrated investor into the continent japan has and continues to show great interest in south africa in particular as it sees it as gateway into the rest of africa with many investors predominantly from the vehicle manufacturing sector establishing offices in south africa japan has also opened dialogues and is working closer with east africa including rwanda as well as ethiopia however kenya nigeria and south africa maintain their primary destination spots with this investment giant the european union eu has sought to strengthen its collaboration with africa with the fifth eu africa summit having taken place in abidjan in 2017 two way trade exceeds us 300 billion and the eu has pledged to mobilise more than 44 billion in sustainable investment by 2020 furthermore the eu is formalising its support of the continent and firming up its preferential access to markets across the region with the economic partnership agreements already signed with over 40 nations in sub saharan africa germany and the netherlands are emerging as the fastest growing investors in africa increasing their project counts on the continent from 2017 while the united kingdom remains solid and dependable in its commitment to fdis second only to the united states while the u s is the largest direct investor in africa with us 54 billion in fdis it is trailing behind in its collaborative efforts being more selective of the countries with which it engages primarily south africa lesotho kenya mauritius and ethiopia two way trade at below us 39 billion and only having ever held one summit with african leaders under the obama administration in 2014 however both the trump administration as well as the u s corporate sector are set to increase investment into the continent in a bid to counter the narrative that china s influence in africa is rising while the u s falls off president trump signed legislation the build act better utilisation of investments leading to development act into law in october 2018 and it combines the u s overseas private investment corporation opic and other u s agencies focusing on international economic development into a new consolidated agency called the u s international development finance corporation dfc the dfc expands opic s budget from us 29 billion to us 60 billion and provides the dfc with authority to make limited equity investments previously opic was limited to debt investments it is anticipated that the dfc will be operational in october 2019 and there is potential that the dfc will increase the amount of u s equity capital invested in african private equity as at the end of 2017 south africa shared the top spot for fdi contribution to other african countries with morocco followed by kenya nigeria ethiopia egypt and ghana it is likely that the trend will continue into 2019 with increased investor appetite for east and west africa and egypt and africa the traditional darlings of fdis being displaced by morocco and ethiopia closing over the past few years africa has emerged as an exciting investment destination despite being afflicted by concerns of political and economic stability currency and commodity price fluctuation and infrastructure deficiency as well as questionable governance as in any emerging and developing markets the continent continues to attract investors eager to diversify portfolios and dip into sectors and industries which though challenging have significant room for growth and development 2019 should see investor appetite growing as several countries such as south africa nigeria and kenya continue to see undeniable returns for those willing to venture into some of the choppier waters of african private equity

the s p 500 index reached a milestone monday rising to its highest point since early november while recovering all of december s harrowing plunge many pundits said the rally reflected optimism that the u s and china will come to an amicable agreement on trade after president donald trump postponed the date for boosting tariffs on chinese imports perhaps the more likely reason was relief the move really means that the trump administration is postponing higher taxes on americans by not doubling tariffs on some 200 billion of chinese goods at a time when u s economic growth is rapidly decelerating a government report on thursday is forecast to show that gross domestic product slowed to a 2 4 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter from 3 4 percent pace in the third quarter and 4 2 percent in the second quarter indexes compiled by the federal reserve banks of new york and atlanta that attempt to track growth in real time show gdp this quarter expanding at a less than 1 5 percent rate some strategists such as those at bank of america say the markets will come to realize that continued tariff postponements without any sign of meaningful progress would just extend the uncertainty although trump said the u s and china are getting very very close and that a summit with chinese counterpart xi jinping could be in the offing he also tempered that optimism by both saying a deal with china might happen fairly soon or may not happen at all that may help explain why the s p 500 spent most of the day parings its gains closing up just 0 12 percent after rising as much as 0 75 percent

light of the fact that we had lower than expected uptake on generic copaxone and did not receive our generic advair approval demonstrating once again the resiliency of our business model we adapted quickly and strategically to market conditions while at the same time remained a leader for the generics industry and an advocate for changes to the current structural issues in the u s healthcare system that hinder access to generics looking forward i can confidently say through leveraging the diversification across our commercial operational and scientific platforms we feel incredibly positive about our ability to deliver a strong top line financial performance in 2019 specifically we expect to generate total revenues of between 11 5 billion and 12 5 billion reflecting top line growth across all three of our geographic segments our business model is predicated on prioritizing long term sustainable growth therefore we will be making incremental investments in our sales and marketing and research and development efforts as a result we expect to deliver 2019 adjusted eps in the range of 3 80 to 4 80 additionally we expect to generate adjusted free cash flows between 1 9 billion and 2 3 billion at the same time we are putting a highly disciplined financial lens to unlock latent value from the assets we ve integrated as we transition to a business model that is predominantly driven by organic growth mylan president rajiv malik added we re pleased with our results from 2018 and continue to be extremely proud of our scientific achievements over the past year in 2019 you can expect us to move our portfolio and pipeline up the value chain invest organically in our key brands and execute on our impressive commercial assets around the world we anticipate growth of more than 1 billion in new launches nearly all of which have already been approved and which reflects a heavier weighting on specialty and complex generic products aligned with the evolution of the pharmaceutical industry mylan cfo ken parks added mylan continued to generate strong cash flow with more than 2 7 billion of adjusted free cash flow for 2018 an increase of 86 million compared

can be found at investor mylan com a replay of the webcast also will be available on the website non gaap financial measures this press release includes the presentation and discussion of certain financial information that differs from what is reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states u s gaap these non gaap financial measures including but not limited to adjusted eps constant currency net sales constant currency total revenues adjusted gross profit adjusted gross margins adjusted net earnings ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted r d adjusted sg a adjusted

to credit agreement adjusted ebitda long term average debt to credit agreement adjusted ebitda leverage ratio adjusted net cash provided by operating activities and adjusted free cash flow are presented in order to supplement investors and other readers understanding and assessment of the financial performance of mylan n v mylan or the company management uses these measures internally for forecasting budgeting measuring its operating performance and incentive based awards primarily due to acquisitions and other significant events which may impact comparability of our periodic operating results mylan believes that an evaluation of its ongoing operations and comparisons of its current operations with historical and future operations would be difficult if the disclosure of its financial results was limited to financial measures prepared only in accordance with u s gaap we believe that non gaap financial measures are useful supplemental information for our investors and when considered together with our u s gaap financial measures and the reconciliation to the most directly comparable u s gaap financial measure provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our operations the financial performance of the company is measured by senior management in part using adjusted metrics included herein along with other performance metrics management s annual incentive compensation is derived in part based on the adjusted eps metric and the adjusted free cash flow metric in addition the company believes that including ebitda and supplemental adjustments applied in presenting adjusted ebitda and credit agreement adjusted ebitda as defined below pursuant to our credit agreements is appropriate to provide additional information to investors to demonstrate the company s ability to comply with financial debt covenants and assess the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness we also report sales performance using the non gaap financial measures of constant currency total revenues and net sales these measures provide information on the change in total revenues and net sales assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and current period the comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency sales at the prior year s foreign exchange rates we routinely evaluate our net sales and total revenues performance at constant currency so that sales results can be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rates thereby facilitating a period to period comparison of our operational activities and believe that this presentation also provides useful information to investors for the same reason the summary of total revenues by segment table below compares net sales on an actual and constant currency basis for each reportable segment for the quarters and years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 as well as for total revenues also set forth below mylan has provided reconciliations of such non gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable u s gaap financial measures investors and other readers are encouraged to review the related u s gaap financial measures and the reconciliations of the non gaap measures to their most directly comparable u s gaap measures set forth below and investors and other readers should consider non gaap measures only as supplements to not as substitutes for or as superior measures to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with u s gaap for additional information regarding the components and uses of non gaap financial measures refer to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations use of non gaap financial measures

this article is more than 5 years old getty china stocks are selling off in some profit taking on tuesday following monday s mega rally one thing the market seems to be discounting however is the level of stimulus beijing can pull off this time for now part of the euphoria in china s outperforming stock market is due to president trump s extension of the 90 day trade truce that extension comes with a pause in planned tariff increases to 25 on 200 billion worth of chinese imports trump also appeared to soften trade related actions this week by holding off on an executive order that would ban huawei from the u s telecom market he also opted to pause on auto tariffs something the department of commerce recommended this should be viewed as temporary the 60 day reprieve ends in may tariffs are not going away the u s china trade dispute has been a drag on the global economy and world trade for over a year and asian export growth has slumped now a key negative for both the global economy and global markets looks as though it is being removed says neil mackinnon an economist for vtb capital in london jerome powell s senate testimony today also didn t add any stresses to the market at this time though most investors are still digesting what the fed chairman said a pause in the hiking cycle is good for emerging markets china has been a runaway train it is beating the msci emerging markets index it s beating its bric counterparts it s beating the s p 500 and the ftse europe on tuesday northbound connect trade between hong kong and mainland china stock exchanges witnessed another day of high volumes matching monday s levels foreign investors were net buyers monday and tuesday northbound connect volumes were 50 higher than they were during msci s 2018 inclusion trading days msci s decision on their china a shares index comes out thursday all of this has led to this here china is massively overbought the 1 correction in the deutsche x trackers china a shares ashr etf is a drop in the bucket chinese equity market sentiment was in the gutter at the end of 2018 today it has gone from optimism to euphoric investors believe that the trade war will not escalate and if it does then the people s bank of china and other market movers in beijing s government will support the economy any way they can the problem is no one really thinks china will overstimulate its economy in fact the consensus is that beijing has very little runway to stimulate more in the eventual case of an escalation in the trade dispute as the chinese like to call it markets are too optimistic about the speed scale scope and efficiency of beijing s stimulus measures this time and they may be unprepared for a significantly worse growth slowdown in the first half of 2019 says ting lu a top china analyst for nomura securities in hong kong this is especially true of those investors that have recently converted to the belief that beijing has talented technocrats with quick decision making perfect execution and deep pockets and will deliver stable growth whenever the economy is in trouble like those that were overly bearish on china several years ago we would caution those who are overly bullish compared with the last three major stimulus programs room for monetary easing and fiscal stimulus is much smaller due to surging debt at the provincial level that has xi jinping cracking down on shadow banking a smaller current account surplus and falling forex reserves the decision making process is longer now because there is no consensus on direction and strategy within communist party leadership china is a hybrid capitalist communist system they ve hit a crossroads beijing s last stimulus came in 2015 following a steep market decline after msci rejected a shares inclusion in the msci emerging markets index something everyone in china was banking on and changes to the yuan trading band in order to propel china s currency into the imf s special drawing rights currency basket the people s bank of china was unable to prop up the market and likely has little appetite to do as much as they did three years ago nomura s china analysts think the economy will get worse before getting better that s because conventional easing measures may not be able to resolve many of the problems resulting from non market based policy measures and interventions imposed on the economy in the past few years in a report published tuesday morning ting lu and his team said that freeing up the economy via market oriented reforms is still key to growth but more market access for foreigners will take time and things will get worse before beijing strengthens its resolve to free up the economy the report authors wrote getty moreover beijing s room for stimulating demand appears much more limited the trade war talks have resulted in china agreeing to keep the renminbi stable to stronger rather than let it weaken against the dollar as it should if extra tariffs were ordered it is hard to believe that china will agree to maintain a stronger currency in the event washington hikes tariffs from 10 to 25 china is equally unlikely to introduce new subsidies especially for agriculture after promising to import more u s commodities instead they are likely to ramp up existing subsidies for tech sectors the exact sectors the u s fears will run them out of asia someday xi jinping is not totally sold on subsidies as they tend to lead to overcapacity and oversupply beijing has mentioned several times that it will stimulate the purchase of cars and home appliances this could be a boon for consumers primarily in the discretionary consumer segments blackrock strategist richard turnill says investors will have to pick their spots the trade war is not over and the stimulus packages won t be what the market had before the chinese stock market has rallied sharply this year after finishing 2018 near the bottom he says is there still opportunity left we have a positive view on china s stock market but see rising risks and reason for greater selectivity
we view current economic conditions as healthy and the economic outlook as favourable mr powell also said projecting that the economy would expand at a solid pace in 2019 albeit somewhat slower than in 2018 and the job market would remain strong mr powell also took a shot at the idea that deficits don t matter an idea that has been gaining currency in the last few months on both sides of the political divide we continue to expect the fed will raise interest rates one more time this year and wait at least until q3 before doing so oxford economics kathy bostjancic said regarding the balance sheet mr powell referenced public estimates mostly from banks and primary dealers that bank reserves might need to be about us1 trillion plus a buffer ms bostjancic said given the current pace of roll off the fomc will likely end the balance sheet normali ation this year and the size of the balance sheet will be around us3 4 us3 6 trillion according to our estimates overnight in the uk brexit again

order to get a cross party majority of mps to back a deal though this shift now likely will come in q2 not at the end of q1 this path is less risky for the pm than holding a second referendum or

when today monday february 25 2019 where cnbc s closing bell live from the forbes shook top advisor summit in las vegas nv the following is a cnbc exclusive interview with the carlyle group co founder and co executive chairman david rubenstein and cnbc s leslie picker on cnbc s closing bell m f 3pm 5pm today monday february 25 the following is a link to video of the interview on cnbc com all references must be sourced to cnbc wilfred frost welcome back to the closing bell our own leslie picker is at the third annual forbes shook top advisor summit in las vegas she s joined now by david rubenstein co founder and the co executive chairman of the carlyle group leslie over to you leslie picker hey wilf thanks so much and david thank you for joining us david rubenstein my pleasure to be here leslie picker so president trump tweeting a little bit ago that the china trade deal is in advanced stages do you believe they get there david rubenstein i do think there will be a deal because i think both sides really want a deal i think the chinese recognize it s necessary for them to really get their economy in the shape that they want it to be in to have a deal i think the americans are ready for a deal too so i think a deal will likely get done in the next few months or so leslie picker is it a deal that america needs to see david rubenstein i think it s going to be probably a deal that everybody will like no deal is perfect but this is the deal that will not have to be technically approved by congress there will be hearings but with u s m c a for example you have to get congress to approve that which hasn t happened yet this is not a deal that will have to be technically approved by congress leslie picker now jay powell you know him well you ve hired him at carlyle you interviewed him recently on stage what do you hope to hear from him this week when he testifies in front of congress david rubenstein well i think he s probably going to say somewhat what he said before which is that the fed is monitoring the data but right now the data indicates that the fed is right on course to kind of stay where they are i think he would surprise people if he were to say well we re going to make a reversal we re going to increase interest rates or decrease interest rates i think people are expecting him to say pretty much what he said before when i interviewed him and what he s also said recently other places that steady as she goes right now leslie picker is that what your data says as carlyle you own businesses and you look at different pockets of the markets you have a really good read on what s going on in the economy right now does what you see with your underlying businesses at carlyle match up with where you think the fed is david rubenstein yes we have the data and we share that data with some government agencies when they want it from time to time because we have a pretty good look on the global economy we own more than 200 companies or partial stakes in 200 companies in some cases all around the world and we basically feel that the u s economy s in reasonably good shape it is not going to grow at 4 this year or perhaps not even 3 i think probably closer to 2 2 or 2 3 that s still reasonably good remember we are in a ten year growth cycle and to be growing at 2 3 after 10 years is pretty good for an economy of our size certainly leslie picker and obviously the markets have reflected that at least in 2019 what do you think is something that could help propel the markets higher the equity markets higher and what do you think are some of the risks that could derail it at this point david rubenstein well clearly the markets are feeling pretty good the fact that there is likely to be a china trade agreement i think that congress is not likely to change the tax laws that we have currently there s been discussion recently about tax changes i don t think the congress is likely to do anything in that regard in the next two years ago i think the president has been very good in deregulating some of the overregulation in the economy at least that s the perception of the business community so i think the economy is in reasonably good shape and the business community has a fair amount of confidence and there s a fair amount of consumer confidence as well leslie picker i want to ask you about modern monetary theory david rubenstein okay leslie picker and this idea that the national debt is seemingly less and less important by policy makers on both sides of the aisle where do you stand on this as someone who lives in washington looks at issues related to the national debt all the time do you think that s the right way to david rubenstein well recently larry summers and jason furman had an article in foreign affairs which is the publication of the council on foreign relations and it said that actually the debt we have is not as big of a problem as previously had thought we have about 22 trillion of total debt and we are adding about 1 2 or 1 3 trillion a year to me that s a problem it s something we have to address some time but it s not an immediate problem in part because we are able to sell our debt at pretty low prices people really have to buy dollars we are the only reserve currency and we can print a fair amount of dollars and sell it at very low rates so for the time being it is not as big of a problem as traditionally people would thought but it s something that would have to be addressed at some point hopefully by my children if not my grandchildren leslie picker and what s if we do go into some sort of a downturn does that threaten the ability to keep running up the tab on our national debt david rubenstein well if we went into a downturn presumably interest rates would be lower so it d be a little bit cheaper to service that debt but the gdp would probably be down so it might be harder to get tax revenues there s no doubt that it would better to have less debt than we have but right now it s not an immediate problem it s not the greatest problem we have leslie picker now you practice something called patriotic philanthropy david rubenstein yes leslie picker looking at restoring various monuments museums different areas of the u s you donated a copy of the magna carta for example and helped restore james madison s estate in montpelier lately there s been more and more talk of presidential candidates and politicians about this idea of wealth redistribution through taxation primarily do you see that as patriotic philanthropy or is that something else david rubenstein well i m not sure that patriotic philanthropy in my view is giving money or your time or your energy or ideas to remind people of our history our heritage that s what i mean by patriotic philanthropy to remind people of our past the good and the bad to remind people that montpelier or monticello were places where there were slaves and therefore think it s good that those places are being rebuilt to know the good and the bad about the people that were there in terms of tax redistribution i think actually right now that it s unlikely there will be any tax redistribution in the next couple of years i suspect that the more we talk about it and the more moderates get scared about it you probably are likely to help the people who are against it get re elected in other words i don t think there s a big ground swell of support that s likely change congress ability to tax in a way that some of the key candidates are talking about remember we have had a tax system for quite some time we don t have a wealth tax in the united states it s not even clear if it s constitutional and i think it s unlikely congress is going to imposes a wealth tax any time soon leslie picker do you think we should would you be willing to pay for taxes david rubenstein well i pay a fair amount of taxes i think by normal human standards and i think it s important that everybody pay their fair share of taxes so i do pay a fair amount of taxes and i m happy to pay the taxes that i pay but i do think that we have to remember that you have to have some money to let people invest if you overtax you re not likely to have the money to invest and i do think people in our country should get a fair tax and i think we have a system that s not perfect by a long shot it s not a perfect system and we can always improve it and i think there always should be improvements but i think it s unlikely that congress is going have a wealth tax or have marginal tax rates go to 70 to the extent people talk about that i think it s more likely than not going to produce people who are saying well i don t really want that and therefore while i might not like the republican view of things i m more likely to vote republican than i would otherwise do because they re afraid the taxes could be imposed so i think you have to be careful when you re playing with fire in that regard if you really want to make a change in government you have to be careful in my view if you talk about that so much it s unlikely to happen and could scare some people into voting the opposite way that you want them to vote leslie picker interesting i think wilfred frost has a question for you back at the nyse wilf david rubenstein okay wilfred frost hi david thanks very much for joining us just quickly i just want to follow up on that particular topic you said the tax system never perfect always ripe for improvement but you have got to be careful what do would you say it s fair for some people to say that private equity executives are one of the areas where it s least perfect since you pay a large amount under capital gains tax because of carried interest which is lower than income taxes for someone of your level of success david rubenstein well there s no doubt that private equity taxation has gotten a fair amount of attention over the years i don t think it s biggest problem in our tax system relatively speaking it would produce even if you changed the system and went to a different type of system ordinary income taxes for example instead of carried interest capital gains it would produce relatively modest amounts of money for the federal government if you really want to increase the amount of money the federal government is getting you re going to have to tax the middle class and that s obviously very difficult to do there aren t enough extremely wealthy people to really have a big impact on revenue if you change their tax rates even if you went to marginally higher tax rates there s just not enough people in the forbes 400 obviously there s only 400 of them that you re going to make a big difference so if you really want to have more tax revenue and have great fairness you re going to have to tax people who are much lower closer to the middle class and obviously produces some political problems wilfred frost david on air this morning on squawk box becky quick sat down with warren buffett and they discussed the balance between public equity and private equity let s take a listen warren buffet they call themselves private equity but they re really private debt to a great extent but that trillion might buy as much as say 3 trillion of assets if it s leveraged with 2 trillion of debt well the total stock market is something like 30 trillion and if you take the top five companies you know another or six companies knock 4 trillion off that so you re down to something where the buying power of private equity plus just the normal buying power from companies who want to get it s just a huge amount of competition wilfred frost david do you think that s a little bit of sour grapes there from mr buffett given the success your industry had in attracting more assets under management in the last couple of decades david rubenstein warren buffett is perhaps the greatest investor ever he s somebody that i regard as a great role model he s somebody that i regard as a friend i m not going to say that anything he says is wrong because i don t know enough to be able to criticize anything he says let me just say that private equity has done a pretty good job of improving the efficiency of the companies in the united states for 30 or 40 years and around the world people like private equity that come into their country to show them how to improve and modernize companies and i think it has created value for the economies in which it operated there s no doubt there s a fair amount of money in private equity now that s because the returns have been very good the people aren t putting money in private equity because the returns are bad the returns are good the returns may not be as good as warren buffett has achieved nobody can probably get those kind of returns but we ve done reasonably good for our investors and we are proud of what we have achieved courtney reagan david it s courtney here at the new york stock exchange i have a quick question for you in regards to the trade talks it does sound like you re confident that we will have some kind of a resolution between the u s and china but of course the devil s in the details as they say and we really don t know where we are on any of those details is it possible that china could be unhappy with the final terms and possibly could change the way that they buy or hold u s debt is there any risk there that we should be considering david rubenstein neither side will be completely happy with the deal all trade deals all deals of any consequence have things that neither side really likes the most but as i have had discussions over the years with the central bankers in china they do not look at buying of u s debt as something that is a political tool they think it s an important thing for them to be able to take the excess reserves they have the foreign reserves and put it into something safe that they know they can get their money back with some interest and there s nothing else to find that s equivalent to u s treasury bills so i don t think it s used by the chinese whether there s a trade deal or not but i do think there will be a trade deal because clearly both sides want a trade deal and i do think something is imminent in the not too distant future leslie picker now david i know it s a little early to be looking ahead to 2020 but still there are candidates coming forth pretty much every other day at this point david rubenstein yes i m embarrassed to say that i m one of the few people i know not running for president of the united states leslie picker okay we ve got some news here he is not running for president of the united states david rubenstein not running for president of the united states leslie picker but a lot of your peers of business are running for president of the united states or are considering running for president of the united states do you believe that someone who s more of an independent like say howard schultz should be running for president of the united states do you think that someone with that type of a background should be running as an independent or should be running at all david rubenstein well i don t know if howard schultz wants my advice but i would simply say that we have seen independence affect the outcome of elections clearly ross perot i think effected the outcome in 1992 i think john anderson had some effect in 1980 i would say when he ran against carter and reagan and i think ralph nader probably had some impact when he ran in 2000 so there s no doubt that independents can make a difference now the question is do you have a moderate to republican independent running or do you have a moderate to a liberal independent running if some moderate to republican independent for example the governor of maryland if he were to run as independent moderate republican he d probably have a fair impact on the outcome of the election he hasn t said he s doing that but i think you have to be able to figure out whether you want to take votes away from a democrat or votes away from a republican but it s too early to say as you say it is very early and we love politics in the united states and we love to talk about how early it is when people run this early and a point i like to make to people is this if you back the last ten presidential elections two years in advance and try to predict the president two years subsequent to that you would be wrong almost every time you almost never would predict who was going to be president you know two years in advance nobody would have predicted two years ahead of the last presidential election that donald trump would have been elected people wouldn t have predicted jimmy carter they wouldn t have predicted barack obama two years in advance they wouldn t have predicted so many people who were elected so it s just fun interesting but it s just too soon to know the impact of all these candidates running around leslie picker all right david

with the government of alberta s mandatory oil production curtailments husky believes that this abandonment of free market principles has impacted investor confidence and created several business challenges including the company s ability to process and transport its production to markets unimpeded and profitably curtailment rules disproportionately impact companies like husky with significant downstream and midstream investments relative to producers who have not made these investments furthermore the government s curtailment formula does not consider husky s production growth over the year at sunrise and tucker which are now at full capacity and does not consider costs related to marketing commitments or the closure restart or early abandonment of wells and facilities husky

therefore should not be used to make comparisons to similar measures presented by other issuers disclosure of oil and gas information unless otherwise indicated i reserves estimates have been prepared by internal qualified reserves evaluators in accordance with the canadian oil and gas evaluation handbook have an effective date of december 31 2018 and represent the company s working interest share ii projected and historical production volumes provided are gross which represents the total or the company s working interest share as applicable before deduction of royalties iii all husky working interest production volumes quoted are before deduction of royalties and iv historical production volumes provided are for the year ended december 31 2018 the company uses the term barrels of oil equivalent or boe which is consistent with other oil and gas companies disclosures and is calculated on an energy equivalence basis applicable at the burner tip whereby one barrel of crude oil is equivalent to six thousand cubic feet of natural gas the term boe is used to express the sum of the total company products in one unit that can be used for comparisons readers are cautioned that the term boe may be misleading particularly if used in isolation this measure is used for consistency with other oil and gas companies and does not represent value equivalency at the wellhead the company uses the term proved reserves life index which is consistent with other oil and gas companies disclosures the company s proved reserves life index for a given period is determined by taking the company s total proved reserves at the end of that period divided by the company s upstream gross production for the same period readers are cautioned that the term proved reserves life index may be misleading particularly if used in isolation this measure is used for consistency with other oil and gas companies and does not reflect the actual life of the reserves the company uses the term reserves replacement ratio which is consistent with other oil and gas companies disclosures reserves replacement ratios for a given period are determined by taking the company s incremental proved reserve additions for that period divided by the company s upstream gross production for the same period the reserves replacement ratio measures the amount of reserves added to a company s reserves base during a given period relative to the amount of oil and gas produced during that same period a company s reserves replacement ratio must be at least 100 percent for the company to maintain its reserves the reserves replacement ratio only measures the amount of reserves added to a company s reserves base during a given period reserves replacement ratios presented as excluding economic factors exclude the impact that changing oil and gas prices inflation and regulations have on reserves amounts note to u s readers the company reports its reserves and resources information in accordance with canadian practices and specifically in accordance with national instrument 51 101 standards of disclosure for oil and gas activities adopted by the canadian securities regulators because the company is permitted to prepare its reserves and resources information in accordance with canadian disclosure requirements it may use certain terms in that disclosure that u s oil and gas companies generally do not include or may be prohibited from including in their filings with the sec all currency is expressed in canadian dollars unless otherwise indicated
we can t take it anymore proclaims the economist and media sensation javier milei from his twitter account he is not alone it all started a few weeks ago with a twittazo inviting people to protest against the high taxes and the huge public spending the hashtag bajenlosimpuestos lower taxes quickly became a trending topic on march 21 what began as a virtual protest is moving to the real world organized by prestigious economists foundations and think tanks members of the press student organizations and taxpayers groups the first argentine anti tax protest will have its epicenter in buenos aires at the gates of the parliament however there are groups all across the country working to organize similar events in cities like rosario córdoba corrientes and many others when he campaigned for office in 2015 president mauricio macri seemed aware of the heavy tax burden of the country however most of his promises about reducing taxes have never come true the only concrete step taken by his administration the progressive elimination of the export taxes on agricultural products was put on hold due to budgetary constraints moreover mr macri has not only failed to reduce public spending but he has also created some taxes of his own the most pathetic example is a tax on financial investments in late 2017 which many signal as one of the major reasons for the financial crisis of 2018 which hit macri s administration to the point of having to negotiate a rescue package with the international monetary fund imf to avoid a default of argentina s sovereign debt argentina s fiscal situation is appalling the paying taxes 2018 a report issued by the world bank and pwc showed a horrific scenario the taxpayers face up to one hundred taxes and in the item of total tax and contribution rate the percentage is an impossible 106 in the same category latin america as a whole scores a 52 6 per cent europe 39 6 per cent and north america 38 9 per cent argentina posses another shameful record it is the country with more fiscal auditing and tax raids than any other place in the world what is more according to the report argentina is the country with the most taxes in the world and the fifth regarding tax evasion needless to say when fiscal pressure is of 106 per cent there are no other ways to survive at least we can t get worse than this one may think but as it turns out it can a recent report issued by the non partisan local think tank iaraf their tax vademecum claims that individuals and companies may face the grotesque figure of 163 different taxes 40 of them are raised by the national government 40 by the different provincial authorities and a staggering 82 by the municipal administrations it seems there is no lack of fiscal creativity particularly on the city level as a consequence of this über feudal tax policy per every 10 pesos an argentinian spends between 3 to 8 can end up in the pockets of the government perhaps a very telling example are purchases of new cars when someone buys a new car at the dealership he or she will pay 54 8 percent of the car s value in taxes that is it is literally more taxes than the car itself a similar ratio can be observed in textile products fundación atlas 1853 s director martín simonetta once said about this situation since i am poor i have to buy all my clothing in miami for a long time argentina was under what i called unproductive economic freedom the tax policies were completely out of hand but the state was too big and too clumsy to collect its dues the result was a situation in which a sort of economic freedom came into being from the informality that allowed for survival but not for real economic growth this is because the market economy seems to thrive in environments where people pay their taxes because they can afford to pay their taxes governments and states are a reality as long as they exist taxes will be something we have to deal with therefore it is key that they are low and simple the alternative is regime uncertainty and illegality this scenario has been proven again and again incompatible with sustainable economic growth however the weaponization of the income tax carried out by néstor and cristina kirchner in the early 2000s has put many individuals under the reach of the tax collectors thus a worker who earns 38 301 pesos a meager 994 us dollars at the current exchange pays 9 per cent of it as income tax incidentally the income tax is progressive and the highest rate is 35 per cent on top of this according to tax experts argentinians have to work 60 per cent of the year for the state nonetheless the head of national revenue agency afip mr leandro cucclioli recently expressed that there is no end in sight for this tax torture we need more people to pay what they have to pay the more we formalize the economy the better for everyone said the taxman in chief it seems that not everybody agrees with him though and the events of march 21 may very well shake the foundations of an extractive political class which has been testing the levels of toleration of the society for too long originally published by the austrian economics center
hong kong is set to report economic growth halved in the fourth quarter with the outlook for this year overshadowed by a bruising trade war between washington and beijing as well as weaker consumer spending that has weighed on the financial hub financial secretary paul chan said in a blog post this month the economy grew less than 1 5 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier against 2 9 percent growth in the previous three months that would mark the worst performance for a quarter since the first three months of 2016 and a notable slowdown from the 4 6 percent growth in the first quarter which was the city s strongest performance in nearly seven years calling the cooling a significant slowdown chan said that meant economic expansion for the whole year of 2018 was likely to be about 3 percent a two year low the government had revised its full year growth forecast to 3 2 percent in november down from an initial forecast of 3 4 percent the economic outlook of hong kong in 2019 will continue to be clouded by the external uncertainties including brexit and the sino u s trade tension said samuel tse an economist at dbs bank we expect gdp will grow by 2 5 percent in 2019 ratings agency moody s forecast quarterly growth of 0 3 percent up a tick from a 0 1 percent expansion recorded in the third quarter economic growth data is expected to be announced during the government s budget around 11 00 a m 0300 gmt on wednesday chan is widely forecast to offer tax rebates and property rate waivers in the annual budget with supportive initiatives also forecast for businesses in particular small and medium sized enterprises the government is also expected to throw its weight behind the guangdong hong kong macau greater bay area economic zone for which beijing unveiled a blueprint last week and help innovative and creative industries trade war hong kong s trade reliant economy is vulnerable to simmering trade tensions between the world s two largest economies and if unresolved they pose broader risks to the city this year as one of the most open and free economies in the world hong kong s growth is also highly reliant on capital trade tourist and investment flows from china trade and logistics remain one of the pillars of hong kong s economy and account for nearly one fifth of its gdp higher than the financial sector more than 700 000 people are employed in the trade and logistics sector the trade war is taking a toll at a time when the former british colony is already grappling with its weakest retail sales growth in 18 months while visitor spending has been hit by a weaker chinese yuan which makes hong kong more expensive for mainland tourists analysts expect the recent launch of major infrastructure projects linking china and hong kong such as a high speed railway in addition to a slower pace of rate hikes and a stronger stock market to provide some support going forward the hong kong dollar is pegged to the greenback which means the city s de facto central bank is obliged to track u s interest rate moves more than 65 million people or nine times the city s population visited hong kong in 2018 up 11 percent from the previous year of those 51 million were from mainland china retailers in the financial hub are already feeling the chill from the weakest economic growth in china in nearly three decades with the u s china trade war and yuan depreciation also taking a toll a weaker property market has weighed on consumer sentiment although the outlook for the world s least affordable real estate market has started to firm this year source reuters additional reporting by twinnie siu editing by jacqueline wong

with that it s now my pleasure to introduce wolfgang wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director thank you karen good morning everyone i will start on slide 3 2018 has certainly been a very busy and exciting year for our helios associates around the globe over the past two years we have made considerable progress as we are executing the vision 2025 strategic plan that we laid out to you at the end of 2016 i will start with summarizing our financial results we achieved 2018 sales of 508 million that reflects almost a 50 increase over 2017 and is about 2 5 times more than 2016 in addition to acquisition growth during this period we have also been experiencing significant organic growth 11 was realized in 2018 after an amazing 21 organic growth rate in 2017 turning to the bottom line on a non gaap basis we realized 1 74 per share in 2018 up 9 from 2017 and almost double the 0 93 per share we reported for 2016 that excludes acquisition related and other one time type items but it does include amortization expense consistent with how we have been reporting non gaap eps for years as a heads up beginning in 2019 we plan to start reporting our non gaap net income and eps on a normalized cash basis excluding our acquisition related amortization expense we ll talk more about that shortly we are generally pleased with our operating margins for the year but recognize that we have room for improvement which i will touch on later in this presentation our 2018 adjusted operating margin was 21 4 and adjusted ebitda margin was 24 5 these reflect a modest erosion compared with our 2017 results at a 110 basis points and 90 basis points respectively however those metrics reflect improvement over our 2016 results finally i want to point out that as we expected we generated strong cash flow in the fourth quarter this allowed us to reduce our net debt by nearly 20 million and finish the year at our target levels of 15 operating cash flow to sales and 10 free cash flow to sales additionally we made significant progress toward our leverage goal of less than 2 times ebitda we finished the year at 2 4 times please turn to slide 4 and i ll summarize the key milestones we achieved in 2018 from a business perspective we reflect back on the year as one in which we diversified significantly from expanding our end markets to product breadth to global footprint to customer base allow me to summarize 2018 about a year ago we raised capital in the equity markets and then we amended our bank credit facility this additional capital financed our acquisition of faster and provides for further growth faster was a strategic and transformational acquisition providing us with a solid manufacturing footprint in europe from which to expand our european presence in accordance with our in the region for the region philosophy along with a very innovative culture it brought us a global and market leading family of quick release couplings strong relationships with new oems and solid penetration in the agriculture market which is very important to us since that time our teams have been diligently working on the synergies we identified targeting at least 7 5 million of incremental ebitda by 2022 mostly driven by sales opportunities also in april of 2018 we began our cvt manufacturing consolidation project in sarasota in applying our lean enterprise principles we have been diligently moving production lines among our three facilities in sarasota to consolidate our manufacturing into our two adjacent plants we expect to complete this part of the project by the end of next month over the course of the year as we fine tune our newly organized production line we expect our productivity to improve and free up about 15 of additional capacity in the next phase of this project which we expect to complete by the end of 2019 we are establishing a center of excellence in our third sarasota facility which is about two miles from the other two it will house our hydraulic research and testing activities for the americas region as well as certain administrative and operating activities during the second half of 2018 we announced our new business name as helios technologies this was strategically important to us as we maintain sun hydraulics as the operating name for one of our businesses complemented by our other operating businesses enovation controls and faster at nearly the same time we announced our acquisition of custom fluidpower or cfp this was not significant in terms of size relative to helios but it is very significant in terms of its strategic importance to us cfp is an innovative hydraulic integrator with eight locations based in australia prior to closing on the acquisition we referred to this project as stepping stone since we viewed it as exactly that a stepping stone for us in the southeast asia region a base from which to build our other businesses since it s acquisition we have been diligently working on the synergies we identified targeting at least 2 million of incremental ebitda by 2022 mostly driven by sales opportunities at about the same time in august 2018 we started production at our new state of the art facility in south korea serving our cvt business from purchasing the land to getting it up and running we completed this project in just 11 months we previously leased space nearby but this new own facility provides us with about 4 5 times more square footage from which to service the fast growing asia pacific region in addition to the achievements of these specific milestones our associates were very busy with many other projects during 2018 a key one which is very broad and encompasses several teams of different people is focusing on realizing the synergies from the acquisition in addition to faster and cfp which i already mentioned we have been working hard on the synergies from our enovation controls acquisition which we have targeted to achieve at least 5 million of incremental ebitda by 2020 on a day to day basis we have also been focused on productivity improvement and our progress is evident particularly in the second half of the year at the same time we have continued to work on our organic growth initiatives including penetrating geographic white spot identifying new sales opportunities in the field and introducing new products to be responsive to market trend all of these actions are in alignment with our vision 2025 plan which we announced back in late 2016 to achieve global technology leadership in the industrial goods sector with critical mass exceeding 1 billion in sales while maintaining superior profitability and financial strength with that overview i will now turn the call over to tricia to review the financial results for the quarter and full year in a bit more detail tricia l fulton chief financial officer thank you wolfgang and good morning everyone let s begin on slide 6 with a review of our fourth quarter consolidated results sales were up 65 compared with last year s quarter faster contributed 36 million cfp contributed 11 9 million and our organic business sales grew 8 foreign currency had a 400 000 unfavorable impact on consolidated sales for our organic businesses faster and cfp sales were also unfavorably impacted by the decline in the euro and australian dollar resulting in 2 6 million of lower sales compared with their pre acquisition exchange rate i ll now touch on sales by region which are designated here in the sales bar chart on the left there is a table in the back of the press release as well as the supplemental slides summarizing this information as you can see all geographic markets realized considerable year over year growth with the addition of faster and cfp the emea and apac regions are now larger contributors to our sales base sales to the americas emea and apac regions were 49 27 and 24 of the consolidated total respectively last year this was 56 22 and 22 to the americas emea and apac respectively regarding profitability our consolidated adjusted ebitda of 32 4 million was almost double last year s fourth quarter turning to the bottom line adjusted earnings per share were 0 41 more than 50 higher than last year s fourth quarter that comparison is impacted by a few factors i d like to point out first the average number of shares outstanding in the 2018 fourth quarter was 4 9 million higher than last year primarily due to our equity offering in the first quarter second we have more expense from amortization of intangibles as well as interest on new debt resulting from our acquired businesses this year s quarter includes 0 14 and 0 11 per share for amortization and interest expense respectively compared with 0 05 and 0 03 per share for amortization and interest expense respectively in last year s fourth quarter together these two acquisition related items had a 0 17 impact on the fourth quarter comparison on both the gaap and non gaap basis as wolfgang mentioned i want to reiterate that beginning in 2019 we plan to report our non gaap eps on a normalized cash basis so we will be adding the amortization back for that purpose i d now like to bring to your attention the items that impacted our consolidated results and that we added back for purposes of reporting adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps shown here please refer to the tables in the back of the press release or slides for reconciliations of gaap and non gaap numbers during the fourth quarter of 2018 we incurred the following first a 776 000 reduction in amortization of inventory step up costs resulting from a revision to the purchase accounting for faster as we finalized the valuation of intangible assets this was in cost of goods sold next we incurred about 90 000 of acquisition related costs and selling engineering and administrative or sea expenses next we recorded a charge of about 554 000 for contingent consideration associated with the enovation controls acquisition reported on its own line in the income statement finally we had some favorable tax item specifically 1 4 million related to the impact of tax reform and 1 9 million for other discrete items for consistency we added those back for purposes of calculating our adjusted net income and eps please turn to slide 7 for a review of our hydraulics segment fourth quarter operating results consistent with prior periods i want to point out that acquisition related costs including amortization are not included in these segment numbers they are accumulated in our corporate and other segment reported on the tables in the back of the earnings release and slides sales for the hydraulics segment grew 89 we saw 73 113 and 89 year over year growth for the quarter in the americas region emea and apac those growth numbers benefited from the addition of faster and cfp on an organic basis we realized 8 growth which was driven by increased market demand in most geographies and end markets and was also positively impacted by global sales and marketing initiatives orders continued to outpace revenue and our growth could have been even higher except that it was dampened by disruption from our cvt manufacturing consolidation project while gross profit increased by 87 on the higher sales including the addition of faster and cfp the quarter was unfavorably impacted by higher outbound freight to satisfy customer demand faster s shutdown over the december holidays and the impact of the cfp s integrator business model performance by our legacy cvt business was strong hydraulics segment operating income nearly doubled our selling engineering and administrative expenses or sea included 7 1 million for the faster and cfp businesses and we effectively managed the sea expense as far as sun business please turn to slide 8 for a review of our electronics segment fourth quarter operating results revenue was up 8 compared to fourth quarter of last year this was impacted by the timing of project revenue some of which shifted into the fourth quarter from the third gross profit for the segment increased significantly to 45 7 of sales favorable productivity project mix and operational efficiency drove the growth we as we recovered from cost pressures realized earlier in the year operating income in the fourth quarter grew from a loss last year s fourth quarter to 18 7 of sales this year in addition to the gross margin improvement sea expenses decreased by about 1 million this was primarily due to the restructuring costs included in last year s quarter please turn to slide 9 for a review of full year consolidated results sales of 508 million were up 48 over 2017 acquisitions contributed 126 8 million and our organic businesses grew 11 regarding profitability our consolidated adjusted ebitda grew 43 while the margin declined slightly the erosion resulted primarily from higher outbound freight costs to meet customer demand inefficiencies during the cvt manufacturing consolidation project and the impact of the cfp integrator business model turning to the bottom line adjusted earnings per share were 1 74 but like the quarter are impacted by a few factors when comparing to the prior year given our acquisition strategy first the average number of shares outstanding in 2018 was 4 3 million higher than last year primarily due to our equity offering in the first quarter of 2018 second 2018 includes 0 56 and 0 33 per share for amortization and interest expense respectively compared with 0 21 and 0 09 per share for amortization and interest expense respectively in last year s period together these two acquisition related items had a 0 59 impact on the full year eps comparison on both the gaap and non gaap basis please turn to slide 10 for a full year review of the hydraulics segment sales of 381 8 million were up 66 over last year gross profit increased by 55 and operating income increased 53 now please turn to slide 11 for a full year review of the electronics segment sales were up 13 over 2017 gross profit increased by 19 and operating income increased 40 please turn to slide 12 for a review of our cash flow and capitalization in 2018 we generated 77 5 million of cash from operating activities 57 more than in 2017 with the increase driven by higher earnings our capex was 28 4 million including the cost to complete our new production facility in south korea the addition of the faster business and costs associated with our cvt consolidation project as well as other productivity investments in 2018 we are pleased to meet our ongoing cash flow targets of 15 operating cash flow to sales and 10 free cash flow to sales regarding capitalization we finished the year with about 23 million of cash 353 million of debt and 531 million of equity strong cash flow in our fourth quarter allowed us to reduce our net debt by nearly 20 million in the quarter we finished the year with our net debt to pro forma adjusted ebitda of 2 4 times with our strong cash flow profile we are focused on getting that down to below 2 times wolfgang i d like to turn it back to you for your perspective on outlook and our 2019 guidance before we open the lines for q a wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director thanks tricia please turn to slide 14 as we have been expecting the leading us indicators that are important to helios signals slowing growth in 2019 with accelerating growth to resume in 2020 around the world nearly all major global economies are already in the slowing growth phase of the business cycle economic forecast that we follow point to a mild recession in western europe in 2019 returning to growth in 2020 important to note as we have said before in accordance with our vision 2025 plan we expect to outpace macroeconomic growth this is being driven by the investments we have been making to expand our coverage in the field increasing and broadening relationships with oems penetrating regions where we have white space and continuing to introduce new and innovative products and solutions further we are much more diversified by end market than the legacy business was and we expect these factors to help us successfully weather economic cycles please turn to slide 15 for our thoughts regarding our outlook for healios in 2019 referring to our hydraulics segment keep in mind that the timing of our 2018 acquisitions will impact our expectations for 2019 specifically our first quarter will include acquisition growth from both faster and cfp recall that faster will anniversary on april 5th then our second quarter and part of our third quarter will include acquisition growth for cfp which will anniversary on august 1st most of the end markets for all of our businesses are continuing to grow although at a slower pace but we have started to see some softening in the ag market as we indicated last quarter and the oil and gas sector regarding operating profitability we are very encouraged about the results we re seeing from actions taken to improve production flow at our facilities as well as manage our fixed costs as previously indicated we expect to complete our sarasota manufacturing consolidation project over the next month we are already seeing better workflow in those operations and expect that will continue to improve as we progress through the year turning to our electronics segment we are cautious about expected demand given the timing of customer s new model launches affecting that sector but we are focused on opportunities and synergies as well as continuously improving production flow on a consolidated basis regarding quarterly cadence we are currently expecting performance to be evenly spread throughout the year however we expect the hydraulics segment to have a stronger start to the year and the electronics segment to be a bit stronger in the second and third quarters based on timing of product launches i m pleased to report that we are accelerating our new china manufacturing facility project this will provide us with needed capacity to service that region by all of our businesses we expect to begin production later this year lastly i want to highlight that we are continuing to aggressively invest in innovative manufacturing technologies and market leading new products these projects are driving our growth that is outpacing the market as well as ongoing productivity improvements that are allowing us to service our growing customer base around the globe please proceed to slide 16 where we ve provided our guidance for 2019 compared with our actual results for 2018 you will notice that we have simplified the items that we are guiding on for 2019 we are focusing on absorbing the businesses that we acquired over the past couple of years that have transformed helios as we advance along the strategic journey we are expecting consolidated revenue of 590 million to 600 million growth of 16 to 18 driven by both of our segments on a consolidated basis this includes organic growth of 2 to 4 we re expecting 21 to 23 revenue growth in our hydraulics segment and a flat to 4 revenue growth in our electronics segment we are expecting gaap eps of between 2 10 and 2 20 reflecting about a 41 to 48 growth over 2018 and as tricia and i mentioned earlier we are introducing a new non gaap metric cash eps for 2019 without visibility of one time items the only predictable difference between gaap and non gaap cash eps will be amortization expense on a tax effective basis we are currently expecting between 2 55 and 2 65 of cash eps in 2019 up about 11 to 15 over 2018 we ve provided a calculation of 2018 cash eps for your convenience in the supplemental sections of our release and slides we are currently expecting an adjusted ebitda margin of 24 5 to 25 5 at the midpoint that represents a 50 basis point expansion over 2018 now let s open the lines for q a questions and answers operator operator instructions the first question is from nathan jones stifel please go ahead nathan jones stifel financial corp analyst good morning everyone tricia l fulton chief financial officer good morning wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director good morning nathan nathan jones stifel financial corp analyst just a housekeeping one on the gaap and non gaap eps i think you said this wolfgang is the only difference in there currently your expectations of amortization of intangibles any restructuring expense that you re anticipating in 2019 tricia l fulton chief financial officer no it s just the amortization of intangibles at this point we aren t anticipating anything else in the numbers that were provided nathan jones stifel financial corp analyst okay thanks and i guess then probably the first question is going to be on price cost i know you guys had a lot of inflation you had to deal with in 2018 and some places where you could pass it through some places where you couldn t pass it through particularly in enovation controls i think maybe you could talk about where you stand at the moment how you think you can improve that price cost dynamic through 2019 wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director yeah sure nathan as you know from previous calls and conversation we basically secured the majority of the purchases through lta at least on through long term agreements on the hydraulics side of the business after seeing obviously significant cost increases there particularly in the first half of last year as you also know we have had price increases in all of our businesses that were introduced at different points in time in 2018 i think it s fair to say on the legacy business so on the sun business we have made very good progress with regard of getting the price increases through with regard to the enovation business the majority of the business there is in the meantime obviously oem driven and as we pointed out also on numerous occasions obviously it s very difficult to impose price increases if there is not basically a snapshot in time where we have new product launches overall i think i have to say everything we have seen in the fourth quarter is pretty much in line with what we projected mid year when we had the ltas in place and when we launched the price increases across the business the different businesses nathan jones stifel financial corp analyst maybe you can talk a little bit about on the enovation side how successful you ve been on shifting customers to new products as you ve gone through 18 maybe the anticipation of doing that in 19 because i understand that s where you can get those pricing increases through on the oem side wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director absolutely i mean as you know we have about i would say 10 major product launches every single year on the enovation side major product launches and that obviously provides the opportunity also to rediscuss the pricing levels the team has been to your question has been very successful in shifting customers over to new products and new solutions you know with that very strong engineering approach we have pretty much coming in and suggesting modifications and upgrades to the oem customers on an ongoing basis that is one of the true strength i think of enovation controls so we have been pretty successful there and i m very hopeful that we ll continue as we move forward from here nathan jones stifel financial corp analyst is it possible to quantify that at all like you ve moved 25 of customers or 75 of customers or anything like that wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director it s relatively difficult to quantify because you have to distinguish between modification you do on existing products and then you have new product launches as you know the product cycles are very short on the electronics side so i would hesitate to put a percentage on that that s an ongoing process happening in the daily in the daily business but new launches as i said are about 10 that are of significant size during the course of the year the rest i would classify more as modifications upgrades and so forth nathan jones stifel financial corp analyst okay thanks very much for the color i ll pass it on wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director you are welcome operator the next question is from brian drab william blair company please go ahead sir brian drab william blair company analyst good morning thanks for taking my questions i wanted to first ask on organic revenue growth expectations i may have missed it if you gave that number but first of all you didn t ph provide organic forecast for 2019 for the segments did you tricia l fulton chief financial officer no we did not provide organic guidance there we re focused on the consolidated business and looking at that in the 2 to 4 guidance that we provided there and we did give overall guidance for each segment as well but we are not guiding to organic brian drab william blair company analyst sorry what was 2 to 4 tricia tricia l fulton chief financial officer 2 to 4 is consolidated sales growth in 19 the 290 million sic to 600 million represents 2 to 4 brian drab william blair company analyst okay and that s organic you re saying is that right tricia l fulton chief financial officer yes wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director that is organic growth yes brian drab william blair company analyst okay i got it okay i was just doing some math but i guess i don t needed to do here but so does that assume about 1 point to 2 point headwind from fx tricia l fulton chief financial officer yeah that s probably fair and we are seeing most of that from the euro for the faster business brian drab william blair company analyst right ok okay great and then you mentioned wolfgang a stronger start in the hydraulics business in the first half of 19 does that have something to do some pent up demand maybe these orders are stacking up between the facility move or can you talk a little bit more why we got off to that stronger start wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director yeah we are seeing obviously i mean i wouldn t say just because of the facility move but obviously coming out of having a lot of good tailwind actually all through 2018 we are seeing of course higher backlog numbers that we can work off and now obviously with the facility consolidation here progressing well and as expected we are in good position to increase output relatively quick in the first half of the year the reason why i emphasize the first half of the year brian is we have good visibility for the first half of the year i think across all businesses it s fair to say that visibility for the second half of the year is not truly representative i think we would give forecast and projections but we cannot underline with very fundamental data there is too many moving pieces i think in the macroeconomic environment right now brian drab william blair company analyst okay thanks and then maybe just one more for now the faster business if you looked at that on a stand alone basis and just kind of the health of that business given i know you have some challenging end market in the ag would that business be in your forecast sort of expecting it to be up in 2019 versus 2018 wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director yeah absolutely and don t forget brian i mean only 65 of that business is exposed to the ag market we are still seeing strong development in construction equipment and in all the other industrial sectors as a matter of fact we are trying to take advantage of the opportunity and reallocating resources to look more at construction equipment and the industrial sectors last but not least also maybe generating synergies here in collaboration with sun and enovation brian drab william blair company analyst okay thank you i will follow up later wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director thank you operator now i have a question from mr jeff hammond keybanc please go ahead mr hammond brad keybanc capital markets analyst hey good morning this is brad ph on for jeff just on the cvt project could you give us some color to the extent to which that was a drag on the fourth quarter it sounds like that continued to progress from levels in 3q but how much of a drag was that on fourth quarter then how much of that lingering kind of headwind stays with us until 1q then once the project completes in the back half of the year wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director sure brad so first of all things have progressed exactly as we told you already in the q2 and q3 earnings release last year so if i had to quantify the drag to come to your specific question in q4 i would probably say it s between 5 and 10 of output that was impacted in q4 now as we are progressing and pretty much the move is completed at the end of this week already as far as the maneuvering of machinery and equipment is concerned we then have to do streamlining during the month of march and then basically can finalize that project at the end of march so as we moved to the first quarter obviously we are reducing that 5 to 10 deficit that i referred to for q4 gradually so i am hopeful then that by q2 we are still on a level playing field where we can reap the benefit of a more streamlined manufacturing and the increase of capacity brad keybanc capital markets analyst okay that s helpful then along those same lines if i look at the margin guide that seems like there is quite a few headwinds in 2018 primarily on the hydraulics side and the majority of those lessen or go away altogether in 2019 so i guess and then if you layer on some productivity upside once the project completes i guess can you talk about the upside to margins that might exist in hydraulics and maybe some of the gaining factors that are out there as well wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director yeah i mean i would caution you a little bit on the upside potential because i want to make sure that the expectations are not too high as i pointed out earlier so we had three price increases last year we re obviously monitoring the situation right now but we are not planning an imminent price increase at this point in time but from a pricing level we ll probably not do anything for the next few months or so as far as productivity and efficiency is concerned as i said the site consolidation project is completed we ll ramp up the capacity we ll streamline everything and should see a positive impact there we are doing pretty much the same on the faster side as well so i want to make sure that we are not talking only about sun hydraulics here and streamlining of manufacturing here in sarasota i mean we have a number of ongoing projects in place on the faster side of the business to further streamline manufacturing become more efficient more efficient there brad keybanc capital markets analyst okay thanks for the color i will pass it on wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director thanks operator next question is from mig dobre robert w baird co please go ahead sir mircea dobre robert w baird co analyst it s robert w baird good morning everyone how are you wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director good morning mig tricia l fulton chief financial officer good morning mig mircea dobre robert w baird co analyst i want to clarify something perhaps i missed this but in terms of d a should we expect any changes in 19 versus 18 where i m going with this i m looking to confirm that the margin expansion here is on ebitda is kind of a core operating type tricia l fulton chief financial officer yes so on the amortization side amortization for 19 will be lower than it was in 18 some of the items that come through come through on the intangibles for amortization are short lived like backlog so we ended the year at 23 3 million we re looking at amortization of probably 17 million to 19 million for 2019 and on the depreciation side with the addition of faster and cfp for more of the year as well as the assets that are put in place well we do expect an increase in depreciation over 18 as well we ended the year at 16 5 million and we re looking somewhere between 22 million to 24 million mircea dobre robert w baird co analyst okay that s helpful thank you for that and then also sticking with minutiae ph here do you have a view on the tax rate for 2019 and also kind of looking to confirm how you re thinking about free cash flow tricia l fulton chief financial officer yes so we ended the year with an effective tax rate of 17 as we noted in our prepared remarks there were some one time impacts in there but we also do get the benefit of the new us tax laws so our rate going forward we expect to be somewhere between 20 and 22 for 19 and beyond and you had a question on how we view free cash flow so i mean we still are looking at our target of free cash flow of 10 of sales and that s even given the significant capex that we re expecting in 19 mircea dobre robert w baird co analyst okay that s helpful and then maybe going back to margin and i think previous person tried to get at this so when you re looking at your 50 basis point midpoint guidance for expansion that is how do you think this flows at segment level do you essentially bake in similar expansion for both electronics and hydraulics or it s one potentially benefiting more than the other wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director no i mean we don t necessarily look at it like that mig first of all the margin levels as you know from a gross margin perspective are higher on the electronics side to begin with mircea dobre robert w baird co analyst yeah but i am talking about the year over year change here right i mean you re talking about margin improvement and i m trying to figure out where you see more of an impact if at all want that number to be up wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director it will be in both segments so there will be a positive contribution from both segments mircea dobre robert w baird co analyst but you cannot call out one versus the other based on either pricing dynamics or what you know you have in terms of efficiency so on and so forth i mean it strikes me for instance that you ve had a lot of headwinds in hydraulics some of which are getting resolved in 2019 so i would imagine for instance that you would have relatively good margin traction wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director in terms of fair assessment mig it s probably a little bit more contributed by the hydraulics segment my opening statement was referring to electronics where we have already absolutely superior gross margins there is not a lot of room to improve there the benefit on the hydraulics side is it then goes back to the site consolidation project in sarasota as you know i mean our business model is still fixed cost driven so the higher the utilization is the better it is we re creating more capacity through the lean manufacturing principles that we are applying that helps us actually to invest less in machinery and equipment we re just squeezing more out of the existing installed machine base and this coming back to your question will definitely contribute then to margin improvement tricia l fulton chief financial officer with the significant fixed cost in the hydraulics segment primarily related to capital i think we can leverage those costs a little bit more quickly than we can on the electronics side so as we start to see revenue increases i think the hydraulics segment does generate more margin more quickly mircea dobre robert w baird co analyst right and then going back to growth in hydraulics so if i heard you correctly you said that your book to bill has remained above 1 25 ph that essentially implies that you ve built some backlog of orders and i know that you ve built backlog of orders throughout 2018 so i guess i m trying to get a sense from you as to how this dynamic is playing out in terms of supporting growth maybe into 2019 can you maybe size the backlog or give us a sense for how it is now versus prior years and i m also looking to understand what role your disruption played in building this backlog and whether or not you know it s essentially this backlog conversion now that your facility consolidations have been essentially complete that drives this out growth in the front half that you mentioned earlier wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director you know the backlog i mean the backlog is elevated but it is not exceptionally high from a if i look at the actual numbers as such and as i answered already i think it was brad earlier on so the backlog is definitely elevated also to a certain degree because of the site consolidation project it started in april last year as you know we had very strong order intake in q2 q3 and q4 and i d quantify the impact in q4 for between 5 and 10 so that had an impact on backlog this is also the reason mig why we feel pretty comfortable for the first two quarters in 2019 what we are seeing so basically eating into that backlog and still continue to see solid orders order intake at the same time that s why we are more comfortable about the first half of the year on the hydraulics side compared to the second half of the year mircea dobre robert w baird co analyst okay i only have two questions left one on hydraulics again i if you quantified the fx earlier we kind of know what the acquisitions are contributing in terms of faster and cfp running the math here it seems to me like you re implying organic growth in hydraulics of roughly call it 4 please correct me if i m wrong but as i m looking at this 4 figure i m trying to understand how much of that is essentially volume driven versus left over from price increases it seems like about half of that would be related to price increases on a year over year basis do i have that correct or am i mistaken wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director i think you re probably in the ballpark with the numbers that you stated the only thing with regard to the price impact there it s higher on the legacy business as you know and that is certainly something to do because we work more through the channel compared to faster where we sell more through oems and price increases are more difficult to impose on customers but in general yeah i think yeah your numbers are in the ballpark mircea dobre robert w baird co analyst okay and then lastly your comment on quarterly cadence i m looking to make sure that i understand that as part of your slide 15 that quarterly cadence is essentially an eps comment right i mean that s how i took it rather than revenue comment tricia l fulton chief financial officer it is both i don t know that you can have one without the other necessarily so it was intended to cover revenue as well mircea dobre robert w baird co analyst okay all right thank you so much tricia l fulton chief financial officer yeah operator the next question is from charley brady suntrust please go ahead patrick wu suntrust robinson humphrey analyst good morning this is actually patrick ph who is standing in for charley thanks for taking my question tricia l fulton chief financial officer hi patrick wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director good morning patrick patrick wu suntrust robinson humphrey analyst can you provide a little bit more detail on the establishment of the china facility for electronics it sounds like you guys are expecting production to begin later this year when do you expect to sort of more full ramp production capabilities at that facility that s one and then what are the associated costs for the incremental costs related to the project in 2019 and i guess just generally what is your overall outlook in view of china at the moment wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director sure patrick so let me start with the last question first the overall outlook on china remains positive for us we have built a very strong team particularly on the legacy business over the last five to eight years we are seeing the benefit of that in the marketplace we have excellent channel partners in china they ve tremendously helped us to grow the business despite all the geopolitical turmoil we are very optimistic on china because we deal with lots of chinese companies that export their machinery and equipment and they will continue to do so and in order to be competitive on the global scale they need sophisticated and best in class components and solutions and that s why i m very positive about that now let me come to your question with regard to the facility we have planned to put this facility in place about two years ago at that point in time we were looking at 2021 probably 2022 i pointed out earlier on that we are accelerating the plans and we pretty much want to see products coming out of the facility already in q4 of 2019 this current year reason being that we obviously want to move out from the exposure that we have right now of just importing into china we don t want to be get exposed by the outcome of the tariff discussions at the end of the day in the context of our philosophy of building products and building of engineering competence in the region for the region we have decided to accelerate the project in stage one this is not the full scale manufacturing so in stage one we will do assembly and test so there will be still a lot of parts coming from outside of greater china then in phase two we obviously localize those parts and in phase three we want to go into full scale manufacturing the first point i wanted to make patrick that you were referring to this being an electronics manufacturing that s not the case this is first and foremost manufacturing for the hydraulics business and here in particular for the legacy business nevertheless this is at the end of the day a helios compound and we might pull in other businesses as well and embark on value add activities in china does it answer all your questions i think patrick wu suntrust robinson humphrey analyst yeah actually thanks for clearing that out so i guess it sounds like phase two and three that s obviously going to be a post 2019 event is that accurate to clarify that wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director yes that s correct and you still had a question i think on capex for this year so the capex exposure this year will be minimal because we re talking about we re leasing that facility so we are not basically building the facility on our own as we did in korea it s a leased facility and for the assemble and test the capex exposure is relatively minimal this year there will be a higher capex being applied in 2020 but this year it s immaterial looking at the overall capex number that we have for the helios group patrick wu suntrust robinson humphrey analyst got it and then can you provide a little bit more color on the oil and gas and i guess the ag softness that you re beginning to see and particularly in ag just wanted to see how that sort of implies for the faster margins which i think carries higher margins to begin with fully appreciating your earlier comment that you had to diversify more in the construction end market but it sounds like because of the oem relationship with that business pricing is a little bit harder to get through as well versus some legacy sun businesses well i just wanted to sort of get more color on oil and gas in ag and ag softness and how that might imply faster margins for 2019 wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director yeah let me start with oil and gas first so oil and gas exposure we have only in two of the businesses so that s sun and that is enovation that s the legacy business of enovation that came through the murphy brand actually and then on the sun business we have already reduced over the last three four years our exposure to oil and gas and mining at the time by diversifying into further ph segment so just on the outset i want to clarify that that our exposure to oil and gas is significantly less than it was about three or four years ago to begin with we are seeing softening in oil and gas for both for sun and enovation probably already since mid of last year and in the forecast and the assumptions we are making for the balance of this year we are not expecting a significant change there so we are we see a moderate business level and that s what we expected to be for the balance of the year in ag ag has been softening probably since the beginning of the fourth quarter already and that started to soften in europe at that point in time in the meantime i think the softening has expanded also a little bit to some of the other regions as well and faster if you were referring to the margin levels i also pointed out early on we have a lot of initiatives in place from a product from a manufacturing perspective to streamline things and drive more cost out of the system i m pretty confident that we have enough room there to protect the high margins level the high margin levels that we have seen historically also during the course of this year patrick wu suntrust robinson humphrey analyst okay thank you i appreciate it wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director welcome operator we have a question from mr josh pokrzywinski morgan stanley please go ahead sir breindy goldring morgan stanley analyst hi and this is breindy goldring on for josh i wanted to ask you about cash eps the move is understandable given the deal amortization but if i m looking back at the past few years the conversion has been on cash has been relatively low so how should we think about that cash conversion going forward changing from here tricia l fulton chief financial officer yes so i think that we we ve had pretty significant capex investment 17 18 and expected in 19 we historically have said that we think capex would be 4 to 5 of sales and we re above that for the last two years and we re projecting to be above that for 19 obviously those are investments that we need to make before we get back to the lower historical expected and expected level so i think that we are right now happy with the cash eps that we re able to generate and the free cash flow that we re able to generate at 10 of sales we think it s a good target for us to be able to pay down the cash or pay down the debt as quickly as possible to get below 2 times net debt to ebitda breindy goldring morgan stanley analyst okay thank you and then just looking at electronics you mentioned that project timing was a big driver there so can you provide any more color on that was any of that pull forward and then i guess just more broadly if you saw any inventory movement from customers ahead of tariffs wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director let s start with the second question first we saw a little bit of inventory movement but i think it was at the end of the day pretty insignificant we actually see more inventory movement on the channel partner side because once you have expanded lead times then it s probably more influential than the tariff side as such with regard to your first question to the product launches i mean this is just a pure timing situation so if i pointed out we have the same amount of major launches pretty much every single year but this year these launches are pushed back a little bit so that s the only difference compared to last year i think the second factor that is coming into play here is we have been enovation has been highly successful as you know this business grew organically 50 in two years since we acquired and i think they were also highly successful because in the last two years they really generated a lot of additional pull through on equipment with their electronics solution that were in the beginning not even requested now we are continuing doing that but we cannot see the same growth rates every single year that we saw in 2017 and 2018 breindy goldring morgan stanley analyst okay got it that s helpful and then just looking at your 2025 vision you have pretty healthy growth rates all through 2025 so we re starting off this year at 2 to 4 growth which would require a lot of cash afterwards is are the ag and oil and gas markets slower than you expected where you were to try ph more catch up after that or is this or you already is this already baked into that 2025 vision that you would see this growth rate the first year wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director i mean this is an integral part of the 2025 vision if you look at the diversification of the end markets as i pointed out early on our dependency on oil and gas a couple of years ago was significant today this is kind of immaterial it still have an impact but it s immaterial because at the end of the day we have spread our four major clusters here industrial mobile agriculture and recreational markets and we think those clusters we have diversified a lot into individual sectors and i mean the business at the end of the day is cyclical but this is the diversification is the best way of dampening the impact if one of those sectors or end market is sluggish or even declining over a longer period of time breindy goldring morgan stanley analyst okay thank you that s helpful wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director you are welcome operator we have a final question from joe mondillo sidoti company please go ahead sir joseph mondillo sidoti company analyst hi good morning wolfgang and tricia wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director good morning joe tricia l fulton chief financial officer good morning joe joseph mondillo sidoti company analyst so i wanted to i m still having a little difficulty i m a little unclear on the gross margins especially at the hydraulics segment just because there has been so many moving pieces price cost and productivity was a big issue early in the year and i think that s improved throughout 2018 but then you ve acquired cfp and you still got what you re doing in sarasota so looking at sort of the fourth quarter sort of gross margin that hydraulics how can we sort of think about things going forward i m assuming that you re expecting some productivity improvement given once you complete the sarasota consolidation and then remind us how the seasonality sort of plays a role in the thing among the quarters tricia l fulton chief financial officer yeah so looking at the fourth quarter hydraulics gross margin there s a little bit of step up included in that to bring it down a little bit so we would should see higher gross margins than that for the hydraulics segment in 19 than what we just saw in q4 you re right that there were some challenges to the gross margins some of which the cvt price increase helped in the back half of the year and that we will actualize that throughout 2019 the addition of cfp with different business model is playing in a little bit to some margin changes in that segment but we do expect to have modest improvement in 2019 in actually in both segments at the gross profit level joseph mondillo sidoti company analyst and in terms of seasonality could you remind us if there is any i think at hydraulics the fourth quarter tends to fall off correct me if i m wrong about the seasonality there and then in terms of seasonality at electronics just wondering how to look at sort of that fourth quarter gross margin that you posted at electronics taking into account seasonality tricia l fulton chief financial officer yeah i mean we re trying to take out the segment s seasonality discussion by guiding to even consolidated quarters throughout the year there are some different things that play here we talked in our prepared remarks specifically about electronics having some ramp up of model year rollout in q2 and q3 this year that sort of changes the dynamic a little from last year so i think we d like to stay with the way we ve talked about it from a quarterly perspective of expecting consolidated results that are pretty evenly spread across the four quarters of 19 joseph mondillo sidoti company analyst okay and then just last question in terms of the geographical regions looking at sort of the construction market particularly if you look at caterpillar most recent january retail sales they re continuing to see pressure i think their declines are accelerating in asia markets europe sort of following and north america seems to be holding up could you just sort of give us your take on sort of the geographic your geographic market and how they re trending through i guess february or up until whatever date that you have wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director yeah sure so i think in general i think we can say that moderate growth is expected here to continue on a global basis if you break it down into the triad ph i would say probably the most concerning piece is europe right now and as you quite correctly said joe it s probably the strongest situation we are seeing here still in north america i think asia and here particular east asia we have to see how this will shake out we are still seeing quite solid tailwind at this stage particularly in the recent weeks and months so no reason for a concern at this stage in asia joseph mondillo sidoti company analyst okay sorry just a follow up on europe wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director europe is the weakest piece europe is the weakest piece and i think that would i mean that is applicable not just for construction machinery i think that s for industrial production i was just looking in preparation for today s call looking at some of the numbers again i mean if you look at total machinery production in europe it s pretty much expected to be flat and it could even be move into negative territory toward the second half of the year joseph mondillo sidoti company analyst okay all right thanks for taking my question wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director sure operator there are no further questions at this time i d like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director thanks for your interest in helios and for your participation this morning also i want to thank to all of the hardworking helios employees who are driving these results so we look forward to updating all of you on the first quarter 2019

costa rica staff concluding statement of the 2019 article iv mission a concluding statement describes the preliminary findings of imf staff at the end of an official staff visit or mission in most cases to a member country missions are undertaken as part of regular usually annual consultations under article iv of the imf s articles of agreement in the context of a request to use imf resources borrow from the imf as part of discussions of staff monitored programs or as part of other staff monitoring of economic developments the authorities have consented to the publication of this statement the views expressed in this statement are those of the imf staff and do not necessarily represent the views of the imf s executive board based on the preliminary findings of this mission staff will prepare a report that subject to management approval will be presented to the imf executive board for discussion and decision passage of the fiscal reform bill was a critical step to restoring fiscal sustainability given the difficult external environment and high near term fiscal financing needs full and timely implementation of the fiscal reform should be a central part of the policy mix to reduce near term financing needs and help debt fall faster further front loaded fiscal consolidation is recommended accompanied by measures to protect the poor other elements of the policy mix include keeping monetary policy data dependent while further increasing its transparency and maintaining exchange rate flexibility enhancing financial resilience and leveraging the oecd accession process to boost competitiveness and inclusive growth through structural reforms context 1 costa rica was buffeted by multiple shocks in 2018 which led to a moderation of growth and an increase in unemployment growth is estimated to have slowed to 2 7 percent in 2018 reflecting the impact of the public sector strike developments in nicaragua rising global interest rates and tighter domestic financial conditions and the uncertainty surrounding the fiscal reform in part because of this but also due to a sharp rise in the participation rate the unemployment rate increased to 12 percent in 2018q4 with the rate for youths crossing 30 percent 2 passage of the fiscal reform bill was a critical step but market reaction has been cautious and financing costs remain high a fiscal reform had been in the works for nearly two decades and passage of the bill in december 2018 involved seeing off a three month public sector strike shortly following passage however three rating agencies downgraded costa rica s sovereign credit rating and placed the country on a negative outlook citing continued worsening of debt dynamics and significant short term funding challenges local markets have started to normalize allowing the government to secure financing at longer maturities and swap some short term debt for longer maturity paper though at interest rates above 9 percent in u s dollars the embi spread also remains above 450 bps 3 the government recognizes the challenges and is planning a broad array of reforms to complement the fiscal package and stimulate growth the authorities are requesting legislative authorization to issue eurobonds and are also seeking financing from multilateral sources access to external financing would help ease pressure on local debt markets reduce financing costs and lengthen debt maturities moreover reforms regarding public employment tax exemptions and public administration are being planned to boost competitiveness and employment the government is working in a series of reforms some of which come under the oecd accession process in this context the establishment of a special committee in congress solely for legislation related to oecd accession is a welcome sign of political consensus regarding the importance of the process outlook and risks 4 growth is expected to remain subdued in the near term and gradually rise toward potential in the medium term fiscal consolidation and tight financial conditions are expected to keep growth moderate in 2019 20 around 2¾ 3 percent notwithstanding a pickup in public investment base effects associated with the 2018 public sector strike and improving terms of trade in the medium term positive confidence effects and progress with structural reforms including those related to oecd accession should lower risk premia and boost investment pushing growth up towards 3½ percent inflation is expected to remain within the target range 5 growth risks are tilted to the downside key downside risks include partial implementation of the fiscal reform an escalation of global trade tensions and a sharp tightening of global financing conditions any of these if materialized could adversely affect costa rica via an abrupt deterioration in investor sentiment resulting in capital outflows pressure on the currency a sharp rise in interest rates and financing strains restoring fiscal sustainability 6 the fiscal reform constitutes a critical step towards restoring fiscal sustainability although full and timely implementation is key the reform which includes the conversion of the sales tax into a value added tax vat higher income taxes wage restraint and a fiscal rule that ties down the growth of spending is expected to yield savings of about 4 percent of gdp over 2018 23 it should also improve the progressivity of the tax system and likely reduce inequality 7 an additional front loaded adjustment of around ¾ percent of gdp is recommended to further reduce debt and near term financing pressures the fiscal reform should allow central government debt to peak at 61½ percent of gdp in 2023 and gradually decline thereafter however the government faces sizable financing needs in the near term this combined with the need to rebuild fiscal space to manage potential shocks and major contingent liabilities e g pensions presages the need for further front loaded fiscal measures to improve market confidence and reduce financing needs imf staff estimate that an additional adjustment of ¾ percent of gdp over 2019 20 would help debt decline faster and reach 50 percent of gdp by 2030 consistent with studies on sustainable levels of debt in emerging markets 8 given the fiscal reform is largely spending based and costa rica s tax to gdp ratio is relatively low further adjustment should be underpinned by well designed revenue measures while protecting the poor potential measures include increasing the vat rate from 13 to 15 percent closer to regional standards and the oecd average of 19 percent increasing property taxes given associated revenues are around half the latin american average as long as they can be allocated to the central government lowering the tax free threshold of personal income tax pit which is currently about twice the average wage reducing tax progressivity increasing excise taxes on selected goods and services taxing the profits of the cooperatives 9 the authorities should build on recent measures to further improve public spending efficiency debt management and the institutional framework which would allow fiscal policy to better contribute to growth and equity improving the efficiency and quality of public spending the fiscal reform eliminated significant revenue earmarking thereby improving government control of the budget the low efficiency of public spending in certain areas e g education and social protection however suggests the need for performance based reforms imf staff welcome the planned rolling out of debit cards as a vehicle to channel cash transfers to low income households the mission recommends more effective targeting and coordination of social assistance programs to better protect the poor especially in the context of ongoing tax reforms streamlining public debt management the authorities have created an interinstitutional team to improve the coordination and the division of responsibility between different agents involved in debt management imf staff advise using only market based mechanisms as financing conditions improve strengthening price discovery and improving communication with markets introducing a multi year expenditure framework mtef and a fiscal council congress is in the process of passing a constitutional reform for an mtef and the authorities are taking steps to create a fiscal council an independent fiscal council could prevent possible conflicts between the ministry of finance and the comptroller general of the republic who have shared responsibility for the implementation of the fiscal rule and act as a watchdog in addition imf staff encourage the implementation of an mtef consistent with international best practice something which has proven to be an effective tool in oecd countries to control public expenditure over the medium term keeping monetary policy data dependent and enhancing transparency 10 the current monetary stance is appropriate and should remain data dependent the slightly accommodative stance is appropriate given the projected negative output gap and inflation persistently at the floor of the target range going forward monetary policy will need to remain data dependent and balance downside risks to inflation stemming from slower activity and upside risks to inflation arising from a sharp tightening of global financial conditions if growth disappoints space remains for increased monetary stimulus but room would be limited if this coincides with fiscal or financing concerns leading to a deterioration in investor sentiment capital outflows and pressure on the currency 11 significant progress has been made to enhance the inflation targeting framework imf staff welcome i the passage of the bill on delinking the designation of the president of the central bank from the political cycle and improving the clarity of dismissal rules and ii the increase in fx flexibility since september 2018 and limited use of fx intervention to addressing episodes of large exchange rate volatility transparency could be further improved by publishing the calendar of monetary policy meetings and their corresponding meeting minutes enhancing financial sector resilience 12 stress tests suggest the banking system is sufficiently well capitalized to absorb sizable shocks but it remains important to monitor and tackle financial vulnerabilities the latter are related to sizable fx lending to unhedged borrowers significant net foreign liabilities of banks sharply growing household borrowing and high sovereign exposure to further incentivize de dollarization staff recommend i reversing all the june 2018 measures that relaxed fx lending requirements ii introducing different reserve requirements in domestic and foreign currency iii imposing additional capital requirements contingent on the expansion of credit to unhedged borrowers and iv allowing private banks more competitive access to the domestic currency deposit market 13 imf staff welcome the government s planned push for financial sector reforms which are broadly in line with the 2018 fssr recommendations the planned reform on consolidated supervision provides sugef and conassif with essential supervisory tools strengthens fit and proper rules and includes legal protection for supervisors to carry out their duties staff encourage its rapid approval staff welcome the bccr s implementation of an emergency liquidity support mechanism and encourage further progress in establishing crisis management protocols rapid approval of the planned law establishing a deposit guarantee fund is important in addition staff recommend rolling back the blanket guarantee for deposits in state owned banks should be considered to promote a more level playing field for all banks boosting competitiveness and inclusiveness through structural reforms 14 structural reforms are still needed to boost competitiveness and inclusiveness and the authorities are developing an agenda in this regard costa rica ranks favorably in many business indicators and remains a regional leader in attracting fdi additional steps are still needed to improve competitiveness and reduce inequality imf staff welcome the government s plans to boost potential growth and the political consensus regarding the oecd accession process and underscore the importance of leveraging the latter to implement impactful structural reforms many of the plans still need to be turned into concrete policies and an assessment of their fiscal impact is still pending staff view promoting female labor force participation and addressing weaknesses in transport infrastructure as key priorities similarly staff support the oecd s recommendation to undertake an in depth review of key sectors e g electricity exempted from the competition law and measures to increase banking sector competition

commission these documents can be found at our website or at www sec gov i also want to point out that during today s call we will discuss some non gaap financial measures which we believe are useful

reconciliations of comparable gaap to non gaap measures in the tables that accompany today s earnings release as well as in the slides wolfgang will get started with summarizing key highlights for 2018 tricia will go through the details of our financial results for the quarter and the year and then we ll turn it back to wolfgang for his perspective on our outlook and 2019 guidance before we open up the line for questions and answers and with that it s now my pleasure to introduce wolfgang wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director thank you karen good morning everyone i will start on slide 3 2018 has certainly been a very busy and exciting year for our helios associates around the globe over the past two years we have made considerable progress as we are executing the vision 2025 strategic plan that we laid out to you at the end of 2016 i will start with summarizing our financial results we achieved 2018 sales of 508 million that reflects almost a 50 increase over 2017 and is about 2 5 times more than 2016 in addition to acquisition growth during this period we have also been experiencing significant organic growth 11 was realized in 2018 after an amazing 21 organic growth rate in 2017 turning to the bottom line on a non gaap basis we realized 1 74 per share in 2018 up 9 from 2017 and almost double the 0 93 per share we reported for 2016 that excludes acquisition related and other one time type items but it does include amortization expense consistent with how we have been reporting non gaap eps for years as a heads up beginning in 2019 we plan to start reporting our non gaap net income and eps on a normalized cash basis excluding our acquisition related amortization expense we ll talk more about that shortly we are generally pleased with our operating margins for the year but recognize that we have room for improvement which i will touch on later in this presentation our 2018 adjusted operating margin was 21 4 and adjusted ebitda margin was 24 5 these reflect a modest erosion compared with our 2017 results at a 110 basis points and 90 basis points respectively however those metrics reflect improvement over our 2016 results finally i want to point out that as we expected we generated strong cash flow in the fourth quarter this allowed us to reduce our net debt by nearly 20 million and finish the year at our target levels of 15 operating cash flow to sales and 10 free cash flow to sales additionally we made significant progress toward our leverage goal of less than 2 times ebitda we finished the year at 2 4 times please turn to slide 4 and i ll summarize the key milestones we achieved in 2018 from a business perspective we reflect back on the year as one in which we diversified significantly from expanding our end markets to product breadth to global footprint to customer base allow me to summarize 2018 about a year ago we raised capital in the equity markets and then we amended our bank credit facility this additional capital financed our acquisition of faster and provides for further growth faster was a strategic and transformational acquisition providing us with a solid manufacturing footprint in europe from which to expand our european presence in accordance with our in the region for the region philosophy along with a very innovative culture it brought us a global and market leading family of quick release couplings strong relationships with new oems and solid penetration in the agriculture market which is very important to us since that time our teams have been diligently working on the synergies we identified targeting at least 7 5 million of incremental ebitda by 2022 mostly driven by sales opportunities also in april of 2018 we began our cvt manufacturing consolidation project in sarasota in applying our lean enterprise principles we have been diligently moving production lines among our three facilities in sarasota to consolidate our manufacturing into our two adjacent plants we expect to complete this part of the project by the end of next month over the course of the year as we fine tune our newly organized production line we expect our productivity to improve and free up about 15 of additional capacity in the next phase of this project which we expect to complete by the end of 2019 we are establishing a center of excellence in our third sarasota facility which is about two miles from the other two it will house our hydraulic research and testing activities for the americas region as well as certain administrative and operating activities during the second half of 2018 we announced our new business name as helios technologies this was strategically important to us as we maintain sun hydraulics as the operating name for one of our businesses complemented by our other operating businesses enovation controls and faster at nearly the same time we announced our acquisition of custom fluidpower or cfp this was not significant in terms of size relative to helios but it is very significant in terms of its strategic importance to us cfp is an innovative hydraulic integrator with eight locations based in australia prior to closing on the acquisition we referred to this project as stepping stone since we viewed it as exactly that a stepping stone for us in the southeast asia region a base from which to build our other businesses since it s acquisition we have been diligently working on the synergies we identified targeting at least 2 million of incremental ebitda by 2022 mostly driven by sales opportunities at about the same time in august 2018 we started production at our new state of the art facility in south korea serving our cvt business from purchasing the land to getting it up and running we completed this project in just 11 months we previously leased space nearby but this new own facility provides us with about 4 5 times more square footage from which to service the fast growing asia pacific region in addition to the achievements of these specific milestones our associates were very busy with many other projects during 2018 a key one which is very broad and encompasses several teams of different people is focusing on realizing the synergies from the acquisition in addition to faster and cfp which i already mentioned we have been working hard on the synergies from our enovation controls acquisition which we have targeted to achieve at least 5 million of incremental ebitda by 2020 on a day to day basis we have also been focused on productivity improvement and our progress is evident particularly in the second half of the year at the same time we have continued to work on our organic growth initiatives including penetrating geographic white spot identifying new sales opportunities in the field and introducing new products to be responsive to market trend all of these actions are in alignment with our vision 2025 plan which we announced back in late 2016 to achieve global technology leadership in the industrial goods sector with critical mass exceeding 1 billion in sales while maintaining superior profitability and financial strength with that overview i will now turn the call over to tricia to review the financial results for the quarter and full year in a bit more detail tricia l fulton chief financial officer thank you wolfgang and good morning everyone let s begin on slide 6 with a review of our fourth quarter consolidated results sales were up 65 compared with last year s quarter faster contributed 36 million cfp contributed 11 9 million and our organic business sales grew 8 foreign currency had a 400 000 unfavorable impact on consolidated sales for our organic businesses faster and cfp sales were also unfavorably impacted by the decline in the euro and australian dollar resulting in 2 6 million of lower sales compared with their pre acquisition exchange rate i ll now touch on sales by region which are designated here in the sales bar chart on the left there is a table in the back of the press release as well as the supplemental slides summarizing this information as you can see all geographic markets realized considerable year over year growth with the addition of faster and cfp the emea and apac regions are now larger contributors to our sales base sales to the americas emea and apac regions were 49 27 and 24 of the consolidated total respectively last year this was 56 22 and 22 to the americas emea and apac respectively regarding profitability our consolidated adjusted ebitda of 32 4 million was almost double last year s fourth quarter turning to the bottom line adjusted earnings per share were 0 41 more than 50 higher than last year s fourth quarter that comparison is impacted by a few factors i d like to point out first the average number of shares outstanding in the 2018 fourth quarter was 4 9 million higher than last year primarily due to our equity offering in the first quarter second we have more expense from amortization of intangibles as well as interest on new debt resulting from our acquired businesses this year s quarter includes 0 14 and 0 11 per share for amortization and interest expense respectively compared with 0 05 and 0 03 per share for amortization and interest expense respectively in last year s fourth quarter together these two acquisition related items had a 0 17 impact on the fourth quarter comparison on both the gaap and non gaap basis as wolfgang mentioned i want to reiterate that beginning in 2019 we plan to report our non gaap eps on a normalized cash basis so we will be adding the amortization back for that purpose i d now like to bring to your attention the items that impacted our consolidated results and that we added back for purposes of reporting adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps shown here please refer to the tables in the back of the press release or slides for reconciliations of gaap and non gaap numbers during the fourth quarter of 2018 we incurred the following first a 776 000 reduction in amortization of inventory step up costs resulting from a revision to the purchase accounting for faster as we finalized the valuation of intangible assets this was in cost of goods sold next we incurred about 90 000 of acquisition related costs and selling engineering and administrative or sea expenses next we recorded a charge of about 554 000 for contingent consideration associated with the enovation controls acquisition reported on its own line in the income statement finally we had some favorable tax item specifically 1 4 million related to the impact of tax reform and 1 9 million for other discrete items for consistency we added those back for purposes of calculating our adjusted net income and eps please turn to slide 7 for a review of our hydraulics segment fourth quarter operating results consistent with prior periods i want to point out that acquisition related costs including amortization are not included in these segment numbers they are accumulated in our corporate and other segment reported on the tables in the back of the earnings release and slides sales for the hydraulics segment grew 89 we saw 73 113 and 89 year over year growth for the quarter in the americas region emea and apac those growth numbers benefited from the addition of faster and cfp on an organic basis we realized 8 growth which was driven by increased market demand in most geographies and end markets and was also positively impacted by global sales and marketing initiatives orders continued to outpace revenue and our growth could have been even higher except that it was dampened by disruption from our cvt manufacturing consolidation project while gross profit increased by 87 on the higher sales including the addition of faster and cfp the quarter was unfavorably impacted by higher outbound freight to satisfy customer demand faster s shutdown over the december holidays and the impact of the cfp s integrator business model performance by our legacy cvt business was strong hydraulics segment operating income nearly doubled our selling engineering and administrative expenses or sea included 7 1 million for the faster and cfp businesses and we effectively managed the sea expense as far as sun business please turn to slide 8 for a review of our electronics segment fourth quarter operating results revenue was up 8 compared to fourth quarter of last year this was impacted by the timing of project revenue some of which shifted into the fourth quarter from the third gross profit for the segment increased significantly to 45 7 of sales favorable productivity project mix and operational efficiency drove the growth we as we recovered from cost pressures realized earlier in the year operating income in the fourth quarter grew from a loss last year s fourth quarter to 18 7 of sales this year in addition to the gross margin improvement sea expenses decreased by about 1 million this was primarily due to the restructuring costs included in last year s quarter please turn to slide 9 for a review of full year consolidated results sales of 508 million were up 48 over 2017 acquisitions contributed 126 8 million and our organic businesses grew 11 regarding profitability our consolidated adjusted ebitda grew 43 while the margin declined slightly the erosion resulted primarily from higher outbound freight costs to meet customer demand inefficiencies during the cvt manufacturing consolidation project and the impact of the cfp integrator business model turning to the bottom line adjusted earnings per share were 1 74 but like the quarter are impacted by a few factors when comparing to the prior year given our acquisition strategy first the average number of shares outstanding in 2018 was 4 3 million higher than last year primarily due to our equity offering in the first quarter of 2018 second 2018 includes 0 56 and 0 33 per share for amortization and interest expense respectively compared with 0 21 and 0 09 per share for amortization and interest expense respectively in last year s period together these two acquisition related items had a 0 59 impact on the full year eps comparison on both the gaap and non gaap basis please turn to slide 10 for a full year review of the hydraulics segment sales of 381 8 million were up 66 over last year gross profit increased by 55 and operating income increased 53 now please turn to slide 11 for a full year review of the electronics segment sales were up 13 over 2017 gross profit increased by 19 and operating income increased 40 please turn to slide 12 for a review of our cash flow and capitalization in 2018 we generated 77 5 million of cash from operating activities 57 more than in 2017 with the increase driven by higher earnings our capex was 28 4 million including the cost to complete our new production facility in south korea the addition of the faster business and costs associated with our cvt consolidation project as well as other productivity investments in 2018 we are pleased to meet our ongoing cash flow targets of 15 operating cash flow to sales and 10 free cash flow to sales regarding capitalization we finished the year with about 23 million of cash 353 million of debt and 531 million of equity strong cash flow in our fourth quarter allowed us to reduce our net debt by nearly 20 million in the quarter we finished the year with our net debt to pro forma adjusted ebitda of 2 4 times with our strong cash flow profile we are focused on getting that down to below 2 times wolfgang i d like to turn it back to you for your perspective on outlook and our 2019 guidance before we open the lines for q a wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director thanks tricia please turn to slide 14 as we have been expecting the leading us indicators that are important to helios signals slowing growth in 2019 with accelerating growth to resume in 2020 around the world nearly all major global economies are already in the slowing growth phase of the business cycle economic forecast that we follow point to a mild recession in western europe in 2019 returning to growth in 2020 important to note as we have said before in accordance with our vision 2025 plan we expect to outpace macroeconomic growth this is being driven by the investments we have been making to expand our coverage in the field increasing and broadening relationships with oems penetrating regions where we have white space and continuing to introduce new and innovative products and solutions further we are much more diversified by end market than the legacy business was and we expect these factors to help us successfully weather economic cycles please turn to slide 15 for our thoughts regarding our outlook for healios in 2019 referring to our hydraulics segment keep in mind that the timing of our 2018 acquisitions will impact our expectations for 2019 specifically our first quarter will include acquisition growth from both faster and cfp recall that faster will anniversary on april 5th then our second quarter and part of our third quarter will include acquisition growth for cfp which will anniversary on august 1st most of the end markets for all of our businesses are continuing to grow although at a slower pace but we have started to see some softening in the ag market as we indicated last quarter and the oil and gas sector regarding operating profitability we are very encouraged about the results we re seeing from actions taken to improve production flow at our facilities as well as manage our fixed costs as previously indicated we expect to complete our sarasota manufacturing consolidation project over the next month we are already seeing better workflow in those operations and expect that will continue to improve as we progress through the year turning to our electronics segment we are cautious about expected demand given the timing of customer s new model launches affecting that sector but we are focused on opportunities and synergies as well as continuously improving production flow on a consolidated basis regarding quarterly cadence we are currently expecting performance to be evenly spread throughout the year however we expect the hydraulics segment to have a stronger start to the year and the electronics segment to be a bit stronger in the second and third quarters based on timing of product launches i m pleased to report that we are accelerating our new china manufacturing facility project this will provide us with needed capacity to service that region by all of our businesses we expect to begin production later this year lastly i want to highlight that we are continuing to aggressively invest in innovative manufacturing technologies and market leading new products these projects are driving our growth that is outpacing the market as well as ongoing productivity improvements that are allowing us to service our growing customer base around the globe please proceed to slide 16 where we ve provided our guidance for 2019 compared with our actual results for 2018 you will notice that we have simplified the items that we are guiding on for 2019 we are focusing on absorbing the businesses that we acquired over the past couple of years that have transformed helios as we advance along the strategic journey we are expecting consolidated revenue of 590 million to 600 million growth of 16 to 18 driven by both of our segments on a consolidated basis this includes organic growth of 2 to 4 we re expecting 21 to 23 revenue growth in our hydraulics segment and a flat to 4 revenue growth in our electronics segment we are expecting gaap eps of between 2 10 and 2 20 reflecting about a 41 to 48 growth over 2018 and as tricia and i mentioned earlier we are introducing a new non gaap metric cash eps for 2019 without visibility of one time items the only predictable difference between gaap and non gaap cash eps will be amortization expense on a tax effective basis we are currently expecting between 2 55 and 2 65 of cash eps in 2019 up about 11 to 15 over 2018 we ve provided a calculation of 2018 cash eps for your convenience in the supplemental sections of our release and slides we are currently expecting an adjusted ebitda margin of 24 5 to 25 5 at the midpoint that represents a 50 basis point expansion over 2018 now let s open the lines for q a questions and answers operator operator instructions the first question is from nathan jones stifel please go ahead nathan jones stifel financial corp analyst good morning everyone tricia l fulton chief financial officer good morning wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director good morning nathan nathan jones stifel financial corp analyst just a housekeeping one on the gaap and non gaap eps i think you said this wolfgang is the only difference in there currently your expectations of amortization of intangibles any restructuring expense that you re anticipating in 2019 tricia l fulton chief financial officer no it s just the amortization of intangibles at this point we aren t anticipating anything else in the numbers that were provided nathan jones stifel financial corp analyst okay thanks and i guess then probably the first question is going to be on price cost i know you guys had a lot of inflation you had to deal with in 2018 and some places where you could pass it through some places where you couldn t pass it through particularly in enovation controls i think maybe you could talk about where you stand at the moment how you think you can improve that price cost dynamic through 2019 wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director yeah sure nathan as you know from previous calls and conversation we basically secured the majority of the purchases through lta at least on through long term agreements on the hydraulics side of the business after seeing obviously significant cost increases there particularly in the first half of last year as you also know we have had price increases in all of our businesses that were introduced at different points in time in 2018 i think it s fair to say on the legacy business so on the sun business we have made very good progress with regard of getting the price increases through with regard to the enovation business the majority of the business there is in the meantime obviously oem driven and as we pointed out also on numerous occasions obviously it s very difficult to impose price increases if there is not basically a snapshot in time where we have new product launches overall i think i have to say everything we have seen in the fourth quarter is pretty much in line with what we projected mid year when we had the ltas in place and when we launched the price increases across the business the different businesses nathan jones stifel financial corp analyst maybe you can talk a little bit about on the enovation side how successful you ve been on shifting customers to new products as you ve gone through 18 maybe the anticipation of doing that in 19 because i understand that s where you can get those pricing increases through on the oem side wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director absolutely i mean as you know we have about i would say 10 major product launches every single year on the enovation side major product launches and that obviously provides the opportunity also to rediscuss the pricing levels the team has been to your question has been very successful in shifting customers over to new products and new solutions you know with that very strong engineering approach we have pretty much coming in and suggesting modifications and upgrades to the oem customers on an ongoing basis that is one of the true strength i think of enovation controls so we have been pretty successful there and i m very hopeful that we ll continue as we move forward from here nathan jones stifel financial corp analyst is it possible to quantify that at all like you ve moved 25 of customers or 75 of customers or anything like that wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director it s relatively difficult to quantify because you have to distinguish between modification you do on existing products and then you have new product launches as you know the product cycles are very short on the electronics side so i would hesitate to put a percentage on that that s an ongoing process happening in the daily in the daily business but new launches as i said are about 10 that are of significant size during the course of the year the rest i would classify more as modifications upgrades and so forth nathan jones stifel financial corp analyst okay thanks very much for the color i ll pass it on wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director you are welcome operator the next question is from brian drab william blair company please go ahead sir brian drab william blair company analyst good morning thanks for taking my questions i wanted to first ask on organic revenue growth expectations i may have missed it if you gave that number but first of all you didn t ph provide organic forecast for 2019 for the segments did you tricia l fulton chief financial officer no we did not provide organic guidance there we re focused on the consolidated business and looking at that in the 2 to 4 guidance that we provided there and we did give overall guidance for each segment as well but we are not guiding to organic brian drab william blair company analyst sorry what was 2 to 4 tricia tricia l fulton chief financial officer 2 to 4 is consolidated sales growth in 19 the 290 million sic to 600 million represents 2 to 4 brian drab william blair company analyst okay and that s organic you re saying is that right tricia l fulton chief financial officer yes wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director that is organic growth yes brian drab william blair company analyst okay i got it okay i was just doing some math but i guess i don t needed to do here but so does that assume about 1 point to 2 point headwind from fx tricia l fulton chief financial officer yeah that s probably fair and we are seeing most of that from the euro for the faster business brian drab william blair company analyst right ok okay great and then you mentioned wolfgang a stronger start in the hydraulics business in the first half of 19 does that have something to do some pent up demand maybe these orders are stacking up between the facility move or can you talk a little bit more why we got off to that stronger start wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director yeah we are seeing obviously i mean i wouldn t say just because of the facility move but obviously coming out of having a lot of good tailwind actually all through 2018 we are seeing of course higher backlog numbers that we can work off and now obviously with the facility consolidation here progressing well and as expected we are in good position to increase output relatively quick in the first half of the year the reason why i emphasize the first half of the year brian is we have good visibility for the first half of the year i think across all businesses it s fair to say that visibility for the second half of the year is not truly representative i think we would give forecast and projections but we cannot underline with very fundamental data there is too many moving pieces i think in the macroeconomic environment right now brian drab william blair company analyst okay thanks and then maybe just one more for now the faster business if you looked at that on a stand alone basis and just kind of the health of that business given i know you have some challenging end market in the ag would that business be in your forecast sort of expecting it to be up in 2019 versus 2018 wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director yeah absolutely and don t forget brian i mean only 65 of that business is exposed to the ag market we are still seeing strong development in construction equipment and in all the other industrial sectors as a matter of fact we are trying to take advantage of the opportunity and reallocating resources to look more at construction equipment and the industrial sectors last but not least also maybe generating synergies here in collaboration with sun and enovation brian drab william blair company analyst okay thank you i will follow up later wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director thank you operator now i have a question from mr jeff hammond keybanc please go ahead mr hammond brad keybanc capital markets analyst hey good morning this is brad ph on for jeff just on the cvt project could you give us some color to the extent to which that was a drag on the fourth quarter it sounds like that continued to progress from levels in 3q but how much of a drag was that on fourth quarter then how much of that lingering kind of headwind stays with us until 1q then once the project completes in the back half of the year wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director sure brad so first of all things have progressed exactly as we told you already in the q2 and q3 earnings release last year so if i had to quantify the drag to come to your specific question in q4 i would probably say it s between 5 and 10 of output that was impacted in q4 now as we are progressing and pretty much the move is completed at the end of this week already as far as the maneuvering of machinery and equipment is concerned we then have to do streamlining during the month of march and then basically can finalize that project at the end of march so as we moved to the first quarter obviously we are reducing that 5 to 10 deficit that i referred to for q4 gradually so i am hopeful then that by q2 we are still on a level playing field where we can reap the benefit of a more streamlined manufacturing and the increase of capacity brad keybanc capital markets analyst okay that s helpful then along those same lines if i look at the margin guide that seems like there is quite a few headwinds in 2018 primarily on the hydraulics side and the majority of those lessen or go away altogether in 2019 so i guess and then if you layer on some productivity upside once the project completes i guess can you talk about the upside to margins that might exist in hydraulics and maybe some of the gaining factors that are out there as well wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director yeah i mean i would caution you a little bit on the upside potential because i want to make sure that the expectations are not too high as i pointed out earlier so we had three price increases last year we re obviously monitoring the situation right now but we are not planning an imminent price increase at this point in time but from a pricing level we ll probably not do anything for the next few months or so as far as productivity and efficiency is concerned as i said the site consolidation project is completed we ll ramp up the capacity we ll streamline everything and should see a positive impact there we are doing pretty much the same on the faster side as well so i want to make sure that we are not talking only about sun hydraulics here and streamlining of manufacturing here in sarasota i mean we have a number of ongoing projects in place on the faster side of the business to further streamline manufacturing become more efficient more efficient there brad keybanc capital markets analyst okay thanks for the color i will pass it on wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director thanks operator next question is from mig dobre robert w baird co please go ahead sir mircea dobre robert w baird co analyst it s robert w baird good morning everyone how are you wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director good morning mig tricia l fulton chief financial officer good morning mig mircea dobre robert w baird co analyst i want to clarify something perhaps i missed this but in terms of d a should we expect any changes in 19 versus 18 where i m going with this i m looking to confirm that the margin expansion here is on ebitda is kind of a core operating type tricia l fulton chief financial officer yes so on the amortization side amortization for 19 will be lower than it was in 18 some of the items that come through come through on the intangibles for amortization are short lived like backlog so we ended the year at 23 3 million we re looking at amortization of probably 17 million to 19 million for 2019 and on the depreciation side with the addition of faster and cfp for more of the year as well as the assets that are put in place well we do expect an increase in depreciation over 18 as well we ended the year at 16 5 million and we re looking somewhere between 22 million to 24 million mircea dobre robert w baird co analyst okay that s helpful thank you for that and then also sticking with minutiae ph here do you have a view on the tax rate for 2019 and also kind of looking to confirm how you re thinking about free cash flow tricia l fulton chief financial officer yes so we ended the year with an effective tax rate of 17 as we noted in our prepared remarks there were some one time impacts in there but we also do get the benefit of the new us tax laws so our rate going forward we expect to be somewhere between 20 and 22 for 19 and beyond and you had a question on how we view free cash flow so i mean we still are looking at our target of free cash flow of 10 of sales and that s even given the significant capex that we re expecting in 19 mircea dobre robert w baird co analyst okay that s helpful and then maybe going back to margin and i think previous person tried to get at this so when you re looking at your 50 basis point midpoint guidance for expansion that is how do you think this flows at segment level do you essentially bake in similar expansion for both electronics and hydraulics or it s one potentially benefiting more than the other wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director no i mean we don t necessarily look at it like that mig first of all the margin levels as you know from a gross margin perspective are higher on the electronics side to begin with mircea dobre robert w baird co analyst yeah but i am talking about the year over year change here right i mean you re talking about margin improvement and i m trying to figure out where you see more of an impact if at all want that number to be up wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director it will be in both segments so there will be a positive contribution from both segments mircea dobre robert w baird co analyst but you cannot call out one versus the other based on either pricing dynamics or what you know you have in terms of efficiency so on and so forth i mean it strikes me for instance that you ve had a lot of headwinds in hydraulics some of which are getting resolved in 2019 so i would imagine for instance that you would have relatively good margin traction wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director in terms of fair assessment mig it s probably a little bit more contributed by the hydraulics segment my opening statement was referring to electronics where we have already absolutely superior gross margins there is not a lot of room to improve there the benefit on the hydraulics side is it then goes back to the site consolidation project in sarasota as you know i mean our business model is still fixed cost driven so the higher the utilization is the better it is we re creating more capacity through the lean manufacturing principles that we are applying that helps us actually to invest less in machinery and equipment we re just squeezing more out of the existing installed machine base and this coming back to your question will definitely contribute then to margin improvement tricia l fulton chief financial officer with the significant fixed cost in the hydraulics segment primarily related to capital i think we can leverage those costs a little bit more quickly than we can on the electronics side so as we start to see revenue increases i think the hydraulics segment does generate more margin more quickly mircea dobre robert w baird co analyst right and then going back to growth in hydraulics so if i heard you correctly you said that your book to bill has remained above 1 25 ph that essentially implies that you ve built some backlog of orders and i know that you ve built backlog of orders throughout 2018 so i guess i m trying to get a sense from you as to how this dynamic is playing out in terms of supporting growth maybe into 2019 can you maybe size the backlog or give us a sense for how it is now versus prior years and i m also looking to understand what role your disruption played in building this backlog and whether or not you know it s essentially this backlog conversion now that your facility consolidations have been essentially complete that drives this out growth in the front half that you mentioned earlier wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director you know the backlog i mean the backlog is elevated but it is not exceptionally high from a if i look at the actual numbers as such and as i answered already i think it was brad earlier on so the backlog is definitely elevated also to a certain degree because of the site consolidation project it started in april last year as you know we had very strong order intake in q2 q3 and q4 and i d quantify the impact in q4 for between 5 and 10 so that had an impact on backlog this is also the reason mig why we feel pretty comfortable for the first two quarters in 2019 what we are seeing so basically eating into that backlog and still continue to see solid orders order intake at the same time that s why we are more comfortable about the first half of the year on the hydraulics side compared to the second half of the year mircea dobre robert w baird co analyst okay i only have two questions left one on hydraulics again i if you quantified the fx earlier we kind of know what the acquisitions are contributing in terms of faster and cfp running the math here it seems to me like you re implying organic growth in hydraulics of roughly call it 4 please correct me if i m wrong but as i m looking at this 4 figure i m trying to understand how much of that is essentially volume driven versus left over from price increases it seems like about half of that would be related to price increases on a year over year basis do i have that correct or am i mistaken wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director i think you re probably in the ballpark with the numbers that you stated the only thing with regard to the price impact there it s higher on the legacy business as you know and that is certainly something to do because we work more through the channel compared to faster where we sell more through oems and price increases are more difficult to impose on customers but in general yeah i think yeah your numbers are in the ballpark mircea dobre robert w baird co analyst okay and then lastly your comment on quarterly cadence i m looking to make sure that i understand that as part of your slide 15 that quarterly cadence is essentially an eps comment right i mean that s how i took it rather than revenue comment tricia l fulton chief financial officer it is both i don t know that you can have one without the other necessarily so it was intended to cover revenue as well mircea dobre robert w baird co analyst okay all right thank you so much tricia l fulton chief financial officer yeah operator the next question is from charley brady suntrust please go ahead patrick wu suntrust robinson humphrey analyst good morning this is actually patrick ph who is standing in for charley thanks for taking my question tricia l fulton chief financial officer hi patrick wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director good morning patrick patrick wu suntrust robinson humphrey analyst can you provide a little bit more detail on the establishment of the china facility for electronics it sounds like you guys are expecting production to begin later this year when do you expect to sort of more full ramp production capabilities at that facility that s one and then what are the associated costs for the incremental costs related to the project in 2019 and i guess just generally what is your overall outlook in view of china at the moment wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director sure patrick so let me start with the last question first the overall outlook on china remains positive for us we have built a very strong team particularly on the legacy business over the last five to eight years we are seeing the benefit of that in the marketplace we have excellent channel partners in china they ve tremendously helped us to grow the business despite all the geopolitical turmoil we are very optimistic on china because we deal with lots of chinese companies that export their machinery and equipment and they will continue to do so and in order to be competitive on the global scale they need sophisticated and best in class components and solutions and that s why i m very positive about that now let me come to your question with regard to the facility we have planned to put this facility in place about two years ago at that point in time we were looking at 2021 probably 2022 i pointed out earlier on that we are accelerating the plans and we pretty much want to see products coming out of the facility already in q4 of 2019 this current year reason being that we obviously want to move out from the exposure that we have right now of just importing into china we don t want to be get exposed by the outcome of the tariff discussions at the end of the day in the context of our philosophy of building products and building of engineering competence in the region for the region we have decided to accelerate the project in stage one this is not the full scale manufacturing so in stage one we will do assembly and test so there will be still a lot of parts coming from outside of greater china then in phase two we obviously localize those parts and in phase three we want to go into full scale manufacturing the first point i wanted to make patrick that you were referring to this being an electronics manufacturing that s not the case this is first and foremost manufacturing for the hydraulics business and here in particular for the legacy business nevertheless this is at the end of the day a helios compound and we might pull in other businesses as well and embark on value add activities in china does it answer all your questions i think patrick wu suntrust robinson humphrey analyst yeah actually thanks for clearing that out so i guess it sounds like phase two and three that s obviously going to be a post 2019 event is that accurate to clarify that wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director yes that s correct and you still had a question i think on capex for this year so the capex exposure this year will be minimal because we re talking about we re leasing that facility so we are not basically building the facility on our own as we did in korea it s a leased facility and for the assemble and test the capex exposure is relatively minimal this year there will be a higher capex being applied in 2020 but this year it s immaterial looking at the overall capex number that we have for the helios group patrick wu suntrust robinson humphrey analyst got it and then can you provide a little bit more color on the oil and gas and i guess the ag softness that you re beginning to see and particularly in ag just wanted to see how that sort of implies for the faster margins which i think carries higher margins to begin with fully appreciating your earlier comment that you had to diversify more in the construction end market but it sounds like because of the oem relationship with that business pricing is a little bit harder to get through as well versus some legacy sun businesses well i just wanted to sort of get more color on oil and gas in ag and ag softness and how that might imply faster margins for 2019 wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director yeah let me start with oil and gas first so oil and gas exposure we have only in two of the businesses so that s sun and that is enovation that s the legacy business of enovation that came through the murphy brand actually and then on the sun business we have already reduced over the last three four years our exposure to oil and gas and mining at the time by diversifying into further ph segment so just on the outset i want to clarify that that our exposure to oil and gas is significantly less than it was about three or four years ago to begin with we are seeing softening in oil and gas for both for sun and enovation probably already since mid of last year and in the forecast and the assumptions we are making for the balance of this year we are not expecting a significant change there so we are we see a moderate business level and that s what we expected to be for the balance of the year in ag ag has been softening probably since the beginning of the fourth quarter already and that started to soften in europe at that point in time in the meantime i think the softening has expanded also a little bit to some of the other regions as well and faster if you were referring to the margin levels i also pointed out early on we have a lot of initiatives in place from a product from a manufacturing perspective to streamline things and drive more cost out of the system i m pretty confident that we have enough room there to protect the high margins level the high margin levels that we have seen historically also during the course of this year patrick wu suntrust robinson humphrey analyst okay thank you i appreciate it wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director welcome operator we have a question from mr josh pokrzywinski morgan stanley please go ahead sir breindy goldring morgan stanley analyst hi and this is breindy goldring on for josh i wanted to ask you about cash eps the move is understandable given the deal amortization but if i m looking back at the past few years the conversion has been on cash has been relatively low so how should we think about that cash conversion going forward changing from here tricia l fulton chief financial officer yes so i think that we we ve had pretty significant capex investment 17 18 and expected in 19 we historically have said that we think capex would be 4 to 5 of sales and we re above that for the last two years and we re projecting to be above that for 19 obviously those are investments that we need to make before we get back to the lower historical expected and expected level so i think that we are right now happy with the cash eps that we re able to generate and the free cash flow that we re able to generate at 10 of sales we think it s a good target for us to be able to pay down the cash or pay down the debt as quickly as possible to get below 2 times net debt to ebitda breindy goldring morgan stanley analyst okay thank you and then just looking at electronics you mentioned that project timing was a big driver there so can you provide any more color on that was any of that pull forward and then i guess just more broadly if you saw any inventory movement from customers ahead of tariffs wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director let s start with the second question first we saw a little bit of inventory movement but i think it was at the end of the day pretty insignificant we actually see more inventory movement on the channel partner side because once you have expanded lead times then it s probably more influential than the tariff side as such with regard to your first question to the product launches i mean this is just a pure timing situation so if i pointed out we have the same amount of major launches pretty much every single year but this year these launches are pushed back a little bit so that s the only difference compared to last year i think the second factor that is coming into play here is we have been enovation has been highly successful as you know this business grew organically 50 in two years since we acquired and i think they were also highly successful because in the last two years they really generated a lot of additional pull through on equipment with their electronics solution that were in the beginning not even requested now we are continuing doing that but we cannot see the same growth rates every single year that we saw in 2017 and 2018 breindy goldring morgan stanley analyst okay got it that s helpful and then just looking at your 2025 vision you have pretty healthy growth rates all through 2025 so we re starting off this year at 2 to 4 growth which would require a lot of cash afterwards is are the ag and oil and gas markets slower than you expected where you were to try ph more catch up after that or is this or you already is this already baked into that 2025 vision that you would see this growth rate the first year wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director i mean this is an integral part of the 2025 vision if you look at the diversification of the end markets as i pointed out early on our dependency on oil and gas a couple of years ago was significant today this is kind of immaterial it still have an impact but it s immaterial because at the end of the day we have spread our four major clusters here industrial mobile agriculture and recreational markets and we think those clusters we have diversified a lot into individual sectors and i mean the business at the end of the day is cyclical but this is the diversification is the best way of dampening the impact if one of those sectors or end market is sluggish or even declining over a longer period of time breindy goldring morgan stanley analyst okay thank you that s helpful wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director you are welcome operator we have a final question from joe mondillo sidoti company please go ahead sir joseph mondillo sidoti company analyst hi good morning wolfgang and tricia wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director good morning joe tricia l fulton chief financial officer good morning joe joseph mondillo sidoti company analyst so i wanted to i m still having a little difficulty i m a little unclear on the gross margins especially at the hydraulics segment just because there has been so many moving pieces price cost and productivity was a big issue early in the year and i think that s improved throughout 2018 but then you ve acquired cfp and you still got what you re doing in sarasota so looking at sort of the fourth quarter sort of gross margin that hydraulics how can we sort of think about things going forward i m assuming that you re expecting some productivity improvement given once you complete the sarasota consolidation and then remind us how the seasonality sort of plays a role in the thing among the quarters tricia l fulton chief financial officer yeah so looking at the fourth quarter hydraulics gross margin there s a little bit of step up included in that to bring it down a little bit so we would should see higher gross margins than that for the hydraulics segment in 19 than what we just saw in q4 you re right that there were some challenges to the gross margins some of which the cvt price increase helped in the back half of the year and that we will actualize that throughout 2019 the addition of cfp with different business model is playing in a little bit to some margin changes in that segment but we do expect to have modest improvement in 2019 in actually in both segments at the gross profit level joseph mondillo sidoti company analyst and in terms of seasonality could you remind us if there is any i think at hydraulics the fourth quarter tends to fall off correct me if i m wrong about the seasonality there and then in terms of seasonality at electronics just wondering how to look at sort of that fourth quarter gross margin that you posted at electronics taking into account seasonality tricia l fulton chief financial officer yeah i mean we re trying to take out the segment s seasonality discussion by guiding to even consolidated quarters throughout the year there are some different things that play here we talked in our prepared remarks specifically about electronics having some ramp up of model year rollout in q2 and q3 this year that sort of changes the dynamic a little from last year so i think we d like to stay with the way we ve talked about it from a quarterly perspective of expecting consolidated results that are pretty evenly spread across the four quarters of 19 joseph mondillo sidoti company analyst okay and then just last question in terms of the geographical regions looking at sort of the construction market particularly if you look at caterpillar most recent january retail sales they re continuing to see pressure i think their declines are accelerating in asia markets europe sort of following and north america seems to be holding up could you just sort of give us your take on sort of the geographic your geographic market and how they re trending through i guess february or up until whatever date that you have wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director yeah sure so i think in general i think we can say that moderate growth is expected here to continue on a global basis if you break it down into the triad ph i would say probably the most concerning piece is europe right now and as you quite correctly said joe it s probably the strongest situation we are seeing here still in north america i think asia and here particular east asia we have to see how this will shake out we are still seeing quite solid tailwind at this stage particularly in the recent weeks and months so no reason for a concern at this stage in asia joseph mondillo sidoti company analyst okay sorry just a follow up on europe wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director europe is the weakest piece europe is the weakest piece and i think that would i mean that is applicable not just for construction machinery i think that s for industrial production i was just looking in preparation for today s call looking at some of the numbers again i mean if you look at total machinery production in europe it s pretty much expected to be flat and it could even be move into negative territory toward the second half of the year joseph mondillo sidoti company analyst okay all right thanks for taking my question wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director sure operator there are no further questions at this time i d like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer and director thanks for your interest in helios and for your participation this morning also i want to thank to all of the hardworking helios employees who are driving these results so we look forward to updating all of you on the first quarter 2019 results in may thank you very much and have a great day operator this concludes today s teleconference you may disconnect your lines at this time thank you for your participation duration 67 minutes

i just referenced with that i ll turn the call over to dale dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director thank you brendan good morning everyone and thanks for joining us i m pleased to report fourth quarter reported sales grew almost 18 compared to prior year led by the acquisition of interface performance materials which contributed 34 million of revenue in the quarter on a consolidated basis lydall sales for the full year of 2018 were up 2 2 organically with growth across all segments compared to prior year gross margin in the fourth quarter was down and continue to be negatively impacted by higher labor and overhead costs and to a lesser degree raw material inflation however we did see sequential gross margin expansion of a 160 basis points from the third quarter 2018 led by strong gains in performance materials and thermal acoustic solutions partially offset by lower gross margin and technical nonwovens we saw end market softened in the fourth quarter particularly in china adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were 0 52 compared to 0 67 in the fourth quarter of 2017 and included 0 13 of incremental amortization from acquisitions advertisement advertisement slide 3 outlines our recently published financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 i will briefly cover key highlights and randy will take you through the results in detail when he provides a summary of our financial performance fourth quarter 2018 net sales of 209 9 million were a record for lydall increasing 31 9 million or 17 9 from the same period in 2017 organically sales were down 800 000 or 0 4 ph impacted by softness in the china market in technical nonwovens and thermal acoustical solutions filtration sales in performance materials and north american sales of industrial filtration and technical nonwovens were both up double digits while european part sales in thermal acoustic solutions grew mid single digits inorganic growth added 35 5 million to the top line tooling sales were essentially flat and fx was a headwind of 2 9 million or 1 7 fourth quarter 2018 adjusted gross margin declined 200 basis points to 20 3 driven primarily by higher costs in the thermal acoustic solutions and technical nonwovens segments while commodity inflation on aluminum has eased in the final quarter of the year we are still seeing higher costs for midwest premium and conversion costs in addition incremental manufacturing costs in thermal acoustic solutions negatively impacted margins the technical nonwovens segment saw lower volumes in the quarter along with continued high cost for aramid fibers and competitive pricing pressures full year adjusted gross margin of 19 9 was down 380 basis points on higher material labor and overhead costs as a recap for the full year 2018 commodity and material increases impacted the business unfavorably by approximately 12 million or a 150 basis points approximately 5 million of this headwind was reduced by material productivity and where possible pricing actions the remaining headwinds of approximately 7 million was primarily in the thermal acoustic solutions business which experienced significant increases in aluminum costs and to a lesser degree higher cost on stainless steel these increases were driven by commodity index volatility and tariff related impacts including higher market premiums and conversion costs as well as incremental cost for resourcing material the overall decline in gross margin was partially mitigated by continued discipline on sg a expenses adjusted for restructuring strategic initiatives amortization and the addition of interface sg a expenses were down over 3 million principally on lower incentive and stock compensation expense related to lower achievement of financial targets the resulting adjusted ebitda margin for the fourth quarter was 12 1 down 70 basis points from the prior period but notably improved a 130 basis points from the third quarter of 2018 adjusted earnings were 0 52 per share down 0 15 from the fourth quarter 2017 including 0 13 of incremental amortization expense and 3 million of incremental interest expense associated with the borrowings for the interface acquisition turning to slide 4 this is an overview of our long term growth strategy which includes four drivers new product development lean six sigma geographic expansion and m a with respect to acquisitions the completion of the interface performance materials in the third quarter was a major milestone for lydall our short term focus remains on successfully integrating the new business into our performance materials segment randy will cover additional financial details on the acquisition but with four months behind us i m happy to report that the business performance is meeting our expectations advertisement advertisement moving on to product development activities i d like to highlight two innovative engineering materials products applications in performance materials and technical nonwovens first is a ceiling product application and our new interface performance materials business bonded spacer plates are multi layer gasket assemblies used to seal metal surfaces in automatic transmissions interface has developed a high performance material to be used in this demanding application which are used by all major oem equipment manufacturers globally the materials provided in a roll form or finished gaskets and has been very positively received in the market we expect bonded spacer plate sales to grow at double digit rates in 2019 through both market growth and share gains in technical nonwovens we have developed an innovative new application of nonwoven felts in architectural acoustical applications ceiling and wall panels constructed of nonwoven felts can provide significant acoustical reduction in open environment such as offices and other commercial and public spaces panels can be tailored by architects to provide high quality aesthetics stiffness durability chemical resistance and even designed to meet the latest fire protection standards they can be molded and precision cut into various shapes providing customers a flexible simple and cost effective solution compared to traditional materials we continue to receive strong market interest and we ll be investing to support this high growth application in 2019 and beyond the previously announced restructuring initiatives in technical nonwovens focused on the consolidation of the china manufacturing sites as you recall we reached a milestone in the third quarter with the reduction of our footprint from four locations to three and remaining activity will focus on further consolidation to two facilities in china site rationalization activities in europe s are well under way with the consolidation of felt making operations in the uk and germany expected to be completed mid 2019 these initiatives will better leverage our business to be more efficient and further strengthened our scale and positioning in these markets as we near the completion of the program we are revising our estimate on the total restructuring expense to approximately 4 2 million down from our prior estimate of 5 million we continue to expect run rate synergy benefits of 5 million by the end of 2019 to date approximately 3 million have been invested in this program with the remaining spend of approximately 1 2 million we incurred largely in the first half of 2019 turning to slide 5 with respect to business conditions overall we believe the underlying fundamentals of our business remained steady but we will continue to monitor government actions that impact global trade relations on the supply side we continue to see movement in the aluminum market after significant volatility in the first half of 2018 lme prices for aluminum eased in the second half of the year with fourth quarter average settling at approximately 0 89 a pound down approximately 0 06 from the third quarter of 2018 while the index price is down from the fourth quarter of 2017 we continue to see year over year upward pressure on local premiums duties and tariffs and conversion costs for aluminum sheet products used in the thermal acoustic solutions business as a reminder lydall does have pass through arrangements based on the lme index in place for approximately 1 5 of the effective business volumes but there is typically a three to six months lag on recovery in addition we are closely monitoring polyester fiber pricing the key input across all lydall business units and continue to see supply constraints and higher prices on meta aramid prices and input for certain specialty technical nonwoven applications and certain gasket applications and performance materials advertisement advertisement finally we are continuing to work on our alternate supply arrangements for all key raw material inputs impacted by the most recent round of 10 tariffs as a counter measure to the higher 25 tariffs that could be implemented in march 2019 pending the outcome of the ongoing trade discussions on the demand side the domestic automotive market continues to show favorable results in the fourth quarter of 2018 with us light vehicle seasonally adjusted annual rates ending 2018 at 17 3 million units for the year current forecast for 2019 indicate domestic light vehicle production levels slightly down at 16 9 million units and western european automotive volumes are forecasted to be flat china volumes are expected to grow modestly despite contracting each month in the second half of 2018 given this global outlook and the mix of applications and platforms in our product portfolio we expect to slightly outpace the market on a volume basis looking to our filtration and engineering materials business performance materials end markets continue to show stability in europe domestically and are offset by softness in china strong demand for filtration products in the first half of 2018 continue to trend positively in the fourth quarter and we expect that to continue in 2019 sales of specialty cryogenic installation softened in the third quarter but stabilized in the fourth quarter finally in our technical nonwovens segments we are experiencing stable demand for industrial filtration products but are closely monitoring demand in china that softened in the fourth quarter north america demand for industrial filtration markets remain healthy and european demand is stable but could be impacted by the outcome of brexit negotiations the advanced material end markets outside of the automotive applications also remain healthy global technical nonwovens has a robust backlog entering into 2019 with that i will now turn the call over to randy randall b gonzales executive vice president chief financial officer advertisement advertisement thank you dale turning to slide 6 i ll briefly cover our consolidated results and then provide an overview of our operating segment results before i start discussing financial results i d like to point out that we began reporting segment ebitda for q4 results and we ll continue to do so moving forward segment ebitda is a non gaap measure for each business segment and is defined as operating income plus depreciation amortization and equity method income for that segment we have adopted this approach as we believe it provides a basis to evaluate core operating performance of each segment and provides an indication of the segment s ability to generate cash there is no change the ebitda reporting of consolidated lydall results which is reconciled from net income by adding back interest taxes other income and expense and income from equity method in addition consistent with our current reporting practice that provides adjusted gross margin and adjusted operating margin we will also report adjusted segment ebitda which adjusts financial results for nonrecurring unique or one time items such as strategic initiatives restructuring and purchase accounting adjustments related to inventory step up the details on these important metrics are provided in the press release and 10 k moving on to financial results sales in the fourth quarter of 2018 were 209 9 million up 31 9 million or 17 9 from fourth quarter 2017 acquisitions in the performance materials segment contributed 35 5 million or 20 points of this growth foreign exchange was a headwind of 1 7 points primarily on a weaker euro and canadian dollar and tooling sales of 6 3 million were flat compared to fourth quarter 2017 the resulting organic growth was down 0 4 driven primarily by technical nonwovens which saw a softer sales in china and lower intercompany sales to thermal acoustical solutions year to date sales of 785 9 million was up 12 5 or 2 2 organically with acquisitions adding 7 points of growth and fx in tooling adding 1 5 points and 1 8 points respectively all segments showed organic growth for the full year note that our year to date sales includes 4 3 million related to the new accounting standard that impacts the timing of revenue recognition primarily for recognition of tooling sales in thermal acoustical solutions and certain customer orders in technical nonwovens as a reminder under the new standard lydall predominantly recognizes tooling sales as costs are incurred over time in contrast to the prior practice of recognizing tooling revenues upon acceptance and delivery to the customer the net impact to gross profit was 1 3 million advertisement advertisement reported fourth quarter gross margin of 19 9 was down 230 basis points from prior year excluding 600 000 of inventory step up related to the interface acquisition and restructuring and severance charges in both periods adjusted gross margin of 20 3 was down 200 basis points the primary drivers of this reduction were in thermal acoustical solutions were higher labor and overhead costs drove a 130 basis points of consolidated gross margin erosion and higher commodity costs and unfavorable mix in technical nonwovens consolidated operating margin for the fourth quarter was 6 3 including 600 000 of expenses related to corporate strategic initiatives 600 000 of inventory step up and 400 000 of expenses related to restructuring activities adjusting for these items operating margin in the fourth quarter 2018 was 7 down 240 basis points from prior year including a 130 basis points of higher intangibles amortization expense adjusted sg a expense was up 5 million impacted by 2 9 million higher amortization and incremental sg a from interface acquisition offset by 2 8 million lower spending on incentive compensation pay resulting from lower achievement of target financial metrics adjusted ebitda for the quarter was 25 4 million or 12 1 of sales compared with 12 8 in the fourth quarter 2017 period and up 130 basis points sequentially from the third quarter of 2018 year to date adjusted ebitda is 90 2 million or 11 5 of sales the reported effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 26 6 the rate was negatively impacted by 5 3 points of discrete tax items in the quarter primarily from clarification of new tax regulations related to the 2017 tax reform act adjusted for this and other discrete items the tax rate would have been in the range of 21 compared to the fourth quarter 2017 reported effective tax of 5 3 which was favorably impacted by a one time benefit related to the 2017 tax reform act entering 2019 we anticipate the consolidated ordinary tax rate to be in the range of 20 to 22 fourth quarter 2018 earnings per diluted share were 0 42 compared to 0 80 of earnings in the prior year when adjusting for strategic initiatives expenses inventory step up restructuring and severance expenses and discrete tax items adjusted earnings per share of 0 52 were down 0 15 compared to adjusted eps of 0 67 delivered in the fourth quarter of 2017 with higher acquisition related amortization contributing 0 13 of this difference for the full year adjusted eps of 2 43 is down 0 37 including 0 21 of incremental amortization expenses cash flows provided by operations in the fourth quarter were strong at 30 2 million driven primarily by reductions in accounts receivable advertisement advertisement for the full year 2018 cash flow from operations totaled 44 7 million this compares with cash flow of 62 9 million in 2017 with the decrease driven by lower net income and higher working capital our liquidity remained strong at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018 cash was 49 2 million total outstanding debt from the credit facility at year end was 324 8 million for a net debt ratio of approximately 2 8 times adjusted ebitda down from approximately 2 9 times in the third quarter of 2018 entering 2019 cash generation and working capital reduction will be key focus areas as we look to accelerate debt pay down as it relates to capital expenditures lydall spent 11 2 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 up from 7 1 million spent in the fourth quarter of 2017 full year 2018 spending of 31 3 million is consistent with our prior guidance of 30 million and 35 million for 2019 we anticipate capital spend to increase to 40 million to 45 million driven by the full year impact of the interface acquisition and discrete investments to support organic growth in all segments finally during the fourth quarter of 2018 lydall authorized termination of the us lydall pension plan which with completion anticipated in 2019 as a result we currently estimate incurring pension expense of approximately 29 million to 33 million these charges will consists primarily of non cash charges with an estimated 2 million to 4 million cash contribution further detail on the plan is also provided in the 10 k under footnote 10 moving to slide 7 i ll discuss our segment results i ll start with our thermal acoustical solutions segment this is our global automotive business that specializes in providing an innovative engineered thermal and acoustical solutions for vehicle under hood underbody power train and exhaust applications fourth quarter sales in this business were 85 6 million down 0 5 organically net part sales of 79 3 million were down 1 3 million with lower acoustical shielding sales domestically and 17 lower thermal shielding sales in china partially offset by higher part sales in europe tooling sales of 6 3 million were flat and foreign exchange primarily the euro reduced sales growth by 1 point for the full year sales grew 6 8 on a reported basis and 1 6 organically adjusted segment ebitda margin of 13 declined 420 basis points from fourth quarter of 2017 higher labor and overhead cost continued in the quarter impacting margins by 290 basis points compared to prior year but we have seen improvement from third quarter 2018 while commodity index pricing for aluminum was down marginally year over year the total cost for aluminum including higher domestic premiums and conversion costs impacted margins unfavorably by 50 basis points we continue to actively monitor commodity pricing given the dynamic context of current global trade discussions finally consistent with prior periods customer price reductions impacted margin by 90 basis points compared to prior year of note segment ebitda margin expanded by a 150 basis points compared with third quarter of 2018 for the full year segment ebitda margin was 12 9 advertisement advertisement moving to slide 8 i will cover our performance materials segment this business provides specialty filtration and insulation solutions to a variety of end markets globally and the addition of interface performance materials broadens the portfolio with engineered ceiling solutions across myriad of industries as a reminder lydall report sales data under two product categories filtration consist of sales for air and liquid filtration applications including filtration applications previously reported under the legacy life sciences segment ceiling and advanced solutions encompasses the new interface performance materials gasketing and ceiling applications as well as sales previously reported under thermal insulation which consisted of specialty insulation for high temperature and ultra low temperature or cryogenic applications sales of 65 6 million were up 36 5 million or 126 compared to prior year including 35 5 million of sales from the interface and precision filtration acquisitions fx was a slight headwind in the quarter with resulting organic growth of 4 2 primarily on higher filtration sales full year sales of 169 2 million included 48 9 million from acquisitions and 2 million of favorable foreign exchange netting organic growth of 1 4 fourth quarter segment ebitda margin adjusted for 600 000 of inventory step up was essentially flat from prior year at 15 7 with modest gross margin expansion offset by slightly higher sg a expenses associated with the interface integration for the full year adjusted segment ebitda margin grew by 40 basis points to 14 4 interface performance materials business is off to a solid start contributing over 45 million in sales in 2018 with ebitda margins in line with our expectations and accretive to the portfolio as a recap in 2018 purchase accounting adjustments for inventory step up were 2 million and incremental intangibles amortization was 3 4 million moving into 2019 we do not expect any further adjustments for inventory step up but as previously discussed we estimate amortization related expenses to total 16 2 million an increase of 12 8 million from 2018 as a result while we continue to expect the deal will be cash accretive in 2019 it will be minimally accretive to reported eps in 2019 slide 9 covers our technical nonwovens segment this segment produces air and liquid filtration media as well as other engineered products for use in various commercial applications such as geosynthetics automotive industrial and medical among others for the fourth quarter of 2018 sales of 64 7 million were down organically 4 7 or 3 3 million net of unfavorable foreign exchange of 2 5 globally industrial filtration sales were down 2 5 with a 35 decline in china driven by softer demand and timing of orders partially offset by healthy gains in north america sales in advanced materials were down 12 9 primarily in north america on lower sales of needle felts to the thermal acoustical segment and lower sales in canada which were impacted by a shorter construction period compared to fourth quarter of 2017 and a weaker canadian dollar backlog for all regions remained solid but we are closely monitoring china from a profitability perspective adjusted segment ebitda margin of 11 7 was down 210 basis points driven by higher material costs particularly for meta aramid fibers net of increased customer pricing higher labor costs unfavorable mix and lower absorption also contributed as a reminder adjusted segment ebitda excludes 400 000 or 50 basis points of expenses related to ongoing restructuring activities in the quarter compared to 200 000 or 30 basis points in the same period last year for the full year technical nonwovens adjusted segment ebitda was 13 6 down 150 basis points from full year 2017 driven principally on higher materials costs that were partially but not fully offset by pricing actions in unfavorable product mix that concludes our review of the fourth quarter and full year results year to date top line growth was favorable driven by generally healthy demand in the end markets we serve as we enter 2019 we remain focused on the operational items that we can control integrating the interface acquisition into the performance materials portfolio completing restructuring in technical nonwovens and continued improvement in operational performance and cash flow generation leveraging these improvements on continued strength in our end markets position us to deliver solid performance in 2019 with that we will begin our question and answer session questions and answers operator operator instructions and our first question comes from matt koranda of roth capital partners matt koranda roth capital partners analyst hey guys good morning dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director good morning matt matt koranda roth capital partners analyst i want to start out with tas i know you guys referenced in your prepared remarks the aluminum and sort of other indices showing kind of flattish or even decent declines year to date which should be a tailwind i assume for 2019 but you referenced conversion costs are still elevated some of the premiums as well so are we factoring in a net tailwind or a headwind from tas in 2019 in terms of how it kind of fits into the overall outlook for consolidated ebitda margin expansion for the full year dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director yes matt overall obviously it will depend on what happens with the lme which to your point so far and in q4 actually was a tailwind it was a benefit the remaining pieces for the midwest premium and conversion costs as we ve talked about in some prior calls a lot of that capacity had to be locked in in 2018 to secure it for 2019 so those components will be flat to slightly up essentially a headwind if you will so we re really going to see how it pans out through the whole year hopefully if aluminum pricing continues to softened and we can pick up that benefit it will help us but right now i d say it s probably a net flat to a headwind matt koranda roth capital partners analyst okay that s helpful and then in that segment just sticking with it for the quarter at least i think you guys referenced a 130 bps of higher labor and overhead as a headwind to margins in the quarter and also i think higher commodities were like 50 basis points what accounts for sort of the remaining bucket in terms of headwinds to margin in q4 dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director you re talking specifically in the tas segment matt or are you talking the lydall consolidated matt koranda roth capital partners analyst tas specifically randall b gonzales executive vice president chief financial officer yes so matt another big piece of that is the price downs that we see on an annual basis so you captured two out of the three so it s labor and overhead increases commodity cost increases and then it s the price downs that affect the gross margin as well matt koranda roth capital partners analyst okay that s helpful and then just in terms of the pricing environment in tas i mean are you seeing any additional pressure on that front or is it pretty steady in terms of the kind of the normal range that you see on price downs randall b gonzales executive vice president chief financial officer in the fiber product line probably a little more aggressive pricing pressure in the metals product line it s the traditional 1 to 2 down each year matt koranda roth capital partners analyst okay great that s helpful and then just in terms of like when i kind of do the back of the envelope math on cash flow for 2019 it looks promising any and i know you guys highlighted sort of the intent to repay sort of the debt associated with interface anything any additional color you can share on sort of plans for debt paydown for the year and sort of how you re thinking about that dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director i mean matt we re i don t think we re going to give any guidance in terms of a particular number on debt paydown but we re targeting by end of 2019 to be at about a 2 5 net debt leverage ratio matt koranda roth capital partners analyst okay all right that s helpful guys i ll jump back in the queue dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director from where we stand today have about 2 8 matt koranda roth capital partners analyst got it operator the next question comes from edward marshall of sidoti company edward marshall sidoti company analyst good morning guys how are you dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director just fine good morning ed randall b gonzales executive vice president chief financial officer good morning edward marshall sidoti company analyst so looking at the overhead the labor the freight that incurred in the quarter it did drop from q3 but probably not as much as i would have anticipated following up on the q3 call i m curious as we look into 2019 the cadence of that decline is it still that overhead that labor is it still associated with the new product or new product qualifications dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director yes product launches still have a slight impact but not near the impact that it had in 2018 for our point of reference in 2018 tas launched a 163 new tools in 2019 we re anticipating it to be around 50 so a lot of the launch activity is behind us we saw in the fourth quarter over a 20 improvement in our operational efficiency metrics which includes scrap over time outsourcing and so we did see a significant improvement we expect that to continue the one thing that we will have some overhang through probably the third quarter of 2019 is we will still incur some outsourcing expense on a couple of items where we re waiting for some new assets to come in place to provide the capacity to handle that edward marshall sidoti company analyst got it so if we could look at maybe the consolidated grouping of these costs in 2018 and think about what they might do in 2019 can you kind of frame give a frame of reference as to the impact that you expect versus the impact that you felt quantify if you could dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director for 2018 edward marshall sidoti company analyst 18 versus yes i mean if you can quantify it for 2018 dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director yes for 2018 versus what we anticipated there was probably about this is excluding the material inflation that we experienced it was probably about 5 million edward marshall sidoti company analyst in total for overheads additional labor dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director yes outsourcing and everything edward marshall sidoti company analyst outsourcing dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director and then you add to that the raw material impact of about 7 million edward marshall sidoti company analyst and your anticipation for 2019 of that 5 million how much will recur reoccur dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director there ll be a significant reduction i mean we saw so far in the first two months very very good improvement but we ll have to see as some of the new platforms go into production volume how well we run those assets but we re anticipating a significant improvement in 19 versus 18 edward marshall sidoti company analyst got it and a lot of the metal programs if i could are centered around some european production my understanding is that some of the new introductions for 2019 have been delayed or kind of wait and see stuff that was supposed to be released in q1 might take till q3 have you seen that disruption in your manufacturing process or are those unique to specific applications that you re not producing dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director well we have seen and really most of our new launches are in the united states this year ok we are seeing increases in europe but the high volume of the new metal volume will come in the united states we have seen some delays from both gm and mercedes on the launches of their new products that are consuming some of our new metal shields edward marshall sidoti company analyst got it dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director they re saying right what we re hearing from is that they expect full year recovery but just delay in the start edward marshall sidoti company analyst got it midway through this year there was a fire at one of your suppliers i just want to be certain that and i think your expectation was that you wouldn t make up the lost production at least that was your comment coming out of q3 in the fourth quarter that that customer had did you see an uptick from that customer as it would relate to recover some of those lost vehicles or lost production dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director no we have not they did not increase the volume they told us they would when the incident occurred so no that did not happen edward marshall sidoti company analyst you give some good color on the top line for interface and i m curious if you could kind of talk about maybe the expectations or if you could give us a profile and the contribution to profits either in whether in q4 or maybe what your expectations are for 2019 randall b gonzales executive vice president chief financial officer so ed when we announced interface what we talked about was annual revenues in the 150 million range and an annual ebitda in the 29 million range so other than that that s the that continues to be our expectation and i don t think we re prepared to give any additional guidance beyond that our initial edward marshall sidoti company analyst did you give the step up i m sorry randall b gonzales executive vice president chief financial officer sorry go ahead edward marshall sidoti company analyst did you give the step up in the amortization that you anticipate for 2019 randall b gonzales executive vice president chief financial officer yes so step up we re it s complete for 2018 it was a total of 2 million don t anticipate any additional expense related to that in 2019 for full year amortization we expect it to be a little more than 21 million the majority of that is going to be related to the interface acquisition edward marshall sidoti company analyst 21 million step up or 21 million total for the year randall b gonzales executive vice president chief financial officer yes 21 million of amortization in 2019 edward marshall sidoti company analyst is that an increase from 2019 or are you saying 20 million increase or 21 million in total randall b gonzales executive vice president chief financial officer no absolute number of almost 21 5 million of amortization that s on a consolidated basis that s for everything in 2019 versus full year of 9 4 million in 2018 dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director right so ed just to be clear incremental almost 13 million amortization year over year edward marshall sidoti company analyst 13 million incremental great thanks that s what i was looking for and then finally i just i wanted to look for a i wanted to ask somewhat of a strategic question about your tooling and kind of new product initiations and with the change in the accounting i m kind of thinking through maybe some of the changes that you can make to kind of recognition of that tooling in that revenue is there anything that you can kind of do that we don t find ourselves in 2018 event in the future having a pretty hefty rollout in product introduction and the recognition of that revenue and the profit impact as well dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director yes i mean ed i don t think there s anything we can do as far as changing the regulation it is what it is it s an accounting practice and we will continue to adhere to it it s just a matter of the volume of tooling that we have we will have to continue to report the revenue and income as per the latest accounting standard edward marshall sidoti company analyst right randall b gonzales executive vice president chief financial officer yes ed it really kind of comes down to each contract and each customer and there are several criteria that could be evaluated in terms of when and how to properly recognize the revenue so yes it s we ll continue to follow the appointed guidance and go from there edward marshall sidoti company analyst okay i appreciate the comments thanks dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director thank you ed operator and next we have a question from chris moore of cjs securities chris moore cjs securities analyst hey good morning guys dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director good morning chris chris moore cjs securities analyst good morning maybe we could just start kind of big picture i know you walked through kind of the broad prospects of each segment and obviously you don t give specific guidance but i mean if you were to rank the three segments from where you re sitting today likely highest to lowest in terms of organic revenue growth in 2019 what would be that order dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director i think technical nonwovens and performance materials are going to be very close to each other in organic growth in 19 followed then by tas but all should have organic growth in 19 versus 18 one of our biggest disappointments in the fourth quarter was how tnw s business in china sort of evaporated but as we sit here today we re looking at almost a 15 increase in our backlog today versus what we had at the end of december so we re seeing a resurgence of the order patterns in china and across all technical nonwovens chris moore cjs securities analyst got it on the performance materials side you guys said that the cryogenic sales had kind of revitalized in q4 something that you expect to continue as well dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director yes chris moore cjs securities analyst got it if i m looking at the tas to ebitda margins in the future what s a reasonable expectation to get to that kind of mid teen level is that still a couple of years out just what s the kind of progression that you guys expect dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director it s still probably a couple of years i mean our ebitda margins are close to 14 now i believe for tas the key items the key drivers there are successful ramp ups of all these new metal products we won and the pain we went through in 17 and getting through the ppap process we should start seeing that some relief in the commodity pressure that we saw in 17 rather 18 over 7 million of headwind just in commodity prices on the material we buy so a combination of those two will help us get there and we ll continue to see price pressure on the fiber product lines in that business chris moore cjs securities analyst got it last thing for me you talked about some price increases gaining traction in performance materials where specifically is that referring to dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director both in technical nonwovens and performance materials teams are actively working with all of our customers when we see commodity inflation we try to pass that through to our end markets so sometimes we re successful sometimes we re not but clearly focused on it and in 18 we got partial recovery through pricing and not full recovery as that pressure continues we re still out there working with the end markets to drive it and it s a competitive dynamic if our competitors don t support pricing in the marketplace we don t want to lose share chris moore cjs securities analyst got it i appreciate it guys dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director thank you chris operator operator instructions this will conclude our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to dale barnhart for any closing remarks dale g

u s rep alexandria ocasio cortez and sen ed markey are calling for a green new deal that would involve massive government spending to shift the u s economy away from its reliance on carbon their congressional resolution goes into great detail about the harms of climate change and what the u s government should do about it left unanswered however is how america would pay for it some commentators have been calling a green new deal unaffordable with some estimates putting the bill for complete decarbonization at as high as us 12 3 trillion as the author of the united nations environment program s global green new deal a plan to lift the world economy out of the 2008 2009 great recession i disagree i believe there are two straightforward ways to cover the cost and help accelerate the green revolution while lowering the overall price tag what a green new deal may cost before we talk about how to pay for it first we need a rough idea of how much it might actually cost for starters it s important to be realistic rather than putting a price tag on going 100 percent renewable which would take decades i believe we should figure out how much to spend over the next five years to build a greener economy ambitious efforts to foster green energy during the great recession are a good place to start in total the world s largest 20 economies and a few others spent 3 3 trillion to stimulate economic growth of that more than 520 billion was devoted to green investments such as pollution cleanup recycling and low carbon energy the u s share of that was about 120 billion or about 1 percent of its gross domestic product around half of this went toward energy conservation and other short term energy efficiency investments to quickly shore up the then nascent recovery and generate employment the stimulus may have spurred some growth in renewable energy but didn t do much on its own to reduce carbon emissions permanently another country that made fairly big green investments during the great recession was south korea which promoted low carbon green growth as its new long term development vision it allocated 60 billion or 5 percent of its 2007 gdp to a five year plan but in the end south korea may have spent only 26 billion on low carbon energy and failed to adopt pricing reforms and other incentives to foster renewables such as phasing out fossil fuel subsidies pricing carbon and improving regulatory frameworks the result was only a modest improvement in energy efficiency and carbon emissions have continued to rise in other words the price tag of a green new deal that would make a difference would have to be much higher than what governments like the u s and korea actually spent during the great recession the original south korea five year plan however to spend 5 percent of gdp to me seems about right as the best guess of the public investment needed to decarbonize a major economy through a green growth strategy so if we use korea as a starting point that means the u s would need to spend around 970 billion over the next five years or 194 billion annually how to pay for the green new deal as for paying for it the first thing to bear in mind is that in my view a green new deal should be covered by current rather than future revenue a common way for congress to pay for the cost of a new program or stimulus is by deficit spending so the u s borrows the money from investors and then eventually has to pay it back through taxes down the road with the federal deficit projected to reach 1 trillion in 2019 increasing it by several hundred billion more even if for a good cause is not a great idea ballooning deficits add to the national debt which is already 21 trillion and counting saddling future generations of americans with unsustainable levels of national debt is just as dangerous as burdening them with an economy that is environmentally unsustainable deficit spending is warranted to boost overall demand for goods and services when unemployment rises consumers do not spend and private investment is down when that is not the case i believe efforts to grow green sectors should pay for themselves so the u s would have to find new revenue sources to finance additional government support for clean energy research and development greening infrastructure smart transmission grids public transport and other programs under any green new deal two of the main ways to do that would be by raising new revenues or finding savings elsewhere in the budget on the revenue side i believe passing a carbon tax is one of the best ways to go a 20 tax per metric ton of carbon that climbs over time at a pace slightly higher than inflation would raise around 96 billion in revenue each year covering just under half the estimated cost at the same time it would reduce carbon emissions by 11 1 billion metric tons through 2030 in other words not only does it help raise money to pay for a transition to a green economy a carbon tax also helps spur that very change in terms of savings the removal of fossil fuel subsidies is a particularly appropriate target consumer subsidies for fossil fuels and producer subsidies for coal cost u s taxpayers nearly 9 billion a year these subsidies could be shifted instead to cover some expenditures under a green new deal and again doing this would accelerate the transition to cleaner energy so where might the other 89 billion come from one option is to simply impose a higher carbon tax a 20 tax would put the u s roughly in the middle among countries that currently impose carbon taxes but doubling it to 40 per ton would raise an additional 76 billion annually or 172 billion in total as well as reduce 17 5 billion metric tons of carbon by 2030 another idea is to raise taxes on the highest earning americans for example imposing a 70 percent tax on earnings of 10 million or more would bring in an addtional 72 billion a year cost savings but it s also possible that the cost of decarbonizing the economy may fall over time for example the drop in emissions accompanying the carbon tax should lower the price tag in a way that s hard to estimate today the right policies and reforms would also help lower the costs in a sort of chicken and egg effect as economists ken gillingham and james stock have shown green innovations spur demand which leads to more innovation all of which ultimately reduce costs a good illustration is purchases of electric vehicles which will stimulate demand for charging stations once installed the stations will reduce the costs of running electric vehicles and further boost demand the green new deal as proposed by ocasio cortez and markey would be expensive but what policies are adopted and how we choose to pay for it could ultimately determine the plan s success and whether we can afford it
first it was operation desert storm inflicted under orders of bush the father this was followed by 10 years of sanctions when half a million iraqi children died from lack of medicines and food iraq s economy was ruined and the infrastructure laid to waste the resulting humanitarian crisis was blamed on president saddam hussein once an american ally later to be labelled a monstrous dictator because he had wanted to abandon the us dollar for the euro in oil trading there was too the lie that saddam owned weapons of mass destruction wmd between the humanitarian crisis and the wmd lie a consensus for war was created the 2003 invasion of iraq the un security council though was not persuaded this modus operandi has been the basis of many us invasions and interventions and the subsequent regime change and occupation today president donald trump is about to lead the us to war on the principle of responsibility to protect r2p after having cynically softened venezuela economically through a blockade and financial sanctions john bolton openly declared that washington is after venezuelan oil it all began when under bush the son in 2002 president hugo chavez was kidnapped and held for a couple of days before venezuelans poured out onto the streets demanding the release of their elected president together with the army they pressured the kidnappers to release chavez and so the first attempt at regime change in venezuela failed venezuela has gone through some twenty years of us sanctions that has progressively strangled her economy as the country slowly asphyxiates president nicolas maduro is left will little space to manoeuvre to protect his citizens the financial sanctions have deprived him of the country s sole source of income her oil revenues with which to alleviate poverty now the free education free healthcare job security measures and the food box programme that has ensured development and sustenance for the people are at risk having selected a puppet for president a nonentity dubbed random guido by alternative media the americans have set up a parallel venezuelan government centred in miami florida with orders emanating out of washington after more than a month now since guido by definition proclaimed himself a traitor his party boycotted the may 2018 presidential elections won by maduro the whole sham appears to be losing steam it is taking too long the us and her allies have gone openly rogue and trump says the war option is still on the table and his national security advisor john bolton insists that the time for negotiations is past can the world then expect a us climbdown but washigton s aversion to the bolivarian socialist revolution while initially caused by its rabid anti socialism has changed de dollarisation has made urgent the need to control and end the bolivarian republic of venezuela in the 1970s the saudis as leader of opec the oil cartel came to an agreement with the us government to exclusively conduct its oil trade in us dollars other opec members followed suit and thus the petrodollar system was born making the us dollar the world s main reserve currency given that oil is the world s most traded commodity the petrodollar system held world trade captive and allowed the federal reserve to print money freely enabling america s perpetual war policy and venezuela has the world s largest proven reserves of oil bigger even than that of saudi arabia an impossible to rationalise decision by trump to weaponise the us dollar is putting american dominance at risk printing money for its war needs maintaining more than 800 military bases worldwide has raked up debts in excess of us 21 trillion and growing putting the petrodollar at risk therefore through trade wars and sanctions forcing targeted countries to look for alternative payment systems cannot but end the global petrodollar monopoly and diminishing the value of the fiat currency thus ending its on demand dollar printing ability in august 2018 president maduro declared that venezuela s oil be sold in currencies other than the us dollar to circumvent the us financial sanctions that is paralysing his oil dependent economy and too the economy of the country pre chavez was structured to be heavily dependent on the us including her food supply which is almost totally imported and mostly from the us the un recognised maduro government is now forced to sell the country s gold and increasing gold mining activity to pay for its imports to make matters worse the us and uk are stealing venezuela s foreign held assets as the renowned economist michael hudson argues in an interview with the saker the price of the us economic attack on venezuela is to fracture the global monetary system maduro s defensive move is showing other countries the need to protect themselves from becoming another venezuela by finding a new safe haven and paying agent for their gold foreign exchange reserves and foreign debt financing away from the dollar sterling and euro areas in fact the de dollarisation of world trade has gained momentum in recent years therefore it is reasonable to suppose that washington would do everything in its power to stem the tide without the petrodollar all pretence at liquidity ends the dollar is not backed by gold reserves it rolls off the money minting press because there was once an endless global demand for the us dollar at this juncture stopping venezuela from deserting the petrodollar is pivotal venezuela s success spells the end of the petrodollar era but already the world is unevenly split over venezuela the non aligned movement accounting for 120 countries reiterates its firm support of the bolivarian republic of venezuela in line with the bandung principles russia and china declared their pro maduro stand from the word go the un refuses to entertain guido recently some 50 un envoys have stood in solidarity with venezuela determined to protect the un charter and international law this leaves only the usual lapdogs standing with washington is then a military intervention even possible in theory it would be impossible for a military invasion to happen without congressional approval but was congress asleep when the many ongoing wars started furthermore the world is already alerted and wise to deceptions by the us and her allies and their disregard for international law however for washington it is not about saving face neither is it simply about securing her backyard it is about the zionist neoconservatives new world order not achievable without the petrodollar which guarantees the us dollar dominance as the world s reserve currency therefore can de dollarisation happen fast enough to pull the carpet from under washington save nicolas maduro restore the rule of international law as well as consolidating the budding multipolar world last weekend saw a determined effort by washington and its puppet to provoke a war under pretext of delivering aid to the victims of its inhumanity the irony is too obvious even for the naive but this means that bolton is not bluffing no negotiations and according to the russian foreign ministry the us is moving its special forces and equipment to the venezuelan border brazil though has said it is not planning to play host to any us military misadventure has the us been checkmated or will the three neoconservative stooges running washington blow caution to the wind and invade anyway gambling on humanity s fear of armageddon askiah adam executive director international movement for a just world
at first glance it would appear that federal reserve chairman jerome powell stuck to the script in prepared testimony to the senate banking committee by saying a healthy u s economy has faced some crosscurrents and conflicting signals although that s nothing he hasn t said before there was still something potentially significant for markets in powell s delivery in describing those crosscurrents the first thing powell highlighted was how financial markets became more volatile at the end of last year and how financial conditions are now less supportive of growth he then talked about economic fundamentals and how growth has slowed in some major foreign economies particularly china and europe mentioning financial markets before the economy is as clear a signal as any that the fed s top priority is preventing another plunge in the stock market like the one in december which many suspected was the real reason the fed officially pivoted toward a more dovish stance in january keeping asset prices elevated is officially the 3 mandate of the federal reserve bleakley financial group chief investment officer peter boockvar wrote in a note to clients the fed s first two mandates are full employment and stable consumer prices in that context powell s testimony should only further cement the idea of a fed put that underpins riskier assets in that context it s little wonder that the s p 500 index which was down as much as 0 24 percent rebounded to rise as much as 0 25 percent before ending the day little changed in the face of lower earnings and growth forecasts

through deduction under the new federal tax law allows pass through entities with qualifying business income to take a 20 percent deduction the intention behind section 199a is to increase investments in u s corporations and drive wages higher for workers the new business pass through tax rates have proven to be the lowest in the last 80 years one major strategy recommended to qualify for this deduction is for partnerships to revisit their initial partnership agreement the main purpose of this strategy is to remove guaranteed payments so that each earned dollar for partners qualifies for the pass through deduction it can also be a beneficial strategy for pass through entities to transition depreciable property to another entity and utilize the property through interchange another recommended strategy for passthrough entities is to consider shifting to an s corporation as long as individuals are in partnerships most llcs and proprietorships donâ t provide services to other businesses and taxable income exceeds the stated threshold transitioning to an s corporation allows subjected profit to be lower for the sake of taking advantage of the 20 percent tax deduction these

excess losses under the new tax cuts and jobs act provision a the tax cuts and jobs act tcja provision decreases the amount of losses a noncorporate taxpayer can take within a given year excess business losses over the limits of 250 000 or 500 000 married filing jointly taxpayers are disallowed and are carried forward to the following tax year by being converted to a net operating loss if thereâ s a business acquisition in process that results in a net operating loss the deduction is limited to the pre net operating loss taxable income in the following taxable year at 80 percent the main strategy is to avoid limitations if itâ s possible that a business may incur excess business losses that business can properly examine certain expenditures that can be spread out over the course of the loss depreciation of equipment is one of those major expenditures normally a depreciation loss would be expensed under section 179 to write off the cost of equipment but because of this new

paying more tax or paying taxes faster makes sense a yes of course and some people are advocates for making greater estimated payments than are necessary picture an auditor with limited time and two tax returns one return requests a large refund the other has a significant amount paid in and carried forward if the auditor can choose only one return to audit which one do you think will be selected hereâ s an example related to a business sale obviously sellers want to pay the least amount of tax possible so almost always if tax must be paid the focus is on achieving the maximum amount of consideration that will be subject to capital gains rather than ordinary tax rates in most business sales buyers insist on noncompete agreements consideration allocated to those types of agreements is subject to ordinary rates so why would anyone allocate anything to them the reason is simple it creates a defense for the capital gains portion of the transaction if the transaction is ever audited it becomes a valuation issue which is much more difficult to contest than an allocation issue taxes are but one consideration for any business or transaction minimizing or deferring taxes should never stand in the way of making money or intelligent audit defense your after tax return and audit risk are what really matter howard howardâ attorneys pllc lee a sartori taxation mergers acquisitions â

transactions a the short answer with one exception is no with regard to virtual currency federal tax law and internal revenue service written guidance is largely unchanged the irs published notice 2014 21 in 2014 in a q a format advising taxpayers that virtual currency such as bitcoin and ethereum isnâ t treated the same as â realâ currency when utilized in transactions or purchased for investment rather virtual currency is considered property and a taxpayer receiving property in exchange for goods or services must include the fair market value of that property in gross income similarly a taxpayer who acquires and sells virtual currency for investment purposes is considered to have bought and sold property and must realize gain or loss on the disposition the one change in the tcja affecting virtual currency exchanges is the elimination of like kind exchange treatment because nontaxable items such as like kind exchanges are available only for exchanges of real property

tax audit and what makes my return more likely to be selected a the easiest way to prepare for an audit is to stay organized the irs recommends you retain your records for at least seven years from the date you file the return while the irs rarely goes beyond three years for an audit youâ re still expected to be able to substantiate all of the information on your return â so keeping adequate records should be a priority thereâ s usually a reason the irs selects a particular return for an audit it could be that information the irs has on file doesnâ t match what was on your return or if it was a corporate return or you were self employed it could be that some of your expenses varied greatly from the industry average the more outliers a return has the more likely it is to be assigned to a revenue agent these audits typically focus on just a few line items but can quickly escalate to a full review the most important factor for all taxpayers is to understand your return before you sign your name to it if thereâ s a mistake youâ re responsible for the balance due â not your tax preparer ask questions gather information and stay organized to limit your audit exposure plunkett cooney

statements in the future with that please turn to slide four and let me hand the call over to jeff jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer thanks a lot faisel and thank you all for joining us today 2018 was an exceptional year for sempra both operationally and financially it was also a transformative year marking our company s 20th anniversary and the continuation of our strategic mission to become north america s premier energy infrastructure company as i mentioned at our analyst day last june since our formation we ve proactively managed our business portfolio over the years this has greatly improved our earnings and cash flow visibility while bolstering a lower risk profile importantly our recent accomplishments have laid a solid foundation for us to build on and include completing the oncor transaction closing the sale of our us solar business closing the sale of our natural gas storage assets announcing the sale of our us wind business announcing oncor s infrareit acquisition announcing the sale of the south american businesses and making very important progress on our lng projects among other successes over the last 12 months we ve accomplished a tremendous amount the amount of activity we ve had is uncommon and even more uncommon are the results i could not be more proud of our team in what we ve done to improve our portfolio notably we expect our renewables midstream divestitures to yield approximately 2 5 billion in proceeds this is an excellent result and provides a valuable opportunity to pay down debt and redeploy capital to support our growth i also want to highlight that this past year sdg e received the prestigious edison award from eer for its efforts to enhance wildfire preparedness and grid resiliency this award is presented to only one us investor on utility each year at cameron lng we ve entered the critical commissioning phase of construction and also have an excellent safety record with over 67 million hours worked without a lost time incident additionally we were recently added to the dow jones utility index a strong testament to the continued focus on execution and commitment to delivering shareholder value now let s turn into our financial results earlier this morning we reported full year 2018 adjusted earnings of 5 57 per share one of the strongest years in our company s history this puts us above the that midpoint of our full year 2018 adjusted earnings guidance in addition our board approved a dividend increase of 8 for 2019 this marks the ninth consecutive year we ve raised our dividend and represents 47 growth over the last five years this is important for a number of reasons because it clearly demonstrates our commitment to a healthy dividend policy i m also pleased to say that we are affirming our full year 2019 adjusted earnings guidance of 5 70 to 6 30 per share trevor will review the key drivers influencing guidance later on the call i d also like to spend a few minutes on california earlier this month we thought our wildfire mitigation plan related to senate bill 901 this filing is a continuation of our ongoing focus on safety reliability and wildfire prevention that we ve been implementing for over a decade and during this time we ve invested about 1 5 billion in these efforts regarding the state s efforts to reduce wildfire threats and their potential impacts we are very encouraged by recent statements by the governor as well as the formation of the blue ribbon commission and the governor s strike team there is widespread recognition among the governor legislature utility commission that the current liability rules for california utilities need to be fixed to support a long term solution for the state and to allow it to meet the state s energy policy goals to be clear these goals cannot be met without strong financially healthy utilities that support the infrastructure investments needed to deliver cleaner and lower cost energy solutions we anticipate solutions being brought forward will fall under three key categories first help reduce the threat of wildfires across our state second protect the interest of our states ratepayers and third provide a clear legislative pathway for timely and adequate cost recovery for prudent system operators these potential outcomes will help create a longer term sustainable framework for the state and its energy future finally i d be remiss if i didn t take a moment to recognize martha wyrsch martha will be retiring at the beginning of march on behalf of everyone here at sempra i wanted to thank martha for her tremendous contributions to the company we wish martha and her family all the best in retirement now please turn to slide five and i ll hand it over to trevor trevor i mihalik executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks jeff as jeff mentioned we accomplished a lot in 2018 making great progress to refocus our efforts on the strategic mission to become north america s premier energy infrastructure company additionally with two months of 2019 behind us we ve already announced the completion of the evaluation of the south american businesses bank of america and lazard will act as our financial advisors and we ll begin the sales process in march we ve also started implementing the next round of continuous cost improvement initiatives which i ll touch on in a few minutes all of these developments demonstrate this managements team to focus on execution and commitment to creating shareholder value please turn to the next slide the decision to sell the south american businesses was not something we nor our board took lightly the six month evaluation process was comprehensive the primary criteria we looked at our laid out in the slide both businesses screened well in many areas but we concluded that they no longer remain a strategic fit for us as part of this evaluation we assess the benefits and rationale for holding and growing or partnering and growing however we determine the sale of these businesses and redeployment of the proceeds into north american infrastructure should maximize value for our shareholders while giving us the opportunity to strengthen our balance sheet while paying down parent debt there is no doubt that the south american businesses are considered some of the most desirable companies in the region with strong company specific and macro fundamentals we certainly have received robust inquiry from global financial and strategic buyers ahead of our formal sales process commencing although we expect this transaction to be eps dilutive it could be value accretive as we deploy the proceeds into north american t d infrastructure and strengthen our balance sheet portfolio optimization is not something new to our company and we ve talked about this many times over the years we have a long and successful track record of actively managing our portfolio including exiting businesses that are either no longer consistent with our strategy or provide greater long term value through selling rather than holding a great example of this is the sale of our us solar assets late last year the decision to sell the south american businesses is a continuation of this philosophy and demonstrates our commitment to maximizing value for our shareholders we re targeting a transaction announcement in mid 2019 and closing the transaction by the end of this year please turn to slide 7 where i ll review our efforts around cost improvement initiatives at our analyst day in june last year you ll recall that jeff walked through the evolution of our business portfolio illustrating how our management team is continuously reassessing our strategy and business platforms and how they fit with changing market environments in direct alignment with this portfolio of review process we re always refining and reevaluating our cost structure in order to optimize the organization to effectively accomplish our strategic goals sempra has a history of being a prudent cost manager we make thoughtful and deliberate efforts to reduce costs in ways that make our organization efficient but also very effective our continuous cost improvement process is designed to yield long term savings and instill a cost conscious culture across the organization a great example of this is the 65 million of annual savings identified a few years ago at our california utilities that was incorporated into the 2019 grc filings these savings should benefit our customers by allowing us to allocate these dollars to continued infrastructure investments in safety and reliability recently we ve initiated further efforts around continuous cost improvements designed to right size our organization with our evolving business portfolio the announced sale of our assets and other efficiencies will allow us to reduce our corporate costs we expect these cost savings to ramp up to approximately 15 million annually on a pre tax basis over the next few years our management team is committed to reviewing our cost on a regular basis to ensure we run an organization as effectively and sufficiently as possible now please turn to slide 8 where i ll hand the call off to joe joseph a householder president and chief operating officer thanks trevor first i d like to briefly touch on the ienova in mexico mexico is the world s 15th largest economy at over 1 trillion in gdp with nearly 130 million people the infrastructure needs of the country are expected to remain significant for example only 7 of the households have access to natural gas and residential electricity demand is expected to double by 2040 for more than two decades ienova has remained focused on developing energy infrastructure that promotes economic development in a sustainable and socially responsible way ienova is working with the private sector on additional opportunities that should benefit the country such as refined product terminals that should enhance mexico s energy security and the reliability of transportation fuel supplies renewable projects that should increase mexico s clean energy supply and be a source of efficient low cost electricity and the conversion of energia costa azul project to an lng export project that should bring additional regional investment economic development and jobs as ienova mentioned on their call late last week they have proactively engaged in discussions with the current administration related to natural gas transportation contracts that were awarded through public and international tender processes ienova has always had a very constructive relationship with the mexican government and its institutions the company that is committed to being a responsible partner ienova looks forward to working collaboratively to advance the country s energy goals and build out the infrastructure needed to provide clean safe reliable and low cost energy please turn to the next slide moving onto cameron the onsite teams are relentlessly focused on moving to commissioning toward completion of train 1 the contractor has made significant progress recently with the completion of the gas turbine testing commissioning of the boil off gas compressors introduction of fuel gas into the system and completion of all three flares ignition testing in the near term the contractor expects to introduce speed gas sometime this quarter and it also expects to produce lng stabilized production and complete performance testing in the second quarter with that said we expect to start receiving earnings by mid 2019 this first phase of construction which includes train 1 and the associated support systems as well as the common infrastructure that will be used by all three trains represents approximately 60 of the entire project after many years of development and construction all the employees involved as well as the community are excited that the facility will soon be up and running further boosting the local economy while also helping to meet global energy demand as you may have heard on mcdermott s call yesterday the same teams are working hard toward completion of trains 2 and 3 mcdermott reported that train 2 is targeted to be completed by the end of q4 and train 3 is targeted to be completed by the end of q1 2020 this schedule is consistent with what was disclosed on their q3 2018 call please turn to the next slide where trevor will review our financial results trevor i mihalik executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks joe earlier this morning we reported fourth quarter gaap earnings of 864 million or 3 03 per share on an adjusted basis fourth quarter earnings were 431 million or 1 56 per share full year 2018 gaap earnings were 924 million or 3 42 per share this compares to 2017 gaap earnings of 256 million or 1 01 per share on an adjusted basis full year 2018 earnings were 1 503 million or 5 57 per share this compares favorably to our 2017 adjusted earnings of 1 368 million or 5 42 per share please turn to slide 11 where i ll discuss the key drivers impacting our full year 2018 results the year over year increase in full year adjusted earnings was driven primarily by higher operational earnings in 2018 including 371 million of earnings at the sempra texas utility segment resulting from the acquisition of our interest in oncor in march of 2018 65 million of higher earnings at sdg e primarily due to electric transmission operations 25 million of higher earnings at sempra mexico mainly driven by higher pipeline operational earnings and 16 million of higher earnings at socalgas due to higher psep earnings this was partially offset by 310 million of higher costs related to increased interest expense and preferred stock dividends at the parent which includes the impact of our oncor acquisition financing and 21 million unfavorable impact from the foreign currency and inflation effects net of foreign currency hedges in mexico please turn to the next slide several significant business developments since our last analyst conference we thought it would be helpful to provide a brief walk through of the key items related to our affirmation of our 2019 adjusted eps guidance first we removed the earnings associated with the us renewables and nonutility natural gas storage assets subsequent to their respective sale close dates second we added partial year earnings from oncor s planned acquisition of infrareit and our planned acquisition of a 50 equity interest in sharyland and third we added the positive impacts from using the expected 2 5 billion of proceeds from the sale of solar wind and natural gas storage when taking these items into account we are affirming our 2019 adjusted eps guidance range of 5 70 to 6 30 that was presented at the analyst conference last year this is a strong outcome given the significant activity within our business portfolio please turn to slide 13 as we turn our attention to the rest of 2019 we ll continue to focus on the positive momentum we ve developed over the past year we ve identified several goals to progress on our strategic mission to become north america s premier energy infrastructure company they include among others continuing to focus every day on public and employee safety as a cultural imperative optimizing and completing the remaining asset divestitures optimizing cost structures improving the franchise value of our lng business by progressing on our five development projects completing oncor s infrareit acquisition and executing on their growth initiatives in texas and advancing our 2019 general rate case and cost of capital filings at the california utilities among others please turn to the next slide as i stated at the beginning of my comments we are very proud of the great strides we ve made in the many accomplishments in 2018 we delivered strong financial results and our company is aligned for the future we look forward to continuing this progress and feel prepared to meet the challenges and capture strategic opportunities that lie ahead looking to next month we are excited to host many of you in san diego for our analyst conference we will cover several topics including detailed segment guidance for 2019 and 2020 the five year capital plan and rate base growth for our three us utilities our growth outlook in mexico and an update on the progress of our approximately 45 mtpa of lng development opportunities we ll also be hosting a tour of our industry leading weather center at sdg e and highlighting some of the innovative technologies around safety reliability and resiliency that we ve deployed on our systems with that we ll conclude the prepared comments and start to take your questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions we will take our question from greg gordon please go ahead your line is open greg gordon evercore isi analyst hey guys good morning jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer good morning greg greg gordon evercore isi analyst couple of questions great year i m just wondering if you can go into a little bit more detail on how you were able to exceed the high end of the guidance range of the utilities for fiscal year 18 and how do we think about how that sets the stage for going forward jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer greg thank you for the question and thanks for joining the call i think for those of you have followed our company for a long period of time certainly socalgas and the sdg e are kind of the clear drivers underpinning our financial performance i think you can see that year over year there was a lot of growth particularly at sdg e and one of the slides kind of points out some of that oversize growth particularly around the ferc business which is really a function of increased capital investments in and around our high voltage system and our substations as well as a periodic for true up which occurs which was also helped to last year s results i d just like to ask trevor if you like to add any other content around socalgas or sdg e trevor i mihalik executive vice president and chief financial officer yes no thanks jeff i think also one of the things that the utilities are focused on are cost savings and certainly driving cost efficiencies in their businesses but again i think it s really just great operational results that have driven these earnings greg gordon evercore isi analyst great and i know there s been there has been and will probably continue to be a lot of volatility around the peso and i think the assumption you are using is your baseline is a bit higher than where the peso is today so how should we think about how that sort of friction inside the guidance range trevor i mihalik executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i think what i would do is refer you to the rule of thumb that we have in the appendix of the deck and it shows kind of where we are assuming the peso will go by the end of the year and then it has that plus or minus 5 i think if you look at that given where the peso was last year and how we absorbed the peso strengthening in our earnings and we re still well within our guidance i would just kind of direct you to that and i think there s enough other things that we re working on that could offset a strengthening peso greg gordon evercore isi analyst okay i mean just to keep it high levels if i start at the midpoint that should and then flex from their i d be as we go through the year looking at a reasonable approximation of how the peso is affecting your outcomes jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer i would just say i think that s the right approach but i think as we ve seen in the past greg the peso will continue to demonstrate some volatility i think our goal is to make sure that when we put earnings out there and guidance that we can deliver that i think the point trevor was making is we ve got enough levers in our portfolio that we will adequately follow the pace up i think that we feel good very good about our 2019 range greg gordon evercore isi analyst okay final question from me despite the progress that you ve demonstrated at cameron there is still this lingering fear out there in the ether that that somehow this project is either still going to come on late even though we re toward the back end of the construction process or that there is some way that there is incremental financial remuneration that you may have to give to the joint venture constructing the project to get this thing done when do we pass the point of no return where those lingering fears that sort of definitively behind us from your perspective jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer greg i think it s a great question i can assure you that we remain concerned i think that s how you manage because projects has be on top of these types of things i would comment that joe has done a remarkable job with his team and worked with our partners on the cameron build out also i think if you listen mcdermott s call yesterday they have been quite clear but what they believe they can deliver and we will remain active with our partners and managing that relationship against the commissioning timeline joe could you provide some additional color on your conversations with david and how you re approaching it joseph a householder president and chief operating officer thanks jeff i think you d handled that well but greg look together at sempra and our partners and our customers we re very excited about the impending start up at cameron and we re all focused on finishing the commissioning of train 1 and continuing to work on train 2 and 3 and i talked to david quite often and jeff just mentioned he was very strong about his desire to complete this world class facility and their stocks doing very well today and we re working hard toward continuing to push forward greg gordon evercore isi analyst okay thank you guys take care jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer appreciated greg operator thank you we will now take our next question from steve fleishman of wolfe steve fleishman wolfe research analyst yes hi good morning can you hear me jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer hi steve yes steve hi steve fleishman wolfe research analyst great so just jeff question on california so obviously you ve done a good job making avoiding fires invested a lot for your system but there s still i think a lot of outside concerned of just as california done enough to limit risk for the companies and credit agencies putting pressure on you too so i m just kind of curious what you from your standpoint as someone who is not had a fire recently just what you really want the state to do to help address this concern what are you advocating for jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer okay well i appreciate you making the comment that we haven t had a fire for a while it s been since 2007 and i think if there has been anything that s allowed us to create kind of a competitive advantage to protect our rate payers it s experience we went through in 2007 and how hard we ve worked to basically build a system i think that provides a lot of leadership on behalf of our customers but i talked about this a little bit steve in my prepared remarks but here some additional color i think that we ve been in close contact as you would expect with all the key stakeholders in fact we are hosting a lot of key stakeholders from across the state including members of the governor staff here in our building tomorrow to continue to advance what we think the appropriate actions are and i would also complement the governor i think he s walked into a tough situation with strikes in the la unified school district and obviously a lot of the legacy issues in and around the fire areas and he has pushed forward the blue ribbon panel he s pushed forward to strike force there s a lot of conversation from the governors office about trying to deliver results from both of those organizations earlier in the legislative process rather than later on the specifics of what needs to happen i m going to be very clear from sempra s perspective we do not think a strict liability standard is the appropriate standard for investor owned utilities but probably what s most important in our advocacy is to make sure that we always frame our discussions around what s best for ratepayers i mean that really is the fundamental issue in our service model and secondly that whatever the outcomes are either from a regulatory path or a legislative path there is a very clear and defined pathway for timely and adequate cost recovery for utilities that operates our system prudently we filed our wildfire mitigation plan earlier this year it is really kind of a 4 point plan that really focuses number one on fire hardening number two on vegetation management i think we have a world class vegetation management program and our filing attempts to double the frequency which we term our trees in our service territory we re going to add to our aerial assets i think we ve led the nation in terms of the type of helicopter support we ve had on station and if someone used to fly helicopters the utopian goal is to have a 24 hour capability and part of our filing gives us the ability to operate at night time which will be another competitive advantage as you try to fight buyers at one starts and then lastly the fourth part of that plan is we are going to double down our weather stations i think we unified over 60 different weather stations that we re trying to enhance so that not only so we can really extend our fire science advantage in terms of how we predict whether but bottom line is i think there s a lot of different ways to come at this i m pleased with the leadership is being shown from the governors office and i think that the whole goal here is to create a more sustainable and a more fair framework for everyone that s involved in the system steve fleishman wolfe research analyst okay that s very helpful one other question just on the mexico the news from two weeks ago on what the government might want to do with the force majeure situation was there any better clarity just on that specific issue or is it still added more of a high level right now jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer yeah let me make a couple of comments here i ll pass it to joe for some details around the actions relative to that pipeline i think it might be helpful too for dennis to talk about what the united states government is doing to support the key nature of mexico as a partner particularly around natural gas but what i ll try to do steve is remind people that we ve been invested in mexico for over 20 years we re not a company that began invested in projects a year ago or two years ago we have the leading mexican energy company in the country we re ranked in the top 50 on the bolsa obviously as you know it s headquartered in mexico we ve got independent mexican directors and its self funded from local markets and one of the things that we re trying to do is we have a long term view about the opportunity around infrastructure in that country and we believe that the infrastructure opportunity remains quite large steve and as the government continues to focus on expanding services to all the people of mexico their reliance on foreign direct investment will go up it will not go down and i think our value proposition every time we are in front of stakeholders in mexico is to really emphasize our role in bringing new and cleaner sources of energy to the country to help support the economy and give choice and lower cost energy to mexican families but on the specific issue of the pipeline joe in kind of steps that carlos and tania are taking do you want to provide additional color joseph a householder president and chief operating officer thanks jeff hi steve you mentioned a lot of the things that i wanted to mention that we are very focused on providing low cost energy into mexico and one of the things that you know steve is really helpful is the feedstock of natural gas into the electricity market and so obvious pipeline infrastructure is being built around that the situation with the seven pipelines that they referred to the other day was they were as you mentioned in force majeure for various reasons we are involved in two of those in the sonora pipeline as you recall we had that pipeline in operation it was already earning revenues so it s a little bit unlike all the other six which our pipelines haven t gone into service in this case it wasn t service and then there were sabotage and it was damaged and we had to take it out of service and we ve been working with cfe the administration is very focused on making sure that it s getting good value for money than spending so it s actually an opportune time and carlos and tania have been in meeting with cfe so a little bit unlike some other things that have been out in the press we have been a first mover here to go in and meet with various members of various parts of the administration have meetings with cfe and tania is now she is the ceo she is in charge of meeting with cfe to move this along i think it gives us a great opportunity actually to get this pipeline fixed if they could work with us if the government can work with us to work with the local people that were involved in this i think within weeks we could have that pipeline fixed and bringing cheap low cost gas into mexico and i think that will resolve that problem the other one that we re involved in is the marine pipeline that transcanada and we are building and that one s ready to go into service soon we re just working on tying in the thing is substantially done but the offshore pipeline needs to get tied into the onshore pipeline and they are working on that now there is some weather challenges which means wave action that s keeping them from having the vessels tie up these things but we re working on that should be done pretty soon so that will also solve that second one dennis v arriola executive vice president and group president steve this is dennis the other thing i d add to jeff and steve s comments first on the sonora pipeline i think it s important to remember that the auction process there was a competitive process that was run by cfe the terms and conditions were dictated by cfe and i think that was one of the things that our team in mexico may refer to reiterate to the new cfe director and to the president s administration that this was basically a very transparent and fair process the other thing that i had mentioned to you is what we re doing in order to collaborate and support our people in mexico we ve obviously continued to maintain close contact with the state department the department of energy the embassy folks in mexico city to remind them not only of sempra s investment in ienova but the importance of what this means to the united states remember that mexico is the largest natural gas trading partner for the united states and we have a trade surplus from an energy standpoint with mexico so making sure that we maintain fair and transparent rules in mexico for the investments that we have there which are badly needed in the future not only is good for mexico but it serves the interest of the united states and i can tell you that folks in washington dc are supported by watching this closely steve fleishman wolfe research analyst thank you operator thank you we will now take our next question from stephen byrd of morgan stanley stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst hi thank you so much for taking my questions jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer good morning stephen stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst good morning i wondered if you could just talk a little bit more about your dialog with the rating agencies with respect to risk mitigation in california as steve actually mentioned i mean you have a very strong operational track record you re a clearly leader in fire risk mitigation a lot more of your system is underground than other utilities is that being recognized are there real tangible steps in progress that you need to make to avoid ratings downgrades could you just give a little more color on that dialog please jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer i appreciate the question steve and i think the answer in the short form is yes i think if you think about all the strategic initiatives we have a company of undertaken in the last two years we have had very very close contact with the rating agencies because we ve made it a priority to make sure we maintain an investment grade plus balance sheet and your point of differentiation is important and it does resonate with all three agencies we have the best safety program i mean number one in the country and deserves a higher not a lower credit rating we make that point consistently we have been aggressive about derisking our service territory and derisking our overall business model at sempra and that s one of the reasons you ve seen the agencies move down their target ffo to debt metrics based upon our continued focus on t d type of investments second i think there is momentum stephen in the state to correct the market i made this comment earlier in my remarks and to insure ratepayers are protected and if there are cost to be absorbed that there s timely recovery for those folks i guess sdg e they are prudently managing their system so i think the agencies are in a tough spot right i think this is largely been a rerating of the state more so than individual companies but it s our job to be in front of them making sure that they understand that there is true differentiation and separate apart from how the rules change or how the laws change the number one thing to do is to be a leader around how you run your system when you cut your system off how predictive you re about whether that impacts your system and our goal and i think you can see this in our wildfire mitigation plans to take the current leadership we have an extend it based on the investments we re making but i would say with respect sdg e independent of what actions the agencies taken i think we re are going be quite aggressive in terms of defending our franchise we have also taken steps to make sure we have ample liquidity at sdg e stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst well that s super helpful color that actually that last part jeff does touch on and a question we get often from investors just in the event that for any number of reasons the rating agencies do choose to downgrade not just you but potentially other utilities in the state further obviously that s not good for customers in the sense of the cost of capital obviously goes up cost of financing in the long run but in the short run i guess the perspective is you do have quite a bit of liquidity you are not facing fire liabilities you haven t had a fire in 12 years could you maybe give a little more color just on sort of the short term protections you have liquidity et cetera you have just to sort of lay those near term concerns jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer yeah i ll have trevor go ahead and talk through where we re at with our credit lines with socalgas and sdg e and our ability to flex those lines trevor i mihalik executive vice president and chief financial officer yes steve so we have a fairly large credit line at both utilities that we can draw down and those are largely undrawn at the current time and then we also have the ability to continue to issue secured bonds if needed albeit at higher rates but again i think our view on this is we re continuing to defend the fact that we are differentiated in california we had the rating agencies out to come take a look at our fire mitigation plans and they recognize that we are differentiated but again from our perspective the credit lines are 750 million at each of the utilities stephen byrd morgan stanley analyst that s great that s all i had thank you very much jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer thanks steve operator thank you we will now take our next question from julien dumoulin smith of bank of america merrill lynch julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst good afternoon can you hear me jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer yes julien how are you doing julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst good thank you very much so i want to pick up where a couple of last questions are left off first going back to the california policies more broadly i d be curious if you could expand a little bit on the current state of legislative affairs and specifically comment a little bit around the funding or the prefunding potential here for the various ious how do you guys think about that versus other solutions on the table i know it s early days we ve got some draft legislation out there but it seems to be going in a certain direction i m curious if you think that s really where it s going or if there s any other twist that we should be looking at more conceptually not in terms of hard details here jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer i ll make some comments julien and then i ll pass it to dennis to fill in a couple more details but now i think at a high level what i m impressed by is that sb 901 call for this blue ribbon panel to be seeded i think they ve got a diverse group of folks that have their head down are working away on that initiative that report out to the legislature is required by july 1 is my expectation based upon feedback that we ve received that they should be able to finish that work earlier which i think would be helpful from the legislative process the strike team that governor s put together was intentionally designed to bring in independent financial advisors law firms people that specialize really in issues around credit so one of the things that we want to be very proactive is that people really understand the power of the fixed income markets and the importance of the credit ratings across this industry the bottom line is we believe and i think the governor shares our view based on conversations i ve had that the utilities this state deserve and need to have an a rated balance sheet and that is the goal of the process that we re undertaking so there s a lot more work to be done we re going to have a seat at the table i think we re going to have an aggressive outreach i ve been personally involved to make sure that sempra has a seat at the table to improve the overall risk reward profile of both socalgas and sdg e so the process that the state is undergoing should be an opportunity for sempra to have a seat at the table and by the end of the year have improved the franchise value of both of our utilities i ll stop and see if dennis wants to add any color dennis v arriola executive vice president and group president no i think you hit on all the points jeff the only thing i d mention is recall that the strike team that the governor is setup has various representatives whether it s chief or staff people from the finance industry the legal industry folks from insurance so i think it s multifaceted there are a lot of perspectives that are going to be presented in the roadmap and the recommendations to the blue ribbon commission and then their job is going to be really to refine the plan to look at the recommendations of pros and cons of risks and how you can make sure that you can navigate through this process and make those recommendations to the governor and to the legislature by the end of june julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it excellent then just quickly following up on some of the questions on 19 guidance specifically first off i know you guys talked about the 50 million pre tax cost savings effort didn t see that specifically called out here so just wanted to make sure just from a timing perspective how you see that ramping up as you say over the next few years but more specifically here and then also with respect to the california grc here you mentioned the assumptions on attrition certainly there is some early data points shall we say how does that figure into the plus minus math that you show here on the right hand side of slide 12 jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer let me take a stab at that and if we see it needs more detail i ll have trevor jump on it but i think we ve circled to 50 million opportunity around our corporate center and we know exactly where those dollars are coming from we expect to have full run rate of that 50 million julien by the end of the year this isn t a one time event i think you ve heard us talk about this before good companies are always pursuing these type of cost savings and that s why going back to some of trevor s prepared remarks we ran a program like this that our operating companies that in general just over 65 million of savings at sdg e and socalgas and those dollars are currently in the rate case and this 50 million is incremental to that but from time to time we ll take questions on our former ones and so forth and i was looking at some data recently where as an example julien since 2013 just over five years ago sdg e electric o m per customer has decreased by 40 so we ve been able to reduce cost on per customer basis by 12 cagr for five straight years and that includes drop in 500 positions in terms of headcount so we probably in terms of the total o m and sdg e there s probably about 20 that can be directly impacted outside of other required spending they ve done a remarkable job today and that s the type of cost efficiency that was put into our rate case the second thing i ll say is what we ve tried to do at the parent company is as we sell our solar business and our wind business and our natural gas storage business a lot of these cost savings are costs we can realign more efficiently increasing span of control of officers and leaders so that we can have a lower cost platform at the parent company as we sell and become more focused in our strategy and then as to your issues around the 2019 guidance always remind you that we basically took a 100 million out of earnings right so at the analyst conference we forecasted 2019 without any without taking out solar and renewables out of that forecast so in july of last year we we forecasted 5 70 to 6 30 of eps and today that s our exact same guidance after taking 100 billion of earnings out of it for our renewable portfolio and the way you do that is to use the proceeds to pay down parent debt you reinvest in capital programs you go to the investment in texas within infrareit and you continue to find cost savings and i will tell you i expect a 50 million number to go up by the end of the year because we re going to keep going in terms of making our parent company more efficient julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst and grc assumptions nothing to say right nothing to add right now jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer yes i just say on the grc assumptions our convention over the last decade has been to always forecast the existing attrition of 3 5 we ve done that at both of our utilities and i think the filings that you can see from ora and others you can kind of draw your own conclusions in many cases they are actually higher than that but we re not going to guide or change that until we get to this rate case we are focused on making sure we have a good cost of capital filing by april 1st and we re pushing very aggressively to make sure that we can improve the timings of our rate case decision julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst thank you all jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer thank you julien operator thank you we will now take our next question from shah pourreza of guggenheim partners jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer hi shahriar constantine lednev guggenheim partners analyst hey it s actually constantine here for shahriar jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer that s ok constantine lednev guggenheim partners analyst a lot of great questions were answered and congrats on a strong quarter and a great year one kind of short little follow up on the cost of capital filing so any thoughts around kind of how you re thinking about it at this point there has been some kind of early remarks with kind of the ferc roe is done and all that but in light of kind of some of the more recent events kind of what are your thoughts around cost of capital in california jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer i ll give you some thoughts and pass it to trevor but i would just say this as you know at a high level the cost of capital is always intended to be a proxy of the risk associated with our environment right in our regulatory environment so there is no question given the recent developments particularly the northern part of the state that you should expect to see pg e and edison and sdg e and socalgas revisit how that happens right so you re right there are some numbers out there for the first standpoint but we re going to make sure that we re very thoughtful of bringing some independent resources and we re going to put forward something that we think is better reflective of the risk in the marketplace and if some of that risk is resolved that likewise would impact how we would file this but trevor would you add any color trevor i mihalik executive vice president and chief financial officer no i think jeff you really covered it there again as jeff said it s supposed to be a proxy on risk and i think we feel pretty good about where we landed on ferc but we certainly anticipate that cost capital filing should reflect the risk that we re seeing in the state jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer and i would add that bruce folkmann is our cfo at both of our utilities he is a very talented person and he really led the last cost of capital discussion i think on behalf of all three utilities he has a team in place with outside consultants and they ll be putting together a very thoughtful plan about how they approach this and i think that you re raising a great point and this is something that we re very focused on we re going to try to basically improve the regulatory model this year we re going to get a great rate case and we are going to get a cost of capital that s appropriately sized for the type of risk that we expect to manage in the state constantine lednev guggenheim partners analyst perfect thanks and one kind of just detailed question housekeeping on the cost savings program that s being implemented and you ve kind of called out the 50 million in the run rate in the next few in the following few years is there any detail of how to think about the overall kind of costs at the parent and kind of where that 50 million is coming from and where kind of any incremental opportunities lie jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer yes i would just say that the best way to think about this is probably the most common misunderstanding constantine we have an ongoing cost management program every year in the history of the company so sdg e will have stretch goals and one of the ways they reach their stretch goals like you saw the great performance last year and trevor talked about it is continuing to have best practices around technology and innovation and cost efficiency so every single operating company at sempra is very very focused on leveraging technology and innovation to lower their per unit cost for customers what was unique about what the exercise we went through under martha wyrsch and dennis leadership in the last six months was we really revisited opportunities at the parent company because as you sell and dispose some assets and turn your portfolio over it gave us the opportunity to challenge what is the proper role of external affairs and investor relations and financial reporting and you have people at corporate that were directly servicing the solar business or the wind business or natural gas storage so most of the cost opportunity has been around looking at costs associated with the businesses that we re selling and now as you know last month we took the decision to sell our south american utilities that represents another opportunity for us to become more cost efficient at the parent so the long term goal is you got to remember we re going to grow this business at a rate faster than our peers and as we grow this business one of the things we re going to try to do is keep the cost at parent the ones that we control i m not talking about interest expense and preferred dividends and so forth i m talking about the things that we can normally control our job is to keep it flat to declining at the same time that we re scaling the corporate center against a growing set of operating companies constantine lednev guggenheim partners analyst okay so it s fair to kind of assume that as these transactions close and as you go through the transformation process and the savings programs are going to continue further into more than just the 2019 here jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer that s well said and part of that is because we will have ongoing service obligations for short periods of time on the assets that we sold and part of what you re looking at is those service obligations rolling off throughout the year constantine lednev guggenheim partners analyst perfect great thanks those were all my questions thanks jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer thank you constantine operator thank you we will now take our next question from michael lapides of goldman sachs michael lapides goldman sachs analyst hey guys congrats on a good quarter and good end of the year jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer good morning michael michael lapides goldman sachs analyst good morning jeff two questions kind of unrelated to each other first of all the california cost of capital docket given what s happened to your neighbor to the north and just how the california utilities have traded it seems a little bit unusual to meet even half ph the stock i mean how do you calculate the cost to equity for one of the three companies in the state just curious if there s potential to kind of push this out to come back and revisit this at in another year at another time or whether the commissioners and the state as a whole is kind of driving to make sure this happens in 2019 jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer well it s actually a very insightful question if you think back to the california utilities track record around cost of capital you have seen the cost of capital extended for one or two or three years at a time and you ve seen the utilities get engaged from time to time when you see large changes in the marketplace what intrigues me a little bit michael is that there has been a strong voice coming from the credit rating agencies about rerating the state right there s obviously been a very unfortunate bankruptcy in the casualties to the north obviously this has implications to edison as it does to socalgas and sdg e and part of the process i think is going on as you have a change in the governor you got to change in a lot of the members of his administration even some of the energy principles or change in off of governor brown staff so basically have a new guard in sacramento to have some strong voices coming from the credit markets and have the chance to come back in on a timely basis and really lay down some numbers that really point to the cost of not properly managing risk these costs inadvertently get passed on to ratepayers so there is really a hue and cry to fix the market and i actually think this cost of capital process may be additive to that voice and constructive in long term toward getting the action michael lapides goldman sachs analyst got it and then unrelated question just curious there have been a number of lng projects in the us and in north america including canada if their environmental impact statements are ferc certificates and just curious how the lng contracting environment has changed over the last 6 to 12 months and how the economics for new lng for projects like port arthur even ones like costa azul or the cameron expansion look now relative to how they may have looked a year or two years ago jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer great question i think you recall that we were similar to our new management team last summer we took the time michael to do a bottoms up view of what we thought was taken place in the global marketplace and that we had a better feel for that we looked at our own team our own capabilities and you saw us raise our expectations for what we could accomplish michael as well as make some change in terms of how we were leading that organization i would tell you today that i m probably more bullish than i was three or four months ago i mean i think joe and i are on the road starting this weekend going overseas to meet with potential offtakers but to your point you recall that cameron was originally constructed really as a tolling agreement no different you think about as a power plant right you re short gas on one side of the plant and your long lng on the other and we structured that really as a tolling situation where sempra was not really involved in the downstream risk the upstream risk related to that facility one of the things is taking place in the marketplace is the number and type of counter parties has expanded to folks like the oil and gas company in poland is they now expect somewhat at the terminal to go upstream and source the gas and frankly as long as we can do that some form of index where we re not taking the commodity risk we re certainly a business is quite comfortable with transportation so you ve seen the model change a little bit where you re moving probably from a pure toll model toward being able to provide the service of bringing the gas to one side whereas they take all responsibility for the gas on other and look a competitive market always puts pressure on the cost side of it but one of the things i think that i would mention to you is we have a competitive advantage and our competitive advantage is that two of our three sites are brownfield sites number one and number two the fact that we have one on the west coast of north america is a huge advantage and you should be expecting us to push that aggressively in all of our marketing meetings but i ll just stop there joe and see if you will add anything to the contract environment joseph a householder president and chief operating officer the only thing i would say in addition one thing i want to start with is we re going to spend a bunch of time on this at our analyst conference which is coming up in a few weeks so i won t go into too much detail but we are very focused the world has changed a little bit and you re right we are starting to see a lot of action at ferc and our project at port arthur is moving through that queue it s very close in the queue now so it s moving right ahead and so the contracting is indeed important and we have seen a change there was a law for a while now we re starting to see that really come together as jeff said we got airline tickets we re we re heading out and so that shows a good sign we will talk more about this at the conference but we are absolutely right we re starting to see quite a change and we re going to see more and more projects go to fid michael lapides goldman sachs analyst got it thanks guys much appreciated jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer thanks michael operator thank you will now take our next question from paul patterson of glenrock associates jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer hi paul paul patterson glenrock associates analyst hi good morning how are you doing jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer good morning great paul patterson glenrock associates analyst congratulations just want to touch base with you on the wildfire the prudency standard that you guys are looking for at the cpuc and i was wondering in light of sort of the recent activity obviously the bankruptcy at pg e and stuff are you sensing more traction with respect to having the prudency standard of you know to be substantially substantial compliance with the wildfire plan or how are you looking at that it sounds like you and edison sort of have been proposing that in this oir jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer what i would say paul is that one of the things that makes the overall conversation quite complex is that there is a basket of legacy fires some of which were in 17 prelegislation and some of which were in 18 during a gap because the legislation was effective until the first of the year from a big picture standpoint i think sempra has been very much in the position that pg e has been in for a long period of time which we don t think is a strict liability standards the appropriate standard for investor owned utilities right it was intended for a different set of circumstances i think it s very unfortunate that we moved decisions we got at the puc i think that really has been the catalyst for the possibility of there being uncovered or stranded cost actually borne by shareholders and that s led to the situation we re in now so i think the challenge you have paul is that the legislators put a lot of time in sb 901 last year and they thought that they had put the appropriate band aid on the issue and like what we re really asking for is i think the whole process as we looked at de novo with a fresh view i m really encouraged i think the strike force specifically and the blue ribbon panel is not just taking the fact as they are today paul i m really looking at this thing holistically around all the things that dennis talked about the insurance industry what does this mean to tort claims what does this mean to the legal industry and the impacts of the utility so i don t want to make this sound like this is a small change to legislation we have a goal of making sure that we have the chance to operate our system prudently make prudent capital investments and as fires occur from time to time were substantially in compliance with the program as they approved by the commission there should be automatic pass through of costs it s not a discretionary standard paul patterson glenrock associates analyst yes i think that sounds great it would seem to me that regardless of what happens with strict liability or what have you if that standard is adopted i mean obviously there s a lot more that you want to accomplish for a lot of reasons repair costs to be not the least of which but that would be i mean this one issue if you could get that resolved it would seem to me that would go a long way do you follow what i m saying and that might be one way of sort of i mean i know it s not silver bullet but it would be something that would seem to go a long way in solving a lot of this without necessarily relying on the holistic thing to be completely sewn up do you follow what i m saying jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer i do paul and i think first off i think you re spot on but the only caveat i d offer to you is where you start your focus has a direct impact of what you end up resolving and i think that we need to be very clear that s a strict liability standard is the wrong standard at the end of the day you may have the practical solution it maybe less relevant is where that standard goes away or whether that standard is interpreted by rule making that allows for the automatic pass through for people that operate your system prudently so i think you re on to something what i am encouraged by is the leadership the governor is showing the way that he has staffed in saying and asked them to move more quickly and he s asked for them to look at it holistically with a fresh view de novo right so again i can t forecast the future except to say that i think a lot of the right activities are under way and we are optimistic paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay and then just finallym the mcdermott call the discussion of chiyoda came up and i m just wondering we couldn t really obviously and i m not asking you to comment on the chiyoda situation but they themselves as you know said raised ongoing as a ongoing concern question could you just remind us what kind of contingencies we have if in fact chiyoda isn t able to meet its obligations jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer i will start and i ll see if joe wants to add some color but i think in our remarks what you ve heard is that the partnership has been very engaged with the epc contractors and particularly mcdermott has been very clear about what their expectations are for delivering the project and obviously those two parties are jointly and separately liable for their obligations under that contract and it s a full epc wrap contract right so those obligations reside with the epc but i got to tell you we have had great conversations with david dixon i think he has looked at this with clear eyes he understands the challenges and we have confidence and the ability to deliver it but joe if you want to comment further on some of the details around those two parties joseph a householder president and chief operating officer thanks jeff i think you really hit the main points great epc contract joint and separate liability also as we said a few times in the past we do have letters of credit backstopping this in typical amounts that you would see in a contract of this nature and so those are the kinds of things we always have to plan for any risk and so we have a lot of work around all of this with our partners but we feel really confident david s very confident that is going to focus and get this project done and i believe he is focused on it paul patterson glenrock associates analyst awesome thanks so much guys jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer thank you paul operator thank you we ll now take our last question from winfried fruehauf of winfried fruehauf consulting winfried fruehauf winfried fruehauf consulting analyst good morning jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer hello winfried winfried fruehauf winfried fruehauf consulting analyst i have a question about pg e and is a two part question one is what lessons has sempra learned from the bankruptcy filing or yes that s the first question the second question is are there any opportunities for asset purchases from pg e by sempra jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer well thank you for that question i ll start with the second part of the question first and i ll circle back the lessons learned i think you recall you followed us for a long time winfried that we don t typically comment on any type of m a activity as we ve had discussions on our management team our slate of organic spending in our core businesses here in north america over the next two years is quite significant one of the things you should expect for our management team is to have our head down and make sure we execute well our financial plans for 2019 and 2020 on the larger issue of lessons learned it s quite interesting we learned a lot winfried from our 2007 wildfire we viewed it like an existential threat 10 years ago and it really has informed our view that we have to get better and we have to provide leadership we have to be innovative and everything we do is open source i mean all the progress we ve made we re more than willing to share with others but i will give you one discrete thing from the bankruptcy that we find interesting is you ll see a lot of numbers out there about the potential costs that are contingent liabilities related to the renewable contracting and you ll hear numbers above 30 billion being forecasted in large portions of that be an out of market cost it goes back to over the last four or five years the deep strategic process that our board has led we made the decision number one that we wanted to exit fossil fired generation we ve made the decision to exit renewable generation we do not get involved in lifting natural gas or oil or field processing so we ve moved further and further away from generation and commodity and procurement and as early as 2014 myself and steve and davis at sdg e decided to stop all of our renewable purchases at sdg e because we re well ahead of the game at that time so i think the lesson that points to here is it s very important to make sure we re doing all the right things to advance the clean energy transition but it s also important that we re doing that in a way which is thoughtful around price diversity of supply in a balanced energy program and i think that what you see at pg e continues to confirm sempra s business model number one of focus in on t d and the prudency i think that we ve shown around a balanced energy approach to the commodity side of the business winfried fruehauf winfried fruehauf consulting analyst that s very helpful thanks very much jeffrey jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer i appreciate it winfried we hope we see you at the analyst conference winfried fruehauf winfried fruehauf consulting analyst i m not so sure because i m physically still not in a position to do much traveling jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer okay we wish you the best and look forward to staying in touch with you winfried fruehauf winfried fruehauf consulting analyst thank you goodbye jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer bye bye operator thank you as there are no further questions we ll hand the call back to jeff martin for closing remarks jeffrey w martin chairman and chief executive officer look i just like to thank everyone for joining us today i ll conclude by saying that i m very pleased with our team and i think we re excited about the progress we ve made on our strategy and we look forward to seeing all of you at our upcoming analyst conference here in san diego later in march if you have any follow up

america can afford a green new deal here s how credit ai generated image u s rep alexandria ocasio cortez and sen ed markey are calling for a green new deal that would involve massive government spending to shift the u s economy away from its reliance on carbon their congressional resolution goes into great detail about the harms of climate change and what the u s government should do about it left unanswered however is how america would pay for it some commentators have been calling a green new deal unaffordable with some estimates putting the bill for complete decarbonization at as high as us 12 3 trillion as the author of the united nations environment program s global green new deal a plan to lift the world economy out of the 2008 2009 great recession i disagree i believe there are two straightforward ways to cover the cost and help accelerate the green revolution while lowering the overall price tag what a green new deal may cost before we talk about how to pay for it first we need a rough idea of how much it might actually cost for starters it s important to be realistic rather than putting a price tag on going 100 percent renewable which would take decades i believe we should figure out how much to spend over the next five years to build a greener economy ambitious efforts to foster green energy during the great recession are a good place to start in total the world s largest 20 economies and a few others spent 3 3 trillion to stimulate economic growth of that more than 520 billion was devoted to green investments such as pollution cleanup recycling and low carbon energy the u s share of that was about 120 billion or about 1 percent of its gross domestic product around half of this went toward energy conservation and other short term energy efficiency investments to quickly shore up the then nascent recovery and generate employment the stimulus may have spurred some growth in renewable energy but didn t do much on its own to reduce carbon emissions permanently another country that made fairly big green investments during the great recession was south korea which promoted low carbon green growth as its new long term development vision it allocated 60 billion or 5 percent of its 2007 gdp to a five year plan but in the end south korea may have spent only 26 billion on low carbon energy and failed to adopt pricing reforms and other incentives to foster renewables such as phasing out fossil fuel subsidies pricing carbon and improving regulatory frameworks the result was only a modest improvement in energy efficiency and carbon emissions have continued to rise in other words the price tag of a green new deal that would make a difference would have to be much higher than what governments like the u s and korea actually spent during the great recession the original south korea five year plan however to spend 5 percent of gdp to me seems about right as the best guess of the public investment needed to decarbonize a major economy through a green growth strategy so if we use korea as a starting point that means the u s would need to spend around 970 billion over the next five years or 194 billion annually how to pay for the green new deal as for paying for it the first thing to bear in mind is that in my view a green new deal should be covered by current rather than future revenue a common way for congress to pay for the cost of a new program or stimulus is by deficit spending so the u s borrows the money from investors and then eventually has to pay it back through taxes down the road with the federal deficit projected to reach 1 trillion in 2019 increasing it by several hundred billion more even if for a good cause is not a great idea ballooning deficits add to the national debt which is already 21 trillion and counting saddling future generations of americans with unsustainable levels of national debt is just as dangerous as burdening them with an economy that is environmentally unsustainable deficit spending is warranted to boost overall demand for goods and services when unemployment rises consumers do not spend and private investment is down when that is not the case i believe efforts to grow green sectors should pay for themselves so the u s would have to find new revenue sources to finance additional government support for clean energy research and development greening infrastructure smart transmission grids public transport and other programs under any green new deal two of the main ways to do that would be by raising new revenues or finding savings elsewhere in the budget on the revenue side i believe passing a carbon tax is one of the best ways to go a 20 tax per metric ton of carbon that climbs over time at a pace slightly higher than inflation would raise around 96 billion in revenue each year covering just under half the estimated cost at the same time it would reduce carbon emissions by 11 1 billion metric tons through 2030 in other words not only does it help raise money to pay for a transition to a green economy a carbon tax also helps spur that very change in terms of savings the removal of fossil fuel subsidies is a particularly appropriate target consumer subsidies for fossil fuels and producer subsidies for coal cost u s taxpayers nearly 9 billion a year these subsidies could be shifted instead to cover some expenditures under a green new deal and again doing this would accelerate the transition to cleaner energy so where might the other 89 billion come from one option is to simply impose a higher carbon tax a 20 tax would put the u s roughly in the middle among countries that currently impose carbon taxes but doubling it to 40 per ton would raise an additional 76 billion annually or 172 billion in total as well as reduce 17 5 billion metric tons of carbon by 2030 another idea is to raise taxes on the highest earning americans for example imposing a 70 percent tax on earnings of 10 million or more would bring in an addtional 72 billion a year cost savings but it s also possible that the cost of decarbonizing the economy may fall over time for example the drop in emissions accompanying the carbon tax should lower the price tag in a way that s hard to estimate today the right policies and reforms would also help lower the costs in a sort of chicken and egg effect as economists ken gillingham and james stock have shown green innovations spur demand which leads to more innovation all of which ultimately reduce costs a good illustration is purchases of electric vehicles which will stimulate demand for charging stations once installed the stations will reduce the costs of running electric vehicles and further boost demand the green new deal as proposed by ocasio cortez and markey would be expensive but what policies are adopted and how we choose to pay for it could ultimately determine the plan s success and whether we can afford it

presentation i just referenced with that i ll turn the call over to dale dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director thank you brendan good morning everyone and thanks for joining us i m pleased to report fourth quarter reported sales grew almost 18 compared to prior year led by the acquisition of interface performance materials which contributed 34 million of revenue in the quarter on a consolidated basis lydall sales for the full year of 2018 were up 2 2 organically with growth across all segments compared to prior year gross margin in the fourth quarter was down and continue to be negatively impacted by higher labor and overhead costs and to a lesser degree raw material inflation however we did see sequential gross margin expansion of a 160 basis points from the third quarter 2018 led by strong gains in performance materials and thermal acoustic solutions partially offset by lower gross margin and technical nonwovens we saw end market softened in the fourth quarter particularly in china adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were 0 52 compared to 0 67 in the fourth quarter of 2017 and included 0 13 of incremental amortization from acquisitions slide 3 outlines our recently published financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 i will briefly cover key highlights and randy will take you through the results in detail when he provides a summary of our financial performance fourth quarter 2018 net sales of 209 9 million were a record for lydall increasing 31 9 million or 17 9 from the same period in 2017 organically sales were down 800 000 or 0 4 ph impacted by softness in the china market in technical nonwovens and thermal acoustical solutions filtration sales in performance materials and north american sales of industrial filtration and technical nonwovens were both up double digits while european part sales in thermal acoustic solutions grew mid single digits inorganic growth added 35 5 million to the top line tooling sales were essentially flat and fx was a headwind of 2 9 million or 1 7 fourth quarter 2018 adjusted gross margin declined 200 basis points to 20 3 driven primarily by higher costs in the thermal acoustic solutions and technical nonwovens segments while commodity inflation on aluminum has eased in the final quarter of the year we are still seeing higher costs for midwest premium and conversion costs in addition incremental manufacturing costs in thermal acoustic solutions negatively impacted margins the technical nonwovens segment saw lower volumes in the quarter along with continued high cost for aramid fibers and competitive pricing pressures full year adjusted gross margin of 19 9 was down 380 basis points on higher material labor and overhead costs as a recap for the full year 2018 commodity and material increases impacted the business unfavorably by approximately 12 million or a 150 basis points approximately 5 million of this headwind was reduced by material productivity and where possible pricing actions the remaining headwinds of approximately 7 million was primarily in the thermal acoustic solutions business which experienced significant increases in aluminum costs and to a lesser degree higher cost on stainless steel these increases were driven by commodity index volatility and tariff related impacts including higher market premiums and conversion costs as well as incremental cost for resourcing material the overall decline in gross margin was partially mitigated by continued discipline on sg a expenses adjusted for restructuring strategic initiatives amortization and the addition of interface sg a expenses were down over 3 million principally on lower incentive and stock compensation expense related to lower achievement of financial targets the resulting adjusted ebitda margin for the fourth quarter was 12 1 down 70 basis points from the prior period but notably improved a 130 basis points from the third quarter of 2018 adjusted earnings were 0 52 per share down 0 15 from the fourth quarter 2017 including 0 13 of incremental amortization expense and 3 million of incremental interest expense associated with the borrowings for the interface acquisition turning to slide 4 this is an overview of our long term growth strategy which includes four drivers new product development lean six sigma geographic expansion and m a with respect to acquisitions the completion of the interface performance materials in the third quarter was a major milestone for lydall our short term focus remains on successfully integrating the new business into our performance materials segment randy will cover additional financial details on the acquisition but with four months behind us i m happy to report that the business performance is meeting our expectations moving on to product development activities i d like to highlight two innovative engineering materials products applications in performance materials and technical nonwovens first is a ceiling product application and our new interface performance materials business bonded spacer plates are multi layer gasket assemblies used to seal metal surfaces in automatic transmissions interface has developed a high performance material to be used in this demanding application which are used by all major oem equipment manufacturers globally the materials provided in a roll form or finished gaskets and has been very positively received in the market we expect bonded spacer plate sales to grow at double digit rates in 2019 through both market growth and share gains in technical nonwovens we have developed an innovative new application of nonwoven felts in architectural acoustical applications ceiling and wall panels constructed of nonwoven felts can provide significant acoustical reduction in open environment such as offices and other commercial and public spaces panels can be tailored by architects to provide high quality aesthetics stiffness durability chemical resistance and even designed to meet the latest fire protection standards they can be molded and precision cut into various shapes providing customers a flexible simple and cost effective solution compared to traditional materials we continue to receive strong market interest and we ll be investing to support this high growth application in 2019 and beyond the previously announced restructuring initiatives in technical nonwovens focused on the consolidation of the china manufacturing sites as you recall we reached a milestone in the third quarter with the reduction of our footprint from four locations to three and remaining activity will focus on further consolidation to two facilities in china site rationalization activities in europe s are well under way with the consolidation of felt making operations in the uk and germany expected to be completed mid 2019 these initiatives will better leverage our business to be more efficient and further strengthened our scale and positioning in these markets as we near the completion of the program we are revising our estimate on the total restructuring expense to approximately 4 2 million down from our prior estimate of 5 million we continue to expect run rate synergy benefits of 5 million by the end of 2019 to date approximately 3 million have been invested in this program with the remaining spend of approximately 1 2 million we incurred largely in the first half of 2019 turning to slide 5 with respect to business conditions overall we believe the underlying fundamentals of our business remained steady but we will continue to monitor government actions that impact global trade relations on the supply side we continue to see movement in the aluminum market after significant volatility in the first half of 2018 lme prices for aluminum eased in the second half of the year with fourth quarter average settling at approximately 0 89 a pound down approximately 0 06 from the third quarter of 2018 while the index price is down from the fourth quarter of 2017 we continue to see year over year upward pressure on local premiums duties and tariffs and conversion costs for aluminum sheet products used in the thermal acoustic solutions business as a reminder lydall does have pass through arrangements based on the lme index in place for approximately 1 5 of the effective business volumes but there is typically a three to six months lag on recovery in addition we are closely monitoring polyester fiber pricing the key input across all lydall business units and continue to see supply constraints and higher prices on meta aramid prices and input for certain specialty technical nonwoven applications and certain gasket applications and performance materials finally we are continuing to work on our alternate supply arrangements for all key raw material inputs impacted by the most recent round of 10 tariffs as a counter measure to the higher 25 tariffs that could be implemented in march 2019 pending the outcome of the ongoing trade discussions on the demand side the domestic automotive market continues to show favorable results in the fourth quarter of 2018 with us light vehicle seasonally adjusted annual rates ending 2018 at 17 3 million units for the year current forecast for 2019 indicate domestic light vehicle production levels slightly down at 16 9 million units and western european automotive volumes are forecasted to be flat china volumes are expected to grow modestly despite contracting each month in the second half of 2018 given this global outlook and the mix of applications and platforms in our product portfolio we expect to slightly outpace the market on a volume basis looking to our filtration and engineering materials business performance materials end markets continue to show stability in europe domestically and are offset by softness in china strong demand for filtration products in the first half of 2018 continue to trend positively in the fourth quarter and we expect that to continue in 2019 sales of specialty cryogenic installation softened in the third quarter but stabilized in the fourth quarter finally in our technical nonwovens segments we are experiencing stable demand for industrial filtration products but are closely monitoring demand in china that softened in the fourth quarter north america demand for industrial filtration markets remain healthy and european demand is stable but could be impacted by the outcome of brexit negotiations the advanced material end markets outside of the automotive applications also remain healthy global technical nonwovens has a robust backlog entering into 2019 with that i will now turn the call over to randy randall b gonzales executive vice president chief financial officer thank you dale turning to slide 6 i ll briefly cover our consolidated results and then provide an overview of our operating segment results before i start discussing financial results i d like to point out that we began reporting segment ebitda for q4 results and we ll continue to do so moving forward segment ebitda is a non gaap measure for each business segment and is defined as operating income plus depreciation amortization and equity method income for that segment we have adopted this approach as we believe it provides a basis to evaluate core operating performance of each segment and provides an indication of the segment s ability to generate cash there is no change the ebitda reporting of consolidated lydall results which is reconciled from net income by adding back interest taxes other income and expense and income from equity method in addition consistent with our current reporting practice that provides adjusted gross margin and adjusted operating margin we will also report adjusted segment ebitda which adjusts financial results for nonrecurring unique or one time items such as strategic initiatives restructuring and purchase accounting adjustments related to inventory step up the details on these important metrics are provided in the press release and 10 k moving on to financial results sales in the fourth quarter of 2018 were 209 9 million up 31 9 million or 17 9 from fourth quarter 2017 acquisitions in the performance materials segment contributed 35 5 million or 20 points of this growth foreign exchange was a headwind of 1 7 points primarily on a weaker euro and canadian dollar and tooling sales of 6 3 million were flat compared to fourth quarter 2017 the resulting organic growth was down 0 4 driven primarily by technical nonwovens which saw a softer sales in china and lower intercompany sales to thermal acoustical solutions year to date sales of 785 9 million was up 12 5 or 2 2 organically with acquisitions adding 7 points of growth and fx in tooling adding 1 5 points and 1 8 points respectively all segments showed organic growth for the full year note that our year to date sales includes 4 3 million related to the new accounting standard that impacts the timing of revenue recognition primarily for recognition of tooling sales in thermal acoustical solutions and certain customer orders in technical nonwovens as a reminder under the new standard lydall predominantly recognizes tooling sales as costs are incurred over time in contrast to the prior practice of recognizing tooling revenues upon acceptance and delivery to the customer the net impact to gross profit was 1 3 million reported fourth quarter gross margin of 19 9 was down 230 basis points from prior year excluding 600 000 of inventory step up related to the interface acquisition and restructuring and severance charges in both periods adjusted gross margin of 20 3 was down 200 basis points the primary drivers of this reduction were in thermal acoustical solutions were higher labor and overhead costs drove a 130 basis points of consolidated gross margin erosion and higher commodity costs and unfavorable mix in technical nonwovens consolidated operating margin for the fourth quarter was 6 3 including 600 000 of expenses related to corporate strategic initiatives 600 000 of inventory step up and 400 000 of expenses related to restructuring activities adjusting for these items operating margin in the fourth quarter 2018 was 7 down 240 basis points from prior year including a 130 basis points of higher intangibles amortization expense adjusted sg a expense was up 5 million impacted by 2 9 million higher amortization and incremental sg a from interface acquisition offset by 2 8 million lower spending on incentive compensation pay resulting from lower achievement of target financial metrics adjusted ebitda for the quarter was 25 4 million or 12 1 of sales compared with 12 8 in the fourth quarter 2017 period and up 130 basis points sequentially from the third quarter of 2018 year to date adjusted ebitda is 90 2 million or 11 5 of sales the reported effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 26 6 the rate was negatively impacted by 5 3 points of discrete tax items in the quarter primarily from clarification of new tax regulations related to the 2017 tax reform act adjusted for this and other discrete items the tax rate would have been in the range of 21 compared to the fourth quarter 2017 reported effective tax of 5 3 which was favorably impacted by a one time benefit related to the 2017 tax reform act entering 2019 we anticipate the consolidated ordinary tax rate to be in the range of 20 to 22 fourth quarter 2018 earnings per diluted share were 0 42 compared to 0 80 of earnings in the prior year when adjusting for strategic initiatives expenses inventory step up restructuring and severance expenses and discrete tax items adjusted earnings per share of 0 52 were down 0 15 compared to adjusted eps of 0 67 delivered in the fourth quarter of 2017 with higher acquisition related amortization contributing 0 13 of this difference for the full year adjusted eps of 2 43 is down 0 37 including 0 21 of incremental amortization expenses cash flows provided by operations in the fourth quarter were strong at 30 2 million driven primarily by reductions in accounts receivable for the full year 2018 cash flow from operations totaled 44 7 million this compares with cash flow of 62 9 million in 2017 with the decrease driven by lower net income and higher working capital our liquidity remained strong at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018 cash was 49 2 million total outstanding debt from the credit facility at year end was 324 8 million for a net debt ratio of approximately 2 8 times adjusted ebitda down from approximately 2 9 times in the third quarter of 2018 entering 2019 cash generation and working capital reduction will be key focus areas as we look to accelerate debt pay down as it relates to capital expenditures lydall spent 11 2 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 up from 7 1 million spent in the fourth quarter of 2017 full year 2018 spending of 31 3 million is consistent with our prior guidance of 30 million and 35 million for 2019 we anticipate capital spend to increase to 40 million to 45 million driven by the full year impact of the interface acquisition and discrete investments to support organic growth in all segments finally during the fourth quarter of 2018 lydall authorized termination of the us lydall pension plan which with completion anticipated in 2019 as a result we currently estimate incurring pension expense of approximately 29 million to 33 million these charges will consists primarily of non cash charges with an estimated 2 million to 4 million cash contribution further detail on the plan is also provided in the 10 k under footnote 10 moving to slide 7 i ll discuss our segment results i ll start with our thermal acoustical solutions segment this is our global automotive business that specializes in providing an innovative engineered thermal and acoustical solutions for vehicle under hood underbody power train and exhaust applications fourth quarter sales in this business were 85 6 million down 0 5 organically net part sales of 79 3 million were down 1 3 million with lower acoustical shielding sales domestically and 17 lower thermal shielding sales in china partially offset by higher part sales in europe tooling sales of 6 3 million were flat and foreign exchange primarily the euro reduced sales growth by 1 point for the full year sales grew 6 8 on a reported basis and 1 6 organically adjusted segment ebitda margin of 13 declined 420 basis points from fourth quarter of 2017 higher labor and overhead cost continued in the quarter impacting margins by 290 basis points compared to prior year but we have seen improvement from third quarter 2018 while commodity index pricing for aluminum was down marginally year over year the total cost for aluminum including higher domestic premiums and conversion costs impacted margins unfavorably by 50 basis points we continue to actively monitor commodity pricing given the dynamic context of current global trade discussions finally consistent with prior periods customer price reductions impacted margin by 90 basis points compared to prior year of note segment ebitda margin expanded by a 150 basis points compared with third quarter of 2018 for the full year segment ebitda margin was 12 9 moving to slide 8 i will cover our performance materials segment this business provides specialty filtration and insulation solutions to a variety of end markets globally and the addition of interface performance materials broadens the portfolio with engineered ceiling solutions across myriad of industries as a reminder lydall report sales data under two product categories filtration consist of sales for air and liquid filtration applications including filtration applications previously reported under the legacy life sciences segment ceiling and advanced solutions encompasses the new interface performance materials gasketing and ceiling applications as well as sales previously reported under thermal insulation which consisted of specialty insulation for high temperature and ultra low temperature or cryogenic applications sales of 65 6 million were up 36 5 million or 126 compared to prior year including 35 5 million of sales from the interface and precision filtration acquisitions fx was a slight headwind in the quarter with resulting organic growth of 4 2 primarily on higher filtration sales full year sales of 169 2 million included 48 9 million from acquisitions and 2 million of favorable foreign exchange netting organic growth of 1 4 fourth quarter segment ebitda margin adjusted for 600 000 of inventory step up was essentially flat from prior year at 15 7 with modest gross margin expansion offset by slightly higher sg a expenses associated with the interface integration for the full year adjusted segment ebitda margin grew by 40 basis points to 14 4 interface performance materials business is off to a solid start contributing over 45 million in sales in 2018 with ebitda margins in line with our expectations and accretive to the portfolio as a recap in 2018 purchase accounting adjustments for inventory step up were 2 million and incremental intangibles amortization was 3 4 million moving into 2019 we do not expect any further adjustments for inventory step up but as previously discussed we estimate amortization related expenses to total 16 2 million an increase of 12 8 million from 2018 as a result while we continue to expect the deal will be cash accretive in 2019 it will be minimally accretive to reported eps in 2019 slide 9 covers our technical nonwovens segment this segment produces air and liquid filtration media as well as other engineered products for use in various commercial applications such as geosynthetics automotive industrial and medical among others for the fourth quarter of 2018 sales of 64 7 million were down organically 4 7 or 3 3 million net of unfavorable foreign exchange of 2 5 globally industrial filtration sales were down 2 5 with a 35 decline in china driven by softer demand and timing of orders partially offset by healthy gains in north america sales in advanced materials were down 12 9 primarily in north america on lower sales of needle felts to the thermal acoustical segment and lower sales in canada which were impacted by a shorter construction period compared to fourth quarter of 2017 and a weaker canadian dollar backlog for all regions remained solid but we are closely monitoring china from a profitability perspective adjusted segment ebitda margin of 11 7 was down 210 basis points driven by higher material costs particularly for meta aramid fibers net of increased customer pricing higher labor costs unfavorable mix and lower absorption also contributed as a reminder adjusted segment ebitda excludes 400 000 or 50 basis points of expenses related to ongoing restructuring activities in the quarter compared to 200 000 or 30 basis points in the same period last year for the full year technical nonwovens adjusted segment ebitda was 13 6 down 150 basis points from full year 2017 driven principally on higher materials costs that were partially but not fully offset by pricing actions in unfavorable product mix that concludes our review of the fourth quarter and full year results year to date top line growth was favorable driven by generally healthy demand in the end markets we serve as we enter 2019 we remain focused on the operational items that we can control integrating the interface acquisition into the performance materials portfolio completing restructuring in technical nonwovens and continued improvement in operational performance and cash flow generation leveraging these improvements on continued strength in our end markets position us to deliver solid performance in 2019 with that we will begin our question and answer session questions and answers operator operator instructions and our first question comes from matt koranda of roth capital partners matt koranda roth capital partners analyst hey guys good morning dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director good morning matt matt koranda roth capital partners analyst i want to start out with tas i know you guys referenced in your prepared remarks the aluminum and sort of other indices showing kind of flattish or even decent declines year to date which should be a tailwind i assume for 2019 but you referenced conversion costs are still elevated some of the premiums as well so are we factoring in a net tailwind or a headwind from tas in 2019 in terms of how it kind of fits into the overall outlook for consolidated ebitda margin expansion for the full year dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director yes matt overall obviously it will depend on what happens with the lme which to your point so far and in q4 actually was a tailwind it was a benefit the remaining pieces for the midwest premium and conversion costs as we ve talked about in some prior calls a lot of that capacity had to be locked in in 2018 to secure it for 2019 so those components will be flat to slightly up essentially a headwind if you will so we re really going to see how it pans out through the whole year hopefully if aluminum pricing continues to softened and we can pick up that benefit it will help us but right now i d say it s probably a net flat to a headwind matt koranda roth capital partners analyst okay that s helpful and then in that segment just sticking with it for the quarter at least i think you guys referenced a 130 bps of higher labor and overhead as a headwind to margins in the quarter and also i think higher commodities were like 50 basis points what accounts for sort of the remaining bucket in terms of headwinds to margin in q4 dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director you re talking specifically in the tas segment matt or are you talking the lydall consolidated matt koranda roth capital partners analyst tas specifically randall b gonzales executive vice president chief financial officer yes so matt another big piece of that is the price downs that we see on an annual basis so you captured two out of the three so it s labor and overhead increases commodity cost increases and then it s the price downs that affect the gross margin as well matt koranda roth capital partners analyst okay that s helpful and then just in terms of the pricing environment in tas i mean are you seeing any additional pressure on that front or is it pretty steady in terms of the kind of the normal range that you see on price downs randall b gonzales executive vice president chief financial officer in the fiber product line probably a little more aggressive pricing pressure in the metals product line it s the traditional 1 to 2 down each year matt koranda roth capital partners analyst okay great that s helpful and then just in terms of like when i kind of do the back of the envelope math on cash flow for 2019 it looks promising any and i know you guys highlighted sort of the intent to repay sort of the debt associated with interface anything any additional color you can share on sort of plans for debt paydown for the year and sort of how you re thinking about that dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director i mean matt we re i don t think we re going to give any guidance in terms of a particular number on debt paydown but we re targeting by end of 2019 to be at about a 2 5 net debt leverage ratio matt koranda roth capital partners analyst okay all right that s helpful guys i ll jump back in the queue dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director from where we stand today have about 2 8 matt koranda roth capital partners analyst got it operator the next question comes from edward marshall of sidoti company edward marshall sidoti company analyst good morning guys how are you dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director just fine good morning ed randall b gonzales executive vice president chief financial officer good morning edward marshall sidoti company analyst so looking at the overhead the labor the freight that incurred in the quarter it did drop from q3 but probably not as much as i would have anticipated following up on the q3 call i m curious as we look into 2019 the cadence of that decline is it still that overhead that labor is it still associated with the new product or new product qualifications dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director yes product launches still have a slight impact but not near the impact that it had in 2018 for our point of reference in 2018 tas launched a 163 new tools in 2019 we re anticipating it to be around 50 so a lot of the launch activity is behind us we saw in the fourth quarter over a 20 improvement in our operational efficiency metrics which includes scrap over time outsourcing and so we did see a significant improvement we expect that to continue the one thing that we will have some overhang through probably the third quarter of 2019 is we will still incur some outsourcing expense on a couple of items where we re waiting for some new assets to come in place to provide the capacity to handle that edward marshall sidoti company analyst got it so if we could look at maybe the consolidated grouping of these costs in 2018 and think about what they might do in 2019 can you kind of frame give a frame of reference as to the impact that you expect versus the impact that you felt quantify if you could dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director for 2018 edward marshall sidoti company analyst 18 versus yes i mean if you can quantify it for 2018 dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director yes for 2018 versus what we anticipated there was probably about this is excluding the material inflation that we experienced it was probably about 5 million edward marshall sidoti company analyst in total for overheads additional labor dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director yes outsourcing and everything edward marshall sidoti company analyst outsourcing dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director and then you add to that the raw material impact of about 7 million edward marshall sidoti company analyst and your anticipation for 2019 of that 5 million how much will recur reoccur dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director there ll be a significant reduction i mean we saw so far in the first two months very very good improvement but we ll have to see as some of the new platforms go into production volume how well we run those assets but we re anticipating a significant improvement in 19 versus 18 edward marshall sidoti company analyst got it and a lot of the metal programs if i could are centered around some european production my understanding is that some of the new introductions for 2019 have been delayed or kind of wait and see stuff that was supposed to be released in q1 might take till q3 have you seen that disruption in your manufacturing process or are those unique to specific applications that you re not producing dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director well we have seen and really most of our new launches are in the united states this year ok we are seeing increases in europe but the high volume of the new metal volume will come in the united states we have seen some delays from both gm and mercedes on the launches of their new products that are consuming some of our new metal shields edward marshall sidoti company analyst got it dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director they re saying right what we re hearing from is that they expect full year recovery but just delay in the start edward marshall sidoti company analyst got it midway through this year there was a fire at one of your suppliers i just want to be certain that and i think your expectation was that you wouldn t make up the lost production at least that was your comment coming out of q3 in the fourth quarter that that customer had did you see an uptick from that customer as it would relate to recover some of those lost vehicles or lost production dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director no we have not they did not increase the volume they told us they would when the incident occurred so no that did not happen edward marshall sidoti company analyst you give some good color on the top line for interface and i m curious if you could kind of talk about maybe the expectations or if you could give us a profile and the contribution to profits either in whether in q4 or maybe what your expectations are for 2019 randall b gonzales executive vice president chief financial officer so ed when we announced interface what we talked about was annual revenues in the 150 million range and an annual ebitda in the 29 million range so other than that that s the that continues to be our expectation and i don t think we re prepared to give any additional guidance beyond that our initial edward marshall sidoti company analyst did you give the step up i m sorry randall b gonzales executive vice president chief financial officer sorry go ahead edward marshall sidoti company analyst did you give the step up in the amortization that you anticipate for 2019 randall b gonzales executive vice president chief financial officer yes so step up we re it s complete for 2018 it was a total of 2 million don t anticipate any additional expense related to that in 2019 for full year amortization we expect it to be a little more than 21 million the majority of that is going to be related to the interface acquisition edward marshall sidoti company analyst 21 million step up or 21 million total for the year randall b gonzales executive vice president chief financial officer yes 21 million of amortization in 2019 edward marshall sidoti company analyst is that an increase from 2019 or are you saying 20 million increase or 21 million in total randall b gonzales executive vice president chief financial officer no absolute number of almost 21 5 million of amortization that s on a consolidated basis that s for everything in 2019 versus full year of 9 4 million in 2018 dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director right so ed just to be clear incremental almost 13 million amortization year over year edward marshall sidoti company analyst 13 million incremental great thanks that s what i was looking for and then finally i just i wanted to look for a i wanted to ask somewhat of a strategic question about your tooling and kind of new product initiations and with the change in the accounting i m kind of thinking through maybe some of the changes that you can make to kind of recognition of that tooling in that revenue is there anything that you can kind of do that we don t find ourselves in 2018 event in the future having a pretty hefty rollout in product introduction and the recognition of that revenue and the profit impact as well dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director yes i mean ed i don t think there s anything we can do as far as changing the regulation it is what it is it s an accounting practice and we will continue to adhere to it it s just a matter of the volume of tooling that we have we will have to continue to report the revenue and income as per the latest accounting standard edward marshall sidoti company analyst right randall b gonzales executive vice president chief financial officer yes ed it really kind of comes down to each contract and each customer and there are several criteria that could be evaluated in terms of when and how to properly recognize the revenue so yes it s we ll continue to follow the appointed guidance and go from there edward marshall sidoti company analyst okay i appreciate the comments thanks dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director thank you ed operator and next we have a question from chris moore of cjs securities chris moore cjs securities analyst hey good morning guys dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director good morning chris chris moore cjs securities analyst good morning maybe we could just start kind of big picture i know you walked through kind of the broad prospects of each segment and obviously you don t give specific guidance but i mean if you were to rank the three segments from where you re sitting today likely highest to lowest in terms of organic revenue growth in 2019 what would be that order dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director i think technical nonwovens and performance materials are going to be very close to each other in organic growth in 19 followed then by tas but all should have organic growth in 19 versus 18 one of our biggest disappointments in the fourth quarter was how tnw s business in china sort of evaporated but as we sit here today we re looking at almost a 15 increase in our backlog today versus what we had at the end of december so we re seeing a resurgence of the order patterns in china and across all technical nonwovens chris moore cjs securities analyst got it on the performance materials side you guys said that the cryogenic sales had kind of revitalized in q4 something that you expect to continue as well dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director yes chris moore cjs securities analyst got it if i m looking at the tas to ebitda margins in the future what s a reasonable expectation to get to that kind of mid teen level is that still a couple of years out just what s the kind of progression that you guys expect dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director it s still probably a couple of years i mean our ebitda margins are close to 14 now i believe for tas the key items the key drivers there are successful ramp ups of all these new metal products we won and the pain we went through in 17 and getting through the ppap process we should start seeing that some relief in the commodity pressure that we saw in 17 rather 18 over 7 million of headwind just in commodity prices on the material we buy so a combination of those two will help us get there and we ll continue to see price pressure on the fiber product lines in that business chris moore cjs securities analyst got it last thing for me you talked about some price increases gaining traction in performance materials where specifically is that referring to dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director both in technical nonwovens and performance materials teams are actively working with all of our customers when we see commodity inflation we try to pass that through to our end markets so sometimes we re successful sometimes we re not but clearly focused on it and in 18 we got partial recovery through pricing and not full recovery as that pressure continues we re still out there working with the end markets to drive it and it s a competitive dynamic if our competitors don t support pricing in the marketplace we don t want to lose share chris moore cjs securities analyst got it i appreciate it guys dale g barnhart president chief executive officer director thank you chris operator operator instructions this will conclude our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to dale barnhart for any closing remarks dale g

pirate brands was also a company record and i am happy to report that we achieved the high end of our inventory reduction plan target for the year reducing our inventory by approximately 100 million as compared to year end 2017 however our margins and our adjusted ebtida fell short of our expectations as we continue to face elevated input and freight costs that in 2018 we were unable to fully offset with price increases and cost savings initiatives mr cantwell continued looking forward in 2019 we expect to see continued benefits from our cost savings initiatives which we plan to enhance in 2019 as well as the full year impact of our 2018 price increases and a partial year impact of an additional round of price increases for 2019 that we have already communicated to our customers and

2 ebitda and adjusted ebitda are non gaap financial measures used by management to measure operating performance a non gaap financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of the company s financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in the united states in the company s consolidated balance sheets and related consolidated statements of operations comprehensive income changes in stockholders equity and cash flows the company defines ebitda as net income before net interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization and loss on extinguishment of debt see 1 above the company defines adjusted ebitda as ebitda adjusted for cash and non cash acquisition divestiture related expenses gains and losses which may include third party fees and expenses integration restructuring and consolidation expenses amortization of acquired inventory fair value step up and gains and losses on the sale of assets non recurring expenses gains and losses and the non cash accounting impact of the company s inventory reduction plan management believes that it is useful to eliminate these items because it allows management to focus on what it deems to be a more reliable indicator of ongoing operating performance and the company s ability to generate cash flow from operations the company uses ebitda and adjusted ebitda in the company s business operations to among other things evaluate the company s operating performance develop budgets and measure the company s performance against those budgets determine employee bonuses and evaluate the company s cash flows in terms of cash needs the company also presents ebitda and adjusted ebitda because the company believes they are useful indicators of the company s historical debt capacity and ability to service debt and because covenants in the company s credit agreement and the company s senior notes indentures contain ratios based on these measures as a result reports used by internal management during monthly operating reviews feature the ebitda and adjusted ebitda metrics however management uses these metrics in conjunction with traditional gaap operating performance and liquidity measures as part of its overall assessment of company performance and liquidity and therefore does not place undue reliance on these measures as its only measures of operating performance and liquidity ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not recognized terms under gaap and do not purport to be alternatives to operating income net income or any other gaap measure as an indicator of operating performance ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not complete net cash flow measures because ebitda and adjusted ebitda are measures of liquidity that do not include reductions for cash payments for an entity s obligation to service its debt fund its working capital capital expenditures and acquisitions and pay its income taxes and dividends rather ebitda and adjusted ebitda are two potential indicators of an entity s ability to fund these cash requirements ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not complete measures of an entity s profitability because they do not include certain costs and expenses and gains and losses described above because not all companies use identical calculations this presentation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies however ebitda and adjusted ebitda can still be useful in evaluating the company s performance against the company s peer companies because management believes these measures provide users with valuable insight into key components of gaap amounts 3 acquisition divestiture related and non recurring expenses

by lucia mutikani washington reuters u s homebuilding tumbled to a more than two year low in december as construction of both single and multi family housing declined the latest indication that the economy had lost momentum in the fourth quarter but there was some good news on the economy with other data on tuesday showing a rebound in consumer confidence in february after three straight monthly declines still the economy s outlook continues to be overshadowed by fears of a slowdown in global growth fading fiscal stimulus trade tensions and uncertainty over britain s departure from the european union these risks were again highlighted by federal reserve chairman jerome powell when he reaffirmed before lawmakers on tuesday the u s central bank s patient stance towards raising interest rates further this year regardless the economy is moderating which means the fed should be able to maintain its cautious approach to monetary policy said joel naroff chief economist at naroff economic advisors in holland pennsylvania housing starts dropped 11 2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1 078 million units in december the weakest reading since september 2016 data for november was revised down to show starts at a 1 214 million unit rate instead of the previously reported pace of 1 256 million units other details of the report were also downbeat suggesting the housing market could remain sluggish for a while despite an easing in mortgage rates housing completions hit a more than one year low in december and while building permits rose they were driven by the volatile multi family housing segment economists polled by reuters had forecast that housing starts would slip to a pace of 1 250 million units last month the release of the december housing starts and building permits report was delayed by a 35 day partial shutdown of the federal government that ended on jan 25 no date has been set for the release of january s report the commerce department said while delays in data collection could make it more difficult to determine the exact start and completion dates of construction processing and data quality were monitored and no significant issues were identified the report joined weak december retail sales and business spending plans on equipment in suggesting that economic growth cooled down significantly at the tail end of 2018 it also implied that residential investment likely contracted in the fourth quarter extending a decline that began in early 2018 as a result the atlanta fed trimmed its fourth quarter gross domestic product estimate by one tenth of a percentage point to a 1 8 percent annualized rate the economy grew at a 3 4 percent pace in the third quarter a second report from the conference board on tuesday showed its consumer confidence index increased 9 7 points to a reading of 131 4 in february after being held back by financial market volatility and the government shutdown despite the rebound in confidence the conference board said it expected the pace of economic growth to moderate in 2019 the u s dollar fell to a three week low against a basket of major currencies u s treasury prices rose while stocks on wall street were little changed in volatile trade soft patch the housing market hit a soft patch last year amid higher mortgage rates as well as land and labor shortages which led to tight inventories and more expensive homes but there are some glimmers of hope a third report from s p case shiller on tuesday showed house prices in the 20 metro area increased 4 2 percent from a year ago in december the smallest gain since november 2014 after rising 4 6 percent in november slowing house price inflation was also corroborated by a fourth report from the federal housing finance agency showing house prices rose 0 3 percent on a monthly basis in december after advancing 0 4 percent in november moderating house prices together with declining mortgage rates and steadily rising wages could make home buying more affordable though economists expect the housing market weakness to persist at least through the first half of 2019 we do expect the housing data to pick up at some point in response to the recent decline in mortgage rates but it likely will take some time before we start to see firming across many of the relevant figures said daniel silver an economist at jpmorgan in new york a survey last week showed homebuilder confidence increased in february but builders continued to say costs were being kept high by land and labor shortages and tariffs on lumber and other key building materials permits for future home construction rose 0 3 percent to a rate of 1 326 million units in december single family homebuilding which accounts for the largest share of the housing market dropped 6 7 percent to a rate of 758 000 units in december the lowest level since august 2016 it was the fourth straight monthly decline in single family homebuilding single family starts dropped in the northeast midwest and west but rose in the south permits to build single family homes fell 2 2 percent in december to a pace of 829 000 units starts for the multi family housing segment dropped 20 4 percent to a rate of 320 000 units in december permits for the construction of multi family homes rose 4 9 percent to a pace of 497 000 units housing completions fell 2 7 percent to 1 097 million units the fewest since september 2017 realtors estimate that housing starts and completion rates need to be in a range of 1 5 million to 1 6 million units per month to plug the

sovereign bond yields and public debt levels skyrocketed during the great recession and the european debt crisis several european countries such as spain ireland portugal and greece responded by implementing austerity programmes increasing taxes on consumption labour and capital and reducing government expenditures these programmes stood in contrast to the traditional keynesian approach that would have called for expansionary fiscal policy to support aggregate demand during the recession advocates of austerity measures argued that the recession was largely due to low productivity rather than deficient demand and that consequently structural reforms and fiscal consolidation were the appropriate policy response feld et al 2015 with particular attention to the effects on technology in a new paper bianchi et al 2019 we investigate the medium run consequences of the austerity measures taken in european countries in the context of a two country model with endogenous technology adoption even in the absence of a role for demand stabilisation austerity programmes have adverse effects on productivity and output they deepen the recession in the short run in the medium run fiscal austerity deters both investment in capital and investment in the adoption of new technologies this reduces adoption rates and leads to a slower recovery the negative effects of austerity are strongest for programmes that rely on raising labour taxes to stabilise public debt the model we build a two country open economy model that features an endogenous response of technology adoption rates to business cycle fluctuations 1 the world technology frontier moves exogenously but firms have to invest in technology adoption in order to make use of new technologies successful investments expand the set of intermediate inputs that can be used for final goods production in the respective country as in romer 1990 to capture the linkages between euro area countries our model considers two open economies spain and germany which are connected through trade in final goods and government bonds each country produces a distinct final good that is consumed by domestic and foreign households while the stocks of adopted intermediate goods productive capital and labour are country specific government bonds are held by both domestic and foreign savers trade in government bonds is subject to quadratic transaction costs similar to benigno 2009 and ghironi et al 2007 finally the government has a wide range of fiscal policies at its disposal these include distortionary taxes on labour capital and consumption which were the most important taxes in spain s austerity programme of 2012 2 in the absence of austerity measures fiscal policy follows the same rules as in leeper et al 2010 fiscal distress in spain modelled as a liquidity shock that increases the transaction costs for spanish government bonds leads to an increase in spreads between german and spanish bonds of close to 4 percentage points as observed during the crisis the consequences for output and productivity in the medium run depend heavily on the fiscal response austerity leads to slow recoveries austerity measures limit the increase in the debt to gdp ratio to 10 and help to contain the increase in spreads between spanish and german bonds at 1 2 percentage points without the austerity package the debt to gdp ratio would increase by 50 and spreads would rise by more than 3 5 percentage points figure 1 shows the responses of the technology adoption rate output and consumption with and without the austerity programme the tax increase implemented to consolidate the government s budget reduces the incentive to invest in capital and technology adoption slow adoption of new technologies depresses productivity growth deepens the recession and leads to a slow recovery fifteen years after the shock the technology adoption rate is more than 2 lower when austerity measures are implemented output is 3 below trend under the austerity regime while it would be only 1 below trend if fiscal policy rules had remained unchanged figure 1 impulse responses to a liquidity shock notes the figure shows the responses of the technology adoption rate gdp and consumption after a liquidity shock under normal fiscal policy blue and under fiscal austerity green all figures show percentage deviations from the balanced growth path the recession is deeper if consolidation relies on labour tax the exact design of the austerity package greatly affects its consequences based on the calibration used in our paper the adverse effects of labour tax raises on gdp and consumption are the strongest raising capital taxes is the preferred means of fiscal consolidation an austerity programme that relies solely on higher capital taxes to stabilise debt leads to a trough response of output of 3 ten years after the shock the recession is much deeper when only the labour tax is used to stabilise debt for this scenario the model predicts an output trough of 17 5 five years after the shock adverse effects on foreign country due to the trade linkages between spain and germany fiscal distress in spain has negative effects on the german economy the shock to the liquidity of spanish government bond depresses consumption in germany by more than 2 importantly the magnitude of this spillover effect depends on germany s fiscal policy benefits of austerity an important argument in favour of austerity measures is that they reduce borrowing costs if a high debt to gdp ratio serves as an indicator of a greater default probability fiscal austerity can bring down interest rate spreads if it succeeds to reduce public debt relative to gdp we investigate the effects of austerity in response to a deficit shock that raises spreads 3 in this situation fiscal austerity can accelerate the recovery if the benefits stemming from reducing borrowing costs outweigh the costs of temporarily larger tax distortions conclusion fiscal austerity together with endogenous adoption of new technologies can account for the slow recoveries after the great recession in europe austerity measures taken in response to fiscal distress as in several european countries slow down the adoption of new technologies and depress productivity growth in the medium run these negative consequences are particularly strong if the austerity programme relies on labour taxes cepr is a partner of the frame project which is co ordinated by zew the cepr team is led by diego comin a research fellow in its macroeconomics

the 2018 fourth quarter the average sales price per unit in backlog increased over the prior year and the 2018 third quarter as a result of an increase in shipments of lower priced units during the current quarter while shipments of higher priced units including big trucks were lower primarily because of supplier parts shortages americas results revenues in the americas segment which includes the north america latin america and brazil markets increased to 516 1 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 from 487 4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 this increase was primarily the result of price increases implemented to offset higher material costs and tariffs other revenues generated from the recognition of revenue that had previously been deferred on fuel cell battery box replacement bbr units sold to third parties by the americas and from higher remarketing services as well as an increase in parts sales these improvements were partially offset by modestly lower unit volumes unit shipments decreased by approximately 600 units from the prior year fourth quarter driven by fewer shipments of higher priced class 2 electric trucks and class 5 big trucks in the north america market partly offset by an increase in shipments in brazil as that market continues to recover backlog in the americas increased 6 700 units over the prior year fourth quarter and 2 000 units over the 2018 third quarter as a result of supplier issues prudent production scheduling and higher bookings and backlog in brazil despite an increase in revenues operating profit in the americas which includes corporate headquarters results decreased to 4 0 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 from 23 7 million in the prior year quarter operating profit decreased due to both lower gross profit and an increase in operating expenses the decrease in gross profit was primarily the result of material and freight cost inflation including import tariffs net of price increases manufacturing inefficiencies caused by supplier parts shortages and an increase in warranty expense the americas implemented price increases during the first half of the year and a tariff surcharge in november 2018 to offset material cost inflation and aluminum and steel tariffs but the fourth quarter operating results continued to reflect a 5 7 million shortfall resulting from the lag between the implementation of the price increases and when those price increases are fully realized in unit revenues operating expenses increased mainly due to an increase in incentive compensation resulting from an adjustment for the net impact of tariffs on full year 2018 results additional investments in the expansion of hyster yale group s industry focused sales and marketing teams and increased product development costs to

decreased to 207 7 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 from 215 2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 despite an increase in unit volumes revenues declined because an increase in revenues on lower priced class 3 units did not offset the effect of lower sales volumes of higher priced class 1 class 2 and class 5 trucks including big trucks compared with the prior year backlog in emea increased approximately 2 000 units over the 2017 fourth quarter and 200 units over the 2018 third quarter unfavorable currency movements from the translation of sales into u s dollars partly offset by higher parts sales and price increases also contributed to the revenue decline emea had operating profit of 4 2 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared with 5 3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 the impact of favorable currency movements of 2 8 million and price increases net of material cost inflation were more than offset by decreased volumes of higher value lift trucks specifically big trucks because of ongoing parts shortages as well as manufacturing inefficiencies caused by supplier constraints and national labor related strike days at the company s nijmegen plant a modest increase in operating expenses primarily due to higher incentive compensation also contributed to the decline in operating profit japic results revenues in the japic segment which includes operations

at hyster yale maximal of 0 8 million which included 1 0 of amortization expense for the write up of acquired assets to fair market value excluding the impact of hyster yale maximal japic s operating results declined primarily as a result of increased costs to expand japic s sales and marketing teams and higher product development costs to support the company s growth initiatives as well as a product mix shift and an increase in material and freight costs bolzoni results during the fourth quarter of 2018 bolzoni s revenue increased to 50 6 million from 49 4 million in 2017 primarily due to higher volumes in the emea market partly offset by unfavorable currency movements bolzoni s operating profit increased from the prior year quarter mainly as a result of improved margins on products sold partially offset by higher operating expenses from the continued implementation of strategic programs to increase bolzoni s presence in north america nuvera results during the fourth quarter of 2018 nuvera recognized revenues that had previously been deferred on fuel cell bbrs sold to hyster yale group which are eliminated in consolidation revenue on these units had been deferred due to the inability to estimate future warranty costs because the bbrs are new technology and the design of the product continues to evolve the company determined that sufficient data was available in the 2018 fourth quarter to reasonably estimate all of the future costs related to the sale of bbr units including warranty costs nuvera s 2018 fourth quarter operating loss decreased compared with the prior year quarter mainly as a result of the absence of a 4 9 million asset impairment charge taken in 2017 and product development funding received from third party customers this improvement was partially offset by the recognition of higher warranty expense higher employee related costs and an increase in product development and production start up costs related to nuvera s third party development agreements investor perspective hyster yale is currently undertaking the largest set of transformational programs in the company s history these programs are expected to have a very significant impact on hyster yale s competitiveness market position and economic performance over the next three to five years for some time the company has been focused on six strategic initiatives provide the lowest cost of ownership while enhancing productivity for customers be the leader in the delivery of industry and customer focused solutions be the leader in independent distribution grow in emerging markets be the leader in the attachments business be a leader in fuel cells and their applications the projects required to execute fully on these initiatives have been in general initiated over the last several years and many are now moving toward completion further many of the projects supporting these strategic initiatives are inter related and succeeding in one will foster success in others in total these projects have required significant up front expense and capital expenditure investment the projects cover a very broad range of hyster yale activities including product development supply chain it manufacturing sales and marketing for each of the company s three major businesses hyster yale group bolzoni and nuvera over the course of 2017 and 2018 these investments both expense and capital increased significantly further investment will continue to be made in 2019 and then generally remain at those levels for the next several years the return from these investments has started to be realized and is expected to increase over the course of hyster yale s five year planning period in this context hyster yale group income is expected to improve in 2019 over 2018 but results in the first half of the year are expected to be lower than the first half of 2018 and then improve in the second half beginning in 2020 further improved results are expected with significant increases through 2023 hyster yale group s objective is to meet its target of 7 operating profit in this period assuming reasonable market conditions continue likewise bolzoni s results are expected to improve in 2019 and in the following years with a target of 7 operating profit nuvera s results are expected to improve moderately in the first three quarters of 2019 with a break even target for both the fourth quarter and for the 2020 full year further significantly improved earnings are expected at nuvera in the 2021 to 2023 time period at each of these three businesses the investments being undertaken are expected to lead to increased operating profit through higher volume decreased product costs and improved pricing partially offset by a higher level of operating expense overall 2019 consolidated operating profit is expected to increase significantly with the improvement coming in the second half of the year at hyster yale group product programs are expected to lay the groundwork for enhanced market position by providing lower cost of ownership and enhanced productivity for the company s customers at the core of these programs is a new set of modular and scalable product families covering both internal combustion engine and electric trucks which will provide customers with enhanced flexibility for meeting their application needs combined with the benefit of lowest total cost of ownership implementation of these programs are expected to begin in 2020 with the introduction of a new range of counterbalanced trucks with this range being expanded comprehensively through 2025 to include larger counterbalanced capacities big trucks and warehouse trucks a further major initiative in product offerings will come from the introduction of trucks manufactured by hyster yale maximal hyster yale group s new majority owned joint venture in china a line of trucks from hyster yale maximal has been engineered to provide high quality and reliable utility trucks for global markets and standard trucks for the chinese market in addition hyster yale maximal and hyster yale group s partner in india is expected to expand local production of larger trucks further in early 2019 a new end rider was launched in the north america market and a new reach truck for north america as well as lower cost class 3 walkie and stacker global products are expected to be introduced later in the year rough terrain and electrified big truck products are being added to the product line up to further enhance productivity for customers hyster yale group is developing automation solutions for warehouse trucks initially in combination with industry partners some of these products are already in the market today but new solutions and customers are expected to be developed progressively over the next several years hyster yale group continues to expand sales of telemetry products and new generations of lift trucks will offer a fully integrated telematics solution finally hyster yale group anticipates introducing new fuel cell bbrs for class 1 2 and 3 forklift trucks over the next two years that are expected to move the fuel cell bbr business to break even in 2020 the introduction of these new products will lead to significant changes in supply chain sourcing and in the company s various manufacturing facilities around the world consolidated component volume sourced globally from reliable partners is expected to reduce costs and improve quality as these new products are brought to market over the next two to three years hyster yale group s largest manufacturing facilities in berea craigavon and greenville are expected to be structured to reduce costs and improve productivity while most other plants will see more modest changes china production activities are expected to be consolidated at hyster yale maximal over the course of 2019 hyster yale group currently has over 290 different forklift models in its range which are supported by the ability to customize these trucks to meet specific customer needs the modular nature of the new products being introduced will enhance the ability to meet exact customer needs at lowest cost both at the industry level and at the individual customer level to ensure the full benefit from these programs hyster yale group has made a substantial expense investment in its sales and marketing organizations to realign teams around industry groupings within marketing industry focused resources have been added to develop industry strategies the higher priority industry strategies have been completed for north america and europe all of the strategies are expected to be completed for all countries or groups of countries around the world by the end of 2019 but will mature and be enhanced over future years to support execution of these industry strategies hyster yale group has invested in additional industry focused sales capabilities to support its dealers this industry focused structure has been in place and highly successful in the national account direct sales program and is now being deployed with the new dealer support teams these investments are largely in place in north america and to a lesser degree in emea additional sales capabilities are expected to be added in other areas around the world over the next two years in total the company believes that these projects will put it in a position to be a leader in the delivery of industry and customer focused solutions worldwide while the new sales teams will support dealers sales efforts the company will also continue to upgrade its global dealer capabilities a core objective is to have dealers that are fully capable of maximizing the potential of the hyster and yale brands in their territories these dealers will be supported by a commitment to helping dealers strengthen the excellence of their activities in all areas of their business including leadership sales parts service rental leasing and remarketing to help these programs have maximum impact the company will be investing over the next few years in enhanced digital customer experience systems taken together these initiatives amount to a new uniquely competitive way of serving the markets around the world bolzoni is also pursuing very aggressive projects to expand its global market position this includes strengthening bolzoni s ability to serve the north america market by taking responsibility for hyster yale group s sulligent plant where it will manufacture attachments and also continue the plant s support of hyster yale group through the sale of cylinders and various other components bolzoni will phase out production at its current homewood illinois facility but intends to maintain a distribution center and certain other operations in that area there is a large opportunity for growth in the north america market to help capture this bolzoni plans to introduce a broader range of locally produced attachments available with shorter lead times to serve its customer base bolzoni also has plans to increase its sales marketing and product support capabilities in north america in addition it has developed a standard product line sourced from one of its factories in china which will continue to be expanded bolzoni s current outstanding premium line of products coupled with these standard products and an industry focused strategy are expected to give bolzoni the ability to increase its sales significantly in the americas japic and emea regions bolzoni s results have been improving on a progressive basis since its acquisition three years ago these new programs are expected to increase the company s market position and profitability especially over the next three to four years nuvera is approaching the point where it will move from being a venture business focused on commercializing leading technology to a mature product based company serving not only the forklift truck market but also heavy duty applications such as buses trucks and applications in the automotive sector with an expanding line of developed products nuvera expects its core technology to move to a new generation of fuel cell stack design over the next year with broad application in each of these markets quality and cost of fuel cell engines have been improving and are expected to reach target objectives over the next two years with the transfer of the responsibility for development of non fuel cell engine components and the overall assembly of bbrs to hyster yale group nuvera will focus entirely on fuel cell stacks and engines to enhance its cost base nuvera continues to work on standardizing its products developing lower cost suppliers and automating various elements of stack production to help sharpen its focus on fuel cell stacks and engines nuvera sold its hydrogen generating powertap business to a third party oneh2 inc in exchange for a note and a minority ownership interest in oneh2 oneh2 has developed an important option for hydrogen fuel supply for forklift truck fuel cell users in overview nuvera s objective is to reach break even in both the fourth quarter of 2019 and the full year of 2020 with a move toward target profitability over the following three years in summary hyster yale believes it is approaching an inflection point in its business while the early part of 2019 is expected to reflect continued investment in all of these programs the second half of 2019 is expected to be significantly improved in comparison to the second half of 2018 hyster yale group s efforts to find offsets to the tariff driven unprecedented material cost inflation witnessed in 2018 will mature during 2019 and efforts to abate the most critical supplier issues which are still having an impact on production are underway with most expected to be resolved by mid year the current lift truck backlog contains certain deal specific pricing agreements at less than target margins to gain targeted accounts and for which margin improvement efforts will take some time to mature these deals will have an impact on profitability mainly in the first half of the year generally margins are expected to recover fully from the 2018 material cost inflation and the heavily discounted deals by the third and fourth quarters of 2019 in 2020 and 2021 a considerable portion of the new projects outlined above will have reached completion for all three companies and the company believes the full impact of these programs can lead to profitability improvements for a number of years to come finally the remainder of the programs are expected to come to fruition in 2022 and 2023 with a few particularly those involving dealer structure and excellence being more in the nature of continuous improvement rather than projects which reach maturity at a given time of course the absolute level of profitability will reflect actual market demand levels the company is currently forecasting strong but moderating forklift market levels and a resolution to brexit in a way which does not significantly harm hyster yale s business prospects the company believes that investors who are focused on mid term business improvement in market position and profitability will find that hyster yale s focus is consistent with those investment objectives conference call in conjunction with

this is not investment advice the author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned wccftech com has a disclosure and ethics policy sunday afternoon donald trump announced that trade talks between the u s and china had been productive and decided to delay the imposition of new tariffs to the country trade war between the u s and china as we reported over the last week the u s china relations have been incredibly volatile since 2017 with new rounds of tariff impositions and accusations from diplomats we also reported two days ago that the charges both against huawei and their executives could be part of the negotiation process in the trade deal the newest round of tariff impositions was set to be enforced at the end of this week with targeted goods receiving between a 10 25 tariff this news came from president donald trump tweeting that the trade talks have gone very well and are in advanced stages so the tariffs will be delayed hoping for a resolution china trade deal and more in advanced stages relationship between our two countries is very strong i have therefore agreed to delay u s tariff hikes let s see what happens donald j trump realdonaldtrump february 25 2019 president donald trump when addressing the media on monday heralded the use of tariffs when renegotiating the north american free trade agreement nafta into the united states mexico canada agreement specifically citing the use of targeted tariffs on the canadian automotive industry to have the deal reached the chinese administration had largely targeted american agriculture while the american counterparts had targeted the steel and aluminum industry and the electronics industry in china part of the negotiations includes the u s requesting that china have its exchange rate more flexible and market based rather than have the chinese central bank essentially set the currencies value the trump administration has long accused the chinese market of currency manipulation and artificially keeping the currency value lower to increase exports to other markets the renminbi yuan is a policy currency which means their value is directly set by the people s bank of china in contrast the u s dollar can rise and fall by free market trading but is also impacted by policy decisions from the federal reserve stock market rally as cnn pointed out the shanghai composite index sha 000001 which is the equivalent to the s p 500 dow jones or nasdaq indexes rose over 5 on the news this was the largest daily gain for the index since 2015 the growth of the chinese economy slowed down in 2018 which was noted by almost every semiconductor company in the q4 year end earnings such as apple nasdaq aapl nvidia nasdaq nvda intel nasdaq intc and amd nasdaq amd when reporting their revenues it will be very interesting to see how trade talks continue in the short term and how it will impact multinational corporations that are headquartered in the u s but have their manufacturing done abroad

michael casey chairman and chief executive officer thanks very much good morning everyone thank you for joining us on the call before we walk you through the presentation on our website i d like to share some thoughts on our business with you we exceeded the sales and earnings goals that we shared with you in october we had a very strong finish to the year with high single digit growth in our retail and wholesale businesses our analysis suggests that young children s apparel was a good source of growth of growth for many retailers in the fourth quarter particularly during the holiday shopping periods in our retail business we achieved the strongest growth in comparable fourth quarter sales in five years driven by positive store comps and double digit growth in e commerce sales the quarter got off to a good start as weather turned cooler we saw a strong demand for our fall product offerings with comparable sales up 9 in october on a combined basis sales in november and december grew nearly 5 including good growth during the thanksgiving and christmas holiday shopping periods out retail segment contributed nearly 70 of our sales growth in the fourth quarter we continued to see the strongest traffic to our co branded stores with comparable sales in the quarter up about 10 up nearly 6 for the year these stores offer consumers the convenience of shopping two of the best known brands in children s apparel in one convenient location 10 stocks we like better than carter s when investing geniuses david and tom gardner have a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has quadrupled the market david and tom just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now and carter s wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of january 31 2019 we continue to assess the performance of our various store models with the success of our co branded stores and convenience of shopping online we are seeing fewer visits to our legacy outlet stores over the next five years we plan to close over 10 of our stores in the united states as leases expire these are lower margin stores many in declining outlet centers there s no compelling reason to accelerate these store closures given they collectively are cash flow positive we plan to replace the sales of closed stores by opening over 100 more profitable cobranded stores in better centers closer to the consumer we believe the gymboree store closures may provide a new 100 million growth opportunity for us we have evaluated every gymboree crazy 8 and janie and jack store location our stores share many of the same locations with gymboree in the outlet centers we have less overlap in malls and off mall locations historically we have focused our store growth on non mall locations with good results that said we have about 50 mall based stores which have been a good source of growth for us given our success with malls we plan to very selectively pursue new opportunities given the gymboree closures our mix of e commerce sales grew to 32 of our us retail sales in the fourth quarter up three percentage points from the prior year carter s is the best selling young children s apparel brand in the online channel in the united states with more than twice the share of our nearest competitor in 2017 international consumers ranked carters com as one of their top three favorite websites during the holiday shopping season together with amazon and ralph lauren that said we saw less demand than expected from international consumers shopping online with us in the fourth quarter our analysis reflects a direct correlation between unfavorable changes in exchange rates and international demand for our brands particularly from brazil argentina and russia in years past as exchange rates improved international demand for our brands also improved in 2019 we expect to see continued softness in international demand in the first half and improved trends in the second half with respect to our wholesale business we saw very good growth in the fourth quarter driven by our exclusive brands for target walmart and amazon no other company in young children s apparel has developed these meaningful sources of growth with three of the largest retailers in the world we believe target walmart and amazon were the largest beneficiaries of the toys r us store closures each of them provides a broader product offering for families with young children especially newborns relative to our retail stores and other retailers the toys r us and bon ton closures weighed on the growth we had forecasted last year collectively they contributed over 100 million in sales in 2017 and less than 20 million in sales last year as you may know we had expected to recapture at least half of the lost sales to these retailers last year we invested in additional targeted marketing to their customers and saw a good return on those investments we saw a nice lift in sales at our stores within a five mile radius of the closed toys r us stores so did some of our wholesale customers our best analysis suggests that we achieved about 85 of our 40 million sales recapture assumption last year thankfully with the passage of time following those store closures we are seeing an improved trend in some of our key replenishment product categories if those trends continue we may recapture more of the lost sales this year we expect to see further consolidation of our wholesale sales over time with fewer better and stronger retailers last year our top five customers contributed about 60 of our wholesale sales sales to those top five customers grew about 4 we re forecasting low single digit growth in wholesale sales in 2019 with sales to our top five customers up about 5 despite the effect of door closures in 2018 our brands continue to have the most extensive presence of any young children s apparel brand in the country our brands are currently sold in over 17 000 stores in the united states we are also uniquely positioned in the market with our ability to sell our brands through the websites of the largest retailers of children s apparel in north america online sales of our brands to our top wholesale e commerce customers grew over 30 last year and with the support of our wholesale customers we expect online sales of our brands to exceed 1 billion next year our international business grew 4 last year to nearly 12 5 of our total company sales sales were down a bit in the fourth quarter largely due to a transition in our business model for china we believe china continues to be a meaningful source of growth for us over time it is a highly fragmented 24 billion market with four times the number of annual births relative to the united states in 2018 we decided to change our business model for china we are transitioning from a retail and wholesale model to a licensing model the old business model was generating sales but not profitability and we concluded there was not a clear path to profitability earlier this month we entered into a licensing agreement with a new china partner our new partner has demonstrated retail expertise in young children s apparel in china one of the principles in this new venture has been one of our largest suppliers of baby apparel for the past 20 years beginning this year our new partner will source our product offerings for the china market and will manage both the online and offline experiences for our carter s and oshkosh b gosh brands we believe this new model will provide consumers with a better experience with our brands and enable a more profitable growth strategy for us in china going forward we re forecasting mid single digit growth in international sales driven by the growth in our multi channel operations in canada and mexico and growth through our wholesale relationships with costco walmart amazon and other retailers representing our brands throughout the world since our last call with you we have revisited the growth we believe possible over the next five years we re forecasting over 4 billion in annual sales by 2023 and about 500 million in operating income those growth objectives equate to low single digit growth in sales mid single digit growth in operating income and high single digit growth in earnings per share we have the interest and potential to outperform these growth objectives our current projections reflect nearly 2 billion in cash flow from operations for the next 5 years though currently we believe there are relatively few attractive acquisition opportunities we continue to explore opportunities we believe would provide a new source of growth and attractive returns on investment absent better alternatives to allocate capital we plan to continue returning excess capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends our growth plan is focused on five key strategies which are winning in baby aging up our brands leading in e commerce expanding globally and investing in new growth opportunities baby apparel represent over 50 of our annual apparel sales our stores are rated as mom s favorite place to shop for apparel for their newborn to 24 month old child last year nearly 90 of millennials shopping for newborn apparel purchased the carter s brand though annual births have trended lower in recent years we have expanded our customer base through our marketing efforts we are also seeing higher frequency of visits and customer retention in may we will relaunch our little baby basics product offering this product offering is the core of our carter s brand providing the everyday essentials for a newborn to 24 month old child it is the best selling baby apparel product offering in the united states and a high margin replenishment business for the largest retailers of our carter s brand in the fourth quarter we saw growth in every age segment in our retail business the largest and fastest rate of sales growth was in our product offering for 8 to 10 year old children carter s has the largest share of children s apparel in the baby and toddler age segments two to three times the share of our nearest competitors in fall 2018 we ve launched an extension of the carter s product offering to serve the needs of families with young children up to about a 10 year old child this new strategy was driven by market research which indicated consumers wished to stay with the carter s brand longer based on that input we added new size ranges to the carter s brand by entering this slightly older age segment we now have an opportunity to gain share in a much larger market with respect to leading in e commerce we have the best performing branded website exclusively for young children s apparel in the united states with twice the share of our nearest online competitor in 2019 we are launching new capabilities to further strengthen the consumers experience shopping with us later this year we expect to enable same day pickup of online orders in our stores as we ve seen in recent years nearly 15 of our online customers choose the free ship to store option and about a quarter of those customers increase their purchase when they visit our stores we believe our new same day pickup service will further enhance the convenience of shopping with us and drive more traffic to our stores we have also invested in capabilities to an able us to ship online orders from our stores this new service is designed to expedite the fulfillment of e commerce orders and will be tested with consumers later this year our brands are sold in about 85 countries through our e commerce capabilities and relationships with retailers throughout the world we will continue to pursue opportunities that enable profitable expansion in new markets over the next five years about 60 of our international sales growth is forecast to be driven by canada and mexico earlier this year we restructured our international organization to enable better collaboration between our us operations and our teams in canada and mexico over the past five years we have made significant investments in consumer facing and revenue driving capabilities in the united states with this new organization we plan to leverage those investments and extend those capabilities to support the growth we envision possible in north america as we view it today our organic growth rate is about 2 3 a year over the next five years we plan to close almost as many stores as we plan to open with nearly 850 stores in the united states we are one of the largest specialty retailers for young children s apparel we don t currently see a need for significantly more stores just better stores in better locations our wholesale customers do a great job presenting our brands in their stores and they have been good partners and a source of growth for many years over time however growth in our wholesale segment will be limited by the growth collectively planned by the largest retailers for their own businesses faster sales growth in international markets is possible but to do so profitably has been challenging so we will pursue a more profitable pace for growth expanding globally over the next five years we aspire to achieve a sales growth rate twice what would otherwise be possible organically over the past 15 years we have acquired brands and businesses that contributed over 1 billion in sales in 2018 acquisitions have enabled us to strengthen our multi channel model and reach more consumers with our brands we have a team devoted full time to exploring acquisition opportunities for us and they are supported by external resources we search for brands and businesses focused on the needs of families with young children led by strong management teams and a track record of profitable growth it is intentionally a tight screen given the risk of any acquisition we will be patient with our search for new brands and businesses to ensure future acquisitions provide new sources of meaningful growth and attractive returns for our shareholders we believe that the fundamentals of our business have never been stronger we are the largest branded marketer of young children s apparel in the united states and the largest supplier of young children s apparel to the largest retailers in the country we have built a diversified business model which has enabled 30 consecutive years of sales growth and a cash flow model that has enabled us to return nearly 2 billion in excess capital to shareholders since 2007 over the past 10 years we have managed to grow through the recession the cotton crisis shifts to private label brands and de stocking initiatives we re now faced with the risk of tariffs continued decline in annual births and customer store closures the constant through all of these challenges over the years has been the strength of our brands which have served the needs of multiple generations of consumers and the quality of carter s employees who are focused on providing the best value and experience in young children s apparel that focus has served us well over the years in summary we had a strong finish to the year we re reporting a record level of sales and profitability for 2018 and a record level of free cash flow the outlook for our business is good we have built a unique multi brand multi channel model which we believe is well positioned to grow and gain market share we re committed to strengthen our business and provide better performance for our shareholders in the years ahead richard will now walk you through the presentation on our website richard westenberger executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you mike good morning everyone i ll begin on page 2 with our gaap income statement for the fourth quarter most of my comments will speak to our results on an adjusted basis our gaap results for both this year and 2017 included some unusual items which are detailed in this morning s press release the items that i draw your attention to would be a minor charge in this year s fourth quarter related to the transition of our business model in china fourth quarter 2017 included a significant net gain related to the adoption of the new tax reform legislation our adjusted results exclude these unusual items in both periods for greater comparability our full year gaap p l is included on page 3 today s presentation and earnings release include reconciliations of our gaap basis results to the adjusted basis of presentation i encourage you to review this information as you evaluate our results moving to page 4 with some highlights of q4 and fiscal 2018 we had a strong finish to the year fourth quarter consolidated net sales grew 6 with solid growth in both our us retail and us wholesale segments adjusted earnings per share grew 22 to 2 84 reflecting a largely comparable operating income a lower effective tax rate and the benefit of share repurchases higher sales lower sgna and a lower tax rate drove the outperformance in eps relative to our prior guidance for the full year consolidated net sales grew approximately 2 and were adversely affected by the bankruptcies of toys r us and bon ton recall that we had planned operating income for 2018 to be comparable with 2017 as we had intended to reinvest approximately half of the earnings upside generated by the reduction in the us corporate tax rate back into the business our adjusted operating income for the full year was down approximately 8 versus that comparable objective we had several factors which worked against this past year obviously the loss of planned sales to toys r us and bon ton was a big hurdle to overcome our sales over the important labor day selling period were below our expectations and in the second half of the year in particular we saw lower than planned demand from international consumers in our us retail business full year 2018 adjusted earnings per share grew 9 as the benefits of the lower effective tax rate and lower average shares outstanding helped to offset the decline in operating income for the year lastly in 2018 we continued to return significant capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends moving to page 5 with the summary of our sales performance in the fourth quarter sales in our us retail segment grew 7 with comp sales growing 5 7 which was on top of a positive 4 5 comp in the fourth quarter of 2017 this was our eighth consecutive positive fourth quarter retail comp sales in us wholesale grew 7 driven by growth in our exclusive brands sold at target walmart and amazon international sales declined 2 reflecting lower demand in china and unfavorable movements in currency exchange rates which were partially offset by growth in mexico moving to our adjusted p l for the fourth quarter on page 6 adjusted gross margin was 43 2 compared to 44 9 in the fourth quarter of 2017 this principally reflects higher shipping costs and promotions in our us e commerce business and customer mix changes within us wholesale royalty income declined modestly principally due to the timing of certain spring 2019 retail programs our adjusted sgna rate levered 120 basis points to 28 4 reflecting expense leverage in all segments and lower provisions for performance based compensation fourth quarter net interest and other expense was 10 million compared to 8 million last year this increase reflects higher interest expense due to higher market interest rates and higher average borrowing versus a year ago and expense related to unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates our fourth quarter effective tax rate was 18 9 and our average share count declined 4 compared to last year reflecting our share repurchase activity again on the bottom line fourth quarter adjusted eps was 2 84 up 22 from 2 33 last year turning to page 7 with a recap of our balance sheet and cash flow our balance sheet was in very good shape as of the end of the year we ended 2018 with cash on hand and available borrowing capacity on our revolver totaling over 700 million net inventories were up 5 at year end driven by product cost increases and higher on hand baby replenishment inventory on a unit basis inventories grew approximately 3 in the fourth quarter the quality of our inventory at year end was high our business continues to generate great cash flow operating cash flow for fiscal 2018 was 356 million up from 330 million in 2017 while our gaap net income was somewhat lower versus last year the new tax law resulted in meaningfully lower tax payments than under the previous higher rate structure capital expenditures were 64 million compared to 69 million in 2017 significant areas of investment included new stores and retail systems enterprise technology and distribution capabilities 2018 was another strong year of returning capital to shareholders we returned a total of 277 million comprised of 193 million in share repurchases and 84 million in dividends over the last 12 years we ve returned a total of 1 8 billion and retired 38 of our outstanding shares as noted in today s press release our board of directors has authorized an 11 increase to our quarterly dividend to 0 50 per share beginning with our next dividend payment in march this represents our sixth consecutive annual increase since we initiated our recurring dividend in 2013 now turning to page 9 with an overview of our business segment performance in the fourth quarter our consolidated adjusted operating margin was 15 7 compared to 16 3 in last year s fourth quarter improved profitability and international was offset by lower profitability in our us retail and wholesale businesses corporate expenses as a percent of net sales were comparable year over year moving to some additional perspective on our business results for the fourth quarter beginning with us retail on page 10 total us segment sales increased 7 our total retail comp was 5 7 with double digit comps in e commerce and positive comps also achieved in our retail stores this was our highest q4 comp performance since 2013 in the fourth quarter while overall domestic demand was very good up in the high single digits demand from international consumers declined in the high single digits which we believe was the result of the strength of the us dollar we saw a particular impact of lower international demand in e commerce which caused us to be more promotional than planned in that channel in order to clear inventory in 2018 we opened 55 new stores and closed 41 ending the year with 844 stores in the united states us retail segment margin was 16 9 compared to 17 8 in the fourth quarter of 2017 this performance reflects the higher e commerce promotional activity which i mentioned and higher shipping and distribution costs on page 11 we ve included a photo of a relatively new co branded store in garfield new jersey in the fourth quarter co branded stores were our best performing store type coming up nearly 10 we ve been investing recently in new fixtures in our stores which we think will better present the strength and beauty of our baby assortments this new presentation in one of our atlanta area stores is shown on page 12 moving to page 13 and a recap of our plans for our us retail store portfolio we ve made good progress over the past several years in improving the convenience of shopping for our brands and improving the productivity of our store portfolio we ve found that consumers value the ability to shop the two leading brands in young children s apparel in a single shopping our dual branded locations which present both the carter s and oshkosh brand currently represent about 40 of our store base we anticipate that the majority of future store growth will be in the co branded store format additionally as we ve opened cobranded stores in recent years the proportion of our store base located in traditional further out outlet centers has declined we expect this trend will continue as consumers look to shop closer to home versus driving longer distances to the outlets as we ve shared on our previous calls we ve increased our focus on optimizing our store portfolio over the next five years we expect to open about 110 new stores and close just over 90 locations we ve seen good results to date from closing stores with marginal profit performance at their lease expiration we ve seen a roughly 20 sales transfer rate to nearby store locations at a very attractive profit conversion we ve seen good performance of our recent classes of new stores which are comping positively and delivering good returns we re continuing to focus on improving the performance of our brick and mortar stores including introducing new omnichannel capabilities refining our assortments and improving our fixtures presentation and service on pages 14 and 15 we ve included some of our spring marketing for carter s and oshkosh these pages feature great examples of our easter dressing products and spring products such as t shirts and shorts which mom is going to need for her family as the warm weather arrives around the country on page 16 skip hop also continues to innovate in its product assortment the play enclosure shown here is a new product just introduced in the market and early selling of this item is off to a great start we re seeing good demand for the skip hop brand across all channels in the united states and good growth internationally we re planning that skip hop net sales will grow approximately 20 globally in 2019 with a meaningfully improved profit contribution to the company page 17 highlights the continuing strength of our carter s oshkosh and skip hop brands on social media we ve invested heavily in building our social media capabilities in recent years social media has emerged as one of the most important ways that consumers especially younger parents engage with brands among the comparable brands we track the carter s brand has the highest number of followers on both instagram and facebook in the fourth quarter carter s posts on instagram elicited a great response from consumers earning nine of the top 10 engagement scores among our peers turning to page 18 with the results for our us wholesale business in the fourth quarter sales in us wholesale were strong growing 7 over last year growth was particularly strong in our exclusive brands which offset the loss of sales to toys r us bon ton and sears which collectively represented approximately 34 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 as we noted on our last call sales in the fourth quarter benefited from year over year calendar changes with some of our wholesale customers which resulted in volume shifting from the third quarter last year to the fourth quarter this year as mike noted over the last three quarters of the year we have estimated that we recaptured approximately 34 million of sales that had been previously planned to toys r us and bon ton most of this recapture occurred in our wholesale channel segments operating profit was 74 million compared to 71 million last year segment operating margin was 21 versus 21 7 in q4 of last year reflecting unfavorable changes in customer mix including greater off price channel activity than a year ago and higher shipping costs sg a was lower than a year ago for the full year in 2018 sales in our us wholesale segment declined 2 for full year 2017 sales to toys r us bon ton and sears represented 115 million full year 2018 operating margin for the us wholesale segment was nearly 20 on page 19 we ve included a photo of the carter s baby shop at kohl s the offset photo on the left side of the page features a special additional fixture of carter s little baby basics product which kohl s added in the front entry area of about 400 of their stores during their recent january baby sales this fixture drove excellent productivity for kohl s exceeding expectations we continue to partner with our most significant wholesale customers to ensure very strong presentation of the carter s and oshkosh brands on the selling floor developing the e commerce channel is obviously an enormous priority and opportunity for all of our wholesale customers on pages 20 and 21 we ve included some recent screenshots from the websites of target walmart and amazon we ve been very pleased that our exclusive just one you child of mine and simple joys brands play such a prominent role in driving the online businesses of the largest retailers in the country as you ll note on these pages these brands are unique in their product points of view and value propositions they provide very attractive assortments and aurs for each of these retailers moving to page 22 and international segment results for the fourth quarter international segment net sales declined 2 this reflects lower demand in china and unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates partially offset by increased demand in mexico on a constant currency basis fourth quarter international segment net sales grew about 1 for the full year 2018 international segment net sales grew approximately 4 on a reported and a constant currency basis net sales in mexico in the fourth quarter we approximately 15 million we continue to be pleased with the progress we re making in mexico the mexico market represented about 45 million in net sales in 2018 we believe we can meaningfully grow our business in mexico to double its current size over the next several year in 2019 we ll be testing some new larger retail store formats in mexico with the goal of replicating our cobranded store format which has proven so successful in the us and canada canadian net sales in the fourth quarter declined 1 on a reported basis but grew 2 on a local currency basis canada s performance in the fourth quarter was below our expectations particularly in our stores canadian retail accounts declined 2 the quarter began very strongly in canada and weakened in november and december we believe the extremely strong october demand left us in an oversold inventory position later in the quarter in addition to the inventory mix including less of the special holiday dressing items which sold so successfully in the us this past season we saw strong e commerce growth in canada in q4 even with the adverse effects of a postal strike during the quarter international segment adjusted operating income was 21 million comparable to the fourth quarter of 2017 segment operating margin improved 20 basis points to 16 reflecting improved profitability in mexico partially offset by higher promotions and expense deleverage in canada for 2019 we expect our international business to grow in the mid single digits and note that this reflects the planned transition of our china business from the previous e commerce and wholesale models to a licensed arrangement with a single partner in this market we re also planning on adding approximately 10 new retail stores in canada in 2019 pages 23 through 27 highlight the extensive distribution our brands enjoy in key markets around the world on page 23 we ve included a photo of a new carter s and oshkosh cobranded store in istanbul ecommerce is an important channel for many of our international partners and on pages 24 through 27 we ve included examples of the websites serving consumers in india brazil israel and russia as of the end of 2018 our international partners operate nearly 780 retail locations and 45 websites in approximately 85 markets worldwide on pages 28 through 31 we ve included a few pages for your reference summarizing our full year performance in 2018 despite the challenge of the unplanned bankruptcies and liquidations of two significant wholesale customers we still delivered topline and bottom line growth for the year we also launched new growth initiatives continue to invest in important retail and enterprise technology initiatives and developed a new and we believe more profitable path forward in china turning to page 32 with a recap of our growth opportunities over the next five years as mike noted in his remarks we believe we can grow our consolidated net sales to over 4 billion by 2023 which would represent a compound annual growth rate of approximately 3 our us retail business is expected to be the most meaningful contributor to our growth led by continued growth in the e commerce channel we also see contributions to growth from our us wholesale and international businesses we are committed to margin expansion in our business and believe we can grow profitably at a rate faster than sales driven by improved profit contributions from our new growth initiatives including skip hop mexico simple joys and with amazon a potentially higher return business model in china and improved sourcing pricing and inventory management discipline we re also strengthening our focus on productivity and efficiency initiatives with the objective of optimizing investment and spending across the enterprise we d like to see spending grow at a rate less than the growth rate of gross profit as mike said we re open to adding new sources of growth through m a our bar for acquisitions is appropriately high importantly though we have the resources and strengths to pursue those assets which we find compelling to the extent we don t utilize our significant projected cash flow for m a we would look to continue to distribute excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases moving to our outlook for 2019 on page 34 there s several important factors to keep in mind as we look ahead to the first quarter of 2019 first the easter holiday falls later this year which we believe will shift some holiday related demand to our second quarter this year compared to the first quarter in 2018 second we have not yet fully anniversary discontinued sales to toys r us and bon ton which contributed approximately 13 million in net sales in the first quarter of 2018 we will be past this comparability issue by the end of the first quarter our retail businesses in the us and canada are off to a slower than planned start to the year we believe as the result of the current cold weather around the country it s important to note that march is an extremely significant month for our us retail business roughly equal in volume to january and february combined given the significant weather disruption we saw in march last year we think the comparisons this year may be favorable for this year s outlook for this important selling period due to these factors we expect 1st quarter consolidated net sales will be down approximately 4 to 5 and adjusted eps to be in the range of 0 65 to 0 70 per share for the full year 2019 we expect net sales to increase approximately 1 to 2 and adjusted earnings per share to increase approximately 4 to 6 this outlook contemplates sales growth in all segments improvement in our operating margin sg a leverage and continued share repurchases 2019 operating cash flow is expected to be strong in the range of 375 to 400 million capital expenditures are planned to be approximately 85 million up somewhat from 2018 due to investments in retail systems corporate technology infrastructure and our distribution network risks that we re monitoring include the status of trade negotiations between the united states and china international consumer traffic and demand in our us retail businesses the level of promotional activity in the marketplace and the performance of our wholesale customers with those remarks we re ready to take your questions questions and answers operator thank you if you would like to ask a question please signal by pressing 1 on your telephone key pad if you re using a speakerphone please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment again please press 1 if you d like to ask a question we ll take our first question from susan anderson of riley fbr please go ahead susan anderson riley fbr analyst hi good morning congrats on a really nice quarter i was wondering of you could talk about the older kids business it sounds like it continued to be strong in the quarter i guess have you seen that business get competitive in terms of promotions with the gymboree liquidations and do you think that you ll be able to maybe take some market share from gymboree even though you re not necessarily in the malls except through wholesale and then also i was curious are you seeing any of those in mall wholesale customers potentially wanna take on more older kid product from you guys richard westenberger executive vice president and chief financial officer a couple things on the age up we launched that carter s kid s line last fall we supported it with great marketing in adding those sizes we can dress a child up to about 10 years old so the product sold really great from toddler through size 14 our sales grew high single digits last fall most of it from adding those new sizes 10 to 14 i think we did about an extra 14 million in the fourth quarter we continue to drive that initiative with great product things like sibling dressing and events and uniform and denim all places we think we can gain share so it s a good nice opportunity for growth as far as gymboree mike said we think that s a potential 100 million opportunity to capture market share their liquidation has become it s begun in earnest so the first half could be a little bit disruptive for us but we ve got 200 stores located in the same center as gymboree 150 of those are in outlets and they also have a meaningful presence in the malls we ve got only about 50 mall locations our performance there has exceeded expectations so we re gonna look at malls as a potential growth opportunity given this void in the market and some more attractive rents we re seeing as far as wholesale i would say the biggest incremental business we ve got there is toddler we dominate in baby a lot of folks have our toddler business but several customers last fall intensified the toddler component of the business with us so we re happy about that performance and overall we think this is a good vehicle growth for our company again mike said we tend to have about 90 of the moms buy the carter brand when they have a child and if we can keep those folks in the brand another year or two all the way through a 10 year old child we think that ll be a good thing for our company susan anderson riley fbr analyst great thanks that s very helpful and if i could add one follow up just on toys r us i think you guys said you recaptured about 85 of the 40 million yet obviously the wholesale and retail sales were very strong in the quarter so i guess maybe if you could just give some color on why you didn t think you reached the 40 million and then also just what you think the opportunity could be in 2019 richard westenberger executive vice president and chief financial officer just a couple reactions one the market data would suggest that consumer purchases of our brands was up over 2 last year when we reference what we recaptured it was based on our shipments to replenish some of those sales and replenishment business i would say trended better in the fourth quarter than it had been say in the third quarter it just didn t reach the level that we had expected you ve seen the holiday performance reported by a number of retailers we had very good holiday performance in that 9 week november december shopping period we had very good nearly 5 comp and if you lined up our same 9 weeks to the major retailers 9 weeks which was about a week later their period ended the first week of january our comps were up closer to 6 not every one of our customers had that kind of performance during those 9 week periods depending on the performance they had determines what kind of replenishment we would see in our own business but i would say by and large we re happy with the fourth quarter and we expect based on the current trends in our replenishment sales which is the high margin component of our major retailers business and our business if those trends continue we ll see more of a recapture in 2019 susan anderson riley fbr analyst great and it sounds like that lack of replenishment was more department stores versus mass richard westenberger executive vice president and chief financial officer yes that s fair to say susan anderson riley fbr analyst great thanks so much good luck next quarter richard westenberger executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks very much operator thank you we ll take our next question from heather balsky of bank of america please go ahead heather balsky bank of america analyst hi thank you for taking my question i was hoping you could talk a little bit first on your plans around sg a spending or 2019 and then layering on top of that what level of comp do you need over the next few years to leverage for any expense how should we think about that dynamic in terms of how you plan to expand thanks richard westenberger executive vice president and chief financial officer hi heather as it relates to sg a we re planning actually for leverage in 2019 it s been quite a number of years since we set a plan like that we ve i think made some very good steps to constrain discretionary spending just reflective of the lower topline outlook for the business continuing to invest in important areas marketing technology the forward consumer facing side of the business i d say the overhead area for the business is extremely well controlled we re planning for low single digit growth in sg a and rate leverage as it relates to where do we leverage in the retail business typically it s at that kind of 3 total retail comp level that s the level that allows us to leverage the cost basis of the business heather balsky bank of america analyst thank you and just one follow up in 4q you talked about some expedited shipping initiative i m just curious how those tested in the fourth quarter and how you re thinking of that going forward richard westenberger executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah we did make some investments in expedited shipping i d say in a couple different respects one we wanted to try and increase the processing time through our distribution center and then once we got the products into the shipping stream themselves we spent a bit more on increasing the speed of delivery i d say we re still reading those results i think we are at parity with a number of our competitors now whereas a year ago we felt like we were delivering those e commerce orders a bit more slowly than perhaps our peer group i think we re very comparable still looking for ways to get product to the consumers as quickly as we can we do have some initiatives as it relates to testing fulfillment for instance from some of our retail stores we ll have those capabilities later this year and we ll give that a good test but clearly the consumer has elevated their expectations in terms of the speed with which they expect to get that product and we re trying to respond accordingly heather balsky bank of america analyst thank you very much richard westenberger executive vice president and chief financial officer sure operator as a reminder if you find that your question has been answered you may press 2 to remove yourself from the queue we ll take our next question from ike boruchow of wells fargo please go ahead ike boruchow wells fargo analyst hi good morning everyone thanks for taking the question two questions first one is just on the guidance for q1 could you maybe give us a little bit more color about what retail comp is embedded on the 1q guide just curious how we should expect the later easter to hurt you guys and then obviously help you when you get to second quarter richard westenberger executive vice president and chief financial officer we had a good start out of the gate in q1 in all of our channels i would just say wholesale particularly good and we ve had some softer business in our retail business in the last few weeks we re running down a little bit a little bit of a negative comp there at this point we planned q1 down low single digits and we re running slightly behind that right now keep in mind it s january and february the lightest months of the year march is as big as january and february combined we ve got a later easter this year which pushes about two points of comp into q2 so we re monitoring some of the weather things the tax return situation what have you but we re planning a low single digit comp for the quarter at this point down low single digits michael casey chairman and chief executive officer the best way to think about it ike ike the best way to think about it is with the type of comp we re planning for the first four months of the year which takes the easter holiday out of it is about a 3 comp ike boruchow wells fargo analyst perfect that s helpful then just a quick follow up maybe for richard just more color on the china model and what s changing would be helpful i get that there s a lot of changes going on right now maybe what were the sales and the ebit losses last year that you had with your prior partner and then what we should expect for sales and ebit contribution potentially this fiscal year i m just trying to understand the changes of the model and how it affects the p l a little bit better richard westenberger executive vice president and chief financial officer sure so the previous model we had kind of a disjointed effort we think at approaching that market we were running the e commerce channel which is our website on tmall then we had a partner which is a wholesale relationship for us that we sold product to that partner and then they sold it through the retail stores that they operated from memory sales in china last year were about 12 million we re transitioning to a new model which is more of a royalty relationship so that 12 million will come out of the base of our net sales and we will earn royalty income from that partner on their sales of products in china over time as mike said this is one of our long standing suppliers so they will actually source the product which is a little different we were previously sourcing that product in some cases unique product for china which brought with it a great deal of complexity because that was product that was unique just to china that new partner who had that great expertise both in terms of manufacturing the product and also importantly experience with retail distribution of young children s apparel in china we think that will be a great advantage for us as 2019 is a year of transition we re not planning i wouldn t say for material contributions of royalty income that s probably more of a 2020 and beyond i m not expecting a significant contribution in 2019 we did incur significant losses in china in 2018 the amount that ran through our p l was probably 5 million or 6 million and then we had another 5 or 6 million of additional charges that we ve treated as adjusting items so the better part of 11 million or 12 million of losses and that s a combination of taking charges related to that unique inventory for china and also just severance as we unwind the team and resources that we have put in place in that market ike boruchow wells fargo analyst got it thanks michael casey chairman and chief executive officer this new model what we hope to do is replicate the success that we ve had in canada and mexico we started both of those relationships in canada and mexico through licensing arrangements we ve partnered with someone who grew up in those countries and knew how to operate in those countries and had demonstrated expertise in running retail businesses and sourcing operations and that s now what we have in china it s fortunate to have the experience that we ve had in canada and mexico in china it ll be a nice source of growth force over time ike boruchow wells fargo analyst thanks mike michael casey chairman and chief executive officer you re welcome operator we ll now take our next question from jim chartier of monness crespi hardt please go ahead jim chartier monness crespi hardt analyst good morning thanks for taking my questions michael casey chairman and chief executive officer pleasure jim chartier monness crespi hardt analyst on the toys r us disruption with most of the demand being recaptured by walmart target and amazon who have exclusive brands now that you ve got more time to plan how much of an opportunity do you see to recapture that and how much of a disruption was it to have carter s lost sales and not be able to meet the demand with the exclusive brands michael casey chairman and chief executive officer it was highly disruptive toys r us had been a very good customer of ours for years a good margin customer because it was primarily focused on baby and not surprisingly as we analyze the results we saw a nice lift in our stores but most of the business went to the exclusive brands primarily because those retailers sell things that toys r us was selling diapers formulas strollers other things that we do not sell directly to consumers and things a number of our carter s brand customers don t sell to consumers we re not surprised by the results the encouraging thing is our brands are sold wherever people are shopping for young children s apparel people are just shopping at other places and thankfully we ve seen a nice lift in those exclusive brands but we re also planning good growth with our carter s brand customers in 2019 going forward as i shared with you in some ways it s the toys r us closure bon ton sears disruptive what we re encouraged by going forward there s going to be fewer better stronger retailers and we do business with all of them that should be a nice source of growth for us richard westenberger executive vice president and chief financial officer jim i was just going to also add to that that the shift is something we ve worked on we ve got that great business from amazon we grew our amazon business about 50 last year in our first full year they re now a top ten customer and our exclusive brand simple joys is doing great it doubled over the last year as a matter of fact simple joys was one of the most requested fashion brands on amazon s christmas wish list last year and we just signed a new longer term agreement in january to extend our exclusivity with simple joys those are the types of changes we ve made in the company we continue to have channel shifts we monitor them but we want to make sure we re wherever mom wants to shop for her young children s apparel and as mike said we re gonna have fewer strong retailers we ve got great relationships with all of our partners but as that exclusive brand shift started to happen we re thrilled that we do have those brands and we have those relationships with those folks as well jim chartier monness crespi hardt analyst great and then you guys referenced the potential disruption from china tariffs can you just remind us what percentage of your product will be sourced from china in 2019 and where do you see that over time richard westenberger executive vice president and chief financial officer it s somewhere around 25 comes from china and that s largely for apparel for skip hop it s a much higher percentage it s closer to 100 of skip hop s product comes from china the tariffs in 2018 were not meaningful it hit some of the categories i think even this year the impact is probably somewhere less than 4 or 5 million bucks it s not overly significant it s not zero we already pay tens of millions of dollars in duties from product coming in from china thankfully the tone of the dialogue on those tariffs has improved and we hope it s not a meaningful exposure for us in the balance of the year and going forward jim chartier monness crespi hardt analyst great and then just lastly you mentioned acquisition potential going forward a number of times on skip hop your most recent acquisition can you just give us a sense of where revenue will be in 2019 versus when you purchased it a couple years ago and then where is operating profit next year versus where you bought it thanks richard westenberger executive vice president and chief financial officer sure skip hop s performing well we had real strong sales growth last year of about 30 i think richard said that we were going to grow that about 20 this year we finished last year at about 125 million with skip hop and kind of look at we purchased a nice 100 million business in 2017 we still feel that we can double that business in the first five years of ownership i would say the profit sides not optimized yet we had investments in talent and systems and of course we had the toys r us impact that also played in with skip hop as well but we ve got a real strong product agenda in 2019 we re looking forward to continued growth we ve opened several different accounts got some great new product and our direct business is also growing rapidly we feel very confident about the skip hop business jim chartier monness crespi hardt analyst great thanks and best of luck richard westenberger executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator thank you we will now take our next question from jay sole of ubs please go ahead jay sole ubs analyst great thank you mike you mentioned fewer stronger retailer partners in your wholesale business can you give us an idea of what percentage of the wholesale business right now is your top five customers michael casey chairman and chief executive officer i think we said it s probably the better part of 60 to 70 of our top five they re about it s a high percentage jay sole ubs analyst do you anticipate that number will increase over the next couple years michael casey chairman and chief executive officer yeah there are still some major retailers who are working hard to find relevance with consumers today my guess is there ll be further consolidation jay sole ubs analyst got it and then maybe just on square footage you gave that nice slide on page 13 showing your store plans does the store count growth correlate with what you expect the square footage growth to be or just because you re doing more dual branded stores will there be a relatively greater increase in square footage relative to store count michael casey chairman and chief executive officer the typical model we have right now is 4 000 5 000 square feet something we have not built into the model is this new gymboree opportunity where we re going to test the smaller mall store format and it s worked beautifully for us up in canada we have smaller store formats up in canada we have some smaller formats in the united states and there s a smaller store format in mexico we ve got a line of sight to what makes sense in the malls and going forward it might be more stores but the square footage may be smaller jay sole ubs analyst got it and then maybe one last one richard just on the gross margin in 4q could you just maybe parse out some of the drivers in a little bit more detail to what really changed versus last year richard westenberger executive vice president and chief financial officer jay is your question is for a fourth quarter gross margin or for 2019 jay sole ubs analyst no for fourth quarter the quarter we just finished richard westenberger executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think the major effect really has to do with the mix of the business and so within wholesale we still have the effects of the loss of the toys r us and bon ton which was very good margin business for us we were relatively more promotional in e commerce that s still good margin business for it but just not quite up to our plans we ve seen a real issue around freight costs being higher the cost to serve that e commerce business has been increasing i mentioned the additional investment in expedite shipping but really the operational cost around e commerce had been some pressure and some of those cost run through the gross margin line that was a bit of pressure there we also saw some additional off price channel sales in the fourth quarter that was a feature of just being a little heavier on some of that toys r us related inventory that we were clearing through so those were some factors that probably puts a little bit more pressure on gross margin than is typical for us jay sole ubs analyst got it thank you so much richard westenberger executive vice president and chief financial officer you re welcome operator thank you we will take our next question from laurent vasilescu of macquarie please go ahead laurent vasilescu macquarie analyst good morning thank you very much for taking my question i wanted to follow up on jay s gross margin question i m curious to know how we should model the grow margin down for the first quarter is it probably down 150 bits and then how should we think about the gross margin overall for the year and then maybe any color on the tax rate for the year richard westenberger executive vice president and chief financial officer i would say we are planning gross margins down in the first quarter i d say the planning assumption for 2019 is more comparability year over year we re looking for more comparable gross margins for the full year period the factors that are affecting q1 certainly would be the slow start to the year the factors that i mentioned as it relates to higher freight expenses there is a bit still of that comparability issue on toys r us in the first quarter where again that was very good margin business it s not in the base at the moment but we re expecting good performance and actually some gross margin expansion in the second half of the year effective tax rate will be similar as well to 2018 in that low 20 range laurent vasilescu macquarie analyst okay very helpful and then i think we ve called out the sg a adjusted sg a levered by 120 bits reflecting expense leverage in all segments and then i think also lower provisions are for performance based compensation could you potentially quantify that provision and then how do we think about any are there any one time investments that we should consider for the first quarter richard westenberger executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah in terms of sg a in the fourth quarter i believe the year over year reduction in that provision for performance based compensation is about 9 million we did not achieve our performance objectives for the year a good portion of that relates to the unexpected bankruptcies of toys r us and bon ton but the decrease in the provision that benefited the full year actually i should say is about 9 million it s a smaller number for the fourth quarter is your second question as it relates to investments michael casey chairman and chief executive officer for the first quarter richard westenberger executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i don t think there are any unique investments we continue to spend on some of our technology initiatives we re working on some of the ongoing integration efforts with skip hop we re transitioning some of our distribution and adding additional distribution capabilities on the west coast in service of this skip hop brand michael casey chairman and chief executive officer normal business richard westenberger executive vice president and chief financial officer those are some of the projects that we re pursuing in the first quarter nothing unusual laurent vasilescu macquarie analyst okay very helpful thank you and just a last question here last february i think it was called out that international should grow by 300 million and e commerce should grow by 400 million over the next five years with today s callouts for the five year plan with international growing about 100 million can you parse that out by region and then is e commerce still expected to grow by 400 million over the next five years richard westenberger executive vice president and chief financial officer well on international we ve trimmed the previous forecast by about 100 million and that s entirely china because the new model that we have with china s a licensing model those sales will not be coming through our sales line item then we do continue to expect good growth in e commerce we ll probably trim that by some portion of 100 million as well relative to our forecast last february simply because we re seeing some pressure with international demand on our us website that s been a good source of growth for us over the years and just based on our experience this past year we re seeing lower demand from international consumer shopping on our us website which our analysis suggests is directly attributable to the stronger dollar and the weaker exchange rates we ve seen that not only online but in our stores lower internationally laurent vasilescu macquarie analyst very helpful thank you very much for all the color richard westenberger executive vice president and chief financial officer our pleasure operator that concludes today s question and answer session mr casey i would like to turn the call back to you for any additional or closing remarks michael casey chairman and chief executive officer great thank you thank you all

sterling rebounds after no deal brexit worries failure to break the westminster deadlock over brexit has weighed on sterling over the past month as fears mount over a potential no deal departure with damaging consequences for the british economy however there was a rebound on tuesday on mounting hopes of an extension to the 29 march deadline or a soft brexit analysts say the pound could rise by as

despite solid growth and continuing job gains the us economy will see inflation fall even further below the central bank s two percent goal at least for a time federal reserve chairman jerome powell said tuesday that forecast added weight to the fed s recent announcements that it will be patient before making any further changes in the benchmark borrowing rate a stance powell re emphasized in semi annual testimony before the us senate banking committee recent declines in energy prices will likely push headline inflation further below the longer run goal of 2 percent for a time he said the us central bank increased the key policy interest rate four times last year but rising uncertainty especially around the us trade confrontation with china amplified concerns about slowing global growth and fears the fed was moving too aggressively and with no sign of rising inflation that prompted the fed to signal clearly for the past several weeks that it would tread carefully many economists no longer expect any increases this year while a few say the next move could be a cut if the economy slows further noting the fed s preferred annual inflation measure sits at 1 7 percent powell said the extent and timing of any further rate increases would depend on incoming data and the evolving outlook the danger of having inflation continually below the target is that it saps confidence in the fed s ability to impact the economy especially during a slowdown but the muted inflation pressures and risks on the horizon mean this is a good time to be patient and watch and wait and see how the situation evolves he said in response to a question unlike the reaction to some of his comments late last year markets largely shrugged off powell s testimony to focus on other issues wall street closed slightly lower he remained upbeat about the economic outlook saying fed officials generally expected economic activity to expand at a solid pace albeit somewhat slower than in 2018 and the job market to remain strong economic crosscurrents however crosscurrents and conflicting signals pose a potential danger the predominant risks are slowing global growth particularly china and europe which he cautioned can create headwinds for the united states economy brexit and ongoing trade negotiations also are issues the fed will carefully monitor us federal reserve gal roma afp the united states and china have hammered each other with punitive tariffs on more than 360 billion in two way trade raising prices to producers and consumers and undercutting economic growth the international monetary fund cites the trade war between the world s two largest economies as a major risk to global growth and cut their growth forecast for this year but president donald trump on monday said he expected to hold a signing summit soon with china s leader xi jinping to resolve the issue and he pushed back a march 1 deadline which would have triggered tariffs to more than double on 200 billion in chinese exports in the us economy low inflation and sluggish wage growth despite net job gains that averaged 223 000 last year and gdp gaining just under three percent have continued to baffle economists and the fed powell noted some signs of stronger wage growth particularly in lower skilled jobs but also said disparities persist in the labor market along racial and ethnic lines and also between rural and urban workers they did it anyway however longer run trends such as relatively stagnant incomes for many families and a lack of upward economic mobility among people with lower incomes also remain important challenges he said and the united states has a lower share of prime age workers participating in the economy than comparable advanced economies which has the effect of holding back productivity which is needed to boost growth he added powell said in addition to programs to promote worker training and dealing with the opioid crisis that keeps people out of the workforce the government needs policies that do not punish people for going back to work he described a training program in west virginia where women who participated lost the meager benefits they were already getting because many us aid programs end as soon as the recipients find jobs they had to take a pay cut to go back to work and they did it anyway which is pretty inspiring powell told senators

poc lab diagnostics subscriptions 2 complete our transition to core proprietary diagnostics lines developed manufactured and sold directly by heska 3 continue our transition away from non core contract manufacturing and low differentiation legacy products which we expect to stabilize into a long horizon rate 4 deliver on our transformative new product and geography expansions to drive major steps up in growth and 5 allocate capital for product development and in house manufacturing of heska s exclusive diagnostics analyzer and testing lines team expansion acquisitions joint ventures and licensing opportunities when we began our first five year heska reset plan in 2013 heska contained a small core of businesses that represented the future and several legacy businesses that did not offer sustainable growth opportunity and value additive creation our revitalization efforts since 2013 have grown our core lines of the future to 70 of sales while our non core legacy lines have faded to 30 our retooling and refocusing is nearly complete continued mr wilson heska s future is now firmly in the point of care diagnostics and informatics markets where heska solves important problems for global veterinarians and pets through innovations developed made sold or controlled by heska this is the huge value creation opportunity we have targeted since 2013 and we have made incredible progress our first act 2013 2017 rewarded us for improving our base business our second act 2018 2022 will transform heska into a high margin high growth focused company with widely coveted domain expertise in the markets we serve and in the development manufacturing and global sales of the exclusive in house innovations we offer while 2018 was uncharacteristically light on step function events and the financial scoreboard was challenged by some real negatives i am confident in the substantial progress we have made in dramatically growing the value of heska in the first year of our second act in this second year of our second act we are greatly expanding the utility of our current diagnostics lines that represent the future developing and launching new lines that leapfrog the competition selling our broadening proprietary solutions into our growing subscriber base and international geographies and closing in on key business development opportunities fully aware of the strength and size of our competitors i am optimistic that we can do these things well in 2019 to strongly position heska within the healthy and consolidating global pet and animal healthcare markets to deliver substantial value creation for customers and shareholders concluded mr wilson core companion animal cca segment poc lab diagnostics subscriptions compared to outlook poc lab diagnostics is

hospitals scheduled to begin in november of 2017 and to be largely completed before the end of the second quarter in 2018 these installations have not progressed in line with these commitments for the

diagnostics consumables performed well in 2018 sales of lab diagnostics consumables grew 14 3 to 44 8mm in 2018 compared to 39 2mm in 2017 2018 poc lab diagnostics instruments and consumables and related items delivered gross margins of 53 2 compared to 51 6 in the prior year demand utilization and pricing broadly were excellent offset in the second half by 1 non utilization at non activated pvcc corporate group hospitals earlier in the year and 2 reduced henry schein animal health hsah stocking and sales in the final quarter of the year possibly related to the hsah spinoff into a new animal health company covetrus nasdaq cvet lease accounting impact on lab diagnostics instruments revenue higher ratios of operating versus sale type lease accounting treatment lowered revenue from sales type leases compared to 2017 by approximately 0 2mm in the fourth quarter and 1 5mm for the full year a higher proportion of corporate account installations compared to individual account installations occurred in the second half of 2018 compared to 2017 due to solid activations at pathway corporate group hospitals based on the terms of these contracts they tend to result in operating lease accounting treatment which reduces up front equipment revenues infusion pumps instruments thousands of heska branded infusion pumps are in use throughout veterinary hospitals in north america infusion pumps are a legacy product sold primarily through distribution at volume and at margins to heska of roughly 20 because of the low differentiation and low value added nature of these products they are a non core product line for heska sales of infusion pumps were softer than anticipated in 2018 down for the full year compared to the prior year by 1 3mm to 2 7mm poc imaging heska imaging increased sales 4 2 for 2018 fourth quarter domestic sales of digital radiography were 2 5mm below our outlook the largest portion of our revenue shortfall for the fourth quarter and for the year due to softness in december full year sales of digital radiography products rose 8 4 domestically to 10 8mm and 20 6 internationally to 4 0mm offset by softness in domestic ultrasound sales which were lower by approximately 17 600 thousand in 2018 than in the prior year digital radiography and ultrasound sales were lower than expected in december due to customer delays in making large non subsidized purchases due to several factors including 1 customer concerns surrounding december financial markets turmoil 2 higher borrowing interest rates 3 uncertainty under new tax laws 4 weak participation at the american association of equine practitioners trade show and 5 a supply chain delay for the new dentislate product which delayed shipments until february of 2019 pharmaceuticals

from 84 4mm in 2017 to 89 3mm 5 9 in 2018 non core products in 2018 heska non core products are legacy products that heska contract manufacturers but does not itself sell to customers or that heska does not manufacture and does not add a sustainable and significant innovation or channel advantage products fitting this definition include 1 pvd tri heart and solostep heartworm products 2 infusion pumps in cca segment and 3 ovp segment which is contract manufacturing and research and development non core products we have seen for some time that a runoff of non core products to lower levels of

development new analyzer releases and test menu expansions are progressing positively for 2019 releases to further publicly announced initiatives and others in the third quarter of 2018 heska invested approximately 8 0mm in unconsolidated affiliates as part of our innovation strategy and an additional 8 2mm in software technologies from cuattro llc we continue to track and expect to win several more business development opportunities of various sizes and types with a particular focus on adding more next generation technologies geographies and product line extensions in the 2019 to 2020 period while 2017 and 2018 were relatively quiet on product releases 2019 will see several launches and 2020 is scheduled to see additional major releases element dc5x chemistry analyzer in the second half of 2018 heska began shipping its first major new addition to the heska dry chemistry product line since 2012 the all new element dc5x which delivers the highest throughput of any fully featured point of care veterinary dry chemistry solution by combining higher level automated workflow simultaneous staging of five patient samples on board bi directional data sharing a streamlined touch

of annual fecal and urine microscopy tests performed manually at the point of care in veterinary hospitals around the world element uf is highly anticipated for release in early 2020 the company notes that urine only units have been placed by competitors in over 7 000 hospitals in the past three years heska believes that fecal capabilities are far more valuable problem solving proposition to veterinarians than urine and further that by combining fecal and urine functionality heska will have a substantial and sustainable advantage in anticipation of new product launches geographic

pleased with underlying growth trends in poc lab diagnostics consumables and instruments in 2018 and over the past five years the company sees positive trends continuing for 2019 and 2020 due to the size and nature of incremental test launches and size and nature of heska s reset subscriptions model on new analyzers placed the immediate effects to revenue from these new launches are anticipated to be modest in 2019 and accelerating in 2020 heska remains committed to this strategy of building long term economics and value through these sustaining plans and programs and intends to continue to follow this successful model in the future which may dampen near term revenue recognition for 2019 heska anticipates increased competition effectiveness for retention of competitive current domestic hospital locations market share positively offset by increased installations utilization and new locations acquisitions of corporate group accounts and heska retention rates at or above the 95 rate for 2018 retention of subscribers is a key goal for heska near term in process product launches are scheduled to be substantial for heska throughout 2019 and into early 2020 innovation to solve meaningful customer problems drives growth in poc diagnostics to meet and perhaps accelerate projects the company intends to increase research and development in 2019 and expects expenses from

diagnostics devices and testing consumables from our usda and fda regulated des moines iowa based diamond animal health facility diamond is a major opportunity for heska reductions in 2019 non core

by manufacturing poc testing consumables and light poc analyzer assembly and testing this is a major milestone for heska and the company believes it is a fundamental shift up the value creation chain diamond has for many years performed key cca functions related to these initiatives including 1 poc analyzer intake testing certification and delivery 2 pick pack and shipment of most poc diagnostics consumables to end user veterinary hospitals 3 allercept allergy testing and immunotherapy production and fulfillment and 4 many other key functions critical to the success of cca the company sees

washington afp advertising read more despite solid growth and continuing job gains the us economy will see inflation fall even further below the central bank s two percent goal at least for a time federal reserve chairman jerome powell said tuesday that forecast added weight to the fed s recent announcements that it will be patient before making any further changes in the benchmark borrowing rate a stance powell re emphasized in semi annual testimony before the us senate banking committee recent declines in energy prices will likely push headline inflation further below the longer run goal of 2 percent for a time he said the us central bank increased the key policy interest rate four times last year but rising uncertainty especially around the us trade confrontation with china amplified concerns about slowing global growth and fears the fed was moving too aggressively and with no sign of rising inflation that prompted the fed to signal clearly for the past several weeks that it would tread carefully many economists now do not expect any increase this year while a few say the next move could be a cut if the economy slows further noting the fed s preferred annual inflation measure sits at 1 7 percent powell said the extent and timing of any further rate increases would depend on incoming data and the evolving outlook the danger of having inflation continually below the target is that it saps confidence in the fed s ability to impact the economy especially during a slowdown but the muted inflation pressures and risks on the horizon mean this is a good time to be patient and watch and wait and see how the situation evolves he said in response to a question he remained upbeat about the economic outlook saying fed officials generally expected economic activity to expand at a solid pace albeit somewhat slower than in 2018 and the job market to remain strong economic crosscurrents however crosscurrents and conflicting signals pose a potential danger the predominant risks are slowing global growth particularly china and europe which he cautioned can create headwinds for the united states economy brexit and ongoing trade negotiations also are issues the fed will carefully monitor the united states and china have hammered each other with punitive tariffs on more than 360 billion in two way trade raising prices to producers and consumers and undercutting economic growth the international monetary fund cites the trade war between the world s two largest economies as a major risk to global growth and cut their growth forecast for this year but president donald trump on monday said he expected to hold a signing summit soon with china s leader xi jinping to resolve the issue and he pushed back a march 1 deadline which would have triggered tariffs to more than double on 200 billion in chinese exports in the us economy low inflation and sluggish wage growth despite net job gains that averaged 223 000 last year and gdp gaining just under three percent has continued to baffle economists and the fed powell noted some signs of stronger wage growth particularly in lower skilled jobs but also said disparities persist in the labor market along racial and ethnic lines and also between rural and urban workers they did it anyway however longer run trends such as relatively stagnant incomes for many families and a lack of upward economic mobility among people with lower incomes also remain important challenges he said and the united states has a lower share of prime age workers participating in the economy than comparable advanced economies which has the effect of holding back productivity which is needed to boost growth he added powell said in addition to programs to promote worker training and dealing with the opioid crisis that keeps people out of the workforce the government needs policies that do not punish people for going back to work describing a training program for in west virginia where the women who participated lost the meager benefits they were already getting because many us aid programs end as soon as the recipient finds a job they had to take a pay cut to go back to work and they did it anyway which is pretty inspiring powell told the senators 2019 afp
pie chart depicting total federal spending or government expenditure categories photo adobestock gksd ppd when i m asked for a basic tutorial on fiscal policy i normally share my four videos on the economics of government spending and my primer on fundamental tax reform but this six minute interview may be a quicker introduction to spending issues since i had the opportunity to touch on almost every key principle culled from the discussion here is what everyone should understand about the spending side of the fiscal ledger principle 1 america s fiscal problem is a government that is too big and growing too fast government spending diverts resources from the productive sector of the economy regardless of how it is financed there is real world evidence that large public sectors sap the private sector s vitality augmented by lots of academic research on the negative relationship between government spending and economic performance principle 2 entitlements programs are the main drivers of excessive spending all the long run forecasts show that the burden of spending is rising because of the so called mandatory spending programs social security medicare and medicaid were not designed to keep pace with demographic changes falling birthrates increasing longevity so spending for these program will consume ever larger shares of economic output principle 3 deficits and debt are symptoms of the underlying problem government borrowing is not a good idea but it s primarily badbecause it is a way of financing a larger burden of spending the appropriate analogy is that just as a person with a brain tumor shouldn t fixate on the accompanying headache taxpayers paying for a bloated government should pay excessive attention to the portion financed by red ink principle 4 existing red ink is small compared to the federal government s unfunded liabilities people fixate on current levels of deficits and debt which are a measure of all the additional spending financed by red ink but today s amount of red ink is relatively small compared to unfunded liabilities i e measures of how much future spending will exceed projected revenues principle 5 a spending cap is the best way to solve america s fiscal problems balanced budget rules are better than nothing but they have a don t control the size and growth of government spending caps are the only fiscal rules that have a strong track record even confirmed by research from the international monetary fund and organization for economic cooperation and development here s one final principle though i didn t mention it in the interview principle 6 increasing taxes will make a bad situation worse since government spending is the real fiscal problem higher taxes at best replace debt financed spending with tax financed spending in reality higher taxes loosen political constraints on policy makers and feed the beast so the most likely outcome as seen in europe is that overall spending levels increase and long term debt actually increases in an ideal world these six principles would be put in a frame and nailed above the desk of every politician government official and bureaucrat who deals with fiscal policy not that it would make much difference since their decisions are guided by public choice no matter what principles they see at their desk but it s nice to fantasize here are a few other observations from the interview p s needless to say i wish limits on enumerated powers were still a guiding principle for fiscal policy sadly the days of madisonian constitutionalism are long gone

lined up on opening day at palo alto last year and the patience of our fans more than 7 000 miles away have showed up for our recent opening in shanghai the loyalty and energy from this community is something we value enormously never take for granted we are focused more than ever on developing even deeper relationships with our communities but in and around our shacks also one of our many

with that we re investing meaningfully in our systems for the future tara will provide an update on enterprise systems upgrade we refer to you as project concrete but i would like to take a moment to stress how important we believe this transformation will be in an effort to ensure our infrastructure and support systems are sufficiently robust and scale to deliver up on our current and future growth opportunities we re investing a lot of capital in order to streamline and automate business process all the while taking administrative and time consuming task out of the shacks to better allow

company and resonate with our employees guest and communities and suppliers with that i ll turn the call over to tara to share more fully how we ended the year financially and highlights of our growth ahead tara comonte chief financial officer thanks randy total revenues for the fourth quarter 2018 which includes sales from both company operated shacks as well as licensing revenue increased 29 to 124 3 million sales from our company operated shack increased 30 to 120 7 million largely due to the addition of 34 new domestic company operated shacks since the fourth quarter of 2017 and positive same shack sales licensing revenue for the fourth quarter increased 18 to 3 5 million driven by a net increase of 16 shacks since the fourth quarter last year on a strong performance of our newer shacks in hong kong and japan implementation of the new revenue accounting standard at the beginning of 2018 has impacted the timing of the revenue recognition to some of our licensing agreements and we ve included a comparison in the footnotes of the 10 k to show our revenue as reported under both the new and old standard the impact on the fourth quarter and fiscal 2018 was 263 000 and 668 000 respectively which was slightly above previous expectations due to the accounting treatment for our new partnership agreements in mexico singapore and the philippines in the back half of the year for the full year 2018 total revenue increased 28 to 459 3 million with system wide sales increasing to 671 9 million in november we raised our total revenue guidance and i m pleased to have exceeded that primarily driven by the strength of almost recent opening and same shack sales performance in the fourth quarter we opened 17 domestic company operated shacks in q4 representing 50 of our 2018 opening schedule additionally seven of the 17 shacks opened in the last two weeks of the year and therefore still in their very early days of operation which will impact near term profitability as they work through their settling in period we delivered positive same shack sales of 2 3 during the fourth quarter consisting of a 2 6 increase in price and mix partially offset by 0 3 decrease in traffic lapping of 0 8 increase in same shack sales in the same quarter in 2017 as fourth quarter performance resulted in positive same shack sales of 1 for the full year 2018 at the high end of our previously guided range of 0 to 1 although we lapse the first full quarter of delivery testing we started in earnest in the fourth quarter 2017 our digital channels and delivery in particular performed strongly in quarter four and had a meaningful contribution to our overall revenue and comp performance in addition we saw favorable weather in the northeast over the holiday periods in particular as a reminder new york city and the northeast continues to represent the majority of shacks and revenue in our comp base and as such our comp performance will continue to be impacted to some degree by factors specific to these regions average weekly sales for domestic company operated shacks was 81 000 for the fourth quarter a decline of roughly 4 7 from the prior year driven by the introduction of a broader range of unit volume shacks into the system average unit volume for all domestic company operated shacks was 4 4 million for the full year this is higher than our previously guided range of 4 2 million to 4 3 million due both to the continued strength of the 2018 plus and our rental comp base performance shack level operating profit a non gaap measure for the fourth quarter increased 27 2 million and shack level operating margin was 22 5 for the full year 2018 shack level operating profit grew 22 3 to 112 9 million with shack level operating margin of 25 3 performing at the higher end of our guided range shack level operating margin in the fourth quarter was impacted by a few items in particular the back end weighted opening schedule and the cost of increasing levels of delivery revenue labor and related expenses increased to 160 basis points to 28 5 compared to last year driven by those 24 new shack openings in the second half of the year together with the ongoing impact of year on year wage inflation and regulatory requirements on our existing shacks we have previously shared that new shacks typically see a higher labor rate during the initial operating periods as new teams calibrate staffing level to support demands before the shack settled into a more normalized operating rhythm with 50 of our 2018 class opening in the fourth quarter we certainly saw that impacting our operating margin in the period in addition as illustrated on page 12 in our supplemental materials the significant headwind around labor cost continued with double digit minimum wage increases in many of our markets and incredibly competitive labor environment and increasing levels of regulation across the country other operating expenses in the fourth quarter increased 140 basis points to 12 6 compared to the prior year driven primarily by delivery commissions paid during the quarter that did not exist in the same period last year occupancy and related expenses declined 50 basis points compared to the same period in 2017 the 7 5 of shack sales driven by sales leverage combined with an increase in the proportion of build to suit shacks within the portfolio our occupancy line in particular will be impacted in 2019 from the recent change in lease accounting which we ll discuss in a moment core g a excluding project concrete and other onetime items was 14 4 million in the fourth quarter with the year on year increase driven by ongoing future focused growth investments primarily in people resources home office expenses and technology and foundational infrastructure total g a in the quarter was 15 2 million and included approximately 750 000 a one time operating costs primarily associated with project concrete as a reminder the accounting standard released in august 2018 changed the treatment of implementation costs associated with client based software solutions in line with this for the full year 2018 we spent approximately 1 3 million in one time operating expense and approximately 1 1 million in capsule on project concrete at a combined 2 4 million which was slightly below our prior guidance of 2 5 million of project concrete in 2018 as a result of timing of spend between the fourth quarter 2018 and the third quarter of this year preopening expenses in the fourth quarter was 4 2 million and for the full year 12 3 million albeit slightly below prior guidance of 13 million due to the timing of opening this represents an increase of 60 and 28 from the prior fourth quarter and full year 2017 respectively as we opened our largest class of shacks to date adjusted ebitda in the fourth quarter declined 3 from the same quarter last year to 14 5 million and adjusted ebitda margin was 11 6 the fourth quarter results were impacted by each of the factors i just mentioned the increase in preopening costs relating to 17 openings are heavily back end weighted opening schedule impacting near term operating margin new costs occurring within the business related to delivery as well as our ongoing investments that continued growth for the full year adjusted ebitda increased 14 2 to 73 9 million with an adjusted ebitda margin of 16 1 in the fourth quarter on an adjusted pro forma basis we earned 2 4 million or 0 06 portfolio exchanged and diluted share compared to 3 9 million or 0 10 in the same quarter last year excess tax benefits from stock compensation activity has no impact on results on adjusted pro forma basis for the full year net income increased 28 to 26 9 million or 0 71 per fully exchanged and diluted share compared to 21 million or 0 57 in the prior year included within this full year pro forma results is the tax benefit of 0 05 per fully exchanged and diluted share due to stock based comp activity moving on to 2019 i d like to provide some additional commentary on the new lease accounting standard that went into effect in the beginning of this year and the impact we will have on how we report our leases going forward and our results and balance sheet and p l we ve also included some information as it relates to this on page 13 and 14 of our supplemental materials at the end of fiscal 2018 approximately 16 of our shacks were build to suit leases and 84 for operating lease under the new standard all of our existing build to suit leases will be considered operating leases and as a result of adoption we will derecognize all of the existing built to suite assets and liabilities on the balance sheet we will then account for all operating leases on the balance sheet going forward and we expect the resulting net increase to total assets upon adoption to be in the range of 207 million to 217 million and the net increase to total liabilities to be in the range of 202 million to 212 million from a p l perspective there is no material change to the accounting for our existing operating leases however the accounting treatments of previous build to suit leases will have an impact on a number of key expense lines primarily occupancy where expenses to build to suit leases will not be reported the expenses relating to these leases were previously accounted for in depreciation and interest expense in addition the treatment of some of our shack equipment leases will result in a small benefit to other operating expenses but on a combined basis the impact of this new accounting standard is expected have an unfavorable impact of approximately 60 basis points to our shack level operating profit margin in 2019 and has been incorporated in our guidance for the year while this change will increase our balance sheet and unfavorably impact of shack level operating profit and adjusted ebitda it is non cash in nature expected to be net neutral to net income and not a reflection of any change in underlying business performance so moving on to guidance for the fiscal year 2019 and incorporating the impact i just mentioned we re expecting total revenue of 570 million to 576 million an increase of approximately 25 over 2018 representing another year of strong growth ahead within this total revenue number we expect 15 million to 16 million of licensing revenue an increase of approximately 13 of the midpoint over 2018 we expect to open 36 to 40 new domestic company operated shacks representing a unit growth rate of approximately 30 we do however expect a similarly back weighted development schedule in 2019 as we experienced in 2018 with approximately 60 of our openings at this point scheduled for the second half of the year as noted for the fourth quarter 2018 this significant growth comes with near term investments and can have a meaningful impact on our shack level profitability this has been taken into consideration in our guidance for the year we expect to open 16 to 18 net new licensed shacks with our domestic licensed development focused primarily in airports and internationally continuing our focus on expansion into asia including our upcoming entry in singapore and philippines as well as we enter into mexico later this year at the end of 2019 we expect our average unit volume for our company operated shacks between 4 million and 4 1 million combined with the fact that we will continue to open shacks at lower auv this guidance also reflects our expectations that some of our soft more shacks will extend strong honeymoon periods in 2019 and will start settling into more normalized levels of sales performance we expect same shack sales to continue to be impacted by our ongoing market growth strategy particularly at this early stage in our overall expansion to that end we are guiding to 0 to 1 same shack sales for the full year consistent with 2018 and this includes roughly 1 5 price taken on a blended basis in late december 2018 partially offset by an expected continuation of traffic trends experienced over the last eight to 10 quarters we expect the shack level operating profit margin of between 23 and 24 driven by four major factors the new lease accounting standard which is expected to have a negative impact of approximately 50 basis points food and paper cost increases driven by an increased usage of cost an increased usage and cost of paper and packaging of our digital sales continued to represent a higher proportion of our business and broader inflation in transport and distribution costs labor headwinds continuing the trend we ve experienced for the last couple of years with significant monetary increases in both minimum wages and salaries in many of our key market higher wages overall as a result of the competitive and low unemployment labor markets and the ongoing impact of new shacks at a high percentage growth rate entering our system as illustrated in our supplemental materials our home markets of new york city for example has experienced a 43 increase in minimum wage since 2016 with other key growth markets experiencing between 20 and 30 increase in the same period in addition within the labor line stock comp expense within shack level operating profit will increase in 2019 as a result of the general manager equity growth that randy mentioned earlier in addition to the impact of the lease standard on our occupancy line as a reminder we also benefited from a favorable 20 basis point impact from a non cash deferred rent adjustment in 2018 which will not recur in 2019 we expect our g a expense to be between 66 4 million and 68 2 million inclusive of equity based compensation project concrete and other one time charges at only 125 company operated shacks today that you heard from randy we intend to continue to invest across our business to support a sizable growth that lies ahead we believe in building the right way for the long term and you should expect to see us continue to deploy spend in our people in our guest experience and in our underlying technology that we believe will deliver both leverage and compelling long term returns for our shareholders randy mentioned our continued commitment to excellence in our people in addition to strengthening our leadership team with exciting new members we ve also renewed several other key leaders long term incentive packages as we rapidly approach five years since the ipo as a result our stock compensation expense in 2019 will increase compared to last year we expect equity based compensation to be between 7 4 million and 7 7 million in 2019 an increase of approximately 26 of the midpoint of the range we feel very good with the structure we ve put in place both as it relates to long term retention and incentive alignment to continued performance delivery given the expensing of the original ipo options rolled off in the first quarter next year however we do expect to see leverage on this line item in 2020 project concrete our enterprise system upgrade is progressing well we re in the midst of the development and implementation work and we re on track for multiple key modules going live in the third and fourth quarters the one time incremental costs related to this project remain in line with our prior estimate and for 2019 we re expected to be between 3 million and 3 5 million of g a and approximately 4 million of capital although the split between capex and opex may vary a little as the year progresses the majority of this spend is expected to be one time in nature and we will continue to report it separately on such throughout the year as a reminder project concrete in 2019 includes the majority of our financial hr and procurement and inventory systems and represents a significant strengthening of our foundational infrastructure to further enable the many years of growth we see ahead we expect preopening costs to be between 13 million and 14 million for the year tied closely to our development schedule as we ve seen for many years our shacks often begins with extraordinary sales volume and we believe it s important to continue to invest in ensuring these strong starts over the next few years as we continue to grow established markets we do expect leverage on the shack on a per shack basis in this line item we expect depreciation in 2019 of approximately 41 million to 42 million this represents more than 40 step up in 2018 at the midpoint with the most significant increase as a result of the full year depreciation for 2018 shack opening combined with more new shacks than ever coming online in 2019 the step up in depreciation mirrors our continued high percentage growth rate and although non cash will have a meaningful impact to our 2019 eps we expect interest expense to be significantly lower than in years past are between 300 000 and 400 000 primarily due to the new lease accounting standards and the resulting taxation of build to suit leases which previously recorded an interest charge and lastly we expect an annual adjusted pro forma effective tax rate of 26 5 to 27 5 for 2019 excluding any effect from the accounting treatment for excess tax benefits from stock based comp we know many of you have asked about operating leverage in the business model and we carefully consider that as part of our annual and long term planning process over the next few years as we continue to execute on our robust pipeline of growth fully implement project concrete and benefit more fully from current and ongoing digital investments we do expect to achieve leverage in our overall cost base while we ve experienced significant increases in our labor costs as illustrated in our supplemental materials we do expect those levels of inflation in some of our markets to begin to settle over the next few years we continue our conservative approach to price taking only a modest increase which is not fully offset the increasing labor costs we faced we do believe we retained pricing power and we ll continue to assess relative to the headwinds operating margins as time goes on from a g a perspective as you know we accelerated investment in 2018 and we ll do so again in 2019 as we continue to invest in long term sustainable growth and build toward a much bigger business opportunity between project concrete and our other key digital marketing and tech initiatives we re confident in the return they will deliver for the business in the future and the leverage they will drive in our p l over the coming years overall our business model remains one of the strongest in our industry we have another incredibly year ahead of us we re bullish about our opportunity to continue to grow shake shack for the long term with a stellar leadership team a clear set of strategic priorities and a robust balance sheet with no debt resulting in our ability to continue to self fund our ongoing investments and strategic growth initiatives from cash flow with that i ll pass you back to randy garutti before we open to your questions randy garutti chief executive officer and director thanks tara i m really proud of our team for the strong finish to 2018 marking another tremendous year of growth for shake shack we are going to continue to focus relentlessly on driving growth through committing to excellence in our people delivering a consistently great guest experience cultivating a loyal and connected community and innovating our business for long term growth looking forward 2019 is another busy year as we take on our largest class of shacks yet we ll begin to build and enter into three new countries internationally we know there are significant runway for growth ahead we re building this company for a long and bright future making the necessary investments along the way to ensure we fully capture that opportunity as we head toward our target of at least 200 company operated shacks and 120 licensed shacks and over 700 million in total revenue by the end of 2020 with that i thank you all for joining today s call and you can go ahead and open the line for questions thanks questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question will come from nicole miller from piper jaffray nicole miller piper jaffray companies analyst thank you good afternoon i was wondering if you could share a little bit more about the important changes you made at the executive level the announcements that were made last week talk about if you can a little bit about growing talent internally and how you balance that against attracting external resources randy garutti chief executive officer and director thanks nicole when we ve i ve been working to this company for 19 years and shake shack has grown one of the core principles i have had for our leadership team has been a balance the balance of the people that got us here from the beginning and really understand what build this place with people from outside organizations who bring expertise and experience that we haven t had if you look at our executive leadership team our full leadership team and even our teams always to the shack level they are balance teams they are balanced and reversed and they bring different kinds of thoughts so we re really thrilled to bring in jay and dave to really for the first time have a chief marketing officer and chief information officer and we re thrilled to promote andrew and michael to really lead our development they have seen this place since the beginning and they have done an incredible work in addition to tara zach peggy and our leadership team we re also proud to announce new board member sumaiya balbale who comes to us with a tremendous e commerce background from jet com and most recently at walmart com to add in our board so we re really excited about how we lock arms around this table and they kind of battles debates and excitement that we go forward with as a leadership team and the strategic focus that we ve talked a lot about early on this call has been birth from that group of people we re excited to execute it for shack nicole miller piper jaffray companies analyst thank you for the update and congratulations to all those individuals just a last question when you talk about labor pressures and we run the model we can see that that is a critical so much as an impact that you re talking about i wanted to understand a little bit more on the third piece i think that you talked about the new store just a general inefficiencies with that and it s certainly the price of just doing business very effectively but when does that start to level off and if you could frame up the impact of that that would be very helpful i think as we model maybe not this year but years going forward thanks randy garutti chief executive officer and director thanks nicole it s a really important question and i really won t be able to hear it it s if you look at last year we grew 38 unit growth ok there is a cost to that growth it does impact our shack level operating profit over the near term if you look at this business on a run rate basis it s very different and when you take these one year snapshots that we obviously need to take in these quarters in these years including our guidance for 2019 so when you open restaurants let s talk about just to even name a few at the end of last year palo alto high labor market some in la balance through some in new york in harlem here throughout texas they really balance approach at all levels as we ve noted and in our supplemental materials the majority of our markets where we are growing now are high labor markets and those impacted near term it does take a little time for shack to get open as you know we open with tremendous sales volumes those level off over time but we have to invest in that that comes in the preopening costs and it comes into the first few months of labor in any given shack and as we ve proven time and time again those then level off to tremendously profitable restaurants but when we are growing at the rate we are in another 30 this year in unit volume and again a revenue volume of 25 we expect impact and that s built into our guidance for this year the important question i think is where is this thing where does it go where does it end and that s something we talk a lot about and i think we have tremendous confidence in our ability to level off some of that pressure over the coming years but we re not going to stop growth at the investor at the cost of near term profitability we believe in growth we still have one of the strongest profitable business models in this industry and we want to keep growing it even when we know it impacts over time so yes with these many restaurants being stuffed into the back end of the year last year let me reiterate what tara said we had 17 of our 34 company owned shacks open in the fourth quarter seven of those in the last two weeks that takes investment it has an impact and you saw that in our fourth quarter results and you will see some version of that impact with similar growth into this year i hope that answers the question for you nicole miller piper jaffray companies analyst sure it does thanks again operator our next question will come from jake bartlett with suntrust jake bartlett suntrust analyst great thanks for taking the question the first one randy you re looking at it the same store sales really accelerating very strongly the best in over two years you mentioned a couple of factors but how can we understand what drove that was it the delivery in the digital perhaps hot chick n doing really well what or maybe less cannibalization that you cited last quarter how do we understand you going from kind of negative to sharply positive so quickly randy garutti chief executive officer and director yeah the team did a really great job ending the year in the fourth quarter i d say there was a number of things that have gone our way really just focusing up on continuing to grow operations significant opportunity in the digital space as you mentioned we ve continued to pilot with some of those delivery partners that had some good impact on the fourth quarter all those digital channels that we ve continued to grow we mentioned earlier we opened up new channels with web ordering those have been really good for us our operators really settling into how those digital channels work a little bit better weather in the fourth quarter when it counted and that was really the impact so strong end to the year we re very proud of that first on the higher end of our guidance ending the year over 1 and that s why we re guiding to a similar ratio this year jake bartlett suntrust analyst got it randy garutti chief executive officer and director 0 to 1 for our companies jake bartlett suntrust analyst got it and then but when i think of those factors whether the digital what you already had started to lap in this quarter you kind of add the chick n bites going forward and just trying to understand the guidance and whether that 0 to 1 i guess it is really your long term guidance i think since you ve since your ipo but is that really going to be your starting point every year or does that reflect something that we should be really cognizant of that might kind of pressure you below the where you kind of exited the year randy garutti chief executive officer and director well jake i think what we aimed to it s not a quarter by quarter business for us right we set out with 0 to 1 at the beginning of the year we saw some wins some better quarter some not as good quarters when we look at the strategy for this year we re taking just over 1 price or about 1 5 with the impact of 36 to 40 shacks opening in 80 of those markets being our current markets we want to make sure we re careful we want to make sure we do what we say we re going to do which is what we ve done for many years here at shake and consistent with last year we think that s a good number that allows our teams and our real estate team to focus on building great shacks and all the things we talked about in previous quarters leading up to that 0 to 1 but again we re real proud at the end of the year over that 1 bogie that we set and we think it s a good start for this year i can t speak to future years we ll keep you posted on that tara comonte chief financial officer jake just as a reminder i mean our comp base still and you hear us say this every quarter but our comp base still represents about half the company which i think is it will continue to feed into how we feel about guiding to that number it doesn t represent the majority of the company yet and it went the foreseeable future so and in addition to that it s still pretty heavily dominated by these regions on the east coast that we mentioned with the majority of both shacks and revenue still being new york in the northeast so that feeds into it too until it becomes the majority of the company it s still not the number one metric that we re looking at we were thinking about how we go into a new region to achieve both top and bottom line growth jake bartlett suntrust analyst got it i appreciate it thank you operator next we ll take a question from andrew charles from cowen company andrew charles cowen company analyst great can you guys just quantify just first housekeeping and my real question can you just quantify the impact from strategic cannibalization in the quarter i think in the years past something you guys were able to provide tara comonte chief financial officer no hey andrew no i mean what we ve done in previous quarters is we ve given you some examples of how we enter new market and how we think about giving top and bottom line growth and increasing market share we ve never i don t think really guided to or broken our what we think that strategy has done on a systemwide basis it also would actually be really hard to come up with that number accurate i mean we look at it directionally how much market share do we think there is to be gained in the market how smaller are we today and do we think that it s technical difficulty tonnage of that andrew did you hear that andrew charles cowen company analyst tara just looking at the average weekly sales on a year over year basis it looks like about 4 000 gap between average weekly sales in both the quarter as well as the year over year 2018 reference period to the 2017 reference period you ve obviously the see the outperformance 4q 18 comps seasonally outweighed the full year comps for 2018 i guess what dynamics should we be considering on why the year over year decline in 4q average weekly sales wasn t more muted tara comonte chief financial officer i mean the biggest thing that s impacting that line item will continue to be the case andrew is just the fact that we re adding lower auv shacks into the system randy garutti chief executive officer and director and looking at the 2018 finish why it finished so strong the new shacks outperformed the comp in the fourth quarter was strong very strong obviously and i think those two things were really the impact of what kept it at the four and four ph and we have guided obviously below that but we re really proud of how the team finished up tara comonte chief financial officer yeah andrew charles cowen company analyst very good thanks guys operator our next question will come from john glass with morgan stanley john glass morgan stanley analyst thanks very much first can you just update us on what capex came out in 2018 what you think about it in and see in the guidance perhaps i missed it for 2019 and i guess maybe the core of the question is how have built cost changed in 2018 how do you project them to change in 2019 particularly as i don t know if backloading has caused some inefficiencies in that or if you ve gained efficiencies along the way maybe an update on the build cost for the cost of 2018 and thoughts on 2019 tara comonte chief financial officer yeah i mean john as you know we don t guide to capex and what we have this year and you will see all of our obviously cash flow detail in our 10 k which we posted about half an hour or so go but i will say you aren t seeing anything dramatically different than you ve seen in the past the build cost about 2 1 million to build a shack and of course that varies as it always has done and it can vary quite significantly in some cases and that deployment of capital is something that we look at extremely carefully as we go through the diligence process of new market and new shack opening and i think that process is something that will continue in 2019 so randy garutti chief executive officer and director yeah the largest class of shacks ever in 2018 and even more coming in 2019 in addition to our the board investments we re making in project concrete our new home office the innovation kitchen i think that the story there john maybe just what you re getting at a little bit is obviously depreciation is going to be have a significant tick up and in fact the eps next year that s something that we ve called out on purpose because that s investment we want to and need to make it s a non cash item but it s important and cost us money to build these restaurants the construction costs are going up in a lot of markets our teams i think done a really good job of getting more effective with our builds building some of the best shacks we ve ever built while holding strong to kind of last couple of years of per shack cost investment john glass morgan stanley analyst and then if i could just follow up the delivery question once again so it sounds like you got some benefit from delivery even as you lapped over delivery year ago and i don t know if you would call it delivery is being a dominant factor in the comp increase or the less traffic decline than you experienced in past quarters but is 2009 so one if you can quantify that to the extent you want to is 2019 the year you think you will commit to a systemwide rollout of delivery for every providers you choose and are you you ve called out the cost of commissions are you at the point where you think the economics do make sense i know the execution maybe a question but do the economics make sense the levels you re experiencing it right now randy garutti chief executive officer and director so john a couple of things for the most part deliveries rolled out with various partners it s still under pilot with three to four major partners throughout 2018 no change there we re not going to quantify that just yet other than saying digital channels in total which includes delivery continue to increase and continue to show higher average check that s kind of the data we re going to share at this point all of that impacting the comp in the fourth quarter and our expectations for growth this year so we ll keep you posted as those things go but for the most part we re very happy with the guest demand for delivery we ve got some new packaging that started about a month ago so we re working on some of the new things for just really better guest experience better food safety and making sure we can do a better job in the shacks for anyone no matter how you re getting your shack so important thing we ll keep you posted on strategy and we expect to have a lot of focus on that and other things john glass morgan stanley analyst okay thank you operator jeffrey bernstein from barclays has our next question jeffrey bernstein barclays analyst great thank you very much two questions just one on the broader restaurant margin for 2019 i mean looking back to 2018 restaurant margins were down looks like 130 bps and i know your guidance for 2019 is for at least that and i recognize that s got another 50 basis point movement from lease accounting but just wondering obviously it s significant pressures i m wondering bigger picture where you where would you draw the line in the sand and say you know what this business is going to achieve a certain level of margin and therefore whether it s pricing greater than the 1 5 which i think you kind of alluded to maybe considering that further but just wondering theoretically how you think about the restaurant margin and where you should draw a line in the sand that we shouldn t fall below certain level tara comonte chief financial officer jeff it s tara so yeah i mean obviously these are all things that we re looking at and you hit on some of the major ones in 2019 i mean obviously that leased standard accounting change is meaningful at 50 bps and albeit non cash we have we continue to have lower auv shack coming into the system which as you know impacts lot because the lower sales tend to come with a lower operating profit albeit still a very healthy one we also see going into next year we touched on it a little bit and you saw a little bit of it in the fourth quarter but just the increasing proportion of that as really digital as a whole in our business to delivery being a part of it and starting to affect things like paper packaging as randy mentioned as well as commissions and labor inflation while we touched on it leveling off it haven t stopped yet we ve got pretty significant increases even in our home city going into next year with new or going to this year with new upward 15 and some mandatory salary increases too but we do start we do think we re going to start to see some of those really high double digit increases start to level off over what time period we haven t quantified that publicly yet and some of it is not necessarily we have fully known but we re feeling good about just the there s really high levels of inflation beginning to be a bit less acute as time goes on as well as beginning to deliver some leverage over time on some of our investments whether it s in the shack or as a result of some of those g a investments that we re putting in the business so we ll update you at some point to the extent that we decided to go out a bit further and some of are more detailed line items for now obviously you have got our 2020 target on the top line and but just suffice to say we still feel really really good and really bullish about the return on capital for this business long term and the key metrics top and bottom line for the long term randy garutti chief executive officer and director jeff i will jump in to add we have got a lot of other factors affecting us today our communication really hasn t changed since the ipo in the last four years right we ve talked about many new shacks being added over the long term in the low 3 million range at the low 20s our profits that s kind of the model we ve said we would deliver it s we ve over delivered on that for the last four years that is the long term model but so what are we doing about those pressures that tara talked about there is things like kiosks there s things like project concrete which will help our operations there is hopefully the leveling off of some of the mandated changes that we ve seen at more than double digit increases every year for the last few years in our major markets so it gives us a lot of confidence in the long term strength of the business and again at the rate we re opening i have said it a few times on this call there s going to be some near term impact and we will take it year by year we ll keep you posted we think it s a pretty strong business model and we will continue to move forward tara comonte chief financial officer and as you rightly said we alluded to pricing and we continue to remain very conservative there and we think that s the right thing to do at this early stage in our growth and as we think of entering new markets but we feel pretty confident about the extent which we would be taking pricing power should we need it jeffrey bernstein barclays analyst understood and then secondarily are there any concerns around i mean the labor inflation is obviously significant do you see any secondary signs or any concerning signs in terms of turnover going up or quality or experience maybe coming down i mean how do you measure that or get comfortable that you re still on the better end from a labor standpoint tara comonte chief financial officer no i think it s similar to how it s been for many years albeit i d say there s probably more external pressure than there has ever been right with low unemployment increasing wages across the board it s challenging i said that for years that that will be our number one challenge if you heard me on the call it is our number one focus you see us making continued new investments in general managers and all of our managers frankly but that will be something i would imagine will be the number one challenge for ever in our business we re in a people led business it s also our sweet spot it s also what we do better than anyone and it s how we re going to continue to invest so that we have restaurants that are standing with great leaders decades from now but it s never going to be easy jeffrey bernstein barclays analyst thank you operator our next question will come from john ivankoe with jpmorgan john ivankoe jpmorgan analyst hi thank you i think in fiscal 2018 you said that your company us volumes were up 4 4 million but you re guiding to 4 million to 4 1 million in 2019 which is obviously continues to be a decline relative to your comps which overall is expected but maybe the overall magnitude being a little bit greater the question is the overall average unit volumes as we think about 2019 are influenced by the 17 class the 18 class and the 19 class and because you report comps for stores opened greater than 24 months it s not really easy for us or the fact that s almost impossible for us to calculate a true new unit volume number on a 12 month basis so the point of the question is when you guys look at your class of 17 class of 18 class of 19 are there kind of new unit volume ranges for each one of those years that we should be thinking about in terms of how those different store years will settle out over time and i apologize if you ve answered both question randy garutti chief executive officer and director we guided in the past we ve talked about sort of class auv and we bought in this last couple of years to give you more of a end of trailing 12 auv and we think that s better over the long term i understand the challenge for you i think look when we look at 2019 just adding 36 to 40 more shacks period at all kinds of levels of sales with less new markets that those will generally have a lower auv on average as we go forward over time with the bigger classes we expect that also when we have big classes such as 2018 the sophomore shacks coming into their year two where some of the shacks even that opened in late 2017 will be still in their honeymoon period you look back then to 2017 we had restaurants like our first in san diego we had restaurants like our first in st louis danny meyer s hometown we have some shacks that will start high and then hit their sophomore year and as we ve talked about over time those come down yet often our new shack class starts higher all of that i understand hard model for you it s a little bit more of a balance that has led us to slowly declining auv for the last couple of years something we ve talked about and we continue to share as an expectation for you and our shareholders and something we do think levels off again over time just like our profit margins but so that s going to be it s going to be challenging to forecast in a perfect way with so many with 30 unit growth coming this year john ivankoe jpmorgan analyst if i can ask just i mean when we think about where those settle out longer term should do we think about the 2018 and the 2019 class for example similar to 2017 i mean what i m really asking randy is not necessarily the forecast for how they re performed in 2019 but they re just kind of buckets in terms of thinking this is a 4 million type of class or 3 5 million type of class or 3 million type of class because you know better than anyone that type of location the square foot whether it s the first unit in the market or the third unit in the market whatever it is there s so many different types of units that you guys are opening it s is there anything that that you could say that a certainty year is more representative of a certain type of unit that will have a certain type of average volume over time or will 2017 2018 2019 when we look in five years for example will they all be performing relatively similarly from an average unit volume perspective randy garutti chief executive officer and director yeah john until we get the question is not something we re prepared to break out on the year by year basis right now i ll just say this we have got ended the year with 124 company operated shacks ok 34 of those there is not a whole lot of company so it s very important we opened last year not a whole lot of companies in that kind of percentage growth we understand it s not easiest thing for you to predict i do think as shacks get as classes get bigger over this last few years they generally have a broader range of volumes in a lower auv there may be examples like certain very very strong shacks that we ve opened since 2017 2018 that popped that up or down but i think the best way we can say now is to try to give you that annual guidance understand it s not the best for you guys john ivankoe jpmorgan analyst no i got it no and by the way thank you for that annual guidance even what you gave is certainly helpful but it was a if we could go one step further on the same overall topic but a different direction randy you mentioned in your prepared remarks i think you said 80 to 85 of new units in existing markets can you discuss gaining some efficiencies based on that existing market penetration i mean was that a qualitative comment a quantitative comment and i was hoping make sense you specifically called it out i mean what we may actually gain and benefit from as we think about that increased existing market penetration in 2019 and 2020 randy garutti chief executive officer and director yeah thanks john i it s both quantitative and qualitative here s how we view it there is absolutely learning that we ve had as we ve gone to one off markets that become two off markets it s expensive for us from a human capital g a a start up and distribution cogs line often to have one restaurant let s just this is not an example of particular numbers but when you have one restaurant in birmingham alabama one in st louis or one in nashville those are examples of what we have those one offs can they do not benefit as much as when we open six or seven in los angeles right so we think there is quantitative wins there and there are certainly qualitative wins that come from our marketing teams focus from our operator teams focus on our ability to double down on existing markets so what i wanted to hear in that comment in this response is we want to do that more often i think what we re going to do is keep that 80 to 85 existing market to give us that chance to double down a little more focus on those and probably do a couple of less one off regions in this next couple of years we ll do so there s going to be some great ones we ll do in salt lake city as i said we ll do it in new orleans we will do in columbus ohio but we want to make sure that that can be covered with a great operator who can really build a strong teams and then we can benefit from all the distribution and other efficiencies over time so that s more of a long term play as i mentioned and that s our strategy moving forward for right now john ivankoe jpmorgan analyst thank you operator our next question will come from karen holthouse with goldman sachs karen holthouse goldman sachs analyst hi thanks for taking the question and just a quick question about 2018 guidance so could you give us a sense of specifically what sort of commodity outlook is embedded in that and then how are you thinking about your beef costs in the next year there are some leading indicators that that market is starting to get a little bit tighter but i know it s given how you sourced it s not necessarily a one to one sort of read through from some of the headline prices we might see tara comonte chief financial officer we haven t guided that karen and so we re not really guiding to cogs and when we gave you some directional some directional color based on things how we see it right now our cogs labor other opex is all baked within that 20 baked into that 23 24 guidance i mean we as i mentioned within cogs i think what the things that impact from the increase in delivery or expecting to as well as just broader inflation in the whole transport sector hold still i m sorry i missed the second part of your question is on labor karen holthouse goldman sachs analyst no within commodities you specifically any high level commentary you re willing to give about how you re thinking about beef prices in 2019 there are certainly headline numbers we can see that would suggest the beef market is getting tighter but i know just had given how you source it s not necessarily a one to one sort of relationship between some of the headline commodity prices and your input costs tara comonte chief financial officer yeah no absolutely no i mean we are not guiding to anything and specific on beef right now and as you rightly point out and as you know the cuts that we buy don t necessarily would mirror what you see across the broader beef markets so to the extent that changes and we have any more specifics on beef or any other commodities we will update you as the year goes on karen holthouse goldman sachs analyst thank you operator that does conclude our question and answer session today and at this time i d like to turn the call back over to randy garutti for closing remarks randy garutti chief executive officer and director just want to say thanks to everyone who took time to listen to this call we really appreciate it we are thankful

thank you reagan and thank you all for joining us today on our fourth quarter earnings conference call i ll begin with an overview of our fourth quarter performance and highlights before we offer instant commentary on our three business segments frank will then provide detailed financial and segment level review and i ll conclude with our updated guidance before we move to the q a portion of the call we made good progress in the fourth quarter which was highlighted by strong performance in the australian and us segments new contracts in canada and australia and another quarter of debt reduction during the fourth quarter of 2018 we generated revenues of 114 5 million an increase from 101 3 million year over year and 19 9 million in adjusted ebitda up from 13 3 million revenue was in line with expectations and adjusted ebitda results were at the upper end of our guidance for the fourth quarter turning to our cash flow and debt reduction we generated 28 5 million in operating cash flow and 21 9 million in free cash flow both more than double our cash flow generation from the fourth quarter of 2017 we also repaid 22 9 million of debt during the quarter as you likely saw in our press release we announced multiple contract awards during the fourth quarter at our sitka lodge we secured an 18 month room commitment from lng canada bringing our total lng related contracted revenues to approximately 170 million canadian which extends through 2021 we are pleased to grow our partnership with the lng canada project and the local first nation and will continue to pursue other lng related opportunities including the possible further extension of our sitka lodge in kitimat beyond the previously announced expansion to 1100 rooms we view the development of canadian lng is a significant driver of growth for our canadian business over the next couple of years in addition to the lng related contract awards we continued to win work at our current lodges while expanding our hospitality services to customer owned facilities in the first quarter of 2019 we secured two additional contracts awards totaling approximately 90 million of revenues this includes a contract renewal at our boggabri and narrabri villages and australia and the hospitality services contract to operate a 1500 room facility for an oil sands operator in canada we are particularly pleased with this hospitality award with further validates our strategy to expand civeo s service offering to key customers in our core end markets now let me take a minute to walk to the performance across each of our segments we experienced a slower than expected quarter in canada impacted by extended holiday downtime which led to lower than expected room nights these challenges were partially offset by a strong performance at our mcclellan lake and wapasu lodges which exceeded our expectations we are also very pleased with the continued integration of the noralta assets and we are confident that we will meet our goal of 10 million canadian in synergies for the full year 2019 we are actively monitoring the implications of the provincially imposed oil production curtailment on canadian oil sands producers and their activity and we ll manage our business accordingly while policy decisions can negatively impact our performance in canada in the first quarter 2019 we do not believe that this issue will persist throughout 2019 shifting to australia the fourth quarter benchmark meant coal prices settled about above 220 per ton which supported solid seasonal occupancy particularly given the usual holiday downtime supply disruptions from exporting producers and australia and the united states and domestic producers in china underpinned the robust business environment during the fourth quarter and although the spot met coal prices are expected to drift modestly lower during 2019 due to supply growth and anticipated demand moderation in china the environment should remain very conducive to additional capital project spending from our major customers in fact we expect that business to continue to generate improving occupancy throughout 2019 lastly moving to the us segment it continues to generate positive adjusted ebitda benefiting from an offshore fabrication project in the fourth quarter we will continue monitor market conditions in the us but we expect continued improvement in the financial performance of this business in fiscal 2019 particularly as the segment no longer is burdened by the well site mobilization cost we experienced in 2018 with that i ll turn it over to frank who will give a detailed review of our financial performance frank steininger executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you bradley and thanks everyone for joining us this morning i ll start off with a review of our fourth quarter results by segment before moving into the full year today we reported total revenues in the 2018 fourth quarter 114 5 million with a net loss on a gaap basis of 12 8 million or 0 08 per diluted share during the fourth quarter we generated adjusted ebitda of 19 9 million operating cash flow of 28 5 million and free cash flow of 21 9 million turning to the fourth quarter results for our segments i ll begin with a review of the canadian segment performance compared to the prior quarter revenues from our canadian segment were 69 4 million decreasing from 76 8 million in the third quarter revenues for the quarter were impacted by slowdown around the holiday season and turnaround activity in the canadian oil sands rolling off as well as an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange adjusted ebitda in canada was 11 8 million down from 16 5 million in the third quarter driven by the items i just mentioned during the fourth quarter billed rooms in our canadian lodges totaled 687 217 down 16 sequentially impacted by the aforementioned dynamics our daily room rate for the canadian segment in us dollars was 91 00 compared to 89 00 in the third quarter and this was driven by increasing occupancy at our sitka lodge in british columbia supporting the lng project turning to australia during the fourth quarter we reported revenues of 29 7 million down slightly from 31 1 million in the third quarter primarily driven by lower average daily rate resulting from less casual room use rentals adjusted ebitda was 11 7 million down sequentially from 12 4 million the average daily room rate for australian villages in us dollars decreased to 74 00 in the fourth quarter compared to 77 00 in the third quarter village room nights remained relatively flat sequentially at just over 397 000 now moving to the us revenues for the fourth quarter increased sequentially from 12 6 million to 15 5 million primarily driven by a large offshore fabrication project we continue to experience relatively healthy market conditions driven by stable drilling and completion activity in the permian and midcon adjusted ebitda in the us decreased 1 9 million from 2 4 million in the third quarter this decrease was driven by holiday seasonality lower well site ebitda and increased sg a for the full year ended december 31 2018 the company reported revenues of 466 7 million a net loss of 130 8 million or 0 83 per share we generated 54 4 million in operating cash flow 43 1 million in free cash flow and 76 8 million in adjusted ebitda these results compared to full year 2017 results with reported revenue of 382 3 million a net loss of hundred and 5 7 million or 0 82 per share during the prior period the company generated 56 8 million in operating cash flow 47 5 million in free cash flow and 63 2 million in adjusted ebitda now i will comment on capital expenditures in our current liquidity position during the fourth quarter we invested 8 4 million in capex up from 2 7 million in the third quarter and a total for the year of 17 1 million of capital expenditures compared to 11 2 million in 2017 our total outstanding debt as of december 31 2018 was 379 2 million a 43 9 million decrease since september 30 2018 the decrease resulted primarily from debt repayments of 22 9 million from cash flow generated by the business in foreign currency translation as of december 31 2018 we had total liquidity of approximately 102 7 million consisting of 90 3 million available under our revolving credit facilities and 12 4 million of cash on hand looking ahead we continue to focus on generating free cash flow and deleveraging our balance sheet i will now turn the call back over to bradley who will provide some closing comments and talk about our guidance for the first quarter and full year of 2019 bradley bradley dodson chief executive officer thank you frank i ll start with an overview of the factors that will impact our first quarter and full year 2019 and provide our financial guidance before opening the call for q a the start of 2019 thus far has been punctuated by oil price uncertainty and continued global trade strive and political as well as regulatory uncertainty in each of the us canada and australia these exogenous forces could negatively impact the global supply demand dynamics for oil or met coal the commodity prices for those and ultimately our customer s willingness to spend money and remain active in our major markets with this backdrop we have modestly reduced our full year 2019 guidance from that given on the third quarter earnings call in canada the cadence of work in the oil sands region should pick up after a slow start to the year after the holidays and what we believe will be a temporary alberta oil production curtailment we expect this early weakness in canada to impact both the first quarter results for the region and our consolidated results for the balance 2019 we expected relatively normal turnaround schedule for the second third quarter of 2019 in canada however this activity in our core canadian oil sands market could be negatively impacted by further government intervention or future downward pressure on wti or wcs oil prices our guidance includes uncontradicted turnaround work in the second third quarters as well as normal activity levels in the oil sands regions for the second half of 2019 as we progress through the year we expect to benefit from accelerating contributions the lng canada and in coastal gasoline contrast particularly as we move into the back of 2019 taking into account the softness in the first quarter we expect canadian room nights for the full year to be modestly down year over year and adjusted ebitda year over year to increase 10 to 15 from 2018 the outlook for australia remains constructive for 2019 met coal and iron ore prices are supportive of robust cash flows for our comp clients which should cause them to continue to pursue potential expansion projects which have been absent from the bowen basin and gunnedah basin for several years we anticipate 2019 likely will be a year of transition and australia to a substantially healthier environment in preparation for this ramp up and activity we are selectively allocating capital to refurbish and upgrade rooms for which we anticipate increased demand in 2019and beyond we expect continued improvement in occupancy primarily through our bowen basin locations generating year over year increase in billed rooms of approximately 10 which should largely translate to corresponding year over year growth in ebitda moving to the us while we keep an eye on ongoing completion activity in the permian and midcon markets we are encouraged by the prospects for our us business in 2019 our guidance for the full year of 2019 in the us is predicated on activity in the permian and midcon remain relatively close to where it is today the optimization of our well site footprint where we have the assets will be a key driver of our growth throughout the year in total for the us segment we expect ebitda to double year over year our team understands that we cannot control commodity prices and reciprocality and other exogenous forces as such we continue to focus on our strategic priorities executing on the work we ve won generate free cash flow improve the balance sheet by paying down debt investing in high returning opportunities in each of our three segments expanding our service offerings and lastly continue to provide the best in class hospitality while serving as a trusted partner to all of our stakeholders in terms of guidance for the first quarter of 2019 we expect revenues of 105 million 110 million and adjusted ebitda of 13 million 16 million for the full year of 2019 we expect revenues of 470 million 490 million adjusted ebitda of 95 million 105 million guiding to a 24 to 37 increase in adjusted ebitda from the full year results of 2018 lastly we expect full year 2019 capex to be in the range of 40 million 45 million in conclusion as we begin 2019 we believe it will be another year of positive transition for the company we feel there are recent contract awards that emphasize our strategy of winning work at our current lodges expanding our hospitality service platform to customer owned facilities and securing other work in other end markets such as canadian lng the team is acutely focused on executing our work in a safe and efficient manner with unmatched service to our customers we continue to pursue the highest financial returned for investment opportunities and allocate capital prudently with the goal of maximizing free cash flow and reducing debt with that we d like to turn it over for questions questions and answers operator ladies and gentlemen if you wish to ask a question at this time please signal by pressing 1 on your telephone keypad please ensure your mute function on your telephone is switched off to allow your signal to reach our equipment again please press 1 to ask a question will take our first question from stephen gengaro of stifel please go ahead stephen gengaro stifel financial corporation analyst thanks good morning guys i guess a couple things to just start with when you re looking at your utilization levels and kind of room rate expectations over the course of 2019 versus 2018 any guidance on how we should think about that in canada and then australia bradley dodson chief executive officer sure let s start in canada for the full year 2018 in us dollars i m sorry in canadian dollars i think we ended up around 115 00 a room night now with the mix of rooms and the occupancy as we go into 2019 i think that will be modestly up a couple bucks here or there and as we mentioned we think room nights though will because of the softness we re seeing at the start in the canadian oil sands region will actually be modestly down in total 18 to 19 despite the ramp up at sitka in australia we ended up in australian dollars i believe around 102 we don t expect anything to change next year the variable in australia much more of an impact than we see in canada can be our casual room usage a lot of our customers will contract for a base level room which that base level will be priced at a largely will be take or pay will be priced at a certain level typically mid to high 90s per room night in australian dollars depending on how much they want to expand over that base level of rooms and the amount of time for advance notice that we get on that the prices can be higher than that so presuming that the casual usage remains relatively consistent with what we ve seen over the last 12 months we think pricing is fairly flat year over year and australia anything frank you want to frank steininger executive vice president and chief financial officer no that s exactly right bradley dodson chief executive officer billed rooms and australia i think we talked about right up 10 frank steininger executive vice president and chief financial officer up 10 yeah bradley dodson chief executive officer year over year which with flat pricing then kinda gets us to the concept that we think that will translate into year over year increase in ebitda implicitly and then margins are the same year over year and australia i think the dynamic there is that we ll have some food cost and labor cost inflation and the team is expecting they ll be able to find efficiencies in order to fight that back and keep margins black year over year stephen gengaro stifel financial corporation analyst thank you and then as i think about i guess two parts the to this when you think about the cash generation i mean it sounds like if you use the midpoint of ebitda fortyish million in capex in your interest costs you know you re going to generate 20 30 million in free cash i assume that goes to debt pay down just two questions one is the capex the non maintenance portion it sounds like it s going toward refurb room upgrading rooms and australia plus projects around canada is that right bradley dodson chief executive officer go ahead frank frank steininger executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so i mean i think if you look at where we are i think we have about 20 million or so canadian 20 to 25 million canadian related to projects on the west coast increase in the room count at sitka that we talked about and also some starting on the work on coastal gas line so that s really where that number is really where the growth capital is this coming year and in the rest of it is really more or less maintenance bradley dodson chief executive officer right with some room refurbs and australia frank steininger executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah but that in total at least what we ve got in the forecast right now that might be a year over year change of 3 5 million us bradley dodson chief executive officer exactly right frank steininger executive vice president and chief financial officer so we believe it s a good thing to get started we see in some of our core bowen basin locations the potential need let s say over the next 12 to 18 months for increased occupancy if some of these growth projects move forward and because we ve had lower occupancy for several years now some of the rooms a little spit and polish so we re going to do some of that and get on the refurb s so that we have blocks of rooms that are available because of some of these projects move forward they won t need a handful of extra rooms they could need 200 400 600 extra rooms so we are trying slowly to prepare for that stephen gengaro stifel financial corporation analyst okay thank you operator once again as a reminder it is 1 to ask a question we will now take our next question from mike malouf of craig hallum capital group please go ahead michael malouf craig hallum capital group analyst hi can you hear me ok frank steininger executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah we can hear you mike bradley dodson chief executive officer hi mike michael malouf craig hallum capital group analyst okay great hi how you doing one of the things that struck me on this quarter is it looks like you re getting some synergies coming through especially on the sg a line and i m just wondering if you could comment a little bit on that expense line and as you look into 2019 and then second of all i have a question on the us as we look at the gross profit margins in the us that was down quite a bit sequentially and maybe it was just because of the one time work that you are doing in the fourth quarter but just a comment on the margins in the us would be helpful thanks bradley dodson chief executive officer do you want to start frank steininger executive vice president and chief financial officer sure sg a for the quarter was impacted by two things we had less impact from the standpoint of our annual bonus plans because we didn t reach our target and as you know we ve got phantom shares in with the stock price decreasing that impacted the expense related to the mark to market on those shares that are paid out in cash so that s really the main driver from an sg a standpoint bradley dodson chief executive officer certainly from an sg a standpoint we made strives on the synergy part of this in the fourth quarter got the partial impact for finally being able to turn over the food procurement contract to a consolidated provider that provided some benefit to the canadian lodges during the fourth quarter and then quite frankly finishing up some final touches on some of the integration work so we made some progress but to frank s point that was less of the impact on the sg a as it relates to us margins you nailed it mike and that is that the officer fabrication project was a good project for us the team did a good job in terms of execution both in terms of timing and delivery of that project in the fourth quarter but those typically carry lower margins than the segment as a whole and so with the change of the revenue mix we saw that impact the segment margins in the quarter michael malouf craig hallum capital group analyst okay great thanks and then just a follow up as you look out to 2019 with regards australia obviously the net coal prices have remained pretty strong for a long time here and i m just wondering if you could give us some real time anecdotal commentary on expansion over there and are you seeing some green shoots with regard to chatter thanks bradley dodson chief executive officer sure well as you mentioned and we talked about on prior calls really throughout the 2018 time period and now extending into 2019 it s been a nice steady improvement typically sequentially quarter to quarter in terms of occupancy and therefore profitability of our australian segment but also in terms of your question we haven t seen with constructive met coal prices we haven t seen in a large expansionary projects move forward we are certainly watching some of the things that the bhp affiliates are doing in the bowen basin as well as what whitehaven might do down in the gunnedah if either of those several projects move forward or any of those several projects move forward we expect to use existing locations we are working on getting those rooms ready should any of those move forward also looking at some more for fitzroy and anglo as well so it has been a good sequential improvement but no step change in terms of the occupancy level and that would largely be driven by any expansionary capital projects do you have anything frank steininger executive vice president and chief financial officer she no there s chatter mike but we re waiting for some project michael malouf craig hallum capital group analyst i ve been waiting too so ok thanks a lot appreciate the help bradley dodson chief executive officer well i guess to that point certainly the boggabri and narrabri contract extensions which would foretell potentially some of those projects moving forward but the base level of rooms that are contracted right now is fairly consistent with what we ve had over the last 12 months but getting those extended hopefully will then translate into those gunnedah projects moving forward on an expansionary basis michael malouf craig hallum capital group analyst okay got it thanks operator we will now take our next question from stephen gengaro of stifel please go ahead stephen gengaro stifel financial corporation analyst thanks gentlemen just to follow ups if you don t mind the first being obviously a slow start to the year based on your guidance as you look at the back half of 2019 and obviously it sounds like there s gonna be some of the west coast canadian guests and that sure lng project impact there as we think about 2020 i know it s really early to think about 2020 but is that back second half 2019 run rate a reasonable place to start so i m just thinking about 2020 being a pretty strong cash generation year based on that plus maybe a return to a more normalized maintenance capex level is that a reasonable way to think about it as the back half of 2019 unfolds into 2020 bradley dodson chief executive officer i would think so the biggest driver of the second half 2019 versus the first half of 2019 and frank jump in here is really what happens in sitka we expect that both our room count and or aggregate occupancy will continue to improve throughout q1 q2 into q3 q3 and q4 being fairly consistent in terms of occupancy and revenue and ebitda coming out of sitka that contract goes through the middle part of 2020 so presuming that they will still need rooms in sitka and that it continues for the full year of 2020 then yes that will be a tailwind or a positive year over year trend we ll also have a lot greater input or revenue generation and ebitda generation out of the gasoline projects that are coming we throw those factors in you pull out maybe some holiday downtime if you want to take the fourth quarter and annualize it and presuming the other markets stay relatively consistent it should indicate a much better 2020 and to your point while will have some coastal gasoline capex in 2020 the free cash flow should be better because the sitka capex will be behind us frank steininger executive vice president and chief financial officer that s right stephen gengaro stifel financial corporation analyst and as you look at i look at 2018 as a benchmark but it s maybe not a great place to compare 2018 versus 2019 but you re ebitda jumped significantly first quarter to second quarter in 2018 and obviously your 2019 guidance suggests a strong second half but is the ramp going to be seen materially in the second i made it almost has to be seen in the second quarter i would assume to get to the full year guidance is that fair bradley dodson chief executive officer yes i mean we ll see a couple factors i ll talk about canada and frank talk about australia but canada it s good to be turnaround work and yeah i think right now we factored in a good second quarter turnaround last second quarter was a little messy because of one of our customers having a power outage that impacted their overall activity and activity in the second quarter as a whole then on australia frank steininger executive vice president and chief financial officer the year starts out slow because the christmas holiday and then that just continues to ramp up as we get into february and march and that will follow as we get into the second quarter stephen gengaro stifel financial corporation analyst okay good thank you and then just one final as you look at potential opportunities of expansion and you look at some of these logistics in catering projects what does the environment look like for those type of deals right now bradley dodson chief executive officer we re talking about inorganic growth around acquisitions i would say that we ve had a fairly steady pipeline of opportunities to look at i would say that as with anything i think valuation is relatively manageable in terms of what the seller s expectations are relative to what our expectations might be and then is ultimately due diligence and trying to close the deal so we remained active those of the areas we re looking at in addition to looking at potentially some consolidating and property acquisitions predominantly in australia and the us but i would say that the market is relatively constructive stephen gengaro stifel financial corporation analyst okay great thank you operator it appears there are no further questions at this time i would like to turn the conference back to your host for any additional or closing remarks bradley dodson chief executive officer well i think you all for joining us on the call today we were pleased with how we ended off

transaction effects rolf stangl ceo of sig said in 2018 we successfully continued our growth strategy and achieved core revenue growth of 6 4 at constant currencies slightly exceeding our target range of 4 6 we saw growth across our global footprint and are reaping the rewards of our steady expansion into markets outside europe where growth in aseptic carton packaging is being driven by mega trends including demographics rising disposable income and urbanisation the asia pacific region in particular delivered a strong performance during the year with robust growth in the liquid dairy segment and growing demand for premium products our broad international presence continues to provide us with promising growth opportunities these opportunities come with exposure to currency fluctuations which in 2018 dampened growth in adjusted ebitda at constant currencies adjusted ebitda increased by 8 the adjusted ebitda margin increased to 27 5 reflecting a positive business mix and ongoing cost efficiency measures we achieved a significant increase in adjusted free cash flow while continuing to expand our filler base in growth markets the cash generative nature of our business underpins our

revenue rose by 6 4 at constant currencies 3 4 at reported rates which was ahead of the target range of 4 6 growth was driven in particular by the asia pacific region which after an exceptional first half continued to show good momentum throughout the second half sales in emea were lower owing to instability in some middle eastern markets which affected sales to the joint venture there more than offsetting underlying growth in the european business the americas achieved growth at constant exchange rates despite political and economic uncertainty in brazil in the second half total revenue

lower dividend payment by our middle east joint venture in view of the challenging conditions in some of its markets net capital expenditure is forecast to be in the range of 8 10 of revenue and we expect to generate substantial free cash flow in the mid term we expect our business to continue to demonstrate its resilience this is underpinned by our exposure to non discretionary consumption of

currencies and an adjusted ebitda margin of around 29 percent net capital expenditure is expected to remain within the 8 10 of revenue range we plan a dividend payout ratio of 50 60 of adjusted net

of 2018 we incurred special charges of 25 9 million and 50 7 million for the fourth quarter and full year respectively as follows i re imaging costs at nearly all domestic restaurants and costs to replace or write off certain branded assets of approximately 2 2 million and 5 8 million for the fourth quarter and full year respectively ii financial assistance to domestic franchisees such as short term royalty reductions in an effort to mitigate closings of approximately 5 5 million and 15 4 million for the fourth quarter and full year respectively iii contributions to the national marketing fund of 10 0 million in the fourth quarter to increase marketing and promotional activities and iv costs totaling approximately 8 2 million and 19 5 million for the fourth quarter and full year respectively associated with the activities of the special committee of the board of directors including legal and advisory costs related to the review of a wide range of strategic opportunities that culminated in starboard s strategic investment in the company by affiliates of starboard value lp as well as a third party audit of the culture of papa john s 2 the refranchising and impairment gains losses net of 289 000 loss before tax and 222 000 net loss after tax in 2018 are primarily due to the loss associated with the china refranchise of the 34 company owned restaurants and the quality control center in china with an impairment loss related to these stores in 2017 substantially offset by refranchising gains related to the refranchising of 62 company owned restaurants in north america in 2018 we also had 2 4 million of additional tax expense associated with the china refranchise this additional tax expense is primarily attributable to the required recapture of operating losses previously taken by papa john s international 3 tax effect was calculated using the company s full year marginal rates of 23 2 and 21 0 for 2018 and 2017 respectively 4 the u s income tax legislation effect on deferred taxes is related to the remeasurement of the net deferred tax liability due to the tax cuts and jobs act in 2017 5 2017 also includes the favorable impact of adopting the new guidance for accounting for share based compensation this guidance requires excess tax benefits recognized on stock based awards to be recorded as a reduction of income tax expense rather than stockholders equity beginning in 2018 and on a go forward basis the benefit or reduction in income from this change will not be shown as an adjustment in gaap results the non gaap adjusted results shown above and within this document which exclude special items should not be construed as a substitute for or a better indicator of the company s performance than the company s gaap results management believes presenting certain financial information without the special items is important for purposes of comparison to prior year results in addition management uses these metrics to evaluate the company s underlying operating performance and analyze trends consolidated revenues for the fourth quarter were 374 0 million decreasing 93 6 million or 20 0 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 the fourth quarter and full year 2017 results include the benefit of the 53rd week of operations which contributed approximately 30 9 million excluding the 53rd week in 2017 the revenues for the fourth quarter of 2018 decreased 62 7 million or 13 4 for the full year ended december 30 2018 consolidated revenues decreased 210 0 million or 11 8 excluding the 53rd week in 2017 the revenues for the full year decreased 179 2 million or 10 1 these decreases were primarily due to the following negative comparable sales for the fourth quarter of 10 2 for domestic company owned restaurants and negative 7 4 for franchise restaurants which resulted in lower company owned restaurant revenues lower royalties and decreased north american commissary sales the refranchising of 62 company owned restaurants in north america which reduced total company owned revenues on a quarter and full year basis by approximately 15 0 million and 42 2 million respectively compared to the prior year comparable periods the short term royalty reductions that are part of our franchise assistance program of approximately 5 5 million and 15 4 million on a quarter and full year basis respectively which are included in the previously mentioned special charges decreases in international revenues due to the refranchising of the company owned restaurants and quality control center in china of approximately 4 0 million and 8 1 million on a quarter and full year basis respectively and lower new store franchise fees after the adoption of topic 606 and additional decreases in revenues of approximately 1 7 million under topic 606 for the fourth quarter 2018 this includes fourth quarter decreases in north america and united kingdom commissary revenue of approximately 2 6 million and 700 000 respectively due to required reporting of franchise new store equipment incentives as a reduction of revenue these incentives were previously recorded as general and administrative expenses for the full year 2018 revenue increased approximately 4 0 million under topic 606 primarily related to required reporting of franchise marketing fund contributions as revenues offset by the required reporting of franchise new store equipment incentives as a reduction of revenue as previously discussed see the revenue recognition and income statement presentation section below for more details the consolidated loss before income taxes was 16 2 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 or 4 3 of consolidated revenues in comparison to consolidated income before income taxes of 32 1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 representing a decrease of 48 3 million the decline in income in the quarter was primarily attributable to the previously mentioned 25 9 million of special charges the impact of lower north america and international revenues and the impact of the 53rd week in 2017 of 5 9 million significant changes in the operating results in the fourth quarter of 2018 by business unit are detailed as follows domestic company owned restaurants operating margin decreased 9 3 million or as a percentage of related revenues decreased 0 6 primarily due to negative comparable sales of 10 2 additionally the adoption of topic 606 reduced the restaurant operating margin due to the revised method of accounting for the customer loyalty program the 53 rd week of operations in 2017 contributed approximately 2 4 million of the decrease week of operations in 2017 contributed approximately 2 4 million of the decrease north america franchise royalties and fees decreased 9 2 million or a decrease of 34 1 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily due to the short term royalty reductions granted to the entire north america system as part of the franchise assistance program which is included in the special charges royalties were further reduced due to negative comparable sales of 7 4 the 53 rd week of operations in 2017 contributed approximately 2 0 million of the decrease week of operations in 2017 contributed approximately 2 0 million of the decrease north america commissary operating margin decreased 5 5 million or a decrease of 2 4 as a percentage of related revenues primarily due to the decline in north america restaurant sales and lower commissary revenues due to the required reporting of 2 6 million in new store franchise equipment incentives under topic 606 as previously discussed the reduction attributable to the equipment incentives is offset by a reduction in general and administrative costs as discussed below the 53 rd week of operations in 2017 contributed approximately 1 7 million of the decrease week of operations in 2017 contributed approximately 1 7 million of the decrease international operating margin decreased 2 5 million primarily due to lower new store opening fees and lower united kingdom qcc revenues of 700 000 due to the required reporting of franchise new store equipment incentives under topic 606 as previously discussed the 53 rd week of operations in 2017 contributed approximately 700 000 of the decrease as a percentage of international revenues the operating margin increased 0 7 primarily due to the divestiture of our china operations in the second quarter of 2018 week of operations in 2017 contributed approximately 700 000 of the decrease as a percentage of international revenues the

special items income before income taxes was 56 9 million or a decrease of 79 2 million compared to the year ended december 31 2017 on a 52 week basis the decrease in the full year results excluding

defined by gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to evaluation of the company s financial performance in addition to an evaluation of gaap consolidated loss income before income taxes we believe the presentation of operating margin loss is beneficial as it represents an additional measure used by the company to further evaluate operating efficiency and performance of the various business units additionally operating margin loss discussion may be helpful for comparison within the industry the operating margin loss results detailed herein can be calculated by business unit based on the specific revenue and operating expense line items on the face of the consolidated statements of operations consolidated loss income before income taxes reported includes g a expenses depreciation and amortization refranchising and impairment gains losses net and net interest expense that have been excluded from this operating margin calculation the effective income tax

comparable sales results for restaurants operating outside of the united states are reported on a constant dollar basis which excludes the impact of foreign currency translation we believe north america international and global restaurant and comparable sales growth information as defined in the table above is useful in analyzing our results since our franchisees pay royalties that are based on a percentage of franchise sales franchise sales also generate commissary revenue in the united states and in certain international markets franchise restaurant and comparable sales growth information is also useful for comparison to industry trends and evaluating the strength of our brand management believes the presentation of franchise restaurant sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency provides investors with useful information regarding underlying sales trends and the impact of new unit growth without being impacted by swings in the external factor of foreign currency franchise restaurant sales are not included in company revenues free cash flow the company s free cash flow a non gaap financial measure for the full year of 2018 and 2017 was as follows in thousands full year ended dec 30 dec 31 2018 2017 net cash provided by operating activities a 72 795 134 975 purchases of property and equipment b 42 028 52 593 free cash flow 30 767 82 382 a the decrease of 62 2 million was primarily due to lower net income somewhat offset by favorable changes in working capital items b the decrease of 10 6 million was primarily due to higher capital expenditures in 2017 related to the construction of the company s new domestic commissary in georgia which opened in the third quarter of 2017 we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities from the consolidated statements of cash flows less the purchases of property and equipment we view free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor that management uses in determining the amount of cash available for discretionary investment free cash flow is not a term defined by gaap and as a result our measure of free cash flow might not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies free cash flow should not be construed as a substitute for or a better indicator of the company s performance than the company s gaap measures amended

rates as well as terms that last for 30 years the most actively traded bonds are those from developed countries such as the united states japan and germany emerging countries also have bond markets but those instruments are less liquid how do interest rates make up the forward curve when you purchase or sell a currency pair you are buying one currency and simultaneously selling another currency the majority of the currency transactions that take place globally are within the spot market spot market transactions settle within 2 business days if you are interested in holding a currency transaction longer than 2 business days you need to transact a forward trade forward trades add forward points to a currency pair that is transacted for three or more days to calculate the forward rate currency traders use the interest rate differential this is the difference between the short term interest rates of each of the countries that make up the currency pair for example if you purchase the usd jpy currency pair you would receive the us dollar interest rate and need to pay away the japanese short term interest rate story continues forward points are added or subtracted from the currency pair you would first need to determine which rate is higher currently us dollar interest rates are higher than japanese interest rates in using the example of the purchase of the usd jpy you would subtract the forward points from the rate which would provide a new rate that incorporated the forward points what effects the interest rate differential there are several factors that drive the interest rate differential obviously monetary policy changes are key to changes in countries interest rate levels since market forces drive interest rate levels changes to economic data are also a key factor for this reason you might want to follow an economic calendar to determine if there are specific events that will drive the future direction of rates in addition to economic events and policy changes political strife can also drive interest rate levels when there is uncertainty within a country the markets will demand more from a country to lend them money most developed bond markets move in tandem with one another there are plenty of occasions where a specific event will alter the course of a countries interest rates but when there is little new information available most developed bond markets will move in tandem historically the us bond market is the driving force behind most of the rate movements globally how does the interest rate differential effect the currency pair interest rate differentials can be a benefit or deterrent when you determine to purchase or sell a currency pair for example if you are planning to either buy or sell the usd jpy for 2 years you will either receive 2 68 by purchasing the greenback or pay away 2 68 if you purchase the yen and sell the dollar this is because the 2 year us rate is 2 50 and the japanese 2 year yield is 0 18 if you buy the dollar and nothing happens for 2 years you will earn 2 68 if you buy the japanese yen and sell the dollar and nothing happens for 2 years you will lose 2 68 charting the interest rates differential one of the best ways to follow the interest rate differential is to chart it each currency pair reacts differently to changes in the interest rate differential what is important to remember is that the differential works in tandem with the currency pair so you are looking to see what the future interest rate differential will be you can see from the chart of the us 10 year yield versus the japanese 10 year government bond yield that the interest rate differential trades in tandem with the usd jpy currency pair while there are times when the 2 assets diverge over time they move in tandem with one another many have asked the question does the rate differential drive the currency pair or does the currency pair drive the interest rate differential since the interest rate differential makes up the forward rate the answer is both what you want to evaluate as a trader is whether the currency pair is moving in one direction and the interest rate differential is moving in another summary the interest rate differential is the driving fundamental force behind the movements of currency pairs the interest rate differential makes up the currency forward curve and therefore is an integral part of currency trading monetary policy economic events and political strife are the key factors that drive interest rates to get a gauge of where the interest rate differential is relative to the currency pair you can chart the two what you are looking for is a situation where the path of the interest rate differential and the currency pair have diverged which might give you clues to the future direction of the currency pair author fundamentals translation fundamentals translation a division of the beltranslation international group helps forex brokerage firms expand to

most business economists predict the u s will fall into a recession within the next two years a new survey finds about half of the 280 business economists polled said they expect a downturn by the end of next year roughly 75 percent say it will happen by 2021 only 11 percent anticipate the u s avoiding a recession during that two year window according to a february survey from the national association for business economics released monday the u s is deep into an economic expansion which began in summer 2009 after the financial crisis if the expansion lasts until june it would be the nation s longest though the economy has been robust marked by strong consumer spending climbing markets and the lowest unemployment rates in decades signs of a slowdown have surfaced recent months have seen dizzying volatility in the markets and a sudden drop off in consumer confidence trade tensions between the u s and china have taken a toll on economic growth in the u s and abroad shadows of a slowdown have put pressure on the federal reserve as it tries to price out interest rate increases in january federal reserve chairman jerome powell said the economy has good momentum and that he didn t foresee a recession in 2019 but he signaled the fed would be patient about raising rates as economic growth is expected to fall from the roughly 3 percent of last year to 2 3 percent this year the fed raised rates four times in 2018 although the federal reserve s rate hikes have been a source of ire for president donald trump who has blamed the central bank and powell for raising rates too quickly and disrupting the stock market most economists in the nabe endorse the fed s actions business economists continue to approve of current monetary policy nabe president kevin swift said in a summary nearly three quarters of panelists believe that the federal reserve s policy is about right though the survey showed that most economists anticipate some rise in interest rates this year the markets aren t bracing for impact there is a schism between what the nabe panel and the markets think about the fed s rate path and the shrinking of its balance sheet said megan greene global chief economist at manulife asset management and chair of the nabe survey the markets are pricing in no more interest rate hikes in 2019 whereas a majority of the nabe panel expects one or two rate hikes this year a lack of resolution between the u s and china on trade is a major source of concern the survey found more than 90 percent of economists surveyed said they anticipate existing tariffs to drag the u s gdp down by 25 basis points or more almost all said they expect the tariffs to increase in inflation on sunday trump said he would delay a scheduled increase in tariffs on 200 billion in chinese imports as negotiators seek a trade deal with beijing if an agreement is reached trump is expected to host chinese president xi jinping at his florida estate late next month to finalize terms fears of a greater global slowdown are growing outside the u s a survey of nearly 800 top business leaders around the world listed global recession as their biggest concern for 2019 last month the international monetary fund scaled back its global growth predictions through 2020 saying the balance of risks remains skewed to the downside and momentum is past its peak this story was first published by the washington post follow chitribbusiness on facebook and chitribbiz on twitter

take five deal or no deal on trade brexit world markets themes for the week ahead advertisement following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week march on the march 1 deadline that ends a 90 day u s china trade truce arrives soon and hopes are high that some kind of trade deal reportedly being sketched out by the two sides is reached by then if not markets hope the deadline will be postponed the alternative a significant trade war escalation with washington slapping 25 percent tariffs on 200 billion worth of chinese goods more than double current levels but a trade deal may not be a panacea for china whose economy grew in 2018 at its slowest in 28 years purchasing manufacturing surveys pmis are likely to confirm that lacklustre picture factory activity shrank more than expected in january hit by trade spats but also by cooling domestic demand and as china accounting for a fifth of global manufacturing slows and the trade war disrupts supply chains hiring and investment the impact will be felt across asia there was a taste of that already advance data from japan showed manufacturing shrank this month for the first time

thursday and friday reinforce the picture of a sluggish economy and below target inflation the ecb targets price growth of around 2 percent but a long term market gauge of euro zone inflation is languishing well below that below 1 43 percent a 2 1 2 year low last february it was approaching the 2 percent mark the last print showed euro zone inflation slowed to 1 4 percent in january core inflation did show signs of picking up however as services costs rose possibly fed by wage growth the other upcoming data print of interest is consumer confidence this did rise last month helped by

editor s note the following op ed is adapted from remarks made by edward chow an independent u s energy expert on feb 26 at the ukrainian energy forum in kyiv excellencies ladies and gentlemen it is my great pleasure to be back in kyiv and to speak at the 10th ukrainian energy forum before this distinguished panel and audience it is now five years since the revolution of dignity or euromaidan revolution ousted president viktor yanukovych progress in economic reform has been made including in the energy sector however it is also accurate to say that no one including the officials on this panel is satisfied totally with the pace of reform and the results achieved so far in a democratic society on the eve of important elections it is critical to discuss why this is and what can be done to accelerate energy reform it is in this spirit and as a friend of ukraine that i offer some thoughts based on 40 years of experience working in and studying energy sectors around the world every country thinks it is unique and indeed countries live under very different conditions however there are universal principles that cannot be ignored without consequence and international lessons that have been learned for formulating sound policy there is no reason for ukraine to repeat mistakes that have been made in the past in the united states we ve had reason to rethink these lessons recently within one decade the unconventional oil and gas revolution tight oil and shale gas has made the world s most mature petroleum region the largest oil and gas producer the question is why did this revolution take place in the united states and not somewhere else it cannot only be a matter of geology or that god really blesses america what we have learned is that competition promotes innovation and drives efficiency the shale revolution was led by dozens of small to medium size companies operating alongside a highly competitive oilfield service and equipment industry it was not led by major companies like exxonmobil or chevron which missed the boat and are busy trying to catch up in the u s we had price controls in the 1970s in a misguided policy to fight inflation and to protect consumers we learned that distorting the price signal leads to misallocation of resources declining production wasteful use of energy and shortages it is also an open invitation for corruption consequently we decontrolled oil and gas prices without which the shale revolution would never have happened in a market economy government s job is to protect the public interest and to provide stable conditions for private investment it is not the state s job to engage directly in economic activity all over the world we see ineffective and corrupt national oil companies that crowd out more productive private investment the latest example is venezuela foreign investment is useful not just for offering capital and technology but more importantly to demonstrate modern business practices and operations to domestic industry international capital chases the highest risk adjusted return the riskier the country either because geology or business conditions the higher the rate of return needed to justify an investment after all the same say billion dollar investment in ukraine has to be compared against opportunities in australia brazil and elsewhere in order to attract capital for an energy sector that has suffered rent seeking and underinvestment ever since independence it is government s responsibility to lower the perceived risks by providing fair access to market and data stable fiscal and regulatory regime and properly targeted and time limited subsidies that do not favor politically connected interests suffice it to say in ukraine there is much room for improvement i made a few more slides on a simple analysis of the ukrainian energy sector s strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats bearing in mind international lessons learned i do not have time to go through all of these factors many of which are well known to this informed audience so i will make just a few observations on the slides which will be made available by the conference organizers democracy should be an asset to reform not a liability i do not understand or rather i do not accept the conventional wisdom that 2019 will be a lost year for reform in ukraine elections provide the opportunity to discuss issues critical to society and to build political consensus reforms that last have public support and cannot be pushed through opportunistically or behind the public s back in order to instill public trust there should be a genuine debate in the election campaign and not sloganeering for temporary political advantage a vibrant civil society should be enlisted as part of the process and not seen as an obstacle to reform there are many more weaknesses than strengths in ukraine s energy economy which is why much needed investments have not yet materialized the good news is that means there is ample opportunity for improvement structural reform and overhaul of the soviet legacy system is needed to modernize it is not sufficient just to put good people in charge of a system that is designed for political interference and privileged access not for economic efficiency i have not met a single ukrainian or western geologist who does not think ukraine can be gas self sufficient and indeed become a gas exporter again if price is liberalized and ukraine exports gas the domestic market clearing price will be european gas hub price minus transportation instead of hub price plus transportation today an energy sector that releases economic value rather than asset strip and rent seek can help build public confidence in overall reform and fund reforms in underinvested public sectors such as education health and roads no one should be satisfied with 2 3 percent economic growth ukraine should grow at 5 8 percent and the energy sector can be an engine of that growth rather than a drag one of the handicaps to ukrainian reform is the near term absence of membership perspective in the european union and nato success in energy reform can transform ukraine from what is seen currently in europe as a liability to its energy security into an asset and make membership prospective more promising this is why donors are eager to assist ukraine s energy reform assistance must focus on building capacity to visibly improve the performance of the energy economy emphasis should be placed on creating success stories to build momentum for reform and not in drafting more strategic plans and long term goals that collect dust in government bookshelves in ukraine and in the west lastly you may have noticed that i focused on improvements that are within ukraine s own power to make i have not talked about external threats as i believe they are often used as distraction from real reform or as excuses for not doing more faster there is little that ukraine can do to change its adversaries other than to become stronger and less vulnerable to attack the bigger threat is the absence of political will to enact long needed reforms and vested interests trying to preserve a dangerously antiquated system ukrainians must own the energy reform process and not merely appease foreign donors like the international monetary fund americans really do believe god bless america but just in case we also believe that god help those who help themselves

yixiao zhou we know that from the recently released data on retail sales and manufacturing production in the us we can see weak performance in the us economy so looking into 2019 the fiscal stimulus in the us may run out of steam and we also know that the federal reserve in the us actually changed their tone and the monetary policy will be less tightened than previously expected with one or no great hikes looking forward all this suggests that the us economy is weakening looking into 2019 so if there is a further rate hike to 25 percent that would deal a further blow to the us economy so i think the motivation to avoid a further rate hike partly is due to the consideration for the us domestic economy sputnik does this indicate that the two sides will be able to make progress in negotiations as trump tweeted yixiao zhou i think that it does suggest progress in negotiations this trade conflict between the us and china actually hurt both sides at least as we see in the short run so the progress in negotiations as tweeted by trump i think looks real and i think it looks very real progress in negotiations
africa is comprised of a range of distinct investment destinations with a multitude of cultures business practices as well as political and economic circumstances african private equity pe activity has remained steady over the past seven years with investors positive about the long term attractiveness of africa especially when compared with developed markets hurdles predictably political risk particularly elections currency and commodity price volatility corruption and weak governance as well as limited exit opportunities continue to dampen investment mood additionally local regulatory frameworks often create barriers to pe operations including limited access to local capital exchange controls local content requirements and ownership restrictions sourcing quality competitive deals is frequently a challenge for pe firms and there is still a large gap in reliable data pertaining to private companies which makes it difficult to achieve reliable valuations and peer comparisons resulting in african companies being mispriced against international peers in order to maximise return on investment fund managers are adopting a hands on approach to managing investments requiring time and human capital to engage more actively with and nurture portfolio companies this often proves challenging where portfolio companies remain majority family owned and controlled with significant owner resistance to perceived investor interference with the operation of the business trends looking to generate 22 african nations to support the initiative the african continental free trade agreement aims to stimulate and facilitate intra african trade which should fuel investor confidence particularly in the ever popular consumer goods sector additionally africa s middle class is growing with rising disposable incomes stimulating investment into telecoms consumer and financial services consumer driven industries such as financial services and consumer goods healthcare and education remain stable investment bets and the agricultural sector is set to hold strong as agro processing increases and global food demand spikes infrastructure creates a substantive opportunity for pe support with a need estimated at between usd130 and usd170 billion being unmatched by the continent s capital technology is the highest interest emerging sector for pe investment historically this sector in africa struggled to access funding due to the lack of understanding of the industry as well as poor connectivity that in spite of improvements still plagues the continent however tech enabling solutions in the consumer discretionary spending space as well as technology driven financial solutions are hot topics for 2019 kenya malawi and rwanda are already deploying technology in the agricultural sector including aerial imagery from drones or satellites weather forecasts and soil sensors all of which are making it easier for farmers to manage their crops in real time while financial solutions are connecting smallholder farmers with credit financial institutions and greater market access funding in tech start ups surged by 51 in 2017 and continues to grow exponentially with development capital set to carry the sector to new heights interestingly it is anticipated that more pe firms will participate in later stage million dollar venture capital deals as more businesses look to scale up after proving the viability of their business models sponsor exits by way of initial public offering ipo which remained stable over the past few years amounting to a total of 16 of all ipos in africa between 2010 and 2017 are anticipated to continue into 2019 particularly with the growth and maturing of africa s stock markets including the nigerian stock exchange and the kenyan capital markets authority investor activity china leads in active engagement with africa with seven heads of state summits under its belt to date however chinese support has mainly taken the form of loans to governments and state owned entities with foreign direct investment fdi making up only 5 of total global investment in africa nonetheless two way trade has grown exponentially and now exceeds usd200 billion china has also established more than 10 000 firms across africa becoming the most integrated investor into the continent japan has opened dialogues and is working closer with east africa including rwanda as well as ethiopia however kenya nigeria and south africa top the list with this investment giant the european union eu has sought to strengthen its collaboration with africa with the fifth eu africa summit held in 2017 two way trade exceeding usd300 billion and the pledging of more than eur44 billion in sustainable investments by 2020 furthermore the eu is firming up its preferential access to markets across the region with the economic partnership agreements already signed with over 40 nations in sub saharan africa germany and the netherlands are emerging as the fastest growing investors in africa increasing their project counts on the continent from 2017 while the united kingdom remains solid and dependable in its commitment to fdi second only to the united states us while the us is the largest direct investor in africa it is lagging in its collaborative efforts engaging with few countries primarily south africa lesotho kenya mauritius and ethiopia two way trade being at a fraction of other nations and only having ever held one summit with african leaders back in 2014 however the us is set to increase investment into the continent in a bid to counter the narrative that china s influence in africa is rising while us influence lessens as at the end of 2017 south africa shared the top spot with morocco for attracting fdi followed by kenya nigeria ethiopia egypt and ghana it is likely that the trend will continue into 2019 with increased investor appetite for east and west africa and egypt and south africa the traditional darlings of fdi being displaced by morocco and ethiopia in a nutshell over the past few years africa has emerged as an exciting investment destination despite being afflicted by concerns of political and economic instability currency and commodity price fluctuation and infrastructure deficiency as well as questionable governance the continent continues to attract investors eager to diversify portfolios and dip into sectors and industries which though challenging have significant room for growth and high return 2019 should see investor appetite growing as several countries such as south africa nigeria and kenya continue to see undeniable returns for those willing to venture into some of the choppier waters of african private equity
on almost every continent teachers have come to the forefront of the struggle against government austerity and levels of social inequality not seen since the 1920s teachers have played a key role in the resurgence of the class struggle that broke out across the world in 2018 and has accelerated in the opening months of this year three thousand teachers are currently on strike in oakland california in the latest in a series of teacher walkouts in the united states involving 71 000 educators during the first eight weeks of 2019 the strike follows last month s walkout in los angeles the nation s second largest school district a strike in denver colorado and a two day statewide walkout in west virginia where the strike a year ago sparked the largest rebellion of teachers across the us in decades teachers and school workers accounted for 380 000 of the nearly half million workers involved in work stoppages in the us last year the largest number since 1986 there have been increasing calls for strikes in many states including oklahoma and arizona where statewide strikes took place last year in são paulo brazil the largest city in the americas teachers have gone on strike for the second time this year against pension cuts in mexico teachers in michoacán and oaxaca struck and set up blockades earlier this month to fight layoffs and government backed school reform earlier this month teachers and child care workers struck in berlin germany educators in portugal joined a general strike teachers in france joined the yellow vest protests against the president of the rich emanuel macron and more than 100 000 teachers from primary school to higher education are set to carry out the first national strike on march 15 in the netherlands teachers have also struck in morocco and zimbabwe amid growing opposition against the reduced education budgets and school privatization throughout africa and tens of thousands of teachers in tamil nadu in southern india struck last month for improved pay and conditions this movement is being driven by record levels of social inequality throughout the world the social counterrevolution which was initiated by uk prime minister margaret thatcher and us president ronald reagan four decades ago was accelerated after the global financial crash of 2008 capitalist governments led by the obama administration in the us spent trillions to buy up the toxic assets of the banks and provide unlimited credit to re inflate the stock markets and the private fortunes of the financial criminals to pay for this political parties of every stripe made austerity the watchword two recent reports highlight the historic transfer of wealth from the bottom to the top in the us since 2008 a new research paper by gabriel zucman an economics professor at the university of california berkeley found that the share of total household wealth controlled by the top 0 1 percent richest adults was at the highest level since 1929 when this tiny elite hoarded 25 percent of the wealth us wealth concentration seems to have returned to levels last seen during the roaring twenties wrote zucman who noted that it could be even higher because of the ability of the super rich to hide their wealth in off shore accounts a report by the us commerce department s bureau of economic analysis found that employee pay and benefits as a percentage of gross domestic income fell to 52 7 percent in last year s third quarter the fourth straight quarterly decline labor s share of domestic income has steadily declined since 1970 when it was 59 percent it continues to be the lowest since the end of world war ii at the same time the share of domestic income going to corporate profits has climbed from less than 12 percent in the 1980s to more than 20 percent today the global economic crisis was also used by the financial elite to loot public assets and get its hands on the world education market which will be worth an estimated 10 trillion by 2030 a recent book pointed to the role of the international monetary fund the world bank usaid and the uk s department for international development dfid in funding school privatization schemes around the world in the us the obama administration which found endless resources to bail out wall street starved the public schools of resources and used the manufactured crisis to expand for profit charter schools by 2016 the latest date available 25 of the 50 us states were still spending less per pupil than they did before the great recession leaving a 19 billion shortfall the number of public school employees today is 170 000 below pre 2008 levels even though student enrollment has risen 1 5 million and in 38 states the average annual salary of teachers is lower than it was in 2009 the universal character of the attack on teachers and public education and what underlies it raises a number of fundamental issues first is the role of the unions throughout the world which are opposed to any struggle because they are aligned with the capitalist parties and accept the entire framework of austerity and social inequality in oakland the union rejected demands by rank and file teachers to include opposition to budget cuts in the strike demands even though the district plans to pay for any pay increases by slashing millions of dollars from educational services and closing schools the oakland education association is colluding with the state democratic party to reach a rotten deal that is entirely acceptable to the corporate and financial elite and like previous strikes across the country betrays the fight to defend the right to public education this is true of the unions throughout the world in the face of the global attack on public education jobs and living standards the nationalist and pro capitalist unions have collaborated with their respective governments and capitalist owners to lower labor costs and corporate taxes in order to make their own countries more competitive that is why the building of new organizations of struggle controlled by workers themselves and independent of the unions is a burning question teachers must form rank and file committees which base themselves on what teachers and students need not what the powers that be say is affordable teachers have won popular support because they are fighting for fundamental rights and because all workers are facing the same conditions declining incomes and skyrocketing living costs precarious employment and endless attacks on social rights including health care and pensions which were won over generations of struggle the developing movement among teachers is an initial expression of a rebellion that will inevitably extend into broader layers of the working class particularly industrial workers in key sectors such as auto steel and other areas of manufacturing it is a movement that will be compelled to address not only the immediate questions of wages and working conditions but the great issues that face workers in every country social inequality the shredding of democratic rights the growth of authoritarian forms of rule and the mounting danger of catastrophic war strikes alone cannot resolve what workers confront the logic of the international resurgence of the class struggle is the necessity for the working class to fight to take political power in its own hands and reorganize the world economy on the basis of social need not private profit only by expropriating the financial aristocracy and carrying out the socialist reorganization of economic life can the vast wealth produced by the working class be used to raise the material and cultural level of the masses guarantee a free and quality public education to all and rid mankind of poverty exploitation and war the premium is therefore on the building of a new socialist and internationalist leadership that can make the working class conscious of this necessity that is the fight being undertaken by the icfi and its sections

ceo michael carrazza stated 2018 was a productive year for patriot core performance and assets grew steadily the acquisition of prime bank was completed and the bank s sba loan division has made significant strides in february 2018 patriot entered in to a transaction with hana small busines lending which remains subject to regulatory approvals value creating activities have led to a significant increase in regulatory oversight from prior years the bank continues to maintain strong capital and sustained growth in its core operations patriot became an approved sba lender at the end of 2017 and was designated a preferred lender by the sba earlier in this year enabling it to approve loans to small businesses and entrepreneurs more quickly and efficiently patriot has now opened four new sba business development offices richard muskus patriot s president added the year 2018 was very encouraging for patriot as we have seen growth and development on a number of key initiatives that we expect to yield strong performance into 2019 and beyond we continued to demonstrate impressive trajectory in our core competency of loan originations with approximately 230 million in new loans funded and committed in 2018 further we have significantly advanced the national footprint and platform expanding our national sba business into atlanta indianapolis and jacksonville we have also established a platform for new deposit gathering initiatives in 2019 that are expected to reduce funding costs and materially strengthen ongoing bank operating performance regarding the previously announced november 20 2018 formal agreement with the occ mr muskus added we have made progress addressing each of the items in accordance with our commitment under the agreement and we continue to respond and address any enhancements requested by the occ patriot also announced today the declaration of its seventh consecutive quarterly dividend of 0 01 per share the record date for this quarterly dividend will be march 11 2019 with a dividend payment date of march 18 2019 financial results as of december 31 2018 total assets were 951 5 million as compared to 915 3 million at september 30 2018 and 852 1 million at december 31 2017 for a total asset growth of 12 in the one year period net loans receivable totaled 772 8 million up 2 over 756 6 million at september 30 2018 and up 8 over 713 4 million at december 31 2017 deposits continued to grow to 743 3 million at december 31 2018 as compared to 719 5 million at september 30 2018 and 637 4 million at december 31 2017 net interest income was 7 1 million in the quarter increased 5 and 2 from the prior quarter and the corresponding 2017 period respectively the year to date net interest income of 28 0 million was 8 higher than the 25 9 million in the year ended december 31 2017 net interest margin was 3 20 for the fourth quarter of 2018 as compared to 3 11 in the prior quarter and 3 51 for the fourth quarter of 2017 for the full year period net interest margin declined from 3 58 to 3 29 the decline in net interest margin in the year reflects the impact of subordinated debt added on june 29 2018 and increasing deposit costs associated with higher rates paid on retail deposits and an increased reliance on more expensive wholesale funding sources the provision for loan losses in the quarter was 1 0 million as compared to 87 000 in the fourth quarter of 2017 the year to date provision for loan losses was 1 3 million as compared to a net credit for loan losses of 857 000 which reflected the previously noted recovery the increase of the provision for loan losses in the fourth quarter of 2018 was primarily due to a large provision booked in december 2018 associated with one loan stemming from operating cash flow weaknesses and a collateral shortfall non interest income was 565 000 in the fourth quarter of 2018 60 higher than the prior quarter year to date non interest income in 2018 of 1 6 million was 13 higher than the prior year primarily due to realized gains on the sale of sba loans non interest expense increased 389 000 over the third quarter of 2018 and increased 194 000 over the fourth quarter of 2017 the comparison to the prior quarter expenses were primarily impacted by increase in salaries and benefits due in part to the timing of the recognition of incentive accruals partially offset by reduction of non recurring project costs the non recurring project costs totaled 330 000 and 2 1 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 and year to date period respectively excluding project costs full year 2018 operating expense increased 8 reflecting investments in the organic sba business and deposit gathering initiatives the income tax provision of 44 000 in the fourth quarter of 2018 represented an effective tax rate of 20 and reflects the positive impact of the tax rate changes enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017 and adoption of asu 2018 02 reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income as of december 31 2018 shareholders equity was 69 2 million an increase of 2 4 million from a year ago patriot s book value per share increased to 17 69 at december 31 2018 as compared to 17 12 a year ago the bank s capital ratios continue to be strong as the bank maintained its well capitalized regulatory status the capital ratios improved from the first quarter of 2018 as the result of the subordinated debt issuance completed at the end of the quarter a material amount of the proceeds from the debt issuance were down streamed to the bank as of december 31 2018 the bank tier 1 leverage ratio was 9 82 tier 1 risk based capital was 10 61 and total risk based capital was 11 49 about the company

quarter performance and highlights before we offer instant commentary on our three business segments frank will then provide detailed financial and segment level review and i ll conclude with our updated guidance before we move to the q a portion of the call we made good progress in the fourth quarter which was highlighted by strong performance in the australian and us segments new contracts in canada and australia and another quarter of debt reduction during the fourth quarter of 2018 we generated revenues of 114 5 million an increase from 101 3 million year over year and 19 9 million in adjusted ebitda up from 13 3 million revenue was in line with expectations and adjusted ebitda results were at the upper end of our guidance for the fourth quarter turning to our cash flow and debt reduction we generated 28 5 million in operating cash flow and 21 9 million in free cash flow both more than double our cash flow generation from the fourth quarter of 2017 we also repaid 22 9 million of debt during the quarter as you likely saw in our press release we announced multiple contract awards during the fourth quarter at our sitka lodge we secured an 18 month room commitment from lng canada bringing our total lng related contracted revenues to approximately 170 million canadian which extends through 2021 we are pleased to grow our partnership with the lng canada project and the local first nation and will continue to pursue other lng related opportunities including the possible further extension of our sitka lodge in kitimat beyond the previously announced expansion to 1100 rooms we view the development of canadian lng is a significant driver of growth for our canadian business over the next couple of years in addition to the lng related contract awards we continued to win work at our current lodges while expanding our hospitality services to customer owned facilities in the first quarter of 2019 we secured two additional contracts awards totaling approximately 90 million of revenues this includes a contract renewal at our boggabri and narrabri villages and australia and the hospitality services contract to operate a 1500 room facility for an oil sands operator in canada we are particularly pleased with this hospitality award with further validates our strategy to expand civeo s service offering to key customers in our core end markets now let me take a minute to walk to the performance across each of our segments we experienced a slower than expected quarter in canada impacted by extended holiday downtime which led to lower than expected room nights these challenges were partially offset by a strong performance at our mcclellan lake and wapasu lodges which exceeded our expectations we are also very pleased with the continued integration of the noralta assets and we are confident that we will meet our goal of 10 million canadian in synergies for the full year 2019 we are actively monitoring the implications of the provincially imposed oil production curtailment on canadian oil sands producers and their activity and we ll manage our business accordingly while policy decisions can negatively impact our performance in canada in the first quarter 2019 we do not believe that this issue will persist throughout 2019 shifting to australia the fourth quarter benchmark meant coal prices settled about above 220 per ton which supported solid seasonal occupancy particularly given the usual holiday downtime supply disruptions from exporting producers and australia and the united states and domestic producers in china underpinned the robust business environment during the fourth quarter and although the spot met coal prices are expected to drift modestly lower during 2019 due to supply growth and anticipated demand moderation in china the environment should remain very conducive to additional capital project spending from our major customers in fact we expect that business to continue to generate improving occupancy throughout 2019 lastly moving to the us segment it continues to generate positive adjusted ebitda benefiting from an offshore fabrication project in the fourth quarter we will continue monitor market conditions in the us but we expect continued improvement in the financial performance of this business in fiscal 2019 particularly as the segment no longer is burdened by the well site mobilization cost we experienced in 2018 with that i ll turn it over to frank who will give a detailed review of our financial performance frank steininger executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you bradley and thanks everyone for joining us this morning i ll start off with a review of our fourth quarter results by segment before moving into the full year today we reported total revenues in the 2018 fourth quarter 114 5 million with a net loss on a gaap basis of 12 8 million or 0 08 per diluted share during the fourth quarter we generated adjusted ebitda of 19 9 million operating cash flow of 28 5 million and free cash flow of 21 9 million turning to the fourth quarter results for our segments i ll begin with a review of the canadian segment performance compared to the prior quarter revenues from our canadian segment were 69 4 million decreasing from 76 8 million in the third quarter revenues for the quarter were impacted by slowdown around the holiday season and turnaround activity in the canadian oil sands rolling off as well as an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange adjusted ebitda in canada was 11 8 million down from 16 5 million in the third quarter driven by the items i just mentioned during the fourth quarter billed rooms in our canadian lodges totaled 687 217 down 16 sequentially impacted by the aforementioned dynamics our daily room rate for the canadian segment in us dollars was 91 00 compared to 89 00 in the third quarter and this was driven by increasing occupancy at our sitka lodge in british columbia supporting the lng project turning to australia during the fourth quarter we reported revenues of 29 7 million down slightly from 31 1 million in the third quarter primarily driven by lower average daily rate resulting from less casual room use rentals adjusted ebitda was 11 7 million down sequentially from 12 4 million the average daily room rate for australian villages in us dollars decreased to 74 00 in the fourth quarter compared to 77 00 in the third quarter village room nights remained relatively flat sequentially at just over 397 000 now moving to the us revenues for the fourth quarter increased sequentially from 12 6 million to 15 5 million primarily driven by a large offshore fabrication project we continue to experience relatively healthy market conditions driven by stable drilling and completion activity in the permian and midcon adjusted ebitda in the us decreased 1 9 million from 2 4 million in the third quarter this decrease was driven by holiday seasonality lower well site ebitda and increased sg a for the full year ended december 31 2018 the company reported revenues of 466 7 million a net loss of 130 8 million or 0 83 per share we generated 54 4 million in operating cash flow 43 1 million in free cash flow and 76 8 million in adjusted ebitda these results compared to full year 2017 results with reported revenue of 382 3 million a net loss of hundred and 5 7 million or 0 82 per share during the prior period the company generated 56 8 million in operating cash flow 47 5 million in free cash flow and 63 2 million in adjusted ebitda now i will comment on capital expenditures in our current liquidity position during the fourth quarter we invested 8 4 million in capex up from 2 7 million in the third quarter and a total for the year of 17 1 million of capital expenditures compared to 11 2 million in 2017 our total outstanding debt as of december 31 2018 was 379 2 million a 43 9 million decrease since september 30 2018 the decrease resulted primarily from debt repayments of 22 9 million from cash flow generated by the business in foreign currency translation as of december 31 2018 we had total liquidity of approximately 102 7 million consisting of 90 3 million available under our revolving credit facilities and 12 4 million of cash on hand looking ahead we continue to focus on generating free cash flow and deleveraging our balance sheet i will now turn the call back over to bradley who will provide some closing comments and talk about our guidance for the first quarter and full year of 2019 bradley bradley dodson chief executive officer thank you frank i ll start with an overview of the factors that will impact our first quarter and full year 2019 and provide our financial guidance before opening the call for q a the start of 2019 thus far has been punctuated by oil price uncertainty and continued global trade strive and political as well as regulatory uncertainty in each of the us canada and australia these exogenous forces could negatively impact the global supply demand dynamics for oil or met coal the commodity prices for those and ultimately our customer s willingness to spend money and remain active in our major markets with this backdrop we have modestly reduced our full year 2019 guidance from that given on the third quarter earnings call in canada the cadence of work in the oil sands region should pick up after a slow start to the year after the holidays and what we believe will be a temporary alberta oil production curtailment we expect this early weakness in canada to impact both the first quarter results for the region and our consolidated results for the balance 2019 we expected relatively normal turnaround schedule for the second third quarter of 2019 in canada however this activity in our core canadian oil sands market could be negatively impacted by further government intervention or future downward pressure on wti or wcs oil prices our guidance includes uncontradicted turnaround work in the second third quarters as well as normal activity levels in the oil sands regions for the second half of 2019 as we progress through the year we expect to benefit from accelerating contributions the lng canada and in coastal gasoline contrast particularly as we move into the back of 2019 taking into account the softness in the first quarter we expect canadian room nights for the full year to be modestly down year over year and adjusted ebitda year over year to increase 10 to 15 from 2018 the outlook for australia remains constructive for 2019 met coal and iron ore prices are supportive of robust cash flows for our comp clients which should cause them to continue to pursue potential expansion projects which have been absent from the bowen basin and gunnedah basin for several years we anticipate 2019 likely will be a year of transition and australia to a substantially healthier environment in preparation for this ramp up and activity we are selectively allocating capital to refurbish and upgrade rooms for which we anticipate increased demand in 2019and beyond we expect continued improvement in occupancy primarily through our bowen basin locations generating year over year increase in billed rooms of approximately 10 which should largely translate to corresponding year over year growth in ebitda moving to the us while we keep an eye on ongoing completion activity in the permian and midcon markets we are encouraged by the prospects for our us business in 2019 our guidance for the full year of 2019 in the us is predicated on activity in the permian and midcon remain relatively close to where it is today the optimization of our well site footprint where we have the assets will be a key driver of our growth throughout the year in total for the us segment we expect ebitda to double year over year our team understands that we cannot control commodity prices and reciprocality and other exogenous forces as such we continue to focus on our strategic priorities executing on the work we ve won generate free cash flow improve the balance sheet by paying down debt investing in high returning opportunities in each of our three segments expanding our service offerings and lastly continue to provide the best in class hospitality while serving as a trusted partner to all of our stakeholders in terms of guidance for the first quarter of 2019 we expect revenues of 105 million 110 million and adjusted ebitda of 13 million 16 million for the full year of 2019 we expect revenues of 470 million 490 million adjusted ebitda of 95 million 105 million guiding to a 24 to 37 increase in adjusted ebitda from the full year results of 2018 lastly we expect full year 2019 capex to be in the range of 40 million 45 million in conclusion as we begin 2019 we believe it will be another year of positive transition for the company we feel there are recent contract awards that emphasize our strategy of winning work at our current lodges expanding our hospitality service platform to customer owned facilities and securing other work in other end markets such as canadian lng the team is acutely focused on executing our work in a safe and efficient manner with unmatched service to our customers we continue to pursue the highest financial returned for investment opportunities and allocate capital prudently with the goal of maximizing free cash flow and reducing debt with that we d like to turn it over for questions questions and answers operator ladies and gentlemen if you wish to ask a question at this time please signal by pressing 1 on your telephone keypad please ensure your mute function on your telephone is switched off to allow your signal to reach our equipment again please press 1 to ask a question will take our first question from stephen gengaro of stifel please go ahead stephen gengaro stifel financial corporation analyst thanks good morning guys i guess a couple things to just start with when you re looking at your utilization levels and kind of room rate expectations over the course of 2019 versus 2018 any guidance on how we should think about that in canada and then australia bradley dodson chief executive officer sure let s start in canada for the full year 2018 in us dollars i m sorry in canadian dollars i think we ended up around 115 00 a room night now with the mix of rooms and the occupancy as we go into 2019 i think that will be modestly up a couple bucks here or there and as we mentioned we think room nights though will because of the softness we re seeing at the start in the canadian oil sands region will actually be modestly down in total 18 to 19 despite the ramp up at sitka in australia we ended up in australian dollars i believe around 102 we don t expect anything to change next year the variable in australia much more of an impact than we see in canada can be our casual room usage a lot of our customers will contract for a base level room which that base level will be priced at a largely will be take or pay will be priced at a certain level typically mid to high 90s per room night in australian dollars depending on how much they want to expand over that base level of rooms and the amount of time for advance notice that we get on that the prices can be higher than that so presuming that the casual usage remains relatively consistent with what we ve seen over the last 12 months we think pricing is fairly flat year over year and australia anything frank you want to frank steininger executive vice president and chief financial officer no that s exactly right bradley dodson chief executive officer billed rooms and australia i think we talked about right up 10 frank steininger executive vice president and chief financial officer up 10 yeah bradley dodson chief executive officer year over year which with flat pricing then kinda gets us to the concept that we think that will translate into year over year increase in ebitda implicitly and then margins are the same year over year and australia i think the dynamic there is that we ll have some food cost and labor cost inflation and the team is expecting they ll be able to find efficiencies in order to fight that back and keep margins black year over year stephen gengaro stifel financial corporation analyst thank you and then as i think about i guess two parts the to this when you think about the cash generation i mean it sounds like if you use the midpoint of ebitda fortyish million in capex in your interest costs you know you re going to generate 20 30 million in free cash i assume that goes to debt pay down just two questions one is the capex the non maintenance portion it sounds like it s going toward refurb room upgrading rooms and australia plus projects around canada is that right bradley dodson chief executive officer go ahead frank frank steininger executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so i mean i think if you look at where we are i think we have about 20 million or so canadian 20 to 25 million canadian related to projects on the west coast increase in the room count at sitka that we talked about and also some starting on the work on coastal gas line so that s really where that number is really where the growth capital is this coming year and in the rest of it is really more or less maintenance bradley dodson chief executive officer right with some room refurbs and australia frank steininger executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah but that in total at least what we ve got in the forecast right now that might be a year over year change of 3 5 million us bradley dodson chief executive officer exactly right frank steininger executive vice president and chief financial officer so we believe it s a good thing to get started we see in some of our core bowen basin locations the potential need let s say over the next 12 to 18 months for increased occupancy if some of these growth projects move forward and because we ve had lower occupancy for several years now some of the rooms a little spit and polish so we re going to do some of that and get on the refurb s so that we have blocks of rooms that are available because of some of these projects move forward they won t need a handful of extra rooms they could need 200 400 600 extra rooms so we are trying slowly to prepare for that stephen gengaro stifel financial corporation analyst okay thank you operator once again as a reminder it is 1 to ask a question we will now take our next question from mike malouf of craig hallum capital group please go ahead michael malouf craig hallum capital group analyst hi can you hear me ok frank steininger executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah we can hear you mike bradley dodson chief executive officer hi mike michael malouf craig hallum capital group analyst okay great hi how you doing one of the things that struck me on this quarter is it looks like you re getting some synergies coming through especially on the sg a line and i m just wondering if you could comment a little bit on that expense line and as you look into 2019 and then second of all i have a question on the us as we look at the gross profit margins in the us that was down quite a bit sequentially and maybe it was just because of the one time work that you are doing in the fourth quarter but just a comment on the margins in the us would be helpful thanks bradley dodson chief executive officer do you want to start frank steininger executive vice president and chief financial officer sure sg a for the quarter was impacted by two things we had less impact from the standpoint of our annual bonus plans because we didn t reach our target and as you know we ve got phantom shares in with the stock price decreasing that impacted the expense related to the mark to market on those shares that are paid out in cash so that s really the main driver from an sg a standpoint bradley dodson chief executive officer certainly from an sg a standpoint we made strives on the synergy part of this in the fourth quarter got the partial impact for finally being able to turn over the food procurement contract to a consolidated provider that provided some benefit to the canadian lodges during the fourth quarter and then quite frankly finishing up some final touches on some of the integration work so we made some progress but to frank s point that was less of the impact on the sg a as it relates to us margins you nailed it mike and that is that the officer fabrication project was a good project for us the team did a good job in terms of execution both in terms of timing and delivery of that project in the fourth quarter but those typically carry lower margins than the segment as a whole and so with the change of the revenue mix we saw that impact the segment margins in the quarter michael malouf craig hallum capital group analyst okay great thanks and then just a follow up as you look out to 2019 with regards australia obviously the net coal prices have remained pretty strong for a long time here and i m just wondering if you could give us some real time anecdotal commentary on expansion over there and are you seeing some green shoots with regard to chatter thanks bradley dodson chief executive officer sure well as you mentioned and we talked about on prior calls really throughout the 2018 time period and now extending into 2019 it s been a nice steady improvement typically sequentially quarter to quarter in terms of occupancy and therefore profitability of our australian segment but also in terms of your question we haven t seen with constructive met coal prices we haven t seen in a large expansionary projects move forward we are certainly watching some of the things that the bhp affiliates are doing in the bowen basin as well as what whitehaven might do down in the gunnedah if either of those several projects move forward or any of those several projects move forward we expect to use existing locations we are working on getting those rooms ready should any of those move forward also looking at some more for fitzroy and anglo as well so it has been a good sequential improvement but no step change in terms of the occupancy level and that would largely be driven by any expansionary capital projects do you have anything frank steininger executive vice president and chief financial officer she no there s chatter mike but we re waiting for some project michael malouf craig hallum capital group analyst i ve been waiting too so ok thanks a lot appreciate the help bradley dodson chief executive officer well i guess to that point certainly the boggabri and narrabri contract extensions which would foretell potentially some of those projects moving forward but the base level of rooms that are contracted right now is fairly consistent with what we ve had over the last 12 months but getting those extended hopefully will then translate into those gunnedah projects moving forward on an expansionary basis michael malouf craig hallum capital group analyst okay got it thanks operator we will now take our next question from stephen gengaro of stifel please go ahead stephen gengaro stifel financial corporation analyst thanks gentlemen just to follow ups if you don t mind the first being obviously a slow start to the year based on your guidance as you look at the back half of 2019 and obviously it sounds like there s gonna be some of the west coast canadian guests and that sure lng project impact there as we think about 2020 i know it s really early to think about 2020 but is that back second half 2019 run rate a reasonable place to start so i m just thinking about 2020 being a pretty strong cash generation year based on that plus maybe a return to a more normalized maintenance capex level is that a reasonable way to think about it as the back half of 2019 unfolds into 2020 bradley dodson chief executive officer i would think so the biggest driver of the second half 2019 versus the first half of 2019 and frank jump in here is really what happens in sitka we expect that both our room count and or aggregate occupancy will continue to improve throughout q1 q2 into q3 q3 and q4 being fairly consistent in terms of occupancy and revenue and ebitda coming out of sitka that contract goes through the middle part of 2020 so presuming that they will still need rooms in sitka and that it continues for the full year of 2020 then yes that will be a tailwind or a positive year over year trend we ll also have a lot greater input or revenue generation and ebitda generation out of the gasoline projects that are coming we throw those factors in you pull out maybe some holiday downtime if you want to take the fourth quarter and annualize it and presuming the other markets stay relatively consistent it should indicate a much better 2020 and to your point while will have some coastal gasoline capex in 2020 the free cash flow should be better because the sitka capex will be behind us frank steininger executive vice president and chief financial officer that s right stephen gengaro stifel financial corporation analyst and as you look at i look at 2018 as a benchmark but it s maybe not a great place to compare 2018 versus 2019 but you re ebitda jumped significantly first quarter to second quarter in 2018 and obviously your 2019 guidance suggests a strong second half but is the ramp going to be seen materially in the second i made it almost has to be seen in the second quarter i would assume to get to the full year guidance is that fair bradley dodson chief executive officer yes i mean we ll see a couple factors i ll talk about canada and frank talk about australia but canada it s good to be turnaround work and yeah i think right now we factored in a good second quarter turnaround last second quarter was a little messy because of one of our customers having a power outage that impacted their overall activity and activity in the second quarter as a whole then on australia frank steininger executive vice president and chief financial officer the year starts out slow because the christmas holiday and then that just continues to ramp up as we get into february and march and that will follow as we get into the second quarter stephen gengaro stifel financial corporation analyst okay good thank you and then just one final as you look at potential opportunities of expansion and you look at some of these logistics in catering projects what does the environment look like for those type of deals right now bradley dodson chief executive officer we re talking about inorganic growth around acquisitions i would say that we ve had a fairly steady pipeline of opportunities to look at i would say that as with anything i think valuation is relatively manageable in terms of what the seller s expectations are relative to what our expectations might be and then is ultimately due diligence and trying to close the deal so we remained active those of the areas we re looking at in addition to looking at potentially some consolidating and property acquisitions predominantly in australia and the us but i would say that the market is relatively constructive stephen gengaro stifel financial corporation analyst okay great thank you operator it appears there are no further questions at this time i would like to turn the conference back to your host for any additional or closing remarks bradley dodson chief executive officer well i think you all for joining us on the call today we were pleased with how we ended off 2018 we know that we anticipated some slow start to 2019 and that is coming to peer to be correct we do expect a bench brighter outlook as we move throughout 2019 look forward to talking to you about it on future conference calls operator this concludes today s call thank you for your participation you may now disconnect duration 34 minutes call participants regan nielsen manager corporate

beyond following jack s comments anatol will provide an update on the lng market and michael will review our financial results after prepared remarks we will open the call for q a i ll now turn the call over to jack fusco cheniere s president and ceo advertisement advertisement jack fusco president and ceo thank you randy and good morning everyone i m pleased to be here this morning to review our significant accomplishments from a very successful 2018 to share my optimism for the continued success as we look forward to 2019 and beyond 2018 was a truly remarkable year for cheniere on last year s call i described 2017 as our breakthrough year which is certainly was in 2018 we maintained our momentum achieving excellence in reaching new heights in virtually all phases of our business from commercial success achieved by signing over 7 million tons per year a new long term spas to the fid of corpus christi train 3 in may and the start up of corpus christi train 1 few months later to continued financial discipline and simplification of our corporate structure we ve achieved those and much more and in doing so have cemented our reputation as a reliable full service lng operator which delivers on its promises to its customers employees and stakeholders in 2018 we executed on our strategic growth plans operational plans and financial plans and the results of our execution are apparent in the financial results we reported earlier this morning slide 5 presents some key highlights of the fourth quarter 2018 there are a couple of achievements i d like to highlight from this slide we generated consolidated adjusted ebitda of over 630 million and the the distributable cash flow of approximately 130 million and produced and exported a record 80 cargoes on the quarter almost a cargo a day in addition we reached the commissioning milestone of our first cargo at both train 5 at sabine pass and train 1 at corpus christi advertisement advertisement as of year end we had exported four commissioning cargoes from train 5 at sabine pass and two from train 1 at corpus christi our substantial commercial momentum continued in the fourth quarter as we signed long term spas with both polish oil and gas company and petronas for over 2 5 million tons per year in aggregate we look forward to successful long term relationships with our newest spa customers and expect these spas to support our growth plans the market for lng contracting remains active and we continue to pursue additional long term commercial arrangements with new and existing counterparts worldwide turning now to slide 6 a look of some of 2018s most notable highlights financial results for the first year 2018 came in at the top end of our guidance ranges for both consolidated adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow as we generated more than 2 6 billion in consolidated adjusted ebitda and approximately 600 million in distributable cash flow for the full year michael will cover these results in more detail but our financial performance in 2018 improved throughout the year and we are pleased to deliver full year financial results at or above our upwardly revised guidance range in 2018 we executed two important market transactions that i ll highlight briefly first we closed the merger with cqh in which we opportunistically and economically simplified our corporate structure our corporate structure remains complex and we would prefer to be simpler however we will remain opportunistic and only pursue further simplification transaction to the extent they are economic lng shareholders in addition to the cqh transaction in 2018 we also refinanced the remaining term loans at cqp into the bond market economically addressing the nearest term maturity in our complex and further demonstrating our commitment in managing our balance sheet throughout the corporate structure operationally in 2018 we produced and exported a total of 273 cargoes which required over 1 quadrillion btus of gas to our terminals our teams in gas supply and operations made the significant operational and logistical achievement look easy and their dedication and commitment to excellence are significant contributors to our reputation as a reliable operator advertisement advertisement strategically 2018 was an incredible success as we made a positive final investment decision on train 3 at corpus christi and originated over 7 million tons per year of new long term spas giving us sufficient visibility on train 6 at sabine pass that enables us to finalize the epc contract an issue limited notices to proceed on that project late last year having that project under way the limited notice to proceed is strategically important for us as we have cost and date certainty on train 6 ahead of a formal fid which is where efforts are concentrated today the fid of train 6 is one of my key priorities for 2019 which i ll address on slide 7 on this slide i have included a few key priorities which highlight that our focus remains centered on growth execution and being disciplined toward the capital we are focused on completing the remaining steps necessary to achieve fid of train 6 which we expect to occur over the coming months as we have previously communicated we expect to finance train 6 with approximately 50 debt and 50 equity which is consistent with our strategy of deleveraging through growth ahead of that fid bechtel is hard at work on train 6 and making excellent progress at its scope of work bechtel now estimates that train 6 is approximately 14 complete highlighted by over that 3300 piles already driven as part of the site preparation beyond train 6 we are focused on progressing stage 3 at corpus christi through the permitting process which we are permitting for approximately 9 5 million tons of additional lng capacity this project is moving through the process very well we expect to have all the required regulatory approvals in place by the end of 2019 we expect to bring three trains into commercial operations during 2019 train 5 at sabine pass and the first two trains at corpus christi as we have done with all the trains to date we expect these three to be brought online safely ahead of schedule within budget completing commissioning and start up as well as commencing long term contracts associated with new trains is a significant undertaking and requires a tremendous amount of work and coordination among cheniere our epc partner bechtel in our foundation customers advertisement advertisement these efforts are especially critical for 2019 as we will be starting up three trains and commencing long term spas for train 5 at sabine pass train 1 at corpus christi and i am focused on maintaining our track record for seamless transitions from construction to operations the performance test for train 1 at corpus christi has been successfully completed and we expect substantial completion to occur in the next few days last priority i d like to highlight is our plan to communicate the capital allocation policy this is a high priority for the executive team who are working closely with our advisors and our board of directors to ensure we develop a durable flexible policy that enables us to allocate capital the most effective impactful way for our shareholders we look forward to communicating it to the investment community in the coming months as i said earlier 2018 was a remarkable year for cheniere and we are proud of the accomplishments we achieved throughout the year we have many more successes we re pursuing both in 2019 and beyond and my confidence in our ability to continue delivering on our promises underscored our people and the relentless focus on execution that continues to define cheniere and now i ll turn it over to anatol who will provide an update on the market anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer thanks jack and good morning everyone please turn to slide 9 2018 was a banner year for lng in many regards globally 9 trains started service increasing global supply by roughly 30 million tonnes the largest year on year increase since 2009 when qatar began to bring its mega trains online new and expansion trains in australia russia and the u s push total global supplies over the 320 million tonne mark according to preliminary data in the u s exports from our facilities totaled nearly 19 million tons during the year a 33 increase over 2017 the sabine pass train 4 started commercial deliveries in march and train 5 which is currently undergoing commissioning exported its first cargo in november also in november we saw start up of the first greenfield lng terminal in the lower 48 u s as train 1 at our corpus christi facility started producing lng and exported two commissioning cargoes before the end of the year advertisement advertisement we expect lng production from our facilities and others in the u s to continue ramping up in the coming months and contribute to further enhancing the reliability flexibility and liquidity of the global lng market strong global lng supply growth was met with robust demand in 2018 that led to some late year market rebalancing demand growth in asia absorbed virtually all of the incremental supply the step up in global production especially in the fourth quarter when the global complex added more than 10 5 million tonnes year on year ensured adequate supply availability for asia and the rest of the world as mild winter temperatures kept price spikes in check and supported an uptick in imports into europe which added over 4 million tonnes year on year in 2018 the graph on the top right displays the fourth quarter of 2018 demand compared to that what we saw in fourth quarter of 2017 as you can see china along with the rest of asia had strong year on year increases in imports for the month of november china overtook japan as the world s top importer although the position went back to japan in december total european demand increased nearly 7 million tonnes in the quarter which as i mentioned was partially supported by mild weather in asia new lng supply coming online and high shipping rates that incentivized atlantic source cargoes to target europe i ll come back to weather in europe in just a minute global gas price benchmarks in the fourth quarter saw higher levels and increased volatility compared to the same period in 2016 and 2017 however even with a brief spike in henry hub prices in december the u s benchmark continue to trade at a heavy discount compared to other global gas price indices despite a mild winter and a reduction in the storage deficit seen earlier in the year ttf prices traded more than a 1 50 higher than levels seen during the same time a year ago similarly fourth quarter asian spot prices settled at more than 3 higher on average year on year though the premium decreased over the course of the quarter please now turn to slide 10 more than 20 countries almost half of all lng importing countries had record annual lng import levels in 2018 including china south korea india and pakistan in addition to record import levels china and pakistan also set records for lng demand growth rates in 2018 advertisement advertisement the graph to the far left highlights how remarkable china s demand has been over the past two years china alone absorb more than 50 of the worldwide incremental supplies in 2018 adding 16 million tonnes above the 2017 level china remains an important demand center for our product and the country s need for natural gas and lng is expected to continue to rise as the country balances its economic growth needs and environmental commitments south korea s steady demand over the last two years has also been impressive demand growth was largely due to low nuclear utilization as well as lower coal fired power generation resulting from policies intended to improve air quality looking ahead to 2019 for south korea lng consumption taxes are set to decrease while coal taxes are set to increase which of course is expected to be supportive of lng demand pakistan which began importing lng in 2015 has shown consistent in growing demand and regasification build out in the early 2020s could make pakistan a significantly larger importer than it is today the middle graph shows the total accumulation of population weighted heating degree days for the heating season in asia populous areas of east asia have seen mostly minor cold spells this winter and the month of january finished on an extremely mild note asia s heating degree days an indicative of factor of weather driven demand ran close to average at best for much of the early part of the winter nonetheless prices remained fairly robust compared to last year the graph on the far right shows spot prices in relation to crude oil for the past three years price levels in the first half of 18 were higher than in 2017 and particularly more bullish from june to november probably due to china s early buying ahead of the winter in order to secure more lng and avoid shortages and price spikes in the winter high asian lng storage levels combined with the arrival of new supply in the fourth quarter and a fairly mild winter resulted in more moderate prices in the fourth quarter please turn to slide 11 where i ll highlight the european market lng imports to europe reached record levels in december european lng imports during the first three quarters of 2018 were actually lower year on year but the fourth quarter showed very strong levels for a number of reasons storage levels were at a 17 year low after the 2017 18 winter in europe leaving the region to play catch up throughout the year advertisement advertisement the relative tightness in the global lng market through the first three quarters left limited opportunities for storage replenishment early buying and mild temperatures in asia left that region adequately supplied and elevated shipping rates high coal and carbon prices and an uptick in global lng production incentivized flows into europe in the fourth quarter nuclear maintenance and domestic supply declines also supported imports the middle graph shows a total accumulation of population weighted heating degree days for the heating season in europe through january 24 europe has also seen mild weather this winter particularly in december making the regions heating degree days below average in the fourth quarter cooler temps in the back half of january have helped bring europe s temperatures closer to average for the season which should help with the weather sensitive demand however given all of the factors encouraging lng flows into europe we do not view the increase is entirely weather driven the graph on the far right displays storage levels on the left and ttf prices on the right axis as mentioned earlier the store situation europe faced coming out of the winter of 2017 exerted upward pressure on ttf prices europe entered the third quarter with storage levels near the bottom of the 5 year range which contributed to upward pressure on ttf prices in the fourth quarter prices were still more than 3 an mmbtu higher the level seen in the fourth quarter of 2017 although they have moderated particularly after october settlement europe is undergoing a structural shift in the overall dynamics of its gas market which makes it an increasingly attractive region for both our long term and shorter term lng strategies there is debate in europe heightened in recent weeks about limiting coal use and achieving climate targets that could have a significant positive impact on europe s appetite for lng in the longer term in the near term a number of the issues that were in play in the fourth quarter could remain in 2019 potentially resulting in continued robust european lng imports again this year i ll now turn the call over to michael to review our financial results advertisement advertisement michael wortley executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks anetol and good morning everyone turning to slide 13 for the fourth quarter we generated net income of 67 million consolidated adjusted ebitda of 634 million and distributable cash flow of approximately 130 million our results for the quarter were positively impacted by higher than forecast lng volumes and revenue and lifting ph margins as well as lower than forecast o m expenses for the full year we generated net income of 471 million consolidated adjusted ebitda of over 2 6 billion distributable cash flow of approximately 600 million as jack mentioned consolidated adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow for the full year were both at the top of the revised guidance ranges we provided on our third quarter call exported 285 tbtu of lng from our liquefaction projects during the fourth quarter of which 21 tbtu were commissioning volumes total volumes exported were higher than exports in the third quarter due to commissioning volumes from sabine pass train 5 and corpus christi train 1 and higher seasonal production from the four trains in operation at sabine pass approximately 72 of the volumes exported during the quarter are 260 tbtu were listed by our third party long term spa customers and the remaining 79 tbtu were lifted by our marketing functions long term spa customer volumes were consistent with prior quarter and marketing volumes were higher due to increased production and commissioning volumes the full year and we exported 976 tbtu from our liquefaction projects of which 21 tbtu were commissioning volumes approximately 77 of total volumes 756 tbtu were lifted by a third party long term spa customers and 220 tbtu were lifted by our marketing functions in the fourth quarter we recognized an income 242 tbtu of lng produced at sabine pass consisting of 263 tbtu loaded during the quarter plus 3 tbtu or one cargo loaded in the prior quarter but delivered and recognized in the current quarter last 25 tbtu or 7 cargoes sold on a delivered basis that were in transit as of the end of the fourth quarter we also recognized an income 40 tbtu or 12 cargoes of lng that were sourced from third parties the full year we recognized an income 973 tbtu of lng produced at sabine pass and 84 tbtu of lng that were sourced from third parties five commissioning cargoes from sabine pass train 5 in corpus christi train 1 totaling 17 tbtu of lng were recognized on our balance sheet as an offset of 140 million to lng terminal construction in progress during the fourth quarter one commissioning cargo exported during the fourth quarter was on the water at year end and will be recognized as an offset to construction in progress during the first quarter of 2019 net income attributable to common stockholders for the fourth quarter was 67 million or 0 26 per share consistent with the third quarter increased operating income due to additional lng volumes recognized in revenue was offset by increased derivative loss related to interest rate swaps full year 2018 we generated net income attributable to common stockholders of 471 million or 1 90 per share on a diluted basis an increase of more than 860 million from a net loss of 393 million in 2017 increase in net income was primarily due to increased income from operations as a result of additional trains in operation at sabine pass decreased loss on modification or extinguishment of debt increased derivative gain and decreased net income attributable to non controlling interests partially offset by increased interest expense net of amounts capitalized during the fourth quarter we amended our existing revolving credit facility increasing total commitments to 1 25 billion and extending the maturity date to december 2022 this undrawn revolving facility enhances our liquidity position and provides a backstop for corpus equity funding obligations turn now to slide 14 where i ll review our 2019 guidance and touch on the highest priorities for 2019 jack mentioned earlier we remain focused on delivering results and today we are reiterating our full year 2019 consolidated adjusted ebitda guidance of 2 9 billion to 3 2 billion a distributable cash flow guidance of 0 6 billion to 0 8 billion we are also reconfirming our full year 2019 cqp distribution guidance of 235 to 255 per unit our actual results could be impacted by changes to train completion timing or lng market pricing before turning the call over to q a i d like to briefly review our top three financial priorities for 2019 first is to achieve financial results within these guidance ranges second priority is to complete the debt financing transaction for 50 of the total cost of sabine pass train 6 inaudible that process and it is an essential step prior to reaching fid jack also mentioned this that our final key priority for this year is to develop and communicate capital allocation strategy a process which has been under way for several months now as we have previously indicated we expect our capital allocation plan to support our ability to invest in growth enable us to maintain investment grade credit metrics at the projects and ensure that consolidated leverage is at an appropriate level and return capital to shareholders in a way most appropriate inaudible our shareholders we expect to communicate this policy to the investment community in the coming months that concludes our prepared remarks thank you for your time and your interest in cheniere operator we are ready to open the line for questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions we ll now take our first question from christine cho from barclays please go ahead christine cho barclays analyst good morning everyone michael wortley executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning christine christine cho barclays analyst i know it s early for corpus christi stage 3 and it depends on the contracts but how are you thinking about targeted financing for it especially as you are in the process of developing your capital allocation policy should we also think of it as 50 50 bet equity similar to train 6 michael wortley executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah christine it s michael that s how we re thinking about it continue to deleverage through growth with no more than 50 debt on all incremental projects and maybe you can bring that down over time christine cho barclays analyst okay and then i think on the last quarter call you said that 2 5 to 3 mtpa was the assumption for early cargoes this year has the contracting for this book increased since last quarter and how should we think about your strategy around this as we move through the year and should we still think 5 margin for the uncontracted portion this is what we should assume michael wortley executive vice president and chief financial officer yes this is michael again so i think the number is more like 6 million tonnes i think is of post cod volumes with another 1 5 million on top of that a commissioning volumes which won t hit the p l i don t know exactly how the portfolios evolved over the past few months but certainly we ve been selling one thing to keep in mind is we don t like to sell volumes until we know we have them right until we go through this commissioning process there s always uncertainty about exactly when the train is going to come on so we don t want to get out of our skies having placed a lot of volume prior to getting the train so with that starting to become behind us as jack mentioned corpus passed the performance test recently so we have more certainty there so the guys will definitely be more active in putting those volumes away in terms of market you guys can all see the screen like we can i told you for the unsold piece of our portfolio we were assuming 4 5 to 5 5 margins when we did our budget three or four months ago clearly that has come in probably almost 2 and so we gave you that sensitivity on the last call that said for every dollar move in margin it affect our ebitda by 130 million so you can do that math so if we were in upper half of our guidance range three or four months ago certainly were lower in that range today but still within it christine cho barclays analyst okay thank you so much operator we ll now take our next question from jeremy tonet from jpmorgan jeremy tonet jpmorgan analyst good morning just wanted to build on spl 6 a little bit more here and see what else is needed for positive fid seems like a contractual support is largely there is it just lining up the financing and then also looks like the epc contract price 2 5 billion is a bit lower than what you had pressed pl5 and just wondering what drives the deltas there jack fusco president and ceo hi jeremy thanks spl 6 we re extremely excited about as i mentioned on my talking points we ve released bechtel with limited notice to proceed so we ve locked in the price we ve locked in the schedule in regards to that and bechtel is making extremely good progress as you know there s a lot of synergies with having the workforce just roll off of five into six additionally what you re seeing are with the cost of 6 we think it s extremely competitive just like corpus christi train 3 and we were able to utilize not only the synergies of having the workforce already mobilized in the equipment already there to move right into train 6 but also into utilizing some of the existing infrastructure that it affords us having the brownfield site so we ve got the infrastructure that was already built for the first five trains that we ve rolled into train 6 and that s part of the cost reduction michael i don t know if you have anything to add michael wortley executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean on the financing that we re progressing that as we speak as i said on the last call as jack said we have bechtel working right there full speed ahead we know price we know schedule we don t owe them a full mtpa until all of the summer and so as i said on the last call we re just kind of waiting to see what contracts come in and what the best portfolio is to really attached to that train for financing purposes and since the last call you saw petronas come in it s a very clean fob deal which we like to put down at the project so we have three or four months to see what else comes in and then decide the optimum mix and close that financing but that s not slowing us down in anyway because we re under way on train 6 and then i d add to jack s comment on remember when we built train 5 the first four trains leveraged a lot of infrastructure that we had at the regas facility all the utilities and things like that with train 5 we had to really add all of that and we did that in anticipation of train 6 so train 5 was always going to be the higher cost train train 6 was is far more attractive on a cost perspective because so much infrastructure is in place from the train 5 so yeah just like train 3 jeremy tonet jpmorgan analyst that s helpful thanks just wanted to switch gears over to esg seems like this is the greater focal point for the marketplace for investors going forward here and we re just wondering if you could tell us how cheniere thinks about these issues how you re positioning yourself and how you guys see yourselves stacking up versus other energy infrastructure company jack fusco president and ceo so we re very excited here recently organizationally we were able to bring on a fiji george who is from southwest who s got a lot of experience in esg type programs and he s been spearheading our effort as well as chris smith who is our senior vice president of external affairs in washington dc and you all may know chris he was assistant secretary of energy under the previous administrations so we think we need to be a leader in it as you know we feel like we re on the right side of the equation when it comes to esg we think natural gas is the solution it s economic it s secure and it s sustainable and what you see around the world is a policy shift i think it s going to be a secular shift in the way energy is utilized worldwide and i think you re going to see natural gas and liquefied natural gas take a much more prominent role in that well we will be rolling out our esg methodology and program here very very soon anatol do you have anything there anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer no just exactly as you said we re focused we are looking to leverage our position on the gas procurement side as well as our ability to supply this clean reliable fuel to the rest of the world and have the rest of the world achieve that type of carbon dioxide reductions that the u s has enjoyed over the last decade jeremy tonet jpmorgan analyst that s all from me thanks for taking my question operator we ll take our next question from michael webber from wells fargo securities mr webber please go ahead your line is open michael webber wells fargo securities analyst thanks hi good morning guys how are you anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer good morning michael webber wells fargo securities analyst jack just wanted to start off with you a market based question overnight we saw tensions escalate in pakistan and india because obviously i have some exposure there to india i m just curious can you maybe you run the risk and the impact your business can you maybe walk us through the impact theoretically of a force majeure there on your import contracts if we saw a replay of 1999 or a broader conflict and then maybe i guess within the context of kind of walking through that volumes just gets put into the spot market and make them on the back end i know it s early but seems pretty pressing so anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer yes there is no force majeure michael right it s fob so our contract with gail they pick up at the flange as sabine pass and they can take it wherever they want to take it and that s one of the benefits of the u s lng and the cheniere model so from that perspective we don t see anything meaningful one way or the other michael webber wells fargo securities analyst okay that s it wouldn t be applicable to an fob based contracts that basically what you re saying anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer it s not no we would expect them to honor their contract and we would enforce our contract but so far relationship with gail is extremely strong and we will continue to try to meet their needs so michael webber wells fargo securities analyst okay now that s helpful i appreciate that and then maybe just around the competitive dynamics in and around the u s gulf i guess it s been again a bit more crowded in the last quarter or two with fid at golden pass and vg kind of knocking on the door i guess maybe a little bit more insight i guess within the industry in terms of where those deals are getting done do you have a better sense yet around whether you ve been able to price or able to command a premium for your volumes relative to your peers in u s gulf and if so maybe kind of a vague sense on where you think that is anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer so a couple of things one i think when you see a lot of other folks that want to have a position like cheniere and then it just reconfirms that our business model our position is second to none right worldwide and so i m very very excited about that as you know we were a first mover and we ve executed extremely well right you can compare us to just about everybody else in the u s and see that our construction effort has been second to none our operating ability in the hand off from construction operations has been second to none our ability to produce real volume in a growing demand market has been second to none so i feel very good about our ability to execute and i do think our full service model and our ability to deliver anywhere around the world has afforded us a slight premium to were the spot market is clearing today michael webber wells fargo securities analyst okay thanks for the time guys i appreciate it operator we ll take the next question from craig shere from tuohy brothers please go ahead craig shere tuohy brothers analyst good morning guys hi craig michael in may 2018 at your analyst day i think you guided that on a 9 train program that you won t required to think about debt amortization out of operating cash flows at both the mlp spl level and also at the lng corpus christi level to late 2020s can you kind of share what maybe all equity funding of 300 a ton upsizing of all the liquefaction trains and the possible successful addition of a 50 50 corpus christi phase 3 would do to that would push amortization requirements under the 20s and 30s anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer yes absolutely i don t know what the exact date is that we d look to get into the details on that when we hit the road probably after our next call to roll out capital allocation and train 6 the train 6 numbers and probably add some stage 3 numbers into the whole model but absolutely i mean it s every piece of equity differs that amortization date craig shere tuohy brothers analyst yes speaking of phase 3 since corpus train 3 you signed four agreements with a total of five in a quarter mtpa which obviously is more than you could possibly need for 4 5 6 how much do you feel like you already have in the bag so to speak corpus phase 3 and what minimum percentage of the 9 5 mtpa would you like to train 6 contracted before perhaps an fid next year anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer yes i mean we definitely have more contracts than we need for train 6 for sure we ve drawn down kind of some of our cmi inventory to service some of that but the plan would be to we would think that piece of our business competitive advantage to keep some capacity there how much do we need on stage 3 i think we re running a couple of cases one where we built the whole thing and one where we built half of it and certainly we re making our way toward at least building half of it but not quite there yet so jack fusco president and ceo and i would say craig we re extremely excited about corpus christi and our ability to expand we think there are no constraints with the site there s no constraints with natural gas pipeline capacity coming into the side the amount of infrastructures is there and then our location to the permian should be a real advantage all the way around so that we re not going to slow down on the growth side i think i ve got some of the best originators in this industry and we re going to capitalize upon that craig shere tuohy brothers analyst that sounds great jack if i could kind of dovetail on the those comments do you see prospects related to corpus phase 3 for signing both supply and off take agreements linked to brent or perhaps a texas based gas inaudible jack fusco president and ceo anatol you want to take that anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer thanks jack thanks greg yes i think one of the things that was surprising in some sense amazing in the lng market in 2018 was that the majority of the contracts that were executed were henry hub linked and obviously it was us and our neighbors at vg that had the that success the world has got comfortable with this as an attractive model it offers liquidity price transparency and it has seen a number of times now when if henry hub has a quick excursion to prices above 3 it comes down very rapidly and continues to be very competitive with brent linked and other contracts we continue to think that that is the right flag to fly your question about alternative indices that s a very long part and in our view of the world isn t ready to price meaningful volume aguadulce ph while it s something that you and we know well just does not have the liquidity transparency term structure that would make it marketable internationally michael webber wells fargo securities analyst that s very helpful very quick last one for michael i think may last year at analyst day you said 1 9 billion of incremental forecast equity funding for corpus christi trains 1 to 3 with things progressing seemingly better than expected any range of how much that might come under michael wortley executive vice president and chief financial officer i don t think we re ready to i mean train 3 has a long way to go so i would stick with that number for now train 6 we re going to end up with probably close to 300 million of contingency though and so that will get rolled into train 6 to help meet our 50 50 debt equity to train 5 we had excess contingency which will roll into train 6 to achieve our 50 50 debt equity but on corpus side stick with the numbers we put out in may michael webber wells fargo securities analyst great thank you operator will now take our next question from danilo juvane from bmo capital markets danilo juvane bmo capital markets analyst thanks and good morning my first question is for michael you have pretty clear visibility to the contractive portion of your cash flow profile just curious with that in mind how you sort of evaluating the various capital allocation decisions going forward michael wortley executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah we do have a lot of visibility again we ll roll that out in a few months probably after our next call will hit the road and talk about it but it s pretty straightforward for us there s three buckets right there is the growth bucket the balance sheet bucket and the shareholder returns bucket and i can tell you we re really excited about the growth so that s going to be a big number as we look at not only train 6 but stage 3 reinvesting in the business is the best use of our money at the returns we think we can generate and then we ll have to decide if we want to do something else on the balance sheet relative to what we ve already said publicly so we re thinking through that and then there s probably some money left over for some kind of shareholder return flexibility is going to be key for us we will keep that in mind as we think about bucket number 3 but look to put some real numbers to that here in the coming months danilo juvane bmo capital markets analyst and as you think about bucket number 3 is that something that you think you d be able to actually implement this year or farther out to assuming some sort of a run rate and inaudible michael wortley executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah we ll see i mean probably both but we ll see danilo juvane bmo capital markets analyst okay i thank you for that other question is for jack you spoke earlier in your prepared remarks about being opportunistic to a cqp simplification i mean it seems that there will be a little bit more difficult to achieve versus what you were able to do with cqh how should we think about how you ultimately end up rolling up the mlp thank you jack fusco president and ceo i think that i said it fairly clearly we re going to be very opportunistic the math doesn t work and we re going to have a complicated structure for the foreseeable future and until we convince all of you that our growth really is there i think we ll get hopefully get you ll comfortable and we can actually execute what we say and that we re a conservative bunch overall but right now the exchange ratio just don t work danilo juvane bmo capital markets analyst got you last question from me with respect to stage 3 have we ultimately just abandoned midscale that seems to be let s talk about now there seems to be shift in zones just having sort of conventional trains going forward how should we think about that jack fusco president and ceo no we are moving full speed ahead with our midscale solution right now which is our corpus christi stage 3 sorry not train 3 stage 3 that would filing which we have in front of ferc right now danilo juvane bmo capital markets analyst those are my question thank you jack fusco president and ceo thanks operator as a reminder ladies and gentlemen please limit yourself to one question with one follow up and rejoin the queue for additional questions our next questioner comes from jean salisbury from bernstein please go ahead jean ann salisbury bernstein analyst hi good morning how much advanced locking in is there of pricing for spot cargoes have we seen the full effect of the fourth quarter winter gas spike on margins or it will sum up your next quarter anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer well thank you it s anatol it s really a mix as michael said we have three trains coming on with a fair amount of timing uncertainty on cargoes and we re not in the business of going short in the market we as we ve said to you before we do have some tranches obviously we have early cargoes associated with some term deals that we ve executed over the last year as well as some medium term deals for 19 and 20 but for competitive reasons we re not going to get into the specifics of the volumes quarter by quarter jean ann salisbury bernstein analyst okay fair enough and then do you see a risk in 2019 that have everything starts up as scheduled some u s lng facilities won t be running at full capacity for parts of the year anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer it anatol again i really cannot envision that scenario actually i have to say i can t envision the first premise of that scenario either but even if that did play out the probability that on a marginal basis there is no value in exporting a 2 5 henry hub molecule to a strong global market is pretty close to zero to me jean ann salisbury bernstein analyst okay that s all from me thank you operator next question comes from fotis giannakoulis from morgan stanley please go ahead sir fotis giannakoulis morgan stanley analyst yes hi thank you all anatol i have one question for you the last three fids they can be reached without long term spas from the respective parties is this a new trend and how does this change the the long term dynamics of the market and your potential margins and growth initiatives beyond the stage 3 of corpus christi anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer thanks fotis it s not a surprise to you or to us it s a global and competitive market and lots of places have attractive molecules that they want to monetize with eight different capital allocation algorithm and different risk tolerance than we do so we are always expecting what in the u s we may have called a producer push component the lng market calls it the equity lifting model those are projects that we always believed would be able to get off the ground whether that s east africa western canada arctic russia et cetera and where we are expecting fully expecting to compete with them we have been competing with them and there weren t a surprise to anyone in 2018 where we had pretty close to a record year so we love the hand that we re dealt we love as jack said the business model and the track record that we ve built and we re confident that we ll be able to leverage that into continued success but it is a competitive market fotis giannakoulis morgan stanley analyst so from your answer shall i take that your strategy of backing every new expansion with long term spas will remain intact or this new fids might change your risk appetite anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer well look we told you a couple of years ago our model was continued to refine that we think that the range of cmi having the warehouse staff 5 to 20 sort of as the side boards of volume in it is a very good number and we re still comfortable with that and we ve had good success as michael mentioned we ve in essence drawn down that inventory will look to reallocate volumes to that in order to continue to prosecute the type of bridging volume and secure reliable attractive value proposition that we ve been successful with so there is no reason to change what s been working and is expected to continue working for the foreseeable future fotis giannakoulis morgan stanley analyst thank you very much anatol congratulation for the great year anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer thanks fotis operator our next question comes from michael lapides from goldman sachs michael lapides goldman sachs analyst hey guys two questions one on the last quarterly call you kind of updated the range of potential output our capacity for each training kind of raise the high end can you talk to us about kind of how you get comfortable with hitting that high end and is even upside to that level i d love response on that and then i ve got a follow on about the balance sheet jack fusco president and ceo michael it s jack yeah so from an operating perspective i would say that we are very comfortable now with the upper end of the range that we gave all of you we have some de bottlenecking initiatives that we have plans of achieving this year with some of our turnaround and maintenance schedules and you should expect us to revise our output but i think most of you are probably on genscape and can see our gas flows into our facility and noq hat we re very close to 5 bcf d right now so we re very very pleased with the way our trains have been performing michael lapides goldman sachs analyst got it and then one quick one on the balance sheet just curious how do you think about let s say once you get train 6 online and that s we re talking a couple years down the road what you think about as a normal credit metrics that you d like to achieve kind of a long run target or a long run goal and whether that is measured on an ffo to debt or debt to ebitda perspective anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer before michael answers that question i just want to make sure already this morning with the l t of train 6 that the price in the schedule are fixed and not a risk for us so we haven t had any cost overruns yet we don t expect to start now on our trains number 8 and 9 so i just want to make sure i got that clear michael lapides goldman sachs analyst understood i ve known you for a long time have i ve not seen you have very many cost overruns in the 12 to 15 years anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer go ahead michael michael wortley executive vice president and chief financial officer the balance sheet the rating agencies look at it several different ways the projects they care about debt service coverage ratios and then deconsolidated numbers consolidated numbers and for us i think we had we need to keep it simple and just communicate like everybody else which is just a consolidated debt to ebitda number and so that over the long run i think that s what we ll start to look at more and more though the rating agencies are more nuance given our multiple levels of debt michael lapides goldman sachs analyst do have a kind of a mental target in mind of where you d like that debt to ebitdar number to be train 6 is up and running michael wortley executive vice president and chief financial officer well they are the part of our grant roll out in a few months currently we re at 5 times to 6 times consolidated probably on the upper end of that range from what we said last time so that s what we ll stick with for now michael lapides goldman sachs analyst got it thank you michael much appreciated guys operator our final question today will come from alex kania from wolfe research please go ahead alex kania wolfe research analyst thanks i just wanted to touch on the commentary related to maybe the financing package for sabine pass 6 michael i think you talked about thinking about optimizing what contracts you which has that facility are you talking mainly about the cmi contracts that you ve already got secured or maybe are you is there kind of discussions far enough along in another fob type contract that you may want to wait to see play out for you you finalize that michael wortley executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i mean we have a free option right now which is that we don t have to give full mtpa summer so yes we just wait and see what happens i mean i like our position now if we had to make a decision tomorrow i don t think we have any problem with that but given that we have free time to wait working hard yes i mean we ll wait and see if anything else comes down the pipe between now and then we have vitol and petronas which you re fob deals and then we have a fair amount of does deals so yes we ll just wait alex kania wolfe research analyst thanks very much michael wortley executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks alex anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer and thank you all for your support of cheniere operator ladies and gentlemen we will now turn it back to management for additional or closing remarks anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer thanks everyone for joining us today

when the 2008 financial crisis happened there was a lot of loose talk about the end of the dollar as the world s reserve currency i e the one currency that everyone from central banks to criminals holds and uses there were also a lot more sober analyses suggesting the same thing i was on the other side of the fence during that debate arguing in both short form and long form that the dollar was going to be around for a while why am i bringing this up now because while i still believe the dollar is not going anywhere anytime soon i am less confident than i used to be my reasons for confidence have not changed to create a true challenger to the dollar any actor needed to meet two necessary conditions opportunity and willingness another actor must be both able and willing to provide a substitute and not a complement to the greenback the dollar functions as the reserve currency because of a deep and liquid u s capital markets and b transparent and reliable monetary authorities challengers to the dollar remain deficient in their ability to offer a viable substitute if china wanted the renminbi to rival the dollar it would have to radically improve both the availability of rmb denominated securities and the transparency of its regulators the eurozone economies would have to persuade investors of the long term viability of a stateless currency it is also less than clear if either china or the eurozone really wants to assume the responsibilities of managing a top reserve currency although the issuer of a reserve currency accrues economic benefits through seigniorage and other positive externalities it also reduces the competitiveness of the issuing economy the currency tends to be a bit overvalued weakening export competitiveness neither china nor germany seems to be willing to disrupt its domestic political economy with the added burden of managing a reserve currency furthermore the united states just displayed its command over the dollar yet again by forcing swift the belgium based network responsible for the cross border payments system between banks to comply with unilateral u s sanctions against iran if the trump administration could coerce swift into compliance despite the european union s desire for them not to comply why should i worry now about the dollar s future there are two parts to this answer the first is that in ratcheting up the use of financial statecraft and trade sanctions on trading partners the trump administration has incentivized active efforts to develop the necessary financial architecture to challenge the dollar the iran case was particularly problematic because it is the first time that washington applied this kind of pressure with its european allies in active opposition if china russia and the european union develop joint efforts to develop alternative payments systems to the dollar it lays the groundwork for greater non american coordination to come while this might be costly to these countries a belligerent trump administration will increase the likelihood that these actors will be willing to bear the cost little wonder that sanctions experts are repeatedly sounding the alarm about u s abuse of the dollar s position in the international monetary system if the united states cannot credibly commit to not abusing the dollar s exorbitant privilege eventually other countries in the system will become willing to shoulder the burdens of transitioning away from the dollar on iran we have seen u s partners turkey and india announce that they will trade in local currencies to bypass the dollar the e u china and russia are cobbling together an alternative payments system to bypass swift as well iran is still going to feel the sting of sanctions but think of these measures as hedges against future u s sanctions speaking of the future the second reason this time might be different is the ever worsening u s fiscal picture this year alone according to the treasury department the federal government will have to issue 1 3 trillion in new debt this is coming with an economy generating full employment and more than 3 percent economic growth if the economy were to spiral into a recession or if the federal reserve raises interest rates further the debt picture would deteriorate further who buys u s debt americans mostly but foreigners buy about 30 percent of it if foreign purchasers start to doubt the long term viability of the u s debt picture they might start demanding that the united states denominate its debt in a different currency yes there is precedent for this if that becomes a thing the prospects of the dollar remaining the top currency start to dim one last thought if any of this happens it can happen very quickly the network effects of a single reserve currency are pretty strong for now that is good for the dollar as all the market incentives favor a continuation of the status quo if an alternative to the dollar emerges and is agreed upon however financial actors could move very quickly to offload dollars and buy up the new reserve currency which means that the end of the dollar s privileged status will start slowly and then accelerate quite rapidly

despite solid growth and continuing job gains the us economy will see inflation fall even further below the central bank s two percent goal at least for a time federal reserve chairman jerome powell said tuesday that forecast added weight to the fed s recent announcements that it will be patient before making any further changes in the benchmark borrowing rate a stance powell re emphasized in semi annual testimony before the us senate banking committee recent declines in energy prices will likely push headline inflation further below the longer run goal of 2 percent for a time he said the us central bank increased the key policy interest rate four times last year but rising uncertainty especially around the us trade confrontation with china amplified concerns about slowing global growth and fears the fed was moving too aggressively and with no sign of rising inflation that prompted the fed to signal clearly for the past several weeks that it would tread carefully many economists no longer expect any increases this year while a few say the next move could be a cut if the economy slows further noting the fed s preferred annual inflation measure sits at 1 7 percent powell said the extent and timing of any further rate increases would depend on incoming data and the evolving outlook the danger of having inflation continually below the target is that it saps confidence in the fed s ability to impact the economy especially during a slowdown but the muted inflation pressures and risks on the horizon mean this is a good time to be patient and watch and wait and see how the situation evolves he said in response to a question unlike the reaction to some of his comments late last year markets largely shrugged off powell s testimony to focus on other issues wall street closed slightly lower he remained upbeat about the economic outlook saying fed officials generally expected economic activity to expand at a solid pace albeit somewhat slower than in 2018 and the job market to remain strong economic crosscurrents however crosscurrents and conflicting signals pose a potential danger the predominant risks are slowing global growth particularly china and europe which he cautioned can create headwinds for the united states economy brexit and ongoing trade negotiations also are issues the fed will carefully monitor us federal reserve gal roma afp the united states and china have hammered each other with punitive tariffs on more than 360 billion in two way trade raising prices to producers and consumers and undercutting economic growth the international monetary fund cites the trade war between the world s two largest economies as a major risk to global growth and cut their growth forecast for this year but president donald trump on monday said he expected to hold a signing summit soon with china s leader xi jinping to resolve the issue and he pushed back a march 1 deadline which would have triggered tariffs to more than double on 200 billion in chinese exports in the us economy low inflation and sluggish wage growth despite net job gains that averaged 223 000 last year and gdp gaining just under three percent have continued to baffle economists and the fed powell noted some signs of stronger wage growth particularly in lower skilled jobs but also said disparities persist in the labor market along racial and ethnic lines and also between rural and urban workers they did it anyway however longer run trends such as relatively stagnant incomes for many families and a lack of upward economic mobility among people with lower incomes also remain important challenges he said and the united states has a lower share of prime age workers participating in the economy than comparable advanced economies which has the effect of holding back productivity which is needed to boost growth he added powell said in addition to programs to promote worker training and dealing with the opioid crisis that keeps people out of the workforce the government needs policies that do not punish people for going back to work he described a training program in west virginia where women who participated lost the meager benefits they were already getting because many us aid programs end as soon as the recipients find jobs they had to take a pay cut to go back to work and they did it anyway which is pretty inspiring powell told senators
