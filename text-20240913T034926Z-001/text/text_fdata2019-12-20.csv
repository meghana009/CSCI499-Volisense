overview the holiday mood has tightened its grip on the capital markets and global investors have nearly completely ignored the impeachment of the us president as it has little economic or policy significance us equities reached new record highs yesterday with the s p 500 moving above 3200 asia pacific equities were mixed leaving the msci asia pacific index consolidating recent gains that carried it to the 61 8 retracement objective of the decline that began at the start of 2018 europe s dow jones stoxx 600 is moving broadly sideways after setting record highs at the beginning of the week it is poised to gain more than 1 for the second consecutive week it has fallen only three weeks here in q4 compared with two weeks of declines for the s p 500 the sell off in bonds continues and yields are up 1 2 basis points today though italian and greek yields are up a bit more the foreign exchange market is becalmed sterling has stabilized after falling two percent in the past three sessions for the most part the major currencies are hugging little changed levels the dollar index is poised to snap a two week drop against the emerging market currency complex the dollar is mixed but the jp morgan emerging market currency index has firmed by about 0 3 this week making it the third weekly gain after falling every week in november gold is little changed on the day and week while february wti is nursing a small loss to trim this week s gains the third consecutive weekly rise during the run the price of crude has risen by more than 10 asia pacific japan reported november cpi rose 0 5 year over year up from 0 2 in october it has finished 2018 at 0 3 and 2017 at 1 0 the measures the boj targets exclude fresh food by this metric core inflation rose to 0 5 from 0 4 it stood at 0 7 at the end of last year and 0 9 at the end of 2017 excluding fresh food and oil japan s cpi rose to 0 8 the highest in three years the country s sales tax increase october 1 and the free pre school initiative have distorted the data and when adjusted for core inflation is closer to 0 2 the boj cannot be content with the results but appears to be out of runway and the government s fiscal stimulus buys it time after cutting the reverse repo rate by 5 bp earlier this week the pboc left its loan prime rate unchanged at 4 15 one year which surprised the market many economists expect further easing next year to support the economy which is expected to hover around 6 growth next year separately china s media reported that president xi will not attend davos next month there had been some ideas that xi and trump could meet there the dollar recorded an outside down day against the yen yesterday by trading on both sides of the previous day s range and then closing below its low however there has been no follow through selling today and the greenback has been confined to about jpy109 25 109 40 the dollar has traded above jpy109 70 a few times this month and met sellers each time there is a roughly 430 million option there that expires today but more notable are 3 2 billion in options struck between jpy109 45 and jpy109 50 that also are expiring the australian dollar is firm as it closes in on its third consecutive weekly gain it is flirting with 0 6900 and testing the 200 day moving average 0 6905 which it has toyed with several times this year but failed to close above it once the dollar set the week s high against the chinese yuan today near cny7 0160 today is the first session in seven that the dollar did not trade below cny7 0 europe two developments in the uk dominate the european session first the head of the bank of england s financial conduct authority andrew bailey has been picked to succeed carney at the end of next month as governor of the bank of england recently former deputy governor shafik had been seen as the front runner though bailey was always seen as a safe choice he will serve an eight year term some reports suggest shafik was more critical of brexit bailey may be an old hand at the bank of england but he has not served on the monetary policy committee and his views are not clear note that carney has agreed to extend his term for a third time from the end of january to mid march to allow for a smooth transition second q3 uk gdp was revised to 0 4 from 0 3 on the back of stronger services private consumption was shaved to 0 3 from 0 4 while government spending fell by 0 6 instead of increasing by 0 3 the net export function improved as export growth was revised to 7 9 from 5 2 and a 4 1 contraction in q2 imports fell by 0 3 rather than rise by 0 8 as it was previously estimated the result was a sharp improvement in the q3 current account deficit from a shortfall of gbp24 2 billion in q2 to gbp15 9 billion in q3 which is the smallest deficit in seven years the euro is consolidating in about a ten tick range near the week s lows it reached almost 1 1105 yesterday after having been turned back from nearly 1 12 at the end of last week it met sellers today near 1 1125 and there are 3 5 billion euro in options that will be cut today that are struck between 1 1130 and 1 1150 sterling was pushed briefly and narrowly through 1 30 yesterday and is holding above there today there is an option for about gbp690 million struck there and another for around gbp385 million at 1 3016 that expires today there are also 1 3040 1 3050 options for almost gbp925 million that will be cut as well the next hurdle is near 1 3100 sterling s 2 decline would be the largest weekly decline in seven months america yesterday s us economic data disappointed the philly fed survey for december was weaker than expected weekly jobless claims did not retrace as much of the previous week s spike as anticipated the decline in existing home sales was more than forecast and the november leading economic indicator defied expectations for an increase it has not posted a gain since july the highlight today is not so much revisions to q3 gdp which is too historical to matter to traders but the november income and consumption figures income is expected to rise by 0 3 after a flat reading in october and the risk is for a slightly smaller increase but consumption is understood to be more important and the market anticipates a robust 0 4 increase after 0 3 in october after the disappointing retail sales report the risk here too is on the downside the pce deflator which the fed targets may edge up to 1 4 from 1 3 but the core deflator that is often discussed may slip to 1 5 from 1 6 canada reports october retail sales and a 0 5 increase is expected after the disappointing 0 1 fall in september the average monthly gain this year is 0 3 the same as in 2018 the risk is on the downside as economists have been more often than not expecting stronger than actual data mexico also reports october retail sales there is likely to be some payback from the 0 9 surge in september retail sales and the median forecast in the bloomberg survey is for a 0 3 decline the us dollar s losing streak against the canadian dollar will extend to its fourth consecutive week if it cannot resurface above ca1 3165 there is a 700 million option at cad1 3150 that expires today it has met some selling in front of there in the european morning as widely expected mexico delivered its fourth 25 bp rate cut of the year yesterday to 7 25 and the peso strengthened the dollar has traded as high as mxn19 04 early yesterday before sliding to the session low after the cut to about mxn18 9165 unable to get above mxn18 95 today the greenback remains in this week s trough meanwhile the bounce in the dollar index is bumping along the 91 50 resistance area the 50 day moving average is set to cross below the 200 day moving average golden or

in seven years the euro is consolidating in about a ten tick range near the week s lows it reached almost 1 1105 yesterday after having been turned back from nearly 1 12 at the end of last week it met sellers today near 1 1125 and there are 3 5 bln euro in options that will be cut today that are struck between 1 1130 and 1 1150 sterling was pushed briefly and narrowly through 1 30 yesterday and is holding above there today there is an option for about gbp690 mln struck there and another for around gbp385 mln at 1 3016 that expires today there are also 1 3040 1 3050 options for almost gbp925 mln that will be cut as well the next hurdle is near 1 3100 sterling s 2 decline would be the largest weekly decline in seven months america yesterday s us economic data disappointed the philly fed survey for december was weaker than expected weekly jobless claims did not retrace as much of the previous week s spike as anticipated the decline in existing home sales was more than forecast and the november leading economic indicator defied expectations for an increase it has not posted a gain since july the highlight today is not so much revisions to q3 gdp which is too historical to matter traders but the november income and consumption figures income is expected to rise by 0 3 after a flat reading in october and the risk is for a slightly smaller increase but consumption is understood to be more important and the market anticipates a robust 0 4 increase after 0 3 in october after the disappointing retail sales report the risk here too is on the downside the pce deflator which the fed targets may edge up to 1 4 from 1 3 but the core deflator that is often discussed may slip to 1 5 from 1 6 canada reports october retail sales and a 0 5 increase is expected after the disappointing 0 1 fall in september the average monthly gain this year is 0 3 the same as in 2018 the risk is on the downside as economists have been more often than not expecting stronger than actual data mexico also reports october retail sales there is likely to be some payback from the 0 9 surge in september retail sales and the median forecast in the bloomberg survey is for a 0 3 decline the us dollar s losing streak against the canadian dollar will extend to its fourth consecutive week if it cannot resurface above ca1 3165 there is a 700 mln option at cad1 3150 that expires today it has met some selling in front of there in the european morning as widely expected mexico delivered its fourth 25 bp rate cut of the year yesterday to 7 25 and the peso strengthened the dollar has traded as high as mxn19 04 early yesterday before sliding to the session low after the cut to about mxn18 9165 unable to get above mxn18 95 today the greenback remains in this week s trough meanwhile the bounce in the dollar index is bumping along the 91 50 resistance area the 50 day moving average is set to cross below the 200 day moving average golden or deadman s cross next week it would be the first time since june 2018
ignoring problems rarely solves them you need to deal with them not just the effects but the underlying causes or else they usually get worse the older you get the more you know that is true in almost every area of life in the developed world and especially the us and even in china our economic challenges are rapidly approaching that point things that would have been easily fixed a decade ago or even five years ago will soon be unsolvable by conventional means there is almost no willingness to face our top problems specifically our rising debt the economic challenges we face can t continue which is why i expect the great reset a kind of worldwide do over it s not the best choice but we are slowly ruling out all others last week i talked about the political side of this our embrace of either crony capitalism or welfare statism is going to end very badly ideological positions have hardened to the point that compromise seems impossible central bankers are politicians in a sense and in some ways far more powerful and dangerous than the elected ones some recent events provide a glimpse of where they re taking us hint it s nowhere good and when you combine it with the fiscal shenanigans it s far worse central banks weren t always as responsibly irresponsible as my friend paul mcculley would say as they are today walter bagehot one of the early editors of the economist wrote what came to be called bagehot s dictum for central banks as the lender of last resort during a financial or liquidity crisis the central bank should lend freely at a high interest rate on good securities the federal reserve came about as a theoretical antidote to even worse occasional panics and bank failures clearly it had a spotty record through 1945 as there were many mistakes made in the 20s and especially the 30s the loose monetary policy coupled with fiscal incontinence of the 70s gave us an inflationary crisis paul volcker s recent passing rip reminds us of perhaps the fed s finest hour stamping out the inflation that threatened the livelihood of millions however volcker had to do that only because of past mistakes recently reader mourad rahmanov who has thought provoking and sometimes lengthy reactions to almost every letter kindly sent me some of his personal favorite john mauldin quotes one was this passage which succinctly captures my feelings about the fed context this was part of my response to ray dalio s comments on modern monetary theory beginning with greenspan we have now had 30 years of ever looser monetary policy accompanied by lower rates this created a series of asset bubbles whose demises wreaked economic havoc artificially low rates created the housing bubble exacerbated by regulatory failure and reinforced by a morally bankrupt financial system and with the system completely aflame we asked the arsonist to put out the fire with very few observers acknowledging the irony yes we did indeed need the federal reserve to provide liquidity during the initial crisis but after that the fed kept rates too low for too long reinforcing the wealth and income disparities and creating new bubbles we will have to deal with in the not too distant future this wasn t a beautiful deleveraging as you call it it was the ugly creation of bubbles and misallocation of capital the fed shouldn t have blown these bubbles in the first place the simple conceit that 12 men and women sitting around the table can decide the most important price in the world short term interest rates better than the market itself is beginning to wear thin keeping rates too low for too long in the current cycle brought massive capital misallocation it resulted in the financialization of a significant part of the business world in the us and elsewhere the rules now reward management not for generating revenue but to drive up the price of the share price thus making their options and stock grants more valuable coordinated monetary policy is the problem not the solution and while i have little hope for change in that regard i have no hope that monetary policy will rescue us from the next crisis let me amplify that last line not only is there no hope monetary policy will save us from the next crisis it will help cause the next crisis the process has already begun in september of this year something still unexplained at least to my satisfaction although i know many analysts who believe they know the reasons happened in the repo short term financing market liquidity dried up interest rates spiked and the fed stepped in to save the day i wrote about it at the time in decoding the fed story over no the fed has had to keep saving the day every day since then we hear different theories the most frightening one is that the repo market itself is actually fine but a bank is wobbly and the billions in daily liquidity are preventing its collapse who might it be i have been told by well connected sources that it could be a mid sized japanese bank i was dubious because it would be hard to keep such a thing hidden for months but then this week bloomberg reported some japanese banks badly hurt by the boj s negative rate policy have turned to riskier debt to survive so perhaps it s fair to wonder whatever the cause the situation doesn t seem to be improving on dec 12 a new york fed statement said its trading desk would increase its repo operations around year end to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample and to mitigate the risk of money market pressures notice at the link how the ny fed describes its plans the desk will offer at least 150 billion here and at least 75 billion there that s not how debt normally works lenders give borrowers a credit limit not a credit guarantee plus an implied promise of more the us doesn t yet have negative rates but the fed is giving banks negative credit limits in a very precise violation of bagehot s dictum we have also just finished a decade of the loosest monetary policy in american history the partial tightening cycle notwithstanding something is very wrong if banks still don t have enough reserves to keep markets liquid part of it may be that regulations outside the fed s control prevent banks from using their reserves as needed but that doesn t explain why it suddenly became a problem in september necessitating radical action that continues today like what you re reading get this free newsletter in your inbox every saturday read our privacy policy here first name this is required email this is required subscribe for free recaptcha here s the official line from minutes of the unscheduled oct 4 meeting at which the fomc approved the operation staff analysis and market commentary suggested that many factors contributed to the funding stresses that emerged in mid september in particular financial institutions internal risk limits and balance sheet costs may have slowed the distribution of liquidity across the system at a time when reserves had dropped sharply and treasury issuance was elevated so the fed blames internal risk limits and balance sheet costs at banks what are these risks and costs they were unwilling to accept and why we still don t know there are lots of theories some even make sense whatever the reason it was severe enough to make the committee agree to both repo operations and the purchase of 20 billion a month in treasury securities and another 20 billion in agencies they insist the latter isn t qe but it sure walks and quacks like a qe duck so i and many others call it qe4 as we learned with previous qe rounds exiting is hard remember that 2013 taper tantrum ben bernanke s mild hint that asset purchases might not continue forever infuriated a liquidity addicted wall street the fed needed a couple more years to start draining the pool and then did so in the stupidest possible way by both raising rates and selling assets at the same time i don t feel good saying i told you so but well i did having said that i have to note the fed has few good choices as mistakes compound over time it must pick the least bad alternative but with each such decision the future options grow even worse so eventually instead of picking the least bad they will have to pick the least disastrous one that point is drawing closer underlying all this is an elephant in the room the rapidly expanding federal debt each annual deficit raises the total debt and forces the treasury to issue more debt in hopes someone will buy it the us government ran a 343 billion deficit in the first two months of fiscal 2020 october and november and the 12 month budget deficit again surpassed 1 trillion federal spending rose 7 from a year earlier while tax receipts grew only 3 no problem some say we owe it to ourselves and anyway people will always buy uncle sam s debt that is unfortunately not true the foreign buyers on whom we have long depended are turning away as peter boockvar noted this week foreign selling of us notes and bonds continued in october by a net 16 7b this brings the year to date selling to 99b with much driven by liquidations from the chinese and japanese it was back in 2011 and 2012 when in each year foreigners bought over 400b worth thus it is domestically where we are now financing our ever increasing budget deficits the fed now has also become a big part of the monetization process via its purchases of t bills which also drives banks into buying notes the fed s balance sheet is now 335b higher than it was in september at 4 095 trillion again however the fed wants to define what it s doing market participants view this as qe4 with all the asset price inflation that comes along with qe programs it will be real interesting to see what happens in 2020 to the repo market when the fed tries to end its injections and how markets respond when its balance sheet stops increasing in size it s so easy to get involved and so difficult to leave declining foreign purchases are in part a consequence of the trade war the dollars china and japan use to buy our t bills are the same dollars we pay them for our imported goods but interest and exchange rates also matter with rates negative or lower than ours in most of the developed world the us had been the best parking place but in the last year other central banks started looking for a nirp exit higher rate expectations elsewhere combined with stable or falling us rates give foreign buyers who must also pay for currency hedges less incentive to buy us debt if you live in a foreign country and have a particular need for its local currency an extra 1 in yield isn t worth the risk of losing even more in the exchange rate i know some think china or other countries are opting out of the us treasury market for political reasons but it s simply business the math just doesn t work especially given the fact that president trump is explicitly saying he wants the dollar to weaken and interest rates go even lower if you are in country x why would you do that trade you might if you re in a country like argentina or venezuela where the currency is toast anyway but europe japan china the rest of the developed world it s a coin toss the fed began cutting rates in july funding pressures emerged weeks later coincidence i suspect not many factors are at work here but it sure looks like through qe4 and other activities the fed is taking the first steps toward monetizing our debt if so many more steps are ahead because the debt is only going to get worse as you can see from the gavekal chart below the fed is well on its way to reversing that 2018 quantitative tightening louis gave wrote a brilliant essay recently behind their pay wall but perhaps he will make it more public considering four possible reasons for the present valuation dichotomies i ll quote the first one because i believe it is right on target 1 the fed s balance sheet expansion is only temporary the argument the fed s current liquidity injection program is not a genuine effort at quantitative easing by the us central bank instead it is merely a short term liquidity program to ensure that markets and especially the repo markets continue to operate smoothly in about 15 weeks time the fed will stop injecting liquidity into the system as a result the market is already looking through the current liquidity injections to the time when the fed goes cold turkey once again this explains why bond yields are not rising more why the us dollar isn t falling faster and so on my take this is a distinct possibility but then as milton friedman used to say nothing is so permanent as a temporary government program the question here is why did the repo markets freeze in mid to late september was it just a technical glitch or did the spike in short rates reflect the fact that the appetite of the us private sector and foreign investors for short dated us government debt has reached its limit in short did the repo market reach its wafer thin mint moment if it was a technical glitch then the fed will indeed be able to back off come the spring however if as i believe the repo market was not the trouble but merely a symptom of a bigger problem excessive growth in us budget deficits then it is hard to see how six months before a us election the fed will be able to climb back out of the full on us government monetization rabbit hole in which it is now fully immersed in this scenario the markets will come to an interesting crossroads around the ides of march at that point the fed will have to take one of two paths 1 the fed does indeed stop its non qe qe program in this scenario us and global equities are likely to take a nasty spill in an election year that will trigger a twitterstorm of epic proportions from the us president 2 the fed confirms that the six month temporary liquidity injection program is to be extended for another temporary six months at this point bond yields everywhere around the world will shoot up the us dollar will likely take a nasty spill global equities will outperform us equities and value will outperform growth etc looking at the us government s debt dynamics i believe the second option is much more likely and it is all the more probable since triggering a significant equity pull back a few months before the us presidential election could threaten the fed s independence still the first option does remain a possibility which may well help to explain the market s cautious positioning despite today s coordinated fiscal and monetary policies ex china just this week congress passed and president trump signed massive spending bills to avoid a government shutdown there was a silver lining both parties made concessions in areas each considers important republicans got a lot more to spend on defense and democrats got all sorts of social spending that kind of compromise once happened all the time but has been rare lately maybe this is a sign the gridlock is breaking but if so their cooperation still led to higher spending and more debt as long as this continues as it almost certainly will for a long time the fed will find it near impossible to return to normal policy the balance sheet will keep ballooning as they throw manufactured money at the problem because it is all they know how to do and or it s all congress will let them do nor will there be any refuge overseas the nirp countries will remain stuck in their own traps unable to raise rates and unable to collect enough tax revenue to cover the promises made to their citizens it won t be pretty anywhere on the globe like what you re

trees is one of my favorite macro thinkers like louis gave he thinks the monetization plan will get more obvious in early 2020 those that believe that the fed will begin undoing what it has done since september after the year end turn are either going to be proven right or they are going to be proven wrong in q1 2020 we strongly believe they will be proven wrong if when they are the fftt view that the fed is committed to financing us deficits with its balance sheet may go from a fringe view to the mainstream both parties in congress are committed to more spending no matter who is in the white house they will encourage the federal reserve to engage in more quantitative easing so the deficit spending can continue and even grow as i have often noted the next recession whenever it happens will bring a 2 trillion deficit meaning a 40 trillion dollar national debt by the end of the decade at least 20 trillion of which will be on the fed s balance sheet my side bet is that in 2030 we will look back and see that i was an optimist my 2020 forecast issue which you ll see after the holiday break i m planning to call the decade of living dangerously sometime in the middle to late 2020s we will see a great reset that profoundly changes everything you know about money and investing crisis isn t simply coming we are already in the early stages of it i think we will look back at late 2019 as

growth deceleration in the economy while the political landscape in latin america continues to present both opportunities and challenges in equity markets we are encouraged as the external environment

easing monetary policy from rbi keeps limiting inr s bulls prospects usd inr price has also capped upside on a relatively softer us dollar indian rupee forecast will be determined by the resolution of the current tight trading range between 70 50 and 72 00 after falling nearly 9 in 2018 the indian rupee inr fell another 4 and touched a 2019 low level of 72 40 against its american counterpart on september 3 in the wake of the tit for tat trade war between the world s two largest economies it has since then recovered a part of the yearly losses amid signs of progress in the us china trade dispute and a tentative improvement in the global economic outlook adding to this renewed interest among foreign portfolio investors for indian assets as depicted by stable portfolio flows has also led to the recent bounce according to the latest data foreign portfolio investors had bought 160 69 billion rupees of indian securities in october the highest in six months the purchases pushed the rupee to levels over one month highs dragging the usd inr cross further below the 71 00 mark during the first half of december rbi acting as a headwind for usd inr price however the fact that the reserve bank of india rbi is mopping up dollars inflows might limit any further appreciation according to estimates by bloomberg economics the rbi has bought about 18 billion of foreign exchange since the end of september and propelled reserves to a record pointing to determined efforts to curb a sharp appreciation of the domestic currency which can hurt exports the rbi s sharp dollar purchases could be seen as a predominant reason behind the rupee s under performance in emerging asia recently the rbi governor shaktikanta das also indicated the tolerance for a weaker rupee and said that the currency is fairly valued growth risks weighing on the currency s outlook apart from the rbi s deliberate effort market participants also think that the currency market is under pricing downside risks to domestic growth the indian economic growth slowed to a six and a half year low level of 4 5 during the july september quarter the recent business surveys continued to indicate sluggishness suggesting that growth could decelerate further and any recovery will be slow a slew of interest rate cuts from the reserve bank of india rbi has done nothing concrete so far to revive a slowing indian economy with five reductions in succession for a cumulative of 135 basis points the rbi has been one of the most aggressive central banks in the world for 2019 however the impaired balance sheets of many public sector banks and nbfcs have diluted the flow through the real economy and might further delay the effects of monetary easing adding to persistent concerns about the slowing domestic economy the risk of fiscal slippage might further prevent the currency from recouping this year s losses against the dollar in 2020 india s worrying fiscal deficit to put additional pressure the stimulus measures introduced this year have made it difficult for prime minister narendra modi s government to meet its fiscal deficit targets it is worth mentioning that the government on september 20 announced tax cuts for corporates bringing down the effective tax rate by 10 12 to 25 2 the lower rate was applicable from april 1 2019 and is expected to trigger a revenue loss of inr 1 45 trillion in the current fiscal year however if the measures taken by the government do not result in improving the growth outlook a reversal of portfolio flows could actually lead to some renewed weakness for the rupee softer dollar might limit rupee s downside meanwhile a modestly weaker us dollar may limit rupee s downside growing expectations for a resolution to the us china trade war led to a global stock market rally in recent weeks a wave of interest rate cuts from the world s central banks has also helped to boost risk assets and the greenback in turn gave back some of its gains coinciding with investor optimism the us economic growth after the fiscal fuelled boom of 2018 has started to decelerate and most leading indicators of activity have been heading lower or are already in the contraction territory suggesting that the usd uptrend has nearly run its course a slowdown in the us combined with falling inflation might prompt the federal reserve to provide support to the economy by cutting interest rates further and even restart its quantitative easing program as the rule of thumb goes lower interest rates and renewed bond purchases will weigh on the greenback something that feeds into the expectations that a top in the recent rally has already been reached in fact the fed has cut rates three times in 2019 to counter recession fears though signaled an indefinite pause at its latest meeting on december 11 according to the central bank s updated quarterly economic projections policymakers now anticipated no rate change in 2020 officials penciled in only one move in 2021 a rate hike and another in 2022 meanwhile in the post meeting press conference the fed chair jerome powell said that he doesn t think rates need to rise anytime soon until inflation grows persistently given that the record long us economic expansion is in its 11th year the fed s favorable outlook calmed concerns that the economy could falter and might result into only a

i have argued that in sub sahara africa most demonstrations protests and mass citizens actions are deeply attributed to rant seeking political corruption marginalization mismanagement malfeasances pronounced deprivation of wellbeing and unequal distribution of resources on the part of the political leaderships of the continent these several of menaces have harnessed and continue to midwife civil conflicts in most part of africa here i would build a comparative analysis between liberia and rwanda given the conspicuous similarities of both countries gloomy historical past by amara quardu mohammed kamara contributor like liberia rwanda experienced a dreadful historic genocide that owned the lives of about 1 million rwandans including women and children of the tutsi minority tribe and moderate hutus this happened as a result of what i have mentioned above the rwandan nation was completely paralyzed and failed world bank then referred to the country as nonviable the war had obliterated virtually everything most competent bureaucrats had been killed or fled and looters had stripped government offices down to the last piece of paper all government institutions were looted and vandalized when the post conflict government of national unity had taken charge in july 1994 the country had no running water and little electricity the new president kagame had no idea either did his colleagues have much expertise or institutional knowledge to draw on in reconsolidating the broken fabrics of the rwandan society before the genocide the country had about eight hundred judges but fewer had survived the mass slaughter as mentioned today rwanda s case is completely different as the country has buckled its belt for governance and human capital investment it has transitioned from hopelessness to hopefulness and is now considered as the singapore of africa within twenty five years less than what was projected for rwanda to re establish itself as a sovereign country and positive member of the comity of nations this synonymously depicts the liberian nation a country that was once seen as an epicenter of the fourteen years of civil conflicts from late 1989 to 2003 had embraced peace through the intervention of the then american president george w bush and other world leaders mainly the circle of the united nations it is estimated that about two hundred fifty thousand people were killed during the civil conflict like rwanda the liberian civil conflict had its historical root embedded in the class system orchestrated by the freed slaves after the rebellions in the americas and were migrated and settled in liberia the powerful elites congou though a very small population had ruled the country for almost 133 years the natives who account for the country s highest population had been politically and socially excluded and soon revenged against the ruling class when the opportunity for redemption availed itself this resulted in a military coup d état in april 1980 and resulted to master sgt samuel k doe and his men in arms murdering president william r tolbert at his executive mansion office this caused a prolonged period of anarchy characterized by ethnicity and plunder sadly the ringleader of the coup due to similar reasons he president samuel k doe was in 1990 slaughtered by then leader of the independent national patriotic front and now a member of the liberian senate sen prince y johnson these historical circumstances breaded the liberian civil war which led to massive atrocities and agony following the cessation of hostilities by various parties in 2003 the national transitional government of liberia ntgl headed by the late charles gyude bryant took charge as the country s interim government from 2003 to 2006 this interim arrangement took the country to its first postwar democratic elections that subsequently brought the first elected female president on the continent of africa mrs ellen j sirleaf even after the interim leadership state capacity was limitedly weak to enhance governance and set the pace for national development almost every sector of the country was broken and needed to be rebuilt poverty and diseases had ransacked the country and its people liberia was considered a failed state backed by indebtedness during the administration of the former president mrs ellen j sirleaf liberia graduated from the heavily indebted poor country hipc from the rankings of the international monetary fund imf and the world bank interestingly and despite the similar historical circumstances that beclouded the two countries liberia is yet to regain its full capabilities in governance rule of law and inclusive sustainable development currently reconciliation and political division are increasing challenges to national unity and development unlike rwanda the lessons of the civil conflict have not resonated with the country s government and people there are visibly vices that are considered conflict triggers corruption inequality and social discrimination rwanda s rebirth is accredited to the country s progressive leadership championed by h e president paul kagame whose immaculate leadership has led his country to rapid economic and human capital development can protests and demonstrations hold in rwanda this is hypothetical considering the progress that the country is making with the full participation of about 12 million rwandans who have embraced peace and harmony and involved in the rebuilding efforts of their great country there seems to be zero iotas of citizens actions or any act of political instability because the country has spectacularly positioned itself to achieve economic and social development of its people and onward ensure sustainable livelihoods the reasons i have not seen nor heard about demonstrations and protests in rwanda or even attempting to coin a campaign for kagame step down is that governance in rwanda is participatory the leadership ensures the country s economic development like agricultural employment empowerment job creations regional trades digital economy and infrastructural development etc is done collectively with inclusivity being the hallmark rwanda runs a private sector driven economy through the privatization of major parastastals and public private partnerships to ensure rural dwellers involvement in economic activities the government with supports from development partners has invested millions of dollars in the agricultural sector which ensures food security and job creations for farmers across the country while the private sector is reducing unemployment in the youthful population skilled and unskilled youths are being employed in rwandan firms and industries and as well as foreign investments now drawing from this economic approach would you think that rwandans will stand up for protests and frequent demonstrations a strong economic framework can birth social and political stability which keeps the people actively engaged and developmental for liberia our case is totally different and highly punctuated with a question mark those vices that orchestrated our civil conflict are empirically vivid in present day liberian society they have not abated at all we have not fully reconciled as a country neither have we learned the lessons of the past we have failed to win the war against political corruption marginalization unemployment and systemic mismanagement of our natural endowments these menaces have kept us dependent and undermined liberia s economic prosperity for decades this aspect has given reasons for mass based citizens actions in demand for transformative leadership good governance approach and transparency in the management of the country s resources opposition parties are of course ensuring that the government is greatly accountable to the governed drawing on its manifestos development framework which keeps the opposition parties reminded on checks and balances in government in both governments sirleaf and weah there have been calls to terminate the tenures of the regimes in the names of ellen step down and weah step down campaigns by citizens and politicians based on extreme poverty and lack of sustained economic development of the people the sirleaf chronicles former president ellen j sirleaf is remembered for ensuring efficient and effective performance of the ministries departments and agencies which set governance on the pace for performance through competent experienced and skilled administrators most liberian youths in her government were given opportunities for capacity development and scholarship opportunities were afforded to many liberian students desired for foreign education which propelled them to contribute to nation building efforts in both private and public sectors as mentioned sirleaf ensured that liberia graduated from the heavily indebted poor country hipc from the rankings of the international monetary fund imf and the world bank her accomplishments are enormous as she built roads that connected liberia s capital monrovia to connecting counties her efforts on infrastructural development are conspicuous according to economists her supports to road connectivity have created externalities for rural dwellers who are involved in farming activities yet her 12 years of leadership was expected to have created the country s development framework on the foundation of radical economic development that will guarantee employment of liberian youths who account for nearly 60 of our population considering her strong relationship with washington and aids received from donor countries and institutions this was not achieved and opportunities to achieve them were squandered due to classic corruption malfeasance rant seeking and the mismanagement of the country s resources madam sirleaf s policy on salaries of some heads of government was astronomically high while civil servants were working poor like many others the former maritime boss hon binyal kesselly was alleged to have received a monthly salary of usd 25 000 amidst rampant corruption extreme poverty massive unemployment declining economy infant and maternal mortalities extreme crime rates and fragile healthcare delivery services across liberia while heads of soes and autonomous agencies liberia petroleum refinery corporation national oil company of liberia national port authority liberia telecommunications authority and liberia revenue authority amongst others allegedly received 15 to 20 usd as monthly salaries this happened when healthcare workers were frequently on go slow actions in demand for increment and incentives while lecturers at the state run university and other public colleges were similarly abandoning classes due to low budgetary allotments at the same time the unemployed youths were regularly seen agitating for sustained jobs and skills that will make them potential citizens as a result of fiscal indiscipline in her government state coffers were depleted and our resources were gang raped and bastardized dating to sirleaf s administration i argue that her legacy is marked by systemic controversy some done some na done while i appreciate significant progress reforms in governance and public bureaucracy but at the average our people were robbed of their dignity and condemned to extreme poverty weah s conundrums is gbekugbeh learning from his predecessor well one would not conclude president george m weah s success or failure as he has gone nearly 2 years of his 6 years term however what seems to be vivid is the incompetence of the bureaucrats who supposedly run the day to day activities of the executive branch of government his early approach to governance was highly unorthodox positions were rewarded to his loyalists and partisans based on political reciprocity not competence as it has termed to be nevertheless mr weah has got a spectacular history to learn from mrs sirleaf vices that were ingrained in sirleaf s administration are unearthing in his government wearing reflective jackets his government is accused of massive corruption and siphoning of the state coffers for personal initiatives with a practical example of his duplexes and the jamaica resort property this accusation has triggered numerous protests in demand of accountability in the case involving the 16 billion liberian dollars that were allegedly confiscated and unaccounted and as well calls for the ministry of finance and central bank of liberia to provide findings on the expenditure of the 25 million dollars meant to mob up the economy sadly the president has remained tightlipped on these multiple accusations and the economic prosperity of his people remains a fantasy this has certainly rejuvenated the campaign to oust him from the presidency through a protest designed weah stepdown under the canopy of counsel of patriots conventional wisdom dictates that poverty and hunger cannot be compromised when the people are excessively hungry they result in demanding radical solutions to instantaneous change this has led to forceful removal heads of governments in africa and elsewhere the question of how we change the narrative remains a task to ponder there are diverse views as to how the former can be changed and the country s economic development is secured some argue that a lack of political will on the part of our leaders has increased the existing problems while others believe that liberia s problems are tied to its historical foundation and the behavioral issues mentality of the people towards the country remains structurally undeveloped as for pundits and academics they argue that the quality of leadership sets the country for progress and sustainable development the above is true for instance economic hardships are common and prevalent in weak and developing countries in asia and sub sahara africa which are caused as a result of policy failures implementation gaps and state capacity gaps however the latter can be solved and the solutions are considered sustainable when applied first the liberian government should consider effective and efficient political leadership will that enables our leaders to be deeply committed to radical economic reforms in practical terms and advance working solutions to our existing problems second the government must increase supports to public projects that will in turn attract investments and create avenues for employment and favorable policies that attract foreign investments and boom local economies third most likely the government is advised to invest in the agricultural sector which is the bedrock for economic growth and development it is the ladder used by advanced and developing economies to support economic development and macroeconomic stability lastly rule of law which drives citizens and investors confidence in the state should be uncompromised people must have trust in the system to seek redress at all time and impartial judgment is served regardless who is involved this will further ensure judicial independence to end hunger and poverty as part of sdgs 1 2 developing economy like liberia must prioritize agriculture development as a major frontier for economic development which will support human and infrastructural developments job creation for both unskilled and skilled laborers food security contribution to national income pre requisite for raw materials and as well earn valuable foreign exchange through export of our agricultural products are major advantages of the sector conclusion peace and development are intrinsically intertwined for a lasting and reliable peace to be attained it is significantly fundamental for the government to consider economic systems that can generate sustained economic growth guarantee for the mass of the people s economic prosperity and development depression or prolonged deprivation by itself is a conduit for social conflict and as well as routine protests and demonstrations against political leadership this aspect was not vividly recognized by ex liberian president mrs ellen j sirleaf critics argue that she received impressively global recognitions and accolades which did not translate practically to reconciliation and economic development of her country and people drawing from rwanda s experience in peace conflict management and prevention it s imperative that the current leadership of the country models its development framework as rwanda given that both countries share similar historical experiences in terms of conflict triggers a lesson that has resonated greatly with governance in east africa in the aspect of the presidency it s essential for the president to surround himself with a team of experts local and international comprising persons of diverse backgrounds technicians technocrats architects experienced administrators legal pundits diplomats public policy experts to review analyze evaluate and advise the president on social economic political and foreign policy issues of the country these experts will also review critically void of political maneuvering all policy issues arising from the legislature and the judiciary and well as ministries departments and agencies for the president to have an informed decision on the state of affairs doing this will restore public confidence and get the nation on track to progressive nation building we want peace
everything to know about the april 8 eclipse in atlantic canada saltwire eclipse saltwire by tom arnold london reuters after two months of political deadlock lebanon has finally designated a new prime minister to form a government now comes the hard part saving lebanon from an unprecedented financial crisis nominated with the support of iran backed hezbollah and its allies prime minister designate hassan diab and the cabinet he has vowed to form quickly must win over investors and foreign donors related stories what are the main concerns for investors as lebanon grapples with a hard currency shortage a huge public debt and a weakening currency how likely is a debt default or restructuring lebanon s public debt burden equivalent to around 150 of gdp and its twin current account and fiscal deficits looked unsustainable even before anti government protesters took to the streets two months ago lebanon will face a test of its ability to meet its obligations in 2020 with 10 9 billion of debt maturing across the year including a 1 2 billion eurobond due in march refinitiv data shows the international sovereign bonds continue to trade at less than half their face value while credit default swaps have rocketed suggesting lebanon may be drifting towards a default but that might not be a given a combination of fiscal reforms and a restructuring of the domestic debt could be enough to put public finances on a sustainable footing without having to resort to an external default farouk soussa senior economist at goldman sachs said in a note this week and even if a default does occur lebanon might be able to cushion the fallout central bank holdings of government securities implied that lebanon had near term debt management options that would limit losses borne by the private sector in the event of a default moody s investors service said in a note is a currency devaluation a given lebanon s 22 year old peg to the u s dollar has been strained to near breaking point by the country s political and banking crisis with the pound losing roughly a third of its official value on the black market a devaluation has loomed increasingly large central bank governor riad salameh governor has ruled out any such move saying the government has the means to maintain it but without a revival in sagging capital flows and a recovery in lebanon s external balance sheet the central bank s ability to defend the peg will diminish foreign exchange reserves have already dwindled to 28 billion according to goldman sachs economists say at least in the short term a devaluation could be harmful as it would push up lebanon s already steep overseas liabilities hastening the risk of a default it would also likely stoke inflation at 1 3 year on year in october how can the banking system be revived banks have long served as a vital cog in keeping lebanon s economy moving by taking deposits from lebanon s millions of scattered diaspora and snapping up the government s local debt banks helped prop up the state s finances but that system has broken as foreign deposits dry up amid a collapse in confidence in the banking system non resident deposits in the banking sector fell by 5 2 on an annual basis in october while lebanon faces a hard currency shortage leaving lebanese at home and abroad with restricted access to their bank funds restoring confidence in the financial system needs to include restoring confidence in the political management of the system this is a financial translation of what thousands in the streets of lebanon have been demanding said walid alameddine former chairman of lebanon s banking control commission and a recent former candidate to be prime minister depositor haircuts would be counter productive alameddine warns instead banking deposits should be guaranteed by the state to help restore confidence what about securing foreign financial support lebanon is mired in recession and its recovery remains largely dependent on diab s ability to form a new government and make reforms needed to secure overseas financial support lebanon won pledges of over 11 billion at an international conference last year conditional on reforms that it has so far failed to implement further support appears uncertain given diab s support from iran backed hezbollah and its allies saudi arabia and the united arab emirates which have provided financial aid to lebanon in the past have appeared more circumspect during the latest crisis and may be even less willing to stump up with diab in power instead lebanon may look to qatar accused by its gulf neighbors of more closely aligning itself with iran qatar will stand by lebanon during its economic crisis qatari finance minister ali al emadi said this week lebanon s now departed caretaker prime minister saad al hariri had been discussing the possibility of technical assistance from the international monetary fund and world bank but it is unclear whether diab will pursue such a path and some observers warn the united states the largest financial backer of those institutions could oppose any deal due to the role of hezbollah and its allies in designating diab washington regards hezbollah as a terrorist group additional reporting by tom perry in beirut editing by william maclean
2019 did not offer any great surprises or black swans but the fragile world order did move further down the path of unraveling 2020 will likely bear more resemblance to the 1930s as some of the developments which did not reach a denouement in the past year cross the finish line several simmering conflicts symptoms of a global system under strain from us president donald j trump s anti globalist america first doctrine could well reach breakpoints in 2020 this may include a shift from the mere corroding of multilateral institutions and us alliances toward total dysfunction growing global populist and nationalist outbursts are likely to dampen the potential for global cooperation despite authoritarians facing more pressure from their citizens 2020 could also see us allies and partners continuing to move beyond just hedging against us uncertainty towards pursuing global diplomacy and establishing new institutions without the united states following a potential trump reelection here are ten of the top geopolitical risks to watch out for in 2020 2020 elections either a trump reelection or a victory for a democratic challenger is bound to deepen us political tribalism a trump victory would set the united states up for four more years of withdrawal from the multilateral world order while a narrow trump loss could cause domestic political turmoil a victory for the democrats could also fuel uncertainty and fierce opposition over a potential wealth tax more regulations on business and an overhaul of the health system perhaps sparking fierce reaction from markets it is also not a given that a democratic victory fully reverses the tendency of the united states to retreat from engagement across the world trump win 60 40 probability brexit will finally occur in the wake of the massive tory victory by british prime minister boris johnson over labour and the liberal democrats the uk will be out of the eu by january 31 but it is less clear whether the december 31 2020 deadline for completion of a uk eu trade deal can be met johnson wants to rule out any extension of the brexit process with the risk that the uk departs the single market without any trade deal the eu led by france and germany are increasingly wary of a uk which tries to undercut the single market by not adhering to the same environmental labor and other standards trump has promised quick movement towards a us uk trade deal but will johnson want to pay the price opening the gates to cheap us agricultural goods could undermine tory base support and stir public anger a quick win on a deal with washington isn t likely to compensate for uncertainty over talks with brussels as the uk trades more with the eu than elsewhere over the long run brexit may lead to the breakup of the united kingdom as the scottish nationalist party swept the tories into dust and more irish nationalist mps were elected in northern ireland than the democratic unionist party dup a uk eu free trade deal could end up formalizing the irish sea as the border between the two trade zones probability of uk eu trade deal by end of 2020 50 50 with much less probability 25 percent for uk us deal in 2020 given the political problems of passing any trade deal in a presidential election year the great unraveling with the demise of its dispute mechanism the world trade organization the lynchpin of seventy years of prosperity and a rules based economic order may also become defunct in the best case after a lapse of six to twenty four months an arbitration mechanism with a much reduced mandate and a reformed but also diminished in scope and authority wto may emerge as global supply chains erode in any case universal rules and enforcement will be less important in shaping the terms of trade than the size and power of major economies these large countries using their market size to weaponize trade via tariffs will play a larger role in setting terms of trade meanwhile preferential trade arrangements bilateral e g eu japan eu asean and multilateral comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership regional comprehensive economic partnership eurasian union will take on more importance in shaping rules the latter group often excluding the united states could become the new normal for global trade probability 60 40 a bifurcated world despite a modest us china trade war pause the decoupling of the world s two largest economies amid growing techno nationalism on both sides is driving a new global economic dynamic the main elements of beijing s predatory mercantilism substantive subsidies to state owned enterprises and national champions digital sovereignty in pursuit of made in china 2025 and economic coercion of foreign investors remains largely undiluted washington is seeking to disrupt supply chains linking the united states and china cutting off investment scientific exchanges and tech exports and imports from china decoupling will occur largely in the telecom 5g and electronics it sectors and sensitive national security related industries resulting in a fragmented internet and e commerce the disruption in global innovation and supply chains will render washington s indo pacific policy problematic the fact that only three of sixty one nations complied with the united states request to cut ties to huawei offers a preview of the costs to the united states of a bifurcated global economy after all china is the number one trading partner of all us asian allies and partners and a top trading partner with the eu and many latin american nations probability of bifurcated world 60 40 north korean defiance whether or not trump agrees to another summit with north korean leader kim jong un it will become clear in 2020 that kim has made a strategic choice he has no intention despite us incentives to dismantle his nuclear arsenal in the foreseeable future this is increasingly evident as he continues his ballistic missiles and nuclear tests thirteen sets of ballistic missiles tests since may and an icbm test is likely soon twenty five years of denuclearization diplomacy has run its course exhausting all genuine possible nuclear free end states kim pursues the new path he warned of in his end of year ultimatum kim s goal is to be a de facto nuclear state like israel or pakistan to be accepted as a normal nation kim prefers a muddle through north korean model accelerating cybercrime to accumulate bitcoins and other illicit activities boosting ties to russia and china who are eroding sanctions and incrementally building economic cooperation with south korea trump feeling humiliated that his bromance was betrayed has initially pretended that all is well kim is my friend we re in no rush but soon will come the wrath of fire and fury threatening confrontation with a serious risk of conflict sparked by miscalculation with diminishing chinese and russian cooperation maximum pressure is of limited utility war remains an unthinkable catastrophic option and mutual deterrence needs to hold next phase how to live with a nuclear north korea end of denuclearization diplomacy 65 35 nuclear stability unravels the new start and open skies agreements follow a trump pattern of withdrawing from globalist treaties thus the united states is ending the architecture of restraint and starting a hobbesian world of all against all un learning the lessons from the cold war of avoiding an arms race this is happening at a moment when new risks to crisis stability secure second strikes are growing from non nuclear emerging technologies ai offensive cyber anti space weapons and hypersonic missiles the nuclear doomsday clock stands at two minutes to midnight probability 60 40 demise of us traditional alliances the global leadership deficit grows in a fragmenting world order ad hoc regional security networks are taking shape by key partners in asia and europe with his impulses unchecked trump s narrow transactional view of alliances may lead him in 2020 to bring the boys home withdrawing at least 6 000 troops and unwinding the us republic of korea alliance a similar dynamic threatens the us japan alliance with tokyo building ties to new economic and security partners the european union in the wake of the perceived success of its data privacy protection legislation trump s ceaseless disparaging and beijing s efforts to use economic enticements to split off eastern europe will accelerate moves to protect its economic and political sovereignty against the united states and china end of us rok alliance probability 50 50 strong department of defense and congressional pushback nuclear proliferation north korea is making new strides toward becoming like accepted de facto nuclear states israel and pakistan reflecting a growing pattern of us retreat and unreliability this will lead us allies and partners to rethink us security guarantees the republic of korea and australia already pondering nukes may move to the next stage of actively considering them in 2020 as may japan if the iran nuclear crisis is not resolved expect the saudis to buy or rent a nuke from pakistan active moves toward asian middle east proliferation 40 60 post us middle east trends already percolating with saudi gulf cooperation council backchannel diplomacy with iran evolve toward a new regional balance of power and recalibrated saudi iran rivalry spurred by trump s non response to iranian belligerence and us incoherence in syria as well as a need to end the war in yemen and stabilize syria regional actors become more pro active with russian president vladimir putin as a power broker and a more active eu diplomacy similarly after more sturm and drang with a possible us iran clash by miscalculation the eu and putin facilitate a new iran nuclear deal 2 0 a la nafta 2 0 with longer sunset provisions and missile constraints trump calls it a great deal at the same time reactions to iranian overreach with anti iran protests in iraq lebanon and internally against the khamenei regime help to push tehran toward a new deal limiting their regional influence and dampening populist driven change in the middle east probability 55 45 gray swan a china reckoning world financial crisis a perfect storm involving a simultaneous slowdown in the three economic centers could catapult the global economy into another deep economic crisis china s internal contradictions are growing including massive public household and corporate debt 300 percent of gross domestic product aging demographics labor shortages pension and healthcare demands and sagging growth two to three percent in real terms the united states also suffers from growing debt problem at the federal government level plus substantial corporate debt at a time of record low interest rates the us federal reserve worries its fiscal and monetary instruments may not be up to the job for dealing with even just a recession equally slowing growth and the eu s divisions in the wake of its uneven recovery from the 2008 financial meltdown make it an unlikely candidate to pull the world out of a recession this would be more dangerous than 2008 as central bank cooperation and us congressional action are more problematic probability of a world financial crisis in 2020 35 65 robert a manning is

opinion i have argued that in sub sahara africa most demonstrations protests and mass citizens actions are deeply attributed to rant seeking political corruption marginalization mismanagement malfeasances pronounced deprivation of wellbeing and unequal distribution of resources on the part of the political leaderships of the continent these several of menaces have harnessed and continue to midwife civil conflicts in most part of africa here i would build a comparative analysis between liberia and rwanda given the conspicuous similarities of both countries gloomy historical past like liberia rwanda experienced a dreadful historic genocide that owned the lives of about 1 million rwandans including women and children of the tutsi minority tribe and moderate hutus this happened as a result of what i have mentioned above the rwandan nation was completely paralyzed and failed world bank then referred to the country as nonviable the war had obliterated virtually everything most competent bureaucrats had been killed or fled and looters had stripped government offices down to the last piece of paper all government institutions were looted and vandalized when the post conflict government of national unity had taken charge in july 1994 the country had no running water and little electricity the new president kagame had no idea either did his colleagues have much expertise or institutional knowledge to draw on in reconsolidating the broken fabrics of the rwandan society before the genocide the country had about eight hundred judges but fewer had survived the mass slaughter as mentioned today rwanda s case is completely different as the country has buckled its belt for governance and human capital investment it has transitioned from hopelessness to hopefulness and is now considered as the singapore of africa within twenty five years less than what was projected for rwanda to re establish itself as a sovereign country and positive member of the comity of nations

markets have put in a very creditable performance for 2019 it is one that will be hard to repeat in 2020 said ajay rajadhyaksha head of macro research at barclays most stock indexes covered by reuters in the latest global poll were forecast to make single digit gains in 2020 major government bond yields meanwhile were not expected to rebound from their latest lows looking ahead monetary policy largesse over the past decade increases the risks of a disorderly rise in bond yields and could also amplify a policy mistake and or increase the risks of monetary policy impotence noted bofa s quinlan higher debt levels have failed to deliver stronger growth he added even global property prices with a few notable exceptions have put in a dull or no response to the latest round of central bank easing housing market experts are not optimistic about any kind of major rebound in the coming year and in the foreign exchange market the u s dollar s reign was forecast to continue despite diminishing returns from the most overcrowded trade of 2019 the dollar has been persistently strong even this year it has continued to eke out a small gain despite the fact that the fed has cut rates

the days of a strong dollar look as if they re coming to an end and not a moment too soon if the dollar does weaken we may finally see the kind of durable and robust growth that the u s has only had in fits and starts since the financial crisis ended let s tick off a few of the events that should figure in a weakening dollar the federal reserve has given indications that it will wait for a truly hot labor market before raising rates the resounding election victory of conservatives in the u k gives clarity on brexit leading to a stronger pound and the u s and china may be getting closer to putting together terms for a trade deal the dollar s surge began in july 2014 seven months after the fed started winding down the quantitative easing program it used to battle the great recession that shift changed the focus of market participants to when the fed would begin increasing the fed funds rate from roughly zero where it had sat since the financial crisis at its june 2014 meeting the fed s dot plot showed that members of the federal open market committee projected that the central bank would raise interest rates three or four times in 2015 anticipation of tighter monetary policy when the rest of the world s economies were still weak with their central banks holding interest rates near zero and steady led to a 25 rally in the dollar in the next 18 months coinciding with that rise was a collapse in the price of commodities such as oil economic turmoil in emerging markets and a slump in global manufacturing this foiled the plans of fed policy makers who believed they saw signs of full employment and inflation as early as 2014 due in part to the strength of the dollar and weakness in commodities and commodity related industries the fed s preferred measure of inflation grew 1 7 year over year in july 2014 but by december 2015 it had declined to only 1 1 year over year well below the central bank s inflation target of 2 the global recovery that began in early 2016 started to reverse the dollar s gains but the approval in the u k of the referendum to leave the european union that june led to a significant decline the british pound creating fresh demand for the dollar as a safe haven meanwhile starting in 2015 and continuing through late 2018 the fed raised interest rates from a little more than zero to 2 5 making u s assets more desirable and increasing demand for dollars to invest in them and then in 2017 president donald trump embarked on a trade war with china leading to a new round of dollar strengthening and slowing inflation if the dynamics buoying the dollar during the past five years have been overly hawkish monetary policy brexit uncertainty and the repercussions of the trade war then it now look as if we re in a new environment where the dollar may finally move lower and that could be the impetus that pushes the global economy into higher gear in 2020 large moves in the dollar have multiplying effects a strong dollar tends to push down commodity prices weaken growth in emerging markets create disinflation in the u s and make american workers and industries less competitive in the global market a weak dollar does the opposite a rebound in commodity prices could contribute to a new cycle of global investment higher import prices should put upward pressure on domestic prices helping the fed hit its 2 inflation target a weaker dollar also would make u s products more competitive on world markets and lift wage growth closer to 4 a level it reached during the last two economic expansions but not in this one most of the economic expansion during the past decade has been accompanied by one or more drags on growth whether it was corporations and consumers paying down debt and government austerity early on or the trade wars more recently but now more pieces are falling into place for the dollar to weaken amid fed willingness to let the economy run hot for a change more certainty that brexit will come about and the lowering of trade tensions amid that backdrop the u s is in a good position to return to a more consistent growth environment source bloomberg

territory said gain capital s fiona cincotta the pound was quoted at usd1 3051 at the london equities close up from usd1 3015 late thursday after a large majority of members of parliament backed uk prime minister boris johnson s brexit deal however sterling is down 2 1 since the euphoric highs reached last friday in the wake of the conservative party s general election win the second reading of the eu withdrawal agreement bill was passed by 358 votes to 234 majority 124 the move came after johnson insisted leave and remain labels were now defunct and the country should move on ahead of the scheduled eu exit on january 31 the pm urged parliament to come together and allow the warmth and natural affection that we all share for the uk s european neighbours to find renewed expression in one great new national project the conservative s substantial majority over labour meant the deal was passed with relative ease which was a stark contrast to johnson s predecessor theresa may whose attempt to get her own brexit deal through parliament was stifled at every turn analysts at capital economics commented what s different now is that the eu can t rely on the uk parliament to kick the can down the road but it may be the case that some kind of arrangement can be reached in which there is a nominal goods trade deal by 31 december 2020 but that other aspects can be decided later and in the meantime the status quo is maintained either way the mere fear of something like a no deal on 31 december 2020 will probably mean that the rebound in business investment in 2020 will be fairly small so in that sense brexit uncertainty will continue to restrain gdp growth that said the economy will still probably improve in 2020 due to the effects of a fiscal stimulus but that probably won t be enough to warrant higher interest rates in 2020 or a pound higher than usd1 35 meanwhile andrew bailey became the 121st man to take over at the bank of england since it was founded in 1694 succeeding the outgoing governor mark carney whose term is due to expire in march bailey was appointed by the uk government but the central bank was granted operational independence from parliament in 1997 chancellor sajid javid insisted this would remain under bailey the confirmation that andrew bailey will take over from mark carney as governor of the bank of england on 16 march 2020 doesn t change the outlook for monetary policy but bailey will face many challenges during his eight year term such as navigating the choppy waters of brexit and dealing with the next downturn with not much

by don lee los angeles times washington d c the house of representatives on thursday overwhelmingly passed the new north american trade deal voting in unusually bipartisan fashion just a day after impeaching president donald trump strictly on party lines approval of the trade bill which now goes to the senate for almost certain ratification did far more than help trump notch a major achievement it marked a significant change in u s economic strategy toward the rest of the world for much of the last 70 years throughout the cold war and down to more recent times washington used america s vast wealth and economic power to build friendships and alliances that bolstered national security that strategy included a fundamental commitment to free trade opening the large u s market to products from all over the world for the most part american companies and their workers had to compete against foreign businesses and labor with little or no protection from the federal government as trump has long complained that free trade policy cost millions of american jobs but leaders of both parties and economic experts considered it worth the price because it boosted american growth generating many new jobs and opened new opportunities for many u s companies to profit in a global economy at the same time it helped cement u s leadership in the world in the post world war ii era we were so much more powerful and so much richer than everybody else that we could improve the living standards at home and still give away the store on trade said clyde prestowitz a former top trade negotiator in president ronald reagan s administration and we re now culminated at a moment in which the cost of our old policy is really hard to bear and so we re de facto changing our policy he said the march toward free global markets with lower tariffs and other barriers always had exceptions beginning in the 1970s u s companies began to complain about unfair competition dumping of textiles and steel by foreign producers subsidized by their governments for instance or the sale of below cost television sets electronics and other consumer goods reagan and his successors responded to these complaints with demands for import quotas and other measures but overall the united states remained committed to a broad strategy of free trade relying on market forces and competition to determine outcomes while republican business leaders complained about specific instances of what they saw as unfair tactics such as currency manipulation and intellectual property theft they largely remained committed to the overall free trade strategy democrats responding to their union supporters complained that american workers were paying a heavy price for a system that primarily benefited corporations and upper income americans the original north american free trade agreement which passed the house in 1993 by only 34 votes highlighted the political unease about trade the agreement however fit squarely into that strategy of using trade in part for geopolitical reasons it aimed to make mexico more prosperous and hence make the united states more secure at a time when radical leftist regimes seemed to be on the rise in latin america economically many saw it as a bulwark against rising competition from a unified europe and asian tiger economies nafta tore down tariffs and shaped north america into a powerful economic bloc three way trade in goods now reaches 1 3 trillion but it was in many ways outdated in a global economy driven much more by technology and data trump long attacked nafta calling it one of the worst trade agreements ever and promising to renegotiate it as president he has attacked the whole system of free trade undermining the world trade organization which the u s helped create in the 1990s and starting trade wars not only with china but with longtime u s allies such as europe canada and mexico he has enjoyed quiet but significant democratic support on the issue witness the large bipartisan majority for the new version of nafta renamed united states mexico canada agreement or usmca the measure won approval by the democratic majority house 385 41 a remarkable show of unity at a time of deep partisan acrimony not that there wasn t the usual jostling and one upmanship that have characterized relations between congressional democrats and trump of course we ll take credit for it because what he proposed did not fill the bill of what he described house speaker nancy pelosi said shortly before the vote referring to democrats successful pressure on the administration to amend the trade deal to strengthen enforcement of labor and environmental protections earlier wednesday night at a rally in battle creek mich trump insisted that pelosi and other democrats had no choice but to pass usmca she had a lot of pressure especially from manufacturing areas farm areas a lot of pressure to sign it i had a lot of union labor vote for me tremendous amount of labor he said the final trade agreement came with the support of organized labor s main umbrella group and most business groups rare for a trade deal under any circumstances usmca has new chapters on areas like digital trade and e commerce as well as updated rules on auto production and tougher labor enforcement but the more important parts of the agreement may be those that signal a shift away from the long standing ideology of free trade and toward an embrace of more managed trade the new agreement has quotas on auto exports for example and a provision that allows the u s to pull out of the accord if canada or mexico should cut a free trade deal with a nonmarket economy namely china you re trying to manage the trade not only of your own country but of others it s an imperialistic form of managed trade said james bacchus a former democratic member of congress and ex chairman of the appellate body of the wto the canadians and the mexicans he said have agreed to a lot of these provisions only because they fear the alternative that president trump will pull out of nafta on the whole usmca is not the kind of sweeping game changing deal that trump often boasted he would produce indeed it was quietly negotiated over many months by just the kind of professional economists and diplomats that the president often scorns and the negotiations were largely free of the seesawing white house position shifts and twitter storms that have marked trump s trade war with china analysts say trump s chief trade official robert lighthizer deserves credit for rewriting the quarter century old nafta and building a broad coalition to get it done mickey kantor the u s trade representative under president bill clinton who completed the nafta negotiations in 1993 lauded the trump administration for updating nafta and in particular strengthening enforcement at the same time he was concerned about trump s pull away from open trade and the multilateral trading order established under american leadership early on kantor agreed america did give up markets in order to power some countries because it served larger foreign policy interests but even then trade policy was about much more than that it was jobs economic security and also building bridges to other countries he said so you have multiple reasons for doing it and multiple reasons for going forward because it makes a difference but said prestowitz the approval of the new agreement illustrates how on both the left and right agreement has grown that the time had come to change u s trade strategy this is bigger than trump he said when american industry is relatively much less competitive when we ve seen a dramatic increase in the gap between the wealthy and the poor and the middle class in the u s all of that was kind of a perfect stew we re in a new era of trade

world bank officials warn that developing country debt has piled up bigger and faster than in any period of the last fifty years and could come crashing down on a fragile global economy a world bank report published thursday pdf highlights the striking surge in debt in emerging markets and developing economies emdes which report authors call the largest fastest and most broad based in emdes in the past 50 years debt in these countries has hit an all time high of 168 percent of gdp or around 55 trillion driven by extremely low borrowing costs global waves of debt which looked at the four major bouts of debt growth since 1970 found that the debt to gdp ratio of emdes climbed by 54 percentage points since 2010 which is nearly three times as fast as during the latin america debt crisis the report also notes that debt levels in low income countries a subset of emdes climbed to 67 percent of gdp 268 billion in 2018 up from 48 percent of gdp around 137 billion just nine years ago the size speed and breadth of the latest debt wave should concern us all world bank president david malpass said in a statement clearly it s time for course corrections world bank president david malpass looks on during a press conference at the world bank office in new delhi on oct 26 2019 sajjad hussain afp getty images will history repeat itself the report warns that the mammoth wave of debt in combination with other risk factors could cause history to repeat itself and culminate in financial crises in these economies in addition to their rapid debt buildup they have accumulated other vulnerabilities such as growing fiscal and current account deficits and a shift toward a riskier composition of debt the study states thus despite exceptionally low real interest rates and prospects for continued low rates in the near term the current wave of debt accumulation could follow the historical pattern and culminate in financial crises in these economies the study noted that countries that experienced debt related crises in past episodes of debt accumulation had a toxic mix of unsustainable macroeconomic policies along with structural and institutional weaknesses many of these economies had severe weaknesses in their fiscal and monetary policy frameworks including poor revenue collection widespread tax evasion public wage and pension indexing monetary financing of fiscal deficits and substantial use of energy and food subsidies the authors wrote in addition crisis countries often borrowed in foreign currency and managed their exchange rates while regulation and supervision of banks and other financial institutions were frequently weak political uncertainty was another problem hot spot in several emerging market countries that suffered past debt related crises a way out the world bank head called for improvements to how leaders in affected countries manage debt history shows that large debt surges often coincide with financial crises in developing countries at great cost to the population said ceyla pazarbasioglu the world bank group s vice president for equitable growth finance and institutions policymakers should act promptly to enhance debt sustainability and reduce exposure to economic shocks the world bank head called for improvements to how leaders in affected countries manage debt it underscores why debt management and transparency need to be top priorities for policymakers so they can increase growth and investment and ensure that the debt they take on contributes to better development outcomes for the people malpass said areas for action include improved tax collection and tighter fiscal rules to manage spending the world bank said towering though it may seem the latest global wave of debt can be managed malpass said in the report but leaders need to recognize the danger and move countries into safer territory in terms of the quality and quantity of investment and debt sooner rather than later while the study authors noted that there is no magic bullet of a policy prescription that would prevent the current debt wave from crashing down destructively they identified four areas for improvement these areas are enhanced debt management and transparency more robust monetary exchange rate and fiscal policy frameworks proactive financial sector regulation and supervision and effective public finance management in combination with sound bankruptcy frameworks and policies that promote good corporate governance the world bank noted that while the prescribed policy mix should depend on the specifics of a given country the experience of past waves of debt points to the critical role of policy choices in determining the outcomes of these episodes

in the sea of 2020 predictions saxo bank s outrageous predictions sail their own very unique course for nearly 20 years the danish investment bank has had its experts take a hard look at the coming year to create the very conversation which is difficult because today s world has become too partisan and intolerant according to the bank s chief investment officer steen jakobsen for 2020 the overriding theme from its experts is disruption the year could represent one big pendulum swing to opposites in politics monetary and fiscal policy and not least the environment says mr jakobsen saxo describes the current paradigm as simply at the end of the road because extending the last decade s trend into the future would mean a society at war with itself markets replaced by government only monopolies as the only business model and an utterly partisan and atomised public forum for news and information where lies deceit and spin mean there is no ability to agree on basic truths and best practices of its ten outrageous predictions for 2020 three stand out for their relevance to world trade commodities and shipping head of equity strategy peter garnry opens his prediction with the bold assertion that in energy green is not the new black he notes that the traditional fossil fuel industry peaked in 2014 and has since been transformed by two powerful forces the first was the combination of the rapid arrival of us shale gas globalised lng supply chains and the advent of us shale oil which saw the us become the world s largest oil and petroleum liquids producer the second has been the climate change movement and a concomitant surge in demand for renewable energy these factors have led to lower equity valuations for black energy companies putting them at a 23 discount to clean energy companies in 2020 we see the tables turning for the investment outlook as opec extends production cuts unprofitable us shale outfits slow output growth and demand rises from asia once again predicts mr garnry the surprising winner of this will be the oil and gas industry while the clean energy industry will suffer a wake up call america first tax john hardy s outrageous prediction lands a punch on president trump and his trade policies serving as the head of fx strategy at saxo mr hardy forecasts the enforcement of an america first tax to reduce the us trade deficit while 2020 might start with reasonable stability on the trade policy front china and the trump administration have already reached a temporary agreement on tariffs this is unlikely to last long in mr hardy s eyes he sees the us economy struggling for air early in 2020 as us trade deficits with china stagnate and chinese purchases of agricultural products are maxed out eyeing polls showing a resounding defeat in the 2020 us presidential election trump quickly grows restive and his administration drums up a new approach in a last ditch effort to steal back the protectionist narrative the america first tax foresees mr hardy the fictious tax sees a complete reconstruction of the us corporate tax schedule to favour us based production under the claimed principles of fair and free trade all existing tariffs will be cancelled to be replaced by a flat value added tax of 25 on all gross revenues in the us market that are sourced from foreign production this brings stinging protests from trading partners for what is really just old tariffs in new clothes but the administration counters that foreign companies are welcome to shift their production to the us to avoid the tax says mr hardy furthermore the administration claims that the fair and free portion of the new america first tax is that the 20 rate is indexed to the size of the us trade deficit as a of gdp and would fall to 5 in the event the us moves into a trade surplus an immediate consequence of the new tax would be a sudden scramble to re site production to the us and a direct hit on global trade with the us demise of the dollar singapore based kay van petersen saxo s global macro strategist used his prediction to focus on asia s desire to shift away from us dollar dependence he foresees the launch of a new reserve currency in asia in the form of an aiib backed digital reserve currency that takes the us dollar index down by 20 he explains that the us dollar s rank as the world s chief reserve currency has long been a double edged sword both for the us and for the rising star of china it s now outliving its usefulness as a reserve currency for the region to confront a deepening trade rivalry and vulnerabilities from rising us threats to weaponise the us dollar and its control of global finances the asian infrastructure investment bank creates a new reserve asset called the asian drawing right or adr with 1 adr equivalent to 2 us dollars making the adr the world s largest currency unit mr van petersen predicts the new currency will be powered by blockchain technology with regional central bank reserves injected with the reserve currency it wouldn t be a publicly tradable currency but instead represents a basket of currencies and gold with the chinese renminbi heavily prominent in the mix and the us dollar weighted at below 20 the move is clearly aimed at de dollarising regional trade says mr van petersen the upshot of the arrival of the new currency is that local economies multilaterally agree to begin conducting all trade in the region in adrs only with major oil exporters russia and the opec nations happy to sign up due to their growing reliance on the asian market export revenues received in adr can be converted back into local currencies by central banks and a deepening market of adr based bonds and other financial instruments also secured on the blockchain deepens the liquidity and trust in adrs as a reliable asset he adds this scenario has a grave impact on the us dollar which weakens by 20 against the adr within months in 2020 and hits the dollar

by lucia mutikani washington reuters u s economic growth nudged up in the third quarter and the economy appears to have maintained the moderate pace of expansion as the year ended supported by a strong labor market other data on friday showed consumer spending increased solidly in november adding to a string of upbeat data that have helped to quell recession fears which gripped financial

as a 2 3 pace growth has slowed from the 3 1 rate notched in the first three months of the year in part because of the 17 month trade war between the united states and china and the fading stimulus

of measures to open up its economy after the collapse of former benefactor the soviet union while trying to cushion the blow to citizens and national industry while the system helped cuba get through the shock of the soviet collapse it ended up also distorting the economy and hiding the real economic situation productivity and competitiveness of state run companies and favoring imports instead of exports adios to convertible peso the government says it will eliminate the convertible peso and leave the peso as the only currency and has already taken important steps in that direction larger peso bills denominated at 200 500 and 1 000 are now in circulation previously 100 pesos was the highest denomination thousands of state run retail outlets now price items in pesos as well as cuc and cash

only in pesos hello dollar cuba banned the dollar as legal tender in 2003 after the united states hiked sanctions on its use of the greenback but in october the government began opening stores that sell appliances car parts and other items for dollars though only with a bank card raising the possibility the u s currency will be used at least electronically once the convertible peso is taken out

bringing the fixed official 1 1 and 1 24 public exchange rates more in line with each other and their true value will be difficult especially given the government s pledge that consumers will not be hurt an impossibility according to many local and foreign economists they say fixing the exchange rates will inevitably cause inflation and reveal just how unproductive and bankrupt many state run

international they come from the countryside from the villages from the capital city or from neighboring countries energetic ambitious full of hope that they ll find jobs and a community and better lives few find what they come for yet they keep coming not to london or new york but to lagos the nigerian urban sprawl that s an unrivaled magnet for people in africa or anywhere a city of less than 1 5 million in 1970 lagos is growing so fast that population estimates vary by more than 10 million the lagos bureau of statistics says it s 26 million now the federal government says it s 21 million and international institutions put it at around 15 to 16 million by the end of the century lagos will grow to 88 million making it the world s largest city according to the university of toronto s global cities institute nigeria could be the third largest country by then with a housing deficit of 2 5 million units more than two thirds of lagos s residents live in slums that are among the least hospitable on earth according to leilani farha the united nations special rapporteur on housing people are living in some of the worst if not the worst conditions i ve seen in the world and i ve been to all the big slums in india kenya south africa farha said during a visit to the country in september while most government officials agree the affordable housing shortage is a crisis they have little idea how to respond the aim of making housing readily available accessible and affordable for the low and middle income earners who form the bulk of our citizenry had always been challenged by the ever growing population of the state moruf akinderu fatai the lagos state commissioner for housing said in a dec 8 speech we see many people trooping into lagos in search of economic opportunities on a daily basis with no intention of going back new apartment towers are rising in lagos but they re intended for foreign oil workers and the small group of nigerians who can obtain mortgages or afford to pay cash not the families crowded into crumbling units with seven to a room and limited access to clean water and sanitation developers focus on high end units amid a shortage of affordable housing mirrors that of builders in cities around the world from berlin to london to new york and hong kong boats are seen at the five cowries terminal as uber launches boat service in lagos the most ambitious project is eko atlantic a city within a city that s being built on a lower manhattan sized stretch of land reclaimed from the atlantic ocean its builders plan a boulevard modeled on paris s champs élysées and it will house around 250 000 people in luxury apartments while the u s will move its lagos consulate there with vast oil and mineral wealth nigeria has the 29th largest economy in the world just behind norway s while africa s richest man aliko dangote mainly lives in lagos nigeria also has the highest number of people classified as extremely poor defined as living on 1 90 or less per day at about 87 million of the country s 200 million residents according to the brookings institution even for nigeria s emerging middle class there are few options kalu ndukwe a water plant engineer was desperate to find a new home for his family his landlord failed to make repairs and his apartment was plagued with leaks he can earn as much as 580 000 naira 1 600 per month which would put him in roughly the top third of the population in salary though as a freelancer his pay is inconsistent many challenges he paid an agent for a three bedroom flat on the western edge of nigeria s and africa s biggest city when he arrived with his wife and three children someone else was already living there he managed to get a refund but his troubles continued when the owner of the next property rejected him because he was from the wrong ethnic group there were so many challenges said ndukwe 40 after two years ndukwe found a home he and his family liked and had a landlord who like him was an igbo the rent was 500 000 naira a year and he had to give the agent a 50 commission and pay for the whole year in advance which actually represents an improvement in lagos where landlords used to commonly demand two or even three years up front lagos is one of the fastest growing cities in sub saharan africa and so far the only one of more than 10 million the threshold for a megacity though several others including kinshasa in dr congo luanda in angola and johannesburg in south africa aren t far behind for proponents of faster economic development this should be a sign that africa is finally getting its chance to catch up to the developed world but even as urbanization accelerates and third world megacities proliferate it s no longer a direct route to greater prosperity and the rise of a middle class that it was when industrial revolutions swept europe and north america in the 19th century or transformed the economies of countries such as south korea and china in the 20th members of the gkb academy a unicycle club juggle while balancing on their unicycles during a training session in lagos to serve as engines of greater productivity and development cities need affordable housing reliable public transportation public health services education and other basic services without those megacities impede economic growth rather than promote it all of these together help make cities more productive engines of economic growth said shlomo angel a professor of city planning at new york university one of the setbacks in lagos is that the economy is fragmented it s not integrated people live in small communities so without decent transportation or housing the number of jobs you can reach is based on how far they can walk continued failure to provide adequate housing sanitation and transportation robs nigeria of its greatest resource its human capital nigeria has such a vibrant culture said meredith preston mcghie secretary general of the global centre for pluralism they are artists and musicians and entrepreneurs and they are full of energy in the right conditions they are a formidable workforce for foreign investors particularly those wanting to sell consumer goods nigeria s young rapidly growing population of 200 million should be a major attraction but many are put off by the poor infrastructure including the scarcity of housing investors won t come if housing isn t available for their workers they ll just bypass nigeria said marja hoek smit the founder of the international housing finance program at the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania and who s worked extensively in africa economic growth is very affected by this lack of affordable housing it means cities are a mess inefficient and costly to live in that ultimately means industrialists have to pay more for labor government programs most government efforts so far have been designed to help people buy homes with government mortgages few could qualify because a 30 down payment was required for the 10 year loan according to akinderu fatai in a speech this month so the government introduced a rent to own program the prospective homeowners make only a 5 down payment take possession and pay up the remaining balance with as little interest as possible as rent towards the ownership of the property over a period of 10 years akinderu fatai said file photo a man walks past an advertising poster for mtn on a street in lagos nigeria very few nigerians have access to home loans from banks there are only around 50 000 home mortgages in the entire country and with nigerian inflation in double digits most lenders that do provide home loans charge at least 20 according to a nigerian central bank survey if you don t have normal access to finance you won t get mass development of housing says wharton s hoek smit developers are not going to build if they can t sell upon finishing buildings the world bank estimates nigeria has a deficit of 17 million housing units one of the largest globally it would cost around 363 billion to build that many homes according to the centre for affordable housing finance in africa a johannesburg based think tank the government should begin with the basics said the u n s farha it should prioritize improving informal settlements by giving people the right to live there and upgrading infrastructure she said that way they would lose their fear of being evicted by police who regularly raze slums and invest in their communities they would be quite happy to band together and put up a roof and a wall and build a drain

this article is more than 4 years old president donald trump speaks during a keep america great rally at kellogg arena december 18 2019 in battle creek michigan jeff kowalsky afp via getty images the dangers of trump are like the dangers of recession we were warned about all year nonexistent there is no recession on its way in 2020 only the perennial bears believe this now recession 2020 calls are now as lame as that 1970s rankin bass animatronic character baby new year who was also on his way just like the economic end times when the clock struck midnight on december 31 global manufacturing activity is stabilizing growth is soft but central banks around the world are cutting interest rates barclays capital is not only forecasting just under 2 growth in 2020 but also again in 2021 when a new president could take over the white house our baseline outlook sees an acceleration in global gdp in 2020 led by stabilization in developed market activity and an upturn in emerging market activity says jonathan miller an economist for barclays in new york santa says dow 30k 2020 bryan r smith afp via getty images a key component of their outlook is the diminished trade uncertainty japan korea canada and mexico have all signed or are close to signing trade deals with the u s china s phase one deal is still a mystery but talk of tariff cuts instead of hikes is a positive for wall street the recession fears of a few months ago reflected in an inverted yield curve have dissipated the 2 year to 10 year yield spread which briefly went negative in late august stands at 30 basis points as of friday morning the steepest spread in over a year the u s economy enters 2020 with momentum says scott clemons chief investment strategist for brown brothers harriman in new york he rattles off the numbers 254 000 jobs added in november a 3 5 unemployment rate 3 1 wage growth and falling mortgage rates helping home builders consumer confidence is nearly perfect on an index of 1 to 100 it s in the 90s all of this bodes well for consumer spending and therefore gdp in 2020 next year is the fourth and perhaps final year of the trump presidency compared to obama s presidency it is more disruptive and certainly looks and feels more stressful but the trump obama approval ratings are the same given their time in office trump s high marks across party lines are on the economy the bread and butter of main street u s a three years ago paul krugman mit nobel winning economist and a new york times columnist predicted a global recession in november 2016 if trump got elected we re still waiting nobel prize winning economist and new york times opinion columnist paul krugman sad his prediction of a global recession didn t come to pass giving trump a chance to win reelection in 2020 neilson barnard getty images for the new york times this may not be particularly bold but one mildly courageous prediction is that 2020 turns out better than current sentiment suggests says christopher smart chief global strategist for barings investment institute in boston it s entirely plausible that we see a year in which inflation remains under control driving central banks down a more accommodative path and providing support to company earnings he says others in the market are saying the same thing now not just for the u s but for the world we think it will be a good year for emerging market corporate earnings says george mussalli cio of panagora asset management in boston it s also possible that the political noise here ends up not breaking any sound barriers from impeachment to the supposed socialist takeover of the democratic party that will crash markets none of this may turn out as severe as financial pundits drama queens on the evening news or the daily beast suggest trump may even end up being the first president in u s history to be impeached and reelected some heads will explode if that happens write that down globally as the headwinds around brexit begin to clear it becomes supportive of the u k economy the german economy could also see improvement particularly if the government provides some fiscal support after falling into recession territory this year global debt markets are looking for weakness in the u s dollar in 2020 something that would have a positive effect on emerging markets like brazil back home clemons from brown brothers harriman says its fund managers are finding the most opportunities in companies exposed to consumer staples and discretionary spending consumer staples give some downside risk protection and many companies in this space pay well covered dividends for investors in search of yield we like smaller cap stocks says clemons about 2020 small cap stocks are cheaper than large caps and are less exposed to the trade war for longer term investors clemons says start 2020 looking abroad we ve dialed up our exposure he says about emerging markets due to valuation and a general underperformance against the s p 500 this year politics and the impeachment process won t really move the market in 2020 on the small handful of historical precedents the early removal of a president can disrupt market prices in the short run but the market rapidly returns to fundamental drivers in the low risk event of trump being removed from office by the senate

taking such an authoritarian stance taiwan has slipped further away from beijing s grip while some political wags questioned whether communist party members were losing faith in president xi s governing style but xi has an even bigger challenge on his hands and not just donald trump s trade war antics make that 13 trillion challenges this figure refers to the size in u s dollar terms of china s onshore bond market and generally its growth and development have long been touted as a vital rite of passage for the second biggest economic power the trouble with debt markets though is they tend to expose cracks in financial systems herein lies xi s biggest problem keeping growth north of 6 is reasonably easy for a command economy even amid the trade war xi s party can order up giant infrastructure projects slash taxes and cajole local governments to ramp up fiscal stimulus it has its own atm the people s bank of china trouble is the more you borrow the more investors can push back and the more even the most authoritarian of governments can lose control as punters vote with their feet that risk is increasing along with a recent jump in private sector debt defaults to a record high according to fitch 4 9 of private companies missed bond payments from january to november up from 4 2 for all of 2018 when you combine state and private companies china inc s onshore defaults risks are growing apace from none a few years back to at least 18 billion so far this year there s an obvious caveat here we can only discuss the default risks we know about the ones regulators in beijing cop to not those that are being papered over with public assistance signs of stress are also emerging in the offshore debt market so are this year there have been at least 75 billion defaults with well over 200 billion of debt maturing over the next 24 months standard and poor s warns of increasing missed payments episodes this trajectory collides with u s president trump s trade war ignore all that excitement over trump s phase one deal with xi it s a polite ceasefire than won t hold with trump getting zero from xi in terms of re ordering u s china trade dynamics and facing the risk of removal from office the odds of him lashing out anew at asia are growing not waning it means that xi s annus horribilis won t end even as calendars switch to 2020 the year ahead may very well be the one in which china s debt troubles supersede all else that s saying a lot given the ongoing protests rocking hong kong and piercing the veneer of omnipotence xi seeks to project the same goes for next month s election in taiwan where president tsai ing wen a china critic is sailing toward a second term presidential candidate tsai ing wen talks to the media after the first televised policy address in taipei taiwan on december 18 2019 the island will hold its general elections on january 11 2020 ap photo chiang yong ying the real problem though is that an increasingly unbalanced chinese economy faces a third year of trade clashes as the reviews of the phase one truce come in tepid ones at best trump may double down that means even bigger tariffs the white house targeting more mainland tech champions or pulling the trigger on 25 taxes on imports of cars and auto parts as xi struggles to keep growth above 6 his target for 2020 beijing s debt load and financial system leverage will continue growing here it s worth noting recent comments from ma jun an external adviser to china s central bank he told securities times newspaper that beijing needs to reduce systemic risks ma is particularly worried about excessive regional government borrowing setting off a chain reaction of defaults that unnerve markets these local government financing vehicles or lgfvs have been at the center of the nation s infrastructure boom they re the fuel driving the countless six lane highways international airports and white elephant stadiums being built around the most populous nation yet they re also responsible for the enron ization of china s economy lgfvs are essentially off the books schemes they re vehicles that carry a perceived government guarantee even though one doesn t exist as ma suggests though beijing could allow stronger lgfvs to absorb weaker ones even if they re in other provinces think of it as a non bailout bailout while all this is happening china is allowing more and more foreign punters into its markets in april segments of china s 13 trillion onshore market got added to the bloomberg barclays global aggregate index that puts pressure on others including jpmorgan government bond index and ftse world government bond index to include china and up their weightings the risk of course is overseas investors are hard to silence wall street talking heads appearing on cnbc and fox business television are apt to call beijing out on market quirks if transparency corporate governance or settlement procedures are found lacking beijing risks losing face even more so if defaults get away from chinese authorities and cause capital flight these tensions more than perhaps anything else will come to a head in 2020 in ways that demand xi s attention investors everywhere too if asia s biggest financial power stumbles

a car with a sticker of the rolling stones in the streets of havana cuba march 18 2016 epa ernesto mastrascusa marc frank i reuters havana the cuban government has ramped up moves of late to eliminate the communist run country s dual monetary system a step many analysts say may take place in 2020 what is cuba s currency system the two currencies circulating in cuba s state run economy are the peso and the convertible peso cuc pegged to the dollar the currencies are exchanged at various rates 1 to 1 for state owned businesses 24 pesos for 1 cuc for the public and others for joint ventures wages in island s special development zone and transactions between farmers and hotels cuba legalized the dollar and created the labyrinthine system as part of a package of measures to open up its economy after the collapse of former benefactor the soviet union while trying to cushion the blow to citizens and national industry while the system helped cuba get through the shock of the soviet collapse it ended up also distorting the economy and hiding the real economic situation productivity and competitiveness of state run companies and favoring imports instead of exports adios to convertible peso the government says it will eliminate the convertible peso and leave the peso as the only currency and has already taken important steps in that direction larger peso bills denominated at 200 500 and 1 000 are now in circulation previously 100 pesos was the highest denomination thousands of state run retail outlets now price items in pesos as well as cuc and cash registers and card swipers are programmed for both currencies in november cuba banned the import and export of convertible pesos and began charging travelers in tradable currencies at airports once past the gate in december the government began giving change at some stores only in pesos hello dollar cuba banned the dollar as legal tender in 2003 after the united states hiked sanctions on its use of the greenback but in october the government began opening stores that sell appliances car parts and other items for dollars though only with a bank card raising the possibility the u s currency will be used at least electronically once the convertible peso is taken out of circulation that could end the state s prior practice of importing appliances and other goods with tradable currency and selling them in local currency useless for purchasing more imports risks bringing the fixed official 1 1 and 1 24 public exchange rates more in line with each other and their true value will be difficult especially given the government s pledge that consumers will not be hurt an impossibility according to many local and foreign economists they say fixing the exchange rates will inevitably cause inflation and reveal just how unproductive and bankrupt many state run companies are leading to layoffs the government counters it will freeze prices increase wages and take other measures to insure the social dislocation common in other developing nations when they experience monetary policy failure does not occur claiming its planned economy allows for a different outcome

as one eventful year ends and another looms we highlight five issues in international economic affairs that the simon chair will be tracking in 2020 as we did at the start of this year we discuss both the known knowns about these issues and the known unknowns that is the questions we have today that will only be answered as the year unfolds the final months of 2019 saw a flurry of international activity in trade policy two major regional trade agreements were concluded the united states mexico canada agreement usmca and the regional comprehensive economic partnership rcep among 15 asian economies the united states reached phase one trade deals with the world s second and third largest economies china and japan at least temporarily these developments brought a welcome reduction of uncertainty to the global economy but there is plenty of room for trade surprises in 2020 one big question is how long the mini deal with china will hold in the face of criticism that it leaves most of the deeper differences between washington and beijing unresolved moreover while details remain sketchy the enforcement mechanism appears to depend on sustained uncertainty with the united states able to unilaterally basically retaliate if the chinese violate the agreement according to white house trade adviser peter navarro meanwhile the world trade organization wto faces an existential crisis after its appellate body lost a quorum this month due to u s refusal to approve new members this will roil the global trading system ahead of the biennial meeting of trade ministers in kazakhstan in june with the usmca passed and the mini deals with china and japan done will u s trade representative robert lighthizer have much gas left in the tank for an activist trade policy in 2020 probably not it seems likely that phase two deals with china and japan both needed both highly challenging will have to await a new presidential term beginning in 2021 and a bilateral deal with the united kingdom remains pie in the sky for now until london works out its new relationship with the european union mpg we flagged technology as a theme last year and it did not disappoint developments in 2019 from congressional proposals to fund ambitious technology strategies to government rules aimed at securing technology supply chains underscore the high stake nature of technology competition and also the challenge of developing effective policy responses at issue is how certain technological innovations for instance in artificial intelligence quantum computing and biotechnology may create vulnerabilities as well as advantages for countries in economic and security terms technology competition will undoubtedly remain a key theme in the year ahead a few questions can help frame the issue for policymakers first what technologies will be foundational to innovation leadership in the future second what role should government play in fostering the development of such technologies and third how should the united states take such considerations into account when engaging with allies and partners as well as competitors to date technology competition has been framed mostly in a u s china context however an increasingly assertive stance on the part of the european union including a call for technological sovereignty in some critical technology areas by the new president of the european commission makes clear that it is not simply a two way contest developing a strategy to work with countries in areas of shared interests and common beliefs for instance ethical standards for certain new technologies should be high on the agenda of the u s administration ss technological advances are foundational to developments on another topic worth watching in the year ahead digital currency it has been widely reported that china will introduce at least on a pilot basis its own digital currency in 2020 china s central bank the people s bank of china pboc has been working on its digital currency electronic payment dcep program since 2014 pboc governor yi gang has said the aim is not to create a new currency but to partially digitize china s existing monetary base instead of physical renminbi rmb notes anyone transacting in chinese currency could use digital rmb such a step would be significant boosting efficiency good and data collection mixed as a sovereign fiat currency a digital rmb is a less radical innovation than others in this space this past year the world was introduced to libra envisioned by its backers and led by facebook as a stable currency built on a secure and stable open source blockchain backed by a reserve of real assets and governed by an independent association like china s dcep there is a long way to go from idea to implementation but unlike dcep the libra would not be a sovereign currency which raises a distinct set of issues particularly for the official sector the international monetary fund bank for international settlements and individual central banks and finance ministries are busy evaluating the possible implications of digital currencies adoption of these innovations will depend on consumer and investor preferences as well as future regulations which in turn are linked to policies around money laundering data collection and privacy and critical financial infrastructure digital currency developments will impact the international monetary system and possibly the currency at its center the u s dollar ss china s belt and road initiative bri may have reached peak velocity and could change gears in the year ahead spending for 2019 is likely to be the lowest since the bri s announcement in late 2013 the underlying constraints are both domestic and foreign chinese policymakers have less cash on hand growth is slowing at home and there is less appetite for going even deeper into risky markets where the bri made its initial mark at the same time some of china s partners have already taken on too much debt and are hesitant to borrow further these dynamics reinforce two trends the first is china s desire to multilateralize the bri china s normal preference for bilateral dealmaking makes it the strongest party in most negotiations but also incurs greater financial and reputational costs when projects go wrong a multilateral cooperation center could provide one avenue for raising resources and sharing risk the second trend is china s doubling down on digital infrastructure which often costs less for recipient countries than other infrastructure types and provides china with significant commercial and strategic value as huawei and china s other tech champions face increased scrutiny in western markets they will ride the bri deeper into developing and emerging markets expect more cracks to come to the surface in 2020 promises about game changing projects made years ago are wearing thin rather than cancel troubled projects which would be economically wise chinese officials are pressuring debt ridden partners like pakistan to restart them this reflects a strong desire to make the bri successful but also indicates that the low hanging fruit has been harvested in time and especially if there is a global economic downturn we will learn how much was rotten jh two annual summits mark the global economic calendar in 2020 president trump is scheduled to host fellow leaders of the group of 7 g7 advanced democracies at camp david in mid june there is no shortage of pressing issues for the group of nominally like minded countries to discuss including conflicts in the middle east iranian and north korean nuclear concerns and the challenges of an assertive china president trump has been a disruptive force at previous g7 summits but may have an incentive as host just months before his reelection bid to burnish his global leadership credentials one point to watch is whether trump will follow through on his insistence at last year s summit in france that russia be readmitted to the group on december 1 saudi arabia took over the presidency of the other major forum of global economic governance the group of 20 g20 riyadh is scheduled to host the summit of leaders representing over 80 percent of the global economy in late november 2020 one question is whether the g20 will help de facto saudi ruler prince mohammed bin salman regain international credibility after last year s brutal slaying of journalist jamal khashoggi or whether that issue as well as the saudi role in the calamitous war in yemen will overshadow the summit making progress on the g20 s substantive agenda has been challenging in recent years even under the most capable of hosts nevertheless at osaka last summer japan was able to advance some useful initiatives in areas such as data governance and high quality infrastructure investment follow through in these and other areas will be worth watching and if a global economic crisis were to erupt in 2020 whether sparked by renewed trade conflict or financial strains in china or latin america the g20 may have an opportunity to rebuild the cohesion that marked its early summits following the 2008 financial crisis mpg matthew p goodman is senior vice president and holds the simon chair in political economy at the center for strategic and international studies csis in washington d c stephanie

but consumer demand remains weak as core inflation which excludes food prices and sales tax rise barely increases japan s annual consumer inflation rate ticked up in november and a key price gauge hit a more than three year high suggesting that firms are gradually passing on rising labour costs and a tax increase to shoppers still the inflation rate remained far below the bank of japan s 2 percent target underscoring the challenge the central bank faces in supporting prices as the economy shows signs of slowing even in the face of a record government budget the core consumer price index cpi which excludes volatile fresh food prices rose 0 5 percent in november from a year earlier government data showed on friday matching a median market forecast and accelerating from a 0 4 percent gain in october the so called core core inflation index which strips away the effect of both fresh food and energy costs was up 0 8 percent in november marking the fastest year on year increase since april 2016 but after removing the effect of the sales tax and free pre school education core inflation rose by just 0 2 percent the same rate as in october the latest figures follow an october increase in japan s sales tax from 8 percent to 10 percent which has pushed up the prices of goods and services but also dampened consumer demand a key driver of inflation the rise in the core core cpi closely watched by the boj as a key measurement of the broad inflation trend reflects price rises for a wide range of goods and services a government official told reporters shoppers paid 5 percent more for sushi in november than a year ago and 8 percent more for a cup of ice cream they spent 36 percent more on electric vacuum machines as high end models sold well the official said analysts however doubt whether the rise will have legs given signs of a slowdown in the economy the rise in inflation excluding fresh food and energy is a positive sign for the bank of japan and will allow them to claim with more confidence that momentum towards their 2 percent price target is maintained said tom learmouth japan economist at capital economics however we expect underlying inflation to moderate to around 0 4 percent as the unemployment rate climbs he told reuters news agency anaemic wage growth is still the main hurdle to long term price gains according to economist hiromichi shirakawa at credit suisse unless income expectations rise consumption will not increase sustainably and businesses will not be able to raise prices he told bloomberg the boj kept its monetary policy steady on thursday on the view that solid domestic demand will make up for weak exports which have been hit by the trade war between the united states and china but many analysts expect japan s economy which expanded by an annualised 1 8 percent in the third quarter to have contracted in the current quarter as the sales tax rise in october cools consumption record spending sluggish economic growth prompted japan s cabinet to approve a record budget of about 102 7 trillion yen 939bn for the next fiscal year on friday despite already struggling to rein in the developed world s heaviest public debt burden the 1 2 percent increase from the current year will be boosted by record outlays for welfare and the military and other spending aimed at boosting the economy abe s administration is counting on economic expansion to boost tax revenues to help finance debt as limited scope for monetary stimulus prompts global policymakers to focus on fiscal spending we ll continue efforts on reform of expenditure so as to juggle both economic revival and fiscal reform finance minister taro aso told reporters after a cabinet meeting we are striving to achieve a primary budget surplus he said shrugging off a view that the bank of japan s ultra low rate policy is allowing the government to effectively bankroll its debt parliament must now approve the spending plan along with a separate extra budget for this fiscal year early in 2020 despite the tax hike public finances are worsening as the government expands spending to ease the pain of the higher levy said koya miyamae senior economist at smbc nikko securities japan s public debt is more than double the size of its 5 trillion economy by far the highest among advanced economies bond yields have been suppressed by the boj s money printing under a policy that caps 10 year jgb yields about zero percent allowing the government to rely on cheap borrowing but the economy is still struggling to grow with households spending less for the first time in a year in october even as wages crept up reflecting a tight job market factory output suffered its largest fall in two years in october and big manufacturers business sentiment sank to a near seven year low in the fourth quarter underlining the fragile state of japan s recovery left with little ammunition to fire up inflation the boj is expected to keep policy steady for the time being including at its rate review next month unless a severe shock hits the economy boj governor haruhiko kuroda has said the bank will take into account the expected boost to growth from the government s spending package when it conducts a quarterly review of its growth and price projections at the january rate review

refresh this page throughout the democratic debate for live updates the sixth and final democratic presidential primary debate of 2019 comes the day after the u s house voted to impeach president donald trump the debate is scheduled from 8 p m to 10 30 p m in los angeles co hosted by pbs and politico the smallest candidate field will take the stage at loyola marymount university thursday democrats vying to take on trump in 2020 are expected to highlight the historic impeachment of trump wednesday the president held a defiant rally in battle creek last night while the house votes to impeach him for abuses of power and obstructing congress former vice president joseph r biden remains the leading candidate in recent national polls but three candidates are within striking distance in early voting states u s sens elizabeth warren d mass and bernie sanders i vt and south bend ind mayor pete buttigieg remain hot on biden s trail the debate features the smallest lineup yet after fewer candidates met qualification requirements set by the democratic national committee other democrats will participate in california include u s sen amy klobuchar d minn businessman tom steyer and businessman andrew yang how realistic is medicare for all candidates had a familiar dispute over their conflicting health care policies toward the end of the debate warren and sanders propose putting all americans on a single payer government run health care system biden buttigieg and klobuchar would rather expand medicare but allow people to choose whether they want to join the program or keep their private insurance whoa guys hey klobuchar said i just don t think anyone has a monopoly on bold ideas i think you can be progressive and practical at the same time neither plan is expected to gather much support among republicans biden said medicare for all is an unrealistic plan that would require taxes for the middle class though sanders said any taxes would be offset by eliminating premiums co payments and deductibles candidates agreed to work on bringing down the cost of prescription drugs like insulin warren and buttigieg clash over fundraising warren and buttigieg got into an extended scrape over their contrasting fundraising strategies before the debate buttigieg was facing pressure from progressives and warren for holding closed door fundraisers with wealthy power brokers buttigieg s campaign announced it would begin allowing the press to attend fundraisers but he recently held a private wine cave fundraiser with tickets starting at 500 buttigieg presented a pragmatic argument that democrats shouldn t turn down money that could help defeat trump buttigieg said expecting candidates to refuse money from wealthy donors is a pointless purity test if you can t say no to a donor you have no business running for office in the first place he said buttigieg also noted he is the only candidate on the stage who is not a billionaire he also said warren s presidential campaign was jump started by 10 4 million dollars from her senate account that was raised using the same methods she now denounces warren suggested buttigieg s donors could have some influence over his decisions i do not sell access to my time warren said i don t meet behind closed doors with big dollar donors economists are wrong about wealth tax warren said economic forecasts that suggest her proposed tax increases will stifle economic growth are just wrong the massachusetts democrat proposed a 2 cent wealth tax on every dollar of net worth greater than 50 million and an extra 1 cent tax on every dollar of net worth above 1 billion the ultra millionaire tax would affect america s 75 000 richest families according to her campaign and generate 2 75 trillion over a decade in exchange warren said the tax would fund universal child care for every child up to age five universal pre kindergarten raising the wage of child care workers and preschool teachers providing two free years of community college and four years of tuition free attendance at universities investments in historically black colleges and wiping out student loan debt for 95 of the country independent analysis of warren s proposed wealth tax suggested it would slow economic growth by nearly 0 2 each year over the next 10 years the new york times reported how s the economy trump often touts record breaking unemployment and stock market figures and a net increase in jobs and wage growth to show his administration s positive impact on the economy democrats on stage argued trump isn t giving americans the full picture the middle class is being killed the middle class is being crushed biden said the very wealthy are growing ordinary people are not growing buttigieg agreed saying people are not getting paid enough to cover basic expenses buttigieg said it s the result of bad policy namely trump s 2017 tax cuts not some cosmic forces both candidates said the tax cuts disproportionally benefit the rich most of the primary field said they would repeal trump s tax reform democrats give mixed praise to usmca the house voted to approve trump s signature trade policy hours before the debate thursday moving the united states mexico canada agreement forward to its likely approval in the senate democrats on stage expressed lukewarm support of the measure which trump said will benefit farmers and manufacturing companies in states like michigan sanders said he wouldn t support the agreement when it comes to the senate saying the usmca is a modest improvement over what we have right now sanders also said the deal is not going to stop outsourcing the usmca was supported by the michigan house delegation save u s rep justin amash i vt amash said the deal is worse than nafta impeachment opens the debate all of the candidates on stage thursday supported impeaching trump which isn t necessarily surprising all but three house democrats voted to impeach trump while no republicans supported adopting the charges facing the president the first question of the debate dealt with how the candidates would change the minds of people who don t believe trump did anything wrong sanders said trump is the most corrupt president in history he said he will be making the case to voters on the campaign trail warren agreed noting trump made draining the swamp part of his promise to voters in 2016 and the current election cycle instead she said his 2017 tax reform bill helped the billionaire class and enriched his allies klobuchar hit trump for blocking congressional subpoenas of white house officials buttigieg said trump left the u s house no choice but to impeach him buttigieg told voters not to feel helpless with the situation if the republican led senate

but my sense is that there isn t a great appreciation of the gravity of the situation around the downside vulnerability of the economy as it drifts towards the zero bound business and households aren t perceiving the downside risks and financial markets aren t pricing them in we probably aren t very well prepared rba running out of room if the rba cuts the cash rate to 0 5 per cent in the coming months as is expected by market economists that would take its total easing since the rate cutting cycle began in june 2019 to 1 percentage point citi chief economist paul brennan notes the average cumulative interest rate cut in the past four easing cycles is 3 percentage points in theory and in the knowledge governor philip lowe has ruled out negative interest rates the rba could find itself almost 2 percentage points short of its usual capacity to support the economy in the event of a downturn advertisement running out of rate cut space explains why lowe has flagged unconventional monetary policy as a possibility if the cash rate hits 0 25 per cent initially such an unprecedented move would involve the rba buying government bonds to drive down yields lower lending rates across the economy and put downward pressure on the australian dollar quantitative easing however lowe is not keen on australia using crisis era quantitative easing tools deployed in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis in the united states europe and japan rba governor philip lowe is approaching near zero interest rates bloomberg he is urging a greater stimulatory role for the government s fiscal policy such as more infrastructure spending to avoid an over reliance on monetary policy to lift wages inflation and economic growth advertisement in this world i would hope other public policy options were also on the country s agenda lowe said in november lowe is also urging more structural reforms to boost the economy s speed limit such as changes to tax competition workplace relations innovation education and skills policies lowe might have found himself privately nodding in furious agreement just before christmas when his counterpart at germany s central bank warned the country s government to increase public investment and against a balance budget becoming a fetish budget surplus goal prime minister scott morrison and treasurer josh frydenberg are committed to delivering a budget surplus in 2019 20 and beyond the fall in the unemployment rate to 5 2 per cent in november gives the government cause for hope that the economy can begin to generate more wage pressure and inflation as the rba is hoping advertisement but with consumer spending and business investment both weak the sluggish economy may need extra policy stimulus unless there is a positive upswing in economic momentum in 2020 the rba estimates it needs to drive down the unemployment rate to 4 5 per cent to spur wage pressures and lift inflation back inside the legislated 2 3 per cent target even if there is no crisis the tension that emerged between the government s fiscal and rba monetary policy in 2019 is likely to intensify in 2020 ultimately it may boil down to a choice between the government relaxing its conservative budget rules or the rba embarking on an unconventional money printing experiment

refresh this page throughout the democratic debate for live updates the sixth and final democratic presidential primary debate of 2019 comes the day after the u s house voted to impeach president donald trump the debate is scheduled from 8 p m to 10 30 p m in los angeles co hosted by pbs and politico the smallest candidate field will take the stage at loyola marymount university thursday democrats vying to take on trump in 2020 are expected to highlight the historic impeachment of trump wednesday the president held a defiant rally in battle creek last night while the house votes to impeach him for abuses of power and obstructing congress former vice president joseph r biden remains the leading candidate in recent national polls but three candidates are within striking distance in early voting states u s sens elizabeth warren d mass and bernie sanders i vt and south bend ind mayor pete buttigieg remain hot on biden s trail the debate features the smallest lineup yet after fewer candidates met qualification requirements set by the democratic national committee other democrats will participate in california include u s sen amy klobuchar d minn businessman tom steyer and businessman andrew yang how realistic is medicare for all candidates had a familiar dispute over their conflicting health care policies toward the end of the debate warren and sanders propose putting all americans on a single payer government run health care system biden buttigieg and klobuchar would rather expand medicare but allow people to choose whether they want to join the program or keep their private insurance whoa guys hey klobuchar said i just don t think anyone has a monopoly on bold ideas i think you can be progressive and practical at the same time neither plan is expected to gather much support among republicans biden said medicare for all is an unrealistic plan that would require taxes for the middle class though sanders said any taxes would be offset by eliminating premiums co payments and deductibles candidates agreed to work on bringing down the cost of prescription drugs like insulin warren and buttigieg clash over fundraising warren and buttigieg got into an extended scrape over their contrasting fundraising strategies before the debate buttigieg was facing pressure from progressives and warren for holding closed door fundraisers with wealthy power brokers buttigieg s campaign announced it would begin allowing the press to attend fundraisers but he recently held a private wine cave fundraiser with tickets starting at 500 buttigieg presented a pragmatic argument that democrats shouldn t turn down money that could help defeat trump buttigieg said expecting candidates to refuse money from wealthy donors is a pointless purity test if you can t say no to a donor you have no business running for office in the first place he said buttigieg also noted he is the only candidate on the stage who is not a billionaire he also said warren s presidential campaign was jump started by 10 4 million dollars from her senate account that was raised using the same methods she now denounces warren suggested buttigieg s donors could have some influence over his decisions i do not sell access to my time warren said i don t meet behind closed doors with big dollar donors economists are wrong about wealth tax warren said economic forecasts that suggest her proposed tax increases will stifle economic growth are just wrong the massachusetts democrat proposed a 2 cent wealth tax on every dollar of net worth greater than 50 million and an extra 1 cent tax on every dollar of net worth above 1 billion the ultra millionaire tax would affect america s 75 000 richest families according to her campaign and generate 2 75 trillion over a decade in exchange warren said the tax would fund universal child care for every child up to age five universal pre kindergarten raising the wage of child care workers and preschool teachers providing two free years of community college and four years of tuition free attendance at universities investments in historically black colleges and wiping out student loan debt for 95 of the country independent analysis of warren s proposed wealth tax suggested it would slow economic growth by nearly 0 2 each year over the next 10 years the new york times reported how s the economy trump often touts record breaking unemployment and stock market figures and a net increase in jobs and wage growth to show his administration s positive impact on the economy democrats on stage argued trump isn t giving americans the full picture the middle class is being killed the middle class is being crushed biden said the very wealthy are growing ordinary people are not growing buttigieg agreed saying people are not getting paid enough to cover basic expenses buttigieg said it s the result of bad policy namely trump s 2017 tax cuts not some cosmic forces both candidates said the tax cuts disproportionally benefit the rich most of the primary field said they would repeal trump s tax reform democrats give mixed praise to usmca the house voted to approve trump s signature trade policy hours before the debate thursday moving the united states mexico canada agreement forward to its likely approval in the senate democrats on stage expressed lukewarm support of the measure which trump said will benefit farmers and manufacturing companies in states like michigan sanders said he wouldn t support the agreement when it comes to the senate saying the usmca is a modest improvement over what we have right now sanders also said the deal is not going to stop outsourcing the usmca was supported by the michigan house delegation save u s rep justin amash i vt amash said the deal is worse than nafta impeachment opens the debate all of the candidates on stage thursday supported impeaching trump which isn t necessarily surprising all but three house democrats voted to impeach trump while no republicans supported adopting the charges facing the president the first question of the debate dealt with how the candidates would change the minds of people who don t believe trump did anything wrong sanders said trump is the most corrupt president in history he said he will be making the case to voters on the campaign trail warren agreed noting trump made draining the swamp part of his promise to voters in 2016 and the current election cycle instead she said his 2017 tax reform bill helped the billionaire class and enriched his allies klobuchar hit trump for blocking congressional subpoenas of white house officials buttigieg said trump left the u s house no choice but to impeach him buttigieg told voters not to feel helpless with the situation if the republican led senate

president donald trump is heading into an election year touting a trade deal that promises to double u s exports to china which he says has pledged a 200 billion two year spending spree on everything from airplanes to pork chops and chicken feet yet the inescapable reality is that even this extraordinary splurge if it happens may not make up the economic cost of the trade war it seeks to defuse the precise toll of an economic conflict that is far from over is difficult to isolate and is the result of everything from the direct cost of tariffs to intangibles like the role of uncertainty on business confidence it also gets at a theological debate in economics that sees ideological supporters of trump s tariffs argue prior waves of protectionism are unfairly maligned by history economists who have calculated the impact of u s tariffs most of which will remain in place and china s retaliatory measures have put the economic losses including the impact of the resulting uncertainty at a cost in lost output ranging from 0 3 to 0 7 of real gross domestic product this year alone but even with the phase one trade deal many economists expect the tariff drag to extend for years as stymied business investment lingering uncertainty and the billions of duties still in place take a toll on future growth while a few tenths of a percentage point may not seem like much it s consequential in the world s biggest economy in 2019 dollar terms bloomberg economics estimates the cost in lost u s gdp has reached 134 billion to date and will rise to a total of 316 billion by the end of 2020 a study by researchers at the new york fed and princeton and columbia universities estimated the cost to consumers of the bulk of tariffs that will remain in place despite the latest deal at 831 per household per year or an annual cost of more than 106 billion for the u s economy as a whole that alone would more than wipe out the gains from the chinese buying surge trump s team has negotiated the purchases get us back to where we were before this all started said maurice obstfeld former imf chief economist and member of president barack obama s council of economic advisers so you have to ask what s been gained and was it worth putting the economy through the wringer the costs are also not one time and are likely to build up for years based on economists calculations even as businesses get used to the tariffs or adjust supply chains and the initial deal helps at least calm fears of a further escalation the international monetary fund s estimates are that the u s tariffs will subtract from real gdp in every year to 2023 when real gdp will be 0 5 lower than what it would have been had the duties not been imposed the congressional budget office earlier this year built its analysis on the assumption the tariffs could still be in effect in 2029 and subtract 0 1 from u s economic output that year the administration and its supporters argue they are in a bigger fight to address longstanding american complaints with china that will be to the long term benefit of u s businesses and workers they point to a u s economy growing faster than its peers and continuing to generate plenty of jobs as vindication of its trade policies revised data on friday is expected to confirm the u s economy grew at a 2 1 annualized rate in the third quarter in november the economy created a better than expected 266 000 jobs trump has also repeatedly denied any negative impact from his trade policies and instead blames what he portrays as a timid fed and a strong dollar for not allowing the u s economy to grow as fast as he would like there is no uncertainty he told the economic club of new york on nov 12 economic impact larry kudlow the head of trump s national economic council this week said he expected the combination of the deal with china which is due to be signed in early january and the imminent passage through congress of an update of the north american free trade agreement to add 0 5 to u s growth kudlow s estimate is based on a mix of independent and internal analyses the white house says but it won t say any more it also has not released any analysis of the economic impact of the china deal or of the broader economic conflict a challenge facing critics of trump s trade wars is that the economic effects in the u s have been countered by strong national level data and the ability of a robust economy driven largely by domestic consumption to absorb the impact on the manufacturing and farm sectors but the negative effects are real argue economists like mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics from the third quarter of 2018 to the same quarter this year the period in which the trade war really started to bite zandi calculates the u s lost 0 4 of real gdp to trump s various trade measures or 88 billion it also lost 340 000 jobs to the trade wars he contends via a mix of stalled investment and higher costs due to new import duties the uncertainty affecting business decisions isn t evaporating zandi said and that will continue to weigh on business investment hiring and wage growth and will have continued negative consequences for the economy timber roadkill at northwest hardwoods the u s s largest exporter of timber used in everything from coffee tables to kitchen cabinets the impact of the trade war has been stark a toxic mix of new u s tariffs on furniture made in china that has hit demand there and chinese retaliatory duties has led to a 40 collapse in an export business that for the u s industry was worth 2 billion annually before the trade war said nathan jeppson the company s ceo we feel a bit like roadkill on this path he said the company has responded by shutting down plants in virginia and washington state laying off 225 of its 1 700 employees those jobs seem unlikely to return in a hurry u s trade officials have said an increase in sales of hardwoods to china will be part of the new buying spree they haven t provided any details though and jeppson can t commit to reopening anything we need to see a sustained recovery in demand and pricing in order to reinvest in any facilities or reopen any plants said jeppson we have been so badly hurt by the last year and a half that we are going to be very cautious source bloomberg

water companies have had quite a run over the last 20 years looking ahead the next decade should be the most interesting by the time we get to 2030 the world will be a much different place the climate crisis crescendo will be elevated a billion more people will live in cities the ageing infrastructure will be even older and the un sustainable development goals will be providing a beacon on spending priorities for governments and corporations what will the coming decade bring for water below are seven trends that we believe will drive the water industry while many are already underway we think they will advance from a trickle to a torrent 1 smart water matures some of the greatest challenges for a water utility relate to gathering disparate information throughout their dispersed system and analysing the data to facilitate optimal decisions and maintaining regulatory compliance this requires embedding analytical technologies throughout the system communicating that data and then processing it in a meaningful way the results can mean lower operating costs and more efficient capital deployment at a time when water affordability is increasingly problematic some of the broader technology trends â big data robotics artificial intelligence networking and security â are very relevant to water many of these types of solutions are already deployed but it is very early in commercialisation as the industry tends to lag technology adoption that said a typical utility workforce tends to be weighted closer to retirement ages and the younger generations coming up have greater comfort with the newer technology it is not just for the utility as we enter the 2020s water companies are actively electrifying and networking their analytics on plumbing hydrants pumps meters boilers water treatment technologies and irrigation equipment remote monitoring and controls help with predictive maintenance lowering input costs improving outcomes and pre emptive alerting so whether it is a utility control room or a boiler room or a factory or a field smart water technologies will become an exciting growth area in the next decade 2 battle for the water consumer the prices paid for water and sanitation have been climbing faster than inflation for decades and the compounding effect has increased affordability constraints water bills get scrutinized more consumers also have more information at their fingertips about water quality throw in social media mentions and high profile news about lead and other contamination issues and it seems the casual conversations about water have ramped up anecdotally our water investing team has had more conversations about water quality with â non waterâ people in the last three months than in the previous five years consumerism is about to enter the water space and this will drive two main responses water utilities will need to develop rapid responses and closer relationships to their customer base at the same time as residential water treatment business models ramp up their efforts to bring water treatment solutions into the home in other words over the next decade the battle will intensify between the utilities trying to convince you that the water at the tap is fine while others will argue that piped water is not good enough for your family 3 climate crisis crescendo climate change is experienced in water rising seas more droughts and floods and more extreme weather events scientists expect continued temperature rises here which will mean the decade ahead will be very challenging as governments companies and farmers prioritise investments to increase their resilience water companies will work alongside core stakeholders to provide alternate water supply sources and address stormwater management strategies if the 2010s were mostly reactive then climate related spending in the 2020s will be both reactive and proactive as the social and financial costs of being vulnerable and prone can exceed the costs to address the problems after catastrophe strikes 4 infrastructure boom global markets have historically underinvested in their infrastructure and the 2010s were a rough period in the post gfc austerity era this had led to deteriorating roads bridges public transportation and water and wastewater systems in addition it is increasingly clear that the public will not tolerate toxic water at the taps and more regulations are being put in place globally to drive further investments to address contamination the good news is that it appears that the last few years have been very fruitful in terms of finding new sources of capital and lining up projects you can see it in the management commentaries organic growth and backlogs of the global consulting engineers who are generally the first in line to work on these infrastructure projects but the phasing of spend means that discussed projects can take a long time from conception to completion and the early years are taken up by planning and engineering which account for a fraction of the total construction budget that means the big spending associated with the boom will happen in the 2020s as construction works begin in earnest 5 reverse a decade of industrial rationalisation the 2000s were marked by overinvestment during boom times and the 2010s were marked by shutting down excess manufacturing footprints with new capacity added only sparingly in the global industrial world these days few industries are sitting on excess capacity as demand has grown into the existing space in addition changing trade patterns have driven a desire for a more diverse qualified supplier base and shorter supply chains this has the potential to lead to a more normal pace of growth of industrial capacity going forward and where there is industry there is a need for water and all the infrastructure and technologies to move and treat it 6 resumption of the roll ups unlike the consolidator phase of the 2000s in which large multi industry companies dipped their toe into water it is likely that we are going to see the focused water companies themselves buy up interesting highly fragmented spaces we are already starting to see this happen in waterworks distribution residential water treatment and industrial water treatment similarly we are witnessing a pick up in consolidation among the more than 50 000 us water utilities here here facilitated by favorable regulations and distressed municipalities or utilities either looking for or being forced to find a way out of their predicaments 7 rise of india africa just as china rose from a small factor in the water industry to a huge force over the last 10 15 years we believe the same will be true for india and africa over the coming decade both geographies have a population of about 1 3 billion apiece and have significant needs to address clean water and proper sanitation issues both regions are notoriously difficult to work in due to bureaucracy and corruption but growth is likely to be robust regardless india in the last few years has rolled out numerous initiatives that will be a huge engine of growth for water from cleaning up the ganges river to policy goals like pradhan mantri awas yojana a house for every indian by 2022 and jal jeevan mission piped water for all by 2024 further there are numerous large scale plans for mass adoption of efficient irrigation not that the targets will actually be met but theyâ ll try and it will be a supportive growth driver to the water industry today china represents a material allocation to most water investing strategies while india and africa are minor components we expect this to change with india and africa becoming a higher component as the decade progresses the 2020s follow two completely different prior decades the trends above are interesting in the context of the prior two decades the birth of institutional water investing kicked off at the turn of the century with dedicated strategies launched in europe and california two forward looking regions that understood the multi decade tailwinds for spending in water and had environmental sensitivities to look to align their investments with their values waterâ s first decade was amazing it was all about go go growth and the consolidators the developed market housing boom drove massive spending in water infrastructure from the utility plant to the houses infrastructure spending was booming and global industrial capex was sustained at very high levels recognizing the opportunity to participate in this boom and also seeing the successful roll up strategy executed by us filter in the 1990s there was a consolidation wave by larger companies multi industry companies itt industries danaher dhr ge ge and roper rop entered the water space with acquisitions of goulds pumps hach water quality testing betzdearborn water treatment chemicals and neptune water meters respectively and the media conglomerate vivendi otcpk vivef broke up creating what we now know as veolia otcpk veoey which ultimately acquired us filter and then further divided it up with parts sent to siemens otcpk siegy these companies plus others would go on further acquiring various water technologies for their growing water businesses it was also a period in which the investable utilities were undergoing consolidation as california water service group cwt acquired dominguez rwe acquired american water works awk only to ipo it later in the decade suez szevf bought aguas de barcelona and in the uk infrastructure funds snapped up anglian and kelda which itself had bought us utility aquarion earlier in the decade times were greatâ until they werenâ t with the housing bust and associated financial crisis sapping up capital availability leading to excess capacity and exposing the lack of integration and poor financial discipline water companies were struggling as warren buffett aptly says using a water analogy â only when the tide goes out do you discover whoâ s been swimming naked â source following the boom and bust as well as the consolidation wave the 2010s were the opposite the post gfc stimulus was followed by fiscal austerity and stagnant infrastructure spending in developed markets for much of the decade but as it turned out the decade would be defined not just by the consequences of the housing bust the french water market structure completely reset at lower levels due to regulatory changes which negatively impacted the large utilities there the industrial strength which arose as a second derivative benefit of the us energy renaissance sharply weakened when oil prices collapsed mid decade the 2010s turned out to be about refocusing in the midst of fairly stagnant growth water companies spent much of the decade closing plants right sizing their organizations exiting bad businesses and acquiring higher growth better margin lower cyclicality businesses the companies that had ventured into construction for various reasons got out of construction the multi industry consolidators started to deconsolidate itt spun off their water business xylem xyl while ge and siemens sold off their water businesses the newly focused companies homed in on their targeted end markets and their preferred channels to market their competitive moats were deepened creating further sustainable competitive advantages while it seemed that water companies in the 2000s were simply either a utility or generic growthy industrial company the focus brought about in the 2010s created a broader swath of highly differentiated companies with multiple angles to address global water challenges across utility construction industrial and agricultural markets finally it is important to note that the prior decades can also be defined by chinaâ s emergence from a small base 10 15 years ago china recognized the importance of addressing water for economic and social stability reasons and had rapidly become a huge high growth water market with significant water investments prioritised in their last two five year plans to address increasing access and improvement in quality here here the decades from an investing perspective we entered the 2000s with tech media telecom stocks expensive and everything else cheap with growth seemingly everywhere in the decade significant consolidation underway and inexpensive water stocks as a starting point there was a lot of opportunity for favourable water investments for the first two thirds of the decade times were good and both absolute and relative performance of water investing strategies were strong we entered the 2010s in a post gfc fog and another recession perceived to be always seemingly 18 24 months away for the most part market growth was slow and measured the companies with the best management teams the lowest balance sheet burdens the least cyclicality and ability to look more through the windshield customer focused growth innovation and less in the rear view mirror restructuring were huge winners combined with very low bond yields and high investor risk aversion itâ s clear in retrospect to see why low volatility â low volâ stocks â mostly developed market water utilities and the larger water treatment and analytics stocks â performed admirably as we enter the 2020s low vol stocks are pricey while emerging market water stocks are very cheap cyclicals small caps and higher beta stocks are also trading at a discount in general refocused global water companies have fortified their competitive positioning and are in very good shape to capitalize on the rising tides we might see the best combination of prior decades with robust growth and disciplined water companies those companies best positioned to address the seven trends above should do quite well over the next 10 years and in general their starting point valuations look interesting of course forecasting trends can be tricky hindsight can be humbling that said the water industry moves slowly enough to telegraph changes well before they hit the tipping point population growth urbanisation industrialisation infrastructure rehabilitation and increasing regulations will drive continued strong growth for those companies providing solutions water companies play an important role providing clean water and addressing resource scarcity policymakers are increasingly supportive at a time when water problems are becoming more challenging with the underlying targets of the un sustainable development goals mostly ending in 2030 and the prior decades setting the scene for the current industry structure we are optimistic about the decade ahead for a focused water investing strategy

as non gaap financial measures of our cruise segments and the company s financial performance these non gaap financial measures are provided along with u s gaap gross cruise revenues per albd gross revenue yields gross cruise costs per albd and u s gaap net income and u s gaap earnings per share net revenue yields and net cruise costs excluding fuel per albd enable us to separate the impact of predictable capacity or albd changes from price and other changes that affect our business we believe these non gaap measures provide useful information to investors and expanded insight to measure our revenue and cost performance as a supplement to our u s gaap consolidated financial statements under u s gaap the realized and unrealized gains and losses on fuel derivatives not qualifying as fuel hedges are recognized currently in earnings we believe that unrealized gains and losses on fuel derivatives are not an indication of our earnings performance since they relate to future periods and may not ultimately be realized in our future earnings therefore we believe it is more meaningful for the unrealized gains and losses on fuel derivatives to be excluded from our net income and earnings per share and accordingly we present adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share excluding these unrealized gains and losses we believe that gains and losses on ship sales impairment charges restructuring and other expenses are not part of our core operating business and are not an indication of our future earnings performance therefore we believe it is more meaningful for gains and losses on ship sales impairment charges and restructuring and other non core gains and charges to be excluded from our net income and earnings per share and accordingly we present adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share excluding these items the presentation of our non gaap financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation from as substitute for or superior to the financial information prepared in accordance with u s gaap it is possible that our non gaap financial measures may not be exactly comparable to the like kind information presented by other companies which is a potential risk associated with using these measures to compare us to other companies net revenue yields are commonly used in the cruise industry to measure a company s cruise segment revenue performance and for revenue management purposes we use net cruise revenues rather than gross cruise revenues to calculate net revenue yields we believe that net cruise revenues is a more meaningful measure in determining revenue yield than gross cruise revenues because it reflects the cruise revenues earned net of our most significant variable costs which are travel agent commissions cost of air and other transportation certain other costs that are directly associated with onboard and other revenues and credit and debit card fees net passenger ticket revenues reflect gross passenger ticket revenues net of commissions transportation and other costs net onboard and other revenues reflect gross onboard and other revenues net of onboard and other cruise costs net cruise costs excluding fuel per albd is the measure we use to monitor our ability to control our cruise segments costs rather than gross cruise costs per albd we exclude the same variable costs that are included in the calculation of net cruise revenues as well as fuel expense to calculate net cruise costs without fuel to avoid duplicating these variable costs in our non gaap financial measures substantially all of our net cruise costs excluding fuel are largely fixed except for the impact of changing prices once the number of albds has been determined reconciliation of forecasted data we have not provided a reconciliation of forecasted gross cruise revenues to forecasted net cruise revenues or forecasted gross cruise costs to forecasted net cruise costs without fuel or forecasted u s gaap net income to forecasted adjusted net income or forecasted u s gaap earnings per share to forecasted adjusted earnings per share because preparation of meaningful u s gaap forecasts of gross cruise revenues gross cruise costs net income and earnings per share would require unreasonable effort we are unable to predict without unreasonable effort the future movement of foreign exchange rates and fuel prices we are unable to determine the future impact of gains or losses on ships sales restructuring expenses and other non core gains and charges constant dollar and constant currency our operations primarily utilize the u s dollar australian dollar euro and sterling as functional currencies to measure results and financial condition functional currencies other than the u s dollar subject us to foreign currency translational risk our operations also have revenues and expenses that are in currencies other than their functional currency which subject us to foreign currency transactional risk we report net revenue yields net passenger revenue yields net onboard and other revenue yields and net cruise costs excluding fuel per albd on a constant dollar and constant currency basis assuming the 2019 periods currency exchange rates have remained constant with the 2018 periods rates these metrics facilitate a comparative view for the changes in our business in an environment with fluctuating exchange rates constant dollar reporting removes only the impact of changes in exchange rates on the translation of our operations constant currency reporting removes the impact of changes in exchange rates on the translation of our operations as in constant dollar plus the transactional impact of changes in exchange rates from revenues and expenses that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency examples the translation of our operations with functional currencies other than u s dollar to our u s dollar reporting currency results in decreases in reported u s dollar revenues and expenses if the u s dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies and increases in reported u s dollar revenues and expenses if the u s dollar weakens against these foreign currencies our operations have revenue and expense transactions in currencies other than their functional currency if their functional currency strengthens against these other currencies it reduces the functional currency revenues and expenses if the functional currency weakens against these other currencies it increases the functional currency revenues and expenses

paris europe s economy is struggling to gain traction after years of anaemic growth but the rock bottom interest rates meant to power a recovery are fuelling a property boom that is creating a new set of problems money is so cheap a 20 year mortgage can be had in paris or frankfurt germany at a rate of less than one per cent that borrowers are flocking to buy apartments and houses and institutional investors seeing a chance for lucrative returns are acquiring swaths of residential real estate in cities across europe in some parts of europe said jã rg krã mer chief economist at commerzbank in frankfurt valuations have already returned to or exceeded levels that preceded the continent s debt crisis a decade ago igniting concerns that the property boom could end badly the risks are real because negative interest rates in europe are cemented he said what s important for the economy as a whole is to prevent the emergence of a dangerous new bubble demand has surged in the five years since the european central bank pushed one of its benchmark interest rates below zero a step never before tried on such a scale prices jumped at least 30 per cent in frankfurt amsterdam stockholm madrid and other metropolitan hot spots and are up an average of over 40 per cent in portugal luxembourg slovakia and ireland that has made homeownership increasingly unaffordable for most anyone except high earners while also driving up rents pushing working class people farther from urban centers a political backlash is unfolding as european mayors intervene in the market with rent controls higher property taxes and subsidised housing programmes it plays into a sense of social distress said loã c bonneval a sociologist at the max weber center in lyon a social research organisation while low rates helped produce a rebound in the eurozone economists said that the policies now appear to be doing more harm than good clouding the bank s efforts to reverse inequality they have not resolved fundamental problems like weak business investment nor have they revived inflation which helps lift wages anywhere but in the housing market the dynamics have totally changed in a short period of time said matthias holzhey the head of swiss real estate at ubs and the lead author of an annual report on property price spikes in major global cities in some parts of europe he said low rates are pushing real estate valuations into the bubble risk zone financial authorities are on alert in september the european systemic risk board an arm of the european central bank that helps regulate europe s financial system called on 11 countries including luxembourg austria denmark and sweden to pursue regulations and tax measures meant to rein in prices and promote housing affordability and availability the bundesbank germany s central bank said recently that real estate in german cities had been overvalued by 15 to 30 per cent in other words that there is a bubble the ubs survey cited munich frankfurt amsterdam and paris as cities at risk and a study by the global accounting firm deloitte touche cautioned that average house prices will exceed pre crisis levels if the european central bank keeps interest rates at zero as planned housing prices have risen sharply in the united states as well but there the boom has been driven by individual buyers household debt has been held in check and lending standards have remained relatively tight all factors that reduce the chance of another collapse moreover while benchmark interest rates in the us have been kept low they were never negative and have now been above zero for several years some economists said that the concerns in europe are overblown and that prices are overvalued but not in a danger zone job creation from the economic recovery however tepid or uneven has expanded the ranks of creditworthy borrowers and buyers are mainly living in properties or renting them out rather than flipping them as happened before the crisis the supply of urban housing however has failed to keep pace with the resulting demand disrupters like airbnb have added to the crunch by converting residential properties into vacation stays the result is a shortage of affordable housing particularly in the rental sector squeezing middle and low income earners such as teachers firefighters nurses and retail employees who work in cities but cannot afford to live in them the dynamics are worsening as deep pocketed domestic and foreign investors pivot from focusing almost exclusively on commercial real estate to acquiring residential housing around europe pension and insurance funds which typically invest in government bonds have found it impossible to make money off countries like germany where the interest rate paid is less than zero that has driven them into real estate funds which offer high returns in comparison to bonds few places have felt the impact as sharply as berlin since the fall of the berlin wall 30 years ago workers artists and students have increasingly been displaced by an influx of young professionals with families but property prices and rents have skyrocketed in recent years as homebuyers and investors double down the city imposed a five year rent freeze the toughest in europe in the summer after rents jumped more than 50 per cent in five years and gave tenants the right to demand reductions if rents go too high german real estate stocks have slumped since the ruling for kathrin hauer 39 the measures are urgent she was a student nearly two decades ago when she became a tenant in a world war ii era building formerly owned by the east german government on schã nhauser allee a central street ms hauer who works as a costume and set designer for german theatres was long happy with her us 450 a month apartment which was bought by a small group of investors after communism then in 2016 the building was sold to an investment company last december right before a national law limiting rent increases was to take effect the company announced major construction work that would raise rents on the low income tenants by 250 per cent ms hauer s rent would surge above us 1 500 a month far more than she could afford this is meant to scare us to get out she said the tenants won an order from the city s planning department to halt the renovations which included large elevators balconies and floor to ceiling windows soon after in a move that tenants believe was a form of retaliation ms hauer said the investors ordered all the trees in the interior courtyard to be razed and hired a middleman to persuade tenants to agree to the renovations and accept buyouts wibke werner the deputy director of berliner mieterverein an association of berlin renters with more 170 000 members said that because of the low interest rates investors were betting on concrete gold these investments are designed to optimise returns she said which means rising rents and the crowding out of low income households nytimes
turkey s lira has hit its weakest level against the dollar in more than two months after the u s senate committee backed legislation on wednesday to impose sanctions on turkey it would further aggravate the ties which are already strained with washington it is expected that the central bank may further cut its benchmark rate that is exactly what happened and led to the disquieting situation where washington is taking punitive action against the turkish political leadership its energy industry and the financial system for its military action against kurdish forces in northern syria the pressure on the currency continued for its fourth straight day the turkish lira has weakened more than 11 this year after a currency crisis declined sharply its value by 30 last year the currency deteriorated to 5 9090 by 0734 gmt from a close of 5 8880 on tuesday and it would further affect the turkish economy if it extends its operation in northeast syria the united states has moved to punish turkey when it decides to purchase russian s 400 missile defense systems and imposes sanctions on ankara washington was also incensed by turkey s military offensive into northern syria against u s allied kurdish forces in the battle against islamic state isis turkish president tayyip erdogan on sunday said turkey could consider shutting down the incirlik airbase in response to the potential u s sanctions the senate overwhelmingly approved a 738 billion defense spending bill which authorizes the u s president trump to implement the sanctions on turkey prohibits the delivery of f 35 jets to the nato ally over the s 400 purchases and consents for the lifting of an arms embargo on cyprus the turkish foreign ministry has resolutely responded over the us legislation and termed the u s senate to demonstrate a disrespectful outlook for ankara s sovereign decisions congress has adopted an irrational and hostile attitude toward turkeyand that the threatening language is unacceptable and will never thwart from protecting its national security and defense of the nation state the lira seemingly reflects the flux in the u s turkey relationship and the market sentiments moves the markets that sanctions are still coming down the pipe on turkey from congress said tim ash of bluebay asset management that is exactly what happened and led to the disquieting situation where washington is taking punitive action against the turkish political leadership its energy industry and the financial system for its military action against kurdish forces in northern syria turkey s benchmark stock index suffered a slide by 0 45 in early trade its yield which moves in the reverse direction declined to 12 44 below from 12 52 return on its benchmark interesting enough both presidents have expressed their special rapport between them but the u s lawmakers have bitterly chastised president trump for what they see as trump has largely shielded turkey from the repercussions of sanctions subsequently the trump administration refrained from approving a resolution passed by the senate recognizing the mass killings of more than a million armenians by ottoman turks a century ago termed as genocide the growing tension between turkey and the united states have left the investors to worry about the impact of narrowing real interest rates in the turkish economy which have already fallen below levels in most emerging markets after consecutive rate cuts the turkish central bank has slashed its key rate to 12 since july in order to rebound from the recession and economic recovery brought by the currency crisis in order to improve economic predictability the annual inflation rate stands at 10 6 in november and the real rate remains at around 1 4 the turkish lira fell to 6 47 against the u s dollar and market watchers described the sudden dwindling of the lira as a flash crash as it sneakily approaching the level of about 6 against the dollar when it was adversely hit in late may the currency crisis almost wiped out 30 off the lira s value in 2018 while its value deteriorated 9 this year in a recently concluded kuala lumpur summit in the malaysian capital the leaders of islamic countries have specifically discussed the pressures and threats facing muslim ummah including a coup attempt economic terror and slander the summit was attended by hundreds of government officials businesspersons representatives of civil societies and experts from different sectors across the muslim world in his opening address iranian president hassan rouhani has called upon muslim ummah to be cognizant of the lurking threats of america and its global clout he urged the american economic regime and dollarization of national and global economies have provided the united states with the possibility of advancing its hegemony under the threat of sanctions and economic terrorism turkish president recep tayyip erdogan has emphasized reducing dependence on the us dollar calling on muslim countries to free bilateral trade from foreign exchange pressure he prescribed the prescription by stressing instead of trade with foreign currencies we would like to do foreign trade with our national currencies president erdogan is quite optimistic about developing alternative payment systems with countries like russia china and brazil the turkish lira plummeted its value against the dollar last year it adversely hit the country and the currency s spiraling decline caused turkey to fall into recession the events took place at a time when the relations between the two countries the u s and turkey were at the core of tension this was one of the worst economic crises that erdogan has ever suffered and endured a deeper crisis in his long rule the writer is a

he said the only detail on the benefit for agriculture is the u s claim that china has agreed to purchase between 40 billion and 50 billion worth of u s farm goods next year washington insider trade war costs while nearly everybody is happy to see reduced tensions between the u s and china over trade new questions are being raised by many in the media regarding what the current deal means and what are the longer term costs of the recent battle the administration claims that the current deal promises to double u s exports to china and sees a two year spending spree on everything from airplanes to pork chops and chicken feet still bloomberg argues that the inescapable reality is that even this extraordinary splurge if it happens may not make up the economic cost of the trade war it seeks to defuse not surprisingly the report says what everybody knows that the precise toll of an economic conflict that is far from over is difficult to isolate currently however economists are busily calculating the impact of the fight and notes that most u s tariffs will remain in place these along with china s retaliatory measures along with the impact of the resulting uncertainty range from 0 3 to 0 7 of real gross domestic product this year alone but even with the phase one trade deal many economists expect the tariff drag to extend for years and to continue to stymie business investment and to take a toll on future growth while a few tenths of a percentage point may not seem like much it s consequential in the world s biggest economy in 2019 dollars bloomberg estimates the cost in lost u s gdp has reached 134 billion to date and will rise to a total of 316 billion by the end of 2020 bloomberg also cites a study by researchers at the new york fed and princeton and columbia universities who estimated the cost to consumers of the tariffs that will remain in place at 831 per household per year with an annual cost of more than 106 billion for the u s economy as a whole that alone could more than wipe out the gains from the chinese buying surge the administration says has been negotiated bloomberg says the report says that the costs are also not one time and are likely to build up for years even as businesses get used to the tariffs or to adjusted supply chains for example the international monetary fund s estimates are that the u s tariffs will subtract from real gdp in every year to 2023 when real gdp will be 0 5 lower than it would have been had the duties not been imposed the administration and its supporters argue they are in a bigger fight to address longstanding american complaints regarding chinese investment policies and that the current agreements will be to the long term benefit of u s businesses and workers but that has been a difficult argument to make on the basis of the phase one deal critics say the administration also points to a u s economy growing faster than its peers and continuing to generate jobs as vindication of its trade policies and expect today s report to confirm the u s economy grew at a 2 1 annualized rate or perhaps better in the third quarter larry kudlow the head of the administration s national economic council this week said he expected the combination of the deal with china and the imminent congressional passage of an update of the north american free trade agreement will mean an addition of 0 5 to u s growth but didn t release any details regarding the white house analysis a challenge facing critics of trump s trade policies is the fact that the economic effects of recent trade fights have been largely countered by strong national level data and a robust economy driven by domestic consumption that largely offsets negative trade impacts on the manufacturing and farm sectors bloomberg says still the negative effects are real argues economist mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics and others from the third quarter of 2018 to the same quarter this year the period in which the trade war really started to bite zandi calculates the u s lost 0 4 of real gdp to various trade measure impacts or 88 billion it also lost 340 000 jobs to the trade wars he contends via a mix of stalled investment and higher costs due to new import duties the uncertainty affecting business decisions isn t evaporating zandi thinks and that will continue to weigh on business investment hiring and wage growth and will have continued negative consequences for the economy so we will see skeptics of the administration trade objectives have been increasingly vocal recently across most

national claims about stagnation four million canadians have joined a wealthier middle class photo by getty images istockphoto article content in the planetary space capsule wherein we all ride the message droning out over the media loudspeakers is that globalization free trade and out of control capitalism are destroying the presumably pleasant equitable balance among the economic classes the rich are getting filthy rich the poor are getting poorer and the middle class is stagnating and possibly in crisis or if not in crisis at the moment the middle class is said to be in a state of high

debunking of this middle class squeeze scare has been slow in coming in part because the ideological economics behind the inequality movement are so twisted and abstract that it might all be a case of manufactured resentment motivated by ideology is only gradually emerging the problem begins with defining middle class canada s new minister of middle class prosperity could not define middle class when asked nor could prime minister justin trudeau who came up with a clever response canadians know who s in the middle class and know what their families are facing the idea that middle class families are facing oppression under the ravages of global economic trends and the rise of the corporate super rich is now an accepted foundation for economic policy thanks to two decades of inequality broadcasts over the planetary speaker system the middle class crisis is now an accepted factual foundation for today s policy craze international agencies such as the oecd have been leading the movement in a report in april titled under pressure the squeezed middle class the oecd of which canada is a member claimed that every generation since the baby boom has seen the middle income group shrink and its economic influence weaken other oecd reports include growing unequal 2008 divided we stand 2011 in it together 2015 and a broken social elevator 2018 advertisement 4 story

the 800 page english version of french neo marxist economist thomas piketty s new book capital and ideology will be published his first book capitalism in the 21st century lit an inequality fire in 2014 with its claim that capitalism inevitably leads to increasing inequality excess wealth accumulation among the 10 per cent the 1 per cent and 01 per cent also coming is the first 2020 issue of foreign affairs magazine the future of capitalism mostly a collection of essays based on claims of growing inequality and calls for more government intervention guaranteed to trigger new bouts of pre election class warfare in the united states but is it true is the middle class being squeezed is poverty increasing is inequality really growing because the rich gobble up more and more income and wealth the answer is likely not not around the world not in the developing or the developed world and certainly not in canada a recent cover story in the economist inequality illusions why wealth and income gaps are not what they appear documents how many of the claims of inequality activists and economists do not hold up what exists in fact is a bloody academic battle over inequality with a wide range of economists lining up to contradict the claims of piketty and others that inequality is growing that the middle class has stagnated that the world needs more taxation on the wealthy advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the economist piece reports errors conceptual muddles statistical manipulations exaggerations and other factors that suggest much of the inequality case rests on dubious economic models and analysis is there a gap between the rich and the other classes certainly but it may not be anywhere near as large as claimed also there is reason to believe such gaps are irrelevant beyond ideology and the desire to manufacture more resentment contrary evidence is everywhere including canada globally the expansion of the middle class in recent decades has been massive according to economist homi kharas at the brookings institution in the unprecedented expansion of the global middle class kharas wrote that the size of the middle class has doubled since 2000 alone there were about 3 2 billion people in the global middle class at the end of 2016 500 million more than i had previously estimated this implies that in two to three years there might be a tipping point where a majority of the world s population for the first time ever will live in middle class or rich households advertisement 6 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content meanwhile world poverty levels have plunged according the world bank nearly 1 1 billion fewer people are living in extreme poverty than in 1990 the bank reports that the world attained the first millennium development goal target to cut the 1990 poverty rate in half by 2015 five years ahead of schedule in 2010 in the united states reports of middle class decline have been greatly exaggerated according to stephen rose at the urban institute in washington in a report last december rose summarized statistics debunking one of the main piketty inequality claims piketty has said that the top 10 per cent of americans had walked off with between 50 and 100 per cent of u s economic growth between 1979 and 2014 the actual number is much lower piketty also once claimed that the median income in the u s which statistically captures the middle class had fallen by 10 per cent during the same decades but other studies including one from the congressional budget office actually show an increase in median household income of up to 50 per cent in canada the mid income classes have been expanding in number with rising incomes defining the middle class is somewhat arbitrary but the oecd definition classifies middle class as individuals living in households with incomes 200 per cent above the median and 75 per cent below the median the median household after tax income in canada in 2017 was 59 800 which means that half were above and half were below

the past 20 years the period during which the middle class has allegedly been squeezed and abandoned canada s upper income households have also increased 700 000 over the past 20 years implying that many of the former mid income households rose to the upper income category lower income households have also increased in number but their incomes have risen as indicated by the rise in the median income and per capita household spending whether inequality however defined is growing or not seems irrelevant in an economy enjoying a middle class boom in a tide of rising real incomes financial

washington afp a wave of debt in emerging and developing nations has grown faster and larger than in any period of the last five decades and could end with another crisis the world bank warned thursday and if the wave breaks it could be more damaging since it would engulf private companies in addition to governments at a time when economic growth is sluggish according to a new report that covers four debt surges from 1970 2018 the size speed and breadth of the latest debt wave should concern us all world bank president david malpass said in a statement clearly it s time for course corrections he added the world bank and international monetary fund have been sounding the warning about growing global debt for years but the latest report is even more stark and turned up the volume on its calls for governments to take steps to prevent a debt crisis imf chief kristalina georgieva on thursday said developing nations in africa especially need to strike the right balance between financing development and a manageable debt level the imf reported that total global debt rose to 188 trillion at the end of 2018 equivalent to nearly 230 percent of the world s economy the world bank report highlights the striking debt surge in emerging and developing economies which is the largest fastest and most broad based in emdes in the past 50 years after declining during the 2008 global financial crisis amid very low borrowing costs in just eight years since 2010 debt in these countries climbed to an all time high of roughly 170 percent of gdp or about us 55 trillion much of the growth was incurred by china equivalent to more than us 20 trillion but beijing also has become a large lender for low income countries the report warns that the current debt wave could follow the historical pattern and culminate in financial crises in these economies especially if interest rates spike or if there is a sudden global shock better debt management improved tax collection flexible exchange rates and tighter fiscal rules to manage spending could help avert a crisis and soften the blow if one occurs the world bank said towering though it may seem the latest global wave of debt can be managed malpass said but leaders need to recognize the danger and move countries into safer territory in terms of the quality and quantity of investment and debt sooner rather than later his imf counterpart georgieva in a blog post thursday repeated her concern about the massive increase in commercial borrowing in africa accounting for 70 percent of the ballooning of debt she urged governments in the region to find a balanced approach to managing debt and development africa is seeking to find the right balance between financing development and safeguarding debt sustainability between investing in people and upgrading infrastructure between long term development objectives and pressing immediate needs she said

the battle for the heart of the us democratic party is on as senators bernie sanders and elizabeth warren challenge the status quo by promoting radical policy programs such as a medicare for all system and an energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables despite their differences both candidates consult the political economy research institute peri at the university of massachusetts amherst for policy advising professor robert pollin founding co director of peri was in athens recently to deliver a speech titled the path to global climate stabilization through a global green new deal at the goulandris national history museum and kathimerini caught up with him to learn more about the plan and its impact on different economic sectors its main goal is a zero emissions economy in the next 30 years on meeting pollin you immediately realize that the professor takes great pleasure in tearing down myths the first being that if the us implemented universal healthcare the middle class would suffer a blow he argues that on the contrary households could potentially save between us 2 000 and us 8 000 a year on health costs additionally people that don t have full coverage would stop avoiding treatment for budgetary reasons according to a study conducted by the federal reserve system 30 to 40 percent of households would be unable to pay us 300 400 in the case of an emergency pollin mentions the case of a woman whose leg was caught between the train and the platform in the boston subway and who pleaded with bystanders not to call an ambulance as she couldn t afford it this is the type of incident that is gradually persuading us citizens that such a healthcare plan would benefit them the national nurses union was the first to advocate a universal healthcare system doctors too are complaining about the current state of affairs they may be at liberty to charge their patients as much as they want but a lot are still in debt from medical school additionally their work is being undermined by having to fill in endless administrative forms mainly for insurance and a universal healthcare system would save them much needed time and enable them to take more patients in some labor unions are opposed to such a system because they fear that all their hard fought gains would go to waste i said you fought for but if you get universal healthcare then you can fight for something else you can fight for wages and other things pollin says pointing out that when gm workers went on strike the first thing the company said was we re canceling healthcare for everybody in the usa 18 percent of gdp goes toward healthcare whereas in germany that figure is only 11 percent and they get better results that 7 percent difference which represents us 1 5 trillion is spent on the pharmaceutical industry and insurance you want choice ok it costs 1 5 trillion pollin said the transition nevertheless shutting down the health insurance sector would lead to nearly 2 million job losses so how could the transition be carried out smoothly my plan was the first to look at the transition you have to give good benefits retraining relocation says pollin job losses from the green new deal would be tiny by comparison if you add up all the people that work in oil and gas coal and all the support industries in the us it s only about 800 000 in a total labor force of 160 million he says pointing out that the gnd will create more than enough jobs to compensate for that loss ever since it became known that pollin has informally acted as a consultant for the sanders and warren campaigns he has been receiving calls from journalists on a near daily basis kathimerini asked him how he thought the establishment of the democratic party would handle a sanders or warren candidacy if one of those two wins the nomination the corporate democrats are not going to have much choice the republican establishment didn t want trump he was literally a joke comedians were making fun of him on tv every night but the republicans learned to put up with him since he won sanders and warren have the environmentalists and the healthcare activists behind them they represent a big part of the democratic party activist group if it s blatant that the corporate democrats will try to block sanders or warren that ll be the end of the democrats he responded adding that even if one of them makes it to the white house they still have a long line of obstacles ahead of them as they will surely be forced to make compromises to illustrate how progressive politics is often prevented from being transformed into policy pollin offers the example of the dodd frank act of which he had drafted one section on derivatives trading and futures markets the law was enacted during the obama administration and was made to reinforce financial regulations and protect consumers the financial markets were strongly opposed to it at first wall street hated it the bill is 10 000 pages long in the bill a lot of the things said this is the principle and then we re going to work out the details and then wall street realized that once you get into the real stipulations the details they would have 100 lawyers and the activists on the left would maybe have one maybe and therefore the wall street lawyers were able to modify things he told kathimerini that s what happened gnd ideal for greece the economic transformation required to avert the worse of the climate crisis is also at the top of pollin s agenda according to his calculations we would need to spend around 2 5 to 3 percent of global gdp per year to achieve a global zero emissions economy within 30 years pollin who has been researching energy transition for the last 12 years is convinced that the green new deal would boost economic activity and create more jobs than those lost from shutting down the fossil fuels sector you take 1 million euros out of coal and put it in green investment it s about the same job creation 20 jobs per million euros he says public investment would kick start the whole process funding the green economy in projects such as retrofitting the entire stock of public buildings and reclamation of toxic land at abandoned lignite mines but there s a lot in it for the private sector as well i was doing this consulting for the obama administration the first two years of his administration under obama 12 percent of the stimulus program that was us 90 billion which was real money most of the money was incentives for private businesses it was not directly public investment so if you knew how to take advantage of government subsidies you could do ok that s basically the way through which private businesses can latch into this let s say you have your stocks in oil too bad shift to something else according to pollin a gnd could be ideal in a country with the economic structure of greece because it creates opportunities for small and medium sized businesses collaborative projects as well and energy communities but not for big monopolies but why should a country with such a small global impact need to transform its economy according to pollin all countries have an excuse not to participate in the green economy but they must take radical action if they are serious about climate change small economies none of them individually matter the only ones that matter are china and the us and the big countries of the european union but if you add up all the small countries and their emissions grow proportionate to economic growth we break through the climate budget anyway even if the us gets to zero emissions when asked about where greece would find the money for an energy transition pollin s answer is that first the eu which claims to be the most committed against climate change needs to forgive the country s debt only then will greece be able to fund the transition the way to prove serious is to cut the debt repayment requirements for greece in half and the other half finances the gnd if the eu wants zero emissions by 2050 they must let countries concentrate on building their own green economy demand is key pollin does not believe in divestment he feels it is basically the same thing as selling stocks and they can always end up in profit driven rather than ethically driven hands he told kathimerini that the key to abandoning fossil fuels in favor of renewable energy is a drop in demand saudi arabia s oil is mostly exported if other countries aren t buying their oil it doesn t matter what the saudis want the ultimate constraint is demand if consumers step back investors immediately get the message at umass amherst students had a sit in and pressured the university into shutting down its gas plant and starting to rely on renewable energy sources instead the university chancellor decided to stop burning fossil fuels and stop worrying about the stock market setting a great example for everyone to follow it s that kind of attitude that will really move things
