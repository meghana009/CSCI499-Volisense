an impressive collection of 50 essays organised by the washington based bretton woods committee explores the formidable challenges ahead as gail kelly former chief executive of westpac says in 2019 bretton woods reaches its 75th anniversary here is indeed a lot to celebrate but growing and strident nationalism coupled with ardent protectionism are making the challenge much harder paul volcker former chairman of the us federal reserve encapsulates the spirit of bretton woods the belief in a common interest in international co operation the importance of certain basic rules of good behaviour with respect to exchange rates and the need for development among the multitude of emerging nations with the general agreement on tariffs and trade which went into effect as a provisional agreement in 1948 this idea of certain basic rules of good behaviour also covered trade in economic policy bretton woods means a commitment to co operation contractual obligations among nations and effective international institutions the international monetary fund the world bank group and the world trade organization today there is far more to institutionalised economic co operation than these three institutions the regional development banks created on the model of the world bank and more recently the asian infrastructure investment bank and the new development bank sponsored by china also play an important role two informal groups of countries have also been influential the g7 which includes the seven largest high income economies and since 2008 the g20 which includes the leading emerging economies and the eu advertisement if we judge the era that followed bretton woods by economic performance we have to conclude it has been a triumph in their chapter nicholas stern of the london school of economics and amar bhattacharya of the brookings institution note that overall world income per capita has grown by a factor of four since 1950 as population has roughly trebled between 1950 and 2017 the volume of world trade increased 39 times the share of the world s population living on less than 2 a day at 2011 purchasing power parity levels declined from about 75 per cent in 1950 to 10 per cent in 2015 global inequality has also fallen significantly during the past few decades largely because of the rapid rise of the large asian emerging economies especially china and india moreover the world economy was also far more stable than it had been in the first half of the 20th century these advances did not occur because everything went smoothly the regime of fixed but adjustable exchange rates collapsed in 1971 when the nixon administration broke the dollar s link to gold inflation then exploded upwards in the 1970s to be tamed at substantial cost in the 1980s financial liberalisation delivered waves of banking and debt shocks which culminated in the global and eurozone crises of 2007 13 bouts of protectionism erupted not least in the early 1980s in the us in response to the strong dollar and the success of japan a trading system founded on the principle of non discrimination also morphed into one with a host of preferential that is discriminatory trading agreements overall the bretton woods ideal of structured co operation worked extraordinarily well but new challenges have emerged perhaps the most important is the shift away from western and above all us dominance with the rise to superpower status of china on some measures china already has the biggest economy in the world advertisement also significant has been the rise of nationalism and protectionism and the consequent threat of fragmentation not just globally but also within the west mr trump s idea of america first and his passionate belief in protectionism are a fundamental repudiation of the animating spirit and institutional structure of the order the us created after the second world war the emergence of this very different spirit is in turn a consequence of economic changes that have undermined trust both in the idea of an open world economy and in the people and institutions that manage it important causal factors in high income countries have been deindustrialisation rising inequality the slowdown in productivity growth and the shock of the unexpected financial crises today unlike 40 years ago it is the citizens of the high income countries not of the emerging world who are most suspicious of global economic integration deglobalisation has begun catherine mann former chief economist of the oecd points to declines in the trade intensity of growth and the unravelling of global value chains since the financial crisis this she argues may also be one reason for slowing productivity growth cross border financial flows also peaked in 2007 another shift is growing pressures on the environment especially climate change the world it is now argued has moved from the holocene to the anthropocene a planet largely shaped both for good and ill by human activity to this must be added technological change more recently these are undermining the comparative advantage of developing countries in labour intensive manufacturing they are threatening large scale disruption to patterns of employment they are creating new cross border flows notably of data they are transforming payment systems and are likely to have even bigger effects on monetary systems so how is a co operative global economic order to be sustained this question can be addressed narrowly in terms of institutional purpose and architecture and more broadly in terms of international relations advertisement the focus of the essays is on the former it includes the management of monetary and financial systems the future of development policy and the prospects for the wto and world trade which were all part of the debates at and around bretton woods it includes newer areas for co operation such as corruption climate change fragile states migration and technology one traditional issue is the reliance on the us dollar in the global monetary system this was unresolved at bretton woods when john maynard keynes proposed a global currency in this volume jean claude trichet former president of the european central bank argues that a supranational currency remains impossible but a bigger role for sdr special drawing rights a reserve asset created within the imf is not managing the global monetary system as china s renminbi becomes more important will be a further challenge another well known issue is financial stability on this mark carney governor of the bank of england and former chair of the financial stability board is boldly optimistic the radical programme of g20 reforms has made the global financial system safer simpler and fairer whether it has made it sufficiently safer will only be known in time a depressingly familiar issue is the future of the trading system global liberalisation has halted the us has not only moved in a decisively protectionist direction but has contravened the letter and spirit of the wto it has also sought to neuter the dispute settlement system of the wto by rendering it inquorate on development sri mulyani indrawati indonesian finance minister and former chief operating officer at the world bank emphasises the need for vast investment if today s ambitious sustainable development goals are to be met direct funding by multilateral development banks including the new chinese led ones will be totally inadequate funding will have to come largely from the private sector david miliband head of the international rescue committee and former uk foreign secretary stresses that more than 40 per cent of the extremely poor now live in conflict affected or fragile states this is also the origin of much of the global migration pressure thus if extreme poverty and the flood of refugees are to be eliminated such conflicts need to be addressed so too he argues does the pressure on the relatively poor countries that are now host to 84 per cent of the world s refugees advertisement climate change is making such problems worse yet selfish high income countries notably the us have apparently decided not to tackle this challenge sanctions on such behaviour may have to be considered another important challenge is corruption discussed by frank vogl co founder of transparency international and william rhodes former senior vice chairman at citigroup they write that imf officials privately concede that they need to do more by explicitly raising issues of illicit finance with the governments of major western developed economies whose capital markets provide safe investment havens for so much of the illicit cash yes that includes above all american and british capital markets these perfectly proper questions about how institutions are to be reformed and new challenges to be tackled including the need to reflect changes in global power in institutional governance are to a degree secondary the bigger question is whether the necessary level of co operation is to be sustained at all today s economic challenges are met by a resurgent nationalism yet countries are not islands if anything global co operation is more important today than 75 years ago but it has also become more difficult the realist school will tell us that co operation is a pipe dream international relations are always about the brutal politics of power but is a system realistic if it leads to disastrous results for everybody only if conflict is the only imaginable system now that the world does not have a dominant superpower the old hierarchical us led system is no longer feasible but some sort of co operative system is still essential advertisement keyu jin of the london school of economics one of only two chinese contributors lays out a novel way of thinking about this challenge she argues that economic networks may supersede relations among nations and render traditional notions of hegemony redundant china she suggests may end up not as another hegemon but as a global network leader the big point prof jin makes is a central one how do we create enough order and co operation to sustain our complex interdependent and environmentally stressed world without a hegemon most countries want to follow it can only be through networks of networks set within global commitments bretton woods shaped the post second world war era not so much because of the specific agreements reached but because of the commitment to institutionalised co operation it embodied this commitment has remained vital through the twists and turns of the subsequent 75 years and remains as important as ever institutions must indeed develop new challenges must be met yet if the world is unable to sustain and develop the underlying commitment to co operation global progress may not be sustained and the challenges we confront may not be met morgenthau was correct mr trump is wrong it is as simple and as difficult as that
as pakistan joins the imf programme for the 13th time to get 6 billion over a period of three years to stabilize its shattered economy there has been a lot of discussion focusing on the imf conditionalities and their consequences for pakistan s economy already before the formal start of the programme people are facing the consequences in the form of soaring inflation increase in taxes cut in government spending and increase in oil and gas prices gas has increased by 190 percent and electrify will be hiked to rs2 5 per unit from the next month and the last but not least the market determined value of the rupee devaluation of the rupee and increase in taxes have given unprecedented rise to inflation which at the moment stands at 9 4 percent and at the end of the year will hike to 13 percent and next year will be soaring to 20 percent as inflation has been triggered by new taxes pakistan has promised to increase the fbr s total tax collection from rs3 94tr last year to rs5 5tr this year and to rs10 5tr by 2023 24 a cumulative increase of rs6 564tr in five years as such the tax to gdp ratio will soar to 15 3 percent from 10 4 percent this year the increase in the tax is being resisted by businesses employees and common people the other factor that is responsible for inflation is the unprecedented devaluation of the rupee against dollar when imran khan took over as premier of the country the dollar was at rs128 but now it is at around rs160 the reason for the drop in the value of the rupee said to be the outcome of political indecisiveness and the agreement with the imf that the market will determine the value of the dollar this is being opposed by the business community as it seeks government intervention to stabilize the dollar otherwise pakistan s businesses suffer a great deal in light of the tightened monetary and fiscal policies under imf conditions a very bleak economic scenario is being depicted according to fitch a us based global research house pakistan s real gdp growth for fy2018 19 and fy19 20 will be at 3 2 percent and 2 7 percent respectively obviously the reason for low growth is said to be the strict imf conditionalities due to the bumpy relationship between islamabad and the imf the imf considers pakistan a country with deviant behaviour often failing to complete its programmes consequently this time around pakistan faces harsh conditions of strict financial discipline most of the countries joining the imf refuse to accept such strict conditions as they want to have autonomy in decision making pertaining to financial matters even a small african country like botswana opted for independent advisers from public institutions and private foundation when it joined the imf for structural facilities from 1961 to 1997 sadly our current government has found it difficult to resist the harsh and anti people conditions of imf the imf executive board has formally approved the programme and released 1 65 billion the government expects the imf financial package to help stabilize the rupee against the dollar and spur growth i have the opposite view as empirical studies show that imf programmes create more economic and financial political instability because of their anti poor and pro rich nature the problem with the imf programme is that it is loaded with the ideology of the free market there is nothing wrong with free market ideology but it works well where people have strong demand to which market responds with supply but here in pakistan 80 percent of the population lives on 2 dollars a day on which basis it cannot make any demand and which is why it always looks towards the state for health education and subsidies on food oil gas and essential utilities of daily life but this role of the state is being scuttled under the imf programme pm imran khan often speaks of the welfare state of medina but such imf programmes trim the welfare role of the state and create an economy with a strong market and weak state apparently the staff agreement signed between the imf and the government of pakistan states that it would promote economic stability and growth i think that is mere myth the reality is totally different imf programmes produce more negative effects on the economy with appalling social consequences to dig out and understand the reality we need to look into the conditions that changed the imf s role from bailing out countries and people to bailing out bankers the 1970s and 80s witnessed an economic recession following an increase in oil prices due to the oil embargo of 1973 and 1979 developing countries faced the liquidity crunch as they had to pay more for oil imports oil producing countries flushed with cash after an increase in oil prices invested their money with international banks which was recycled to latin american governments on high interest rates as loan under the brady plan 1989 in the meantime the us increased interests rates due to which debt payments also increased making it harder for the debt ridden latin american countries to pay back their debts depreciation of the local currencies against the dollar made things worse as it increased the amount of debt and lowered the purchasing power the contraction of world trade in 1981 had already caused the prices of primary resources to fall so in the face of mounting debt mexico and brazil were not able to serve their debts and unilaterally declared a 90 day moratorium and requested renegotiation of payments default on their part posed a direct threat to the global financial system to collapse to prevent the system from collapse the washington consensus consensus among the washington based three institutions the us treasury imf and world bank emerged as a response to tackle the threat under the washington consensus the mandate of the imf was changed and new loans with strict conditions were provided in return for reforms the imf forced loan seeking countries to adopt free market capitalism reduce government spending increase taxes private public enterprises liberalize the economy and allow capital account liberalization and devalue dcurrency briefly the purpose was extraction of money through debt payments the effects of imf programmes were very grave income and imports dropped economic growth stagnated unemployment rose high inflation soared reducing the purchasing power of middle classes and real wage dropped between 20 and 40 percent the investment and revenue generated from new taxes were used to pay back the debt instead of addressing social issues austerity programmes lowered government spending and further deteriorated social fractures in a society with aggravating inequalities and poverty conditions all these developments caused intense anger towards the imf amongst the people the whole purpose of the imf programme in mexico and brazil was to extract wealth and transfer that wealth to international private banks in the form of debt payments going to the imf for stabilization of the economy has led to an increase in taxes gas and electricity bills and inflation which has made the lives of common people even more miserable it is time for government to look for alternative ways and means to address the economic ills country is facing and find a proper treatment while referring to the prescription by the imf for ailing economies like pakistan joseph stiglitz describes the imf shock therapy as a cure worse than disease as people suffer more under imf conditionalities than no conditionality mexico was an example prior to the 1982 debt crisis mexico enjoyed a period of economic stability the writer works as professor in thedepartment of management sciences at szabist karachi email isran szanist edu pk

ifrs measures including retail industry metrics this press release makes reference to certain non ifrs measures including certain retail industry metrics these measures are not recognized measures under ifrs do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by ifrs and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies rather these measures are provided as

1 review of financial economic and monetary developments and policy options financial market developments mr cœuré reviewed the latest financial market developments since the governing council s previous monetary policy meeting on 9 10 april 2019 us trade negotiations with both china and mexico had progressively deteriorated negatively impacting global equity markets and pushing equity risk premia higher bond yields had declined to multi year lows in foreign exchange markets the euro and the us dollar had appreciated in nominal effective terms reflecting mainly the weakness in emerging market currencies and in particular the chinese renminbi at the same time the euro had continued its gradual depreciation against the us dollar a trend observed since the start of 2018 that likely related to changes in the relative growth outlook in bond markets the yield on the ten year german government bond had declined by more than 70 basis points since october 2018 to a record low level of 22 basis points the ten year us treasury yield had fallen even more by around 100 basis points over the same period tentative evidence suggested that the recent decline in global bond yields signalled a broader reappraisal of the global growth and monetary policy outlook by markets rather than a temporary flight to safety first yield spreads of higher yielding euro area sovereign bonds with the exception of italian government bonds had declined in recent weeks unlike in periods of broad risk aversion when these yield spreads would tend to rise against german bonds the yields on ten year spanish and portuguese sovereign bonds were trading at their lowest levels on record also euro area five year forward inflation linked swap rates five years ahead had continued their trend decline of recent months and were currently only marginally higher than the record low of 1 25 observed in the aftermath of the 2016 brexit referendum in the united states marked based inflation expectations had also declined more recently a third factor that suggested increasing concerns over the growth outlook related to recent developments in the spread between the ten year bund and the overnight index swap ois rate this had been a good proxy for scarcity in bond markets since the start of the year with bund yields falling steadily ois rates had fallen even more rapidly in turn this suggested that the recent fall in bund yields by and large reflected a revision of the medium term outlook for monetary policy concerning both the level of the key policy rates and the uncertainty around them the eonia forward curve also showed that there had been a reassessment of the monetary policy outlook in the euro area since october 2018 the curve had flattened notably and more recently a significant shift had been observed since the governing council s april 2019 monetary policy meeting there had also been notable changes in the shape of the us treasury yield curve in recent weeks the curve had become inverted in the belly of the curve consistent with expectations of a rate cut the global environment and economic and monetary developments in the euro area mr lane reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area regarding the external environment global manufacturing and trade remained weak the global composite output purchasing managers index pmi had decreased in may pointing to some deceleration in global activity in the second quarter of 2019 reflecting the weakness in manufacturing global trade had remained subdued in the first quarter of 2019 annual consumer price inflation in the oecd area in april had increased to 2 5 from 2 3 in march driven by an increase in core and energy price inflation annual cpi inflation excluding food and energy had stood at 2 2 in april up from 2 1 in march oil prices had declined by 11 since the governing council s april monetary policy meeting and now hovered around usd 62 3 per barrel over the same horizon food prices had declined by almost 4 and metal prices had decreased by 2 7 while the euro was broadly unchanged against the us dollar but had appreciated somewhat in nominal effective terms turning to the euro area economy real gdp growth had rebounded unexpectedly in the first quarter of 2019 with eurostat s second release putting the increase at 0 4 quarter on quarter this rebound had been supported by some temporary factors especially in the manufacturing sector however survey indicators pointed to weaker growth ahead turning to the components of domestic demand real private consumption had posted strong quarter on quarter growth of 0 5 this had in part been driven by a recovery in car purchases following the weakness in the fourth quarter of 2018 stemming from the introduction of the worldwide harmonised light vehicle test procedure wltp as well as by some normalisation in france following weakness caused by the yellow vest protests real residential investment had grown strongly in the first quarter of 2019 at 1 5 quarter on quarter supported by mild weather conditions machinery and equipment investment had increased by 1 2 quarter on quarter in the first quarter of 2019 remaining relatively resilient in the face of the recent growth slowdown the prolonged persistence of uncertainties posed however a downside risk to the outlook for business investment regarding labour market developments according to eurostat s flash estimate euro area employment had increased by 0 3 quarter on quarter in the first quarter of 2019 a rate similar to those recorded in the previous two quarters moreover the composite pmi on employment stood at 52 7 in may pointing towards continued positive overall growth the indicator had held up in services but in manufacturing it had declined below the no change threshold of 50 for the first time since august 2014 extra and intra euro area exports both showed initial signs of stabilisation at the same time leading indicators continued to signal weak trade developments ahead these developments were also reflected in the june 2019 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area which projected annual real gdp growth at 1 2 in 2019 and 1 4 in the subsequent two years while recent hard data for the first quarter of 2019 had turned out better than expected the subsequent quarters had been revised down mainly on account of weaker global trade turning to price developments according to eurostat s flash estimate annual hicp inflation had decreased to 1 2 in may from 1 7 in april mainly due to lower energy and services price inflation hicp inflation excluding energy and food had decreased to 0 8 in may from 1 3 in april looking through the easter related volatility measures of underlying inflation remained muted at the same time according to the latest information wage pressures had continued to build up annual growth in negotiated wages in the euro area had been 2 2 in the first quarter of 2019 unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2018 in the june 2019 eurosystem staff projections annual hicp inflation was expected to increase from 1 3 in 2019 to 1 4 in 2020 and 1 6 in 2021 compared with the march 2019 ecb staff projections the outlook for hicp inflation had been revised up by 0 1 percentage points for 2019 and down by 0 1 percentage points for 2020 but remained unchanged for 2021 the inflation projections were in line with the forecasts of other institutions market based inflation expectations had declined at all horizons since the governing council s april monetary policy meeting despite these measures being close to historic lows there had been no meaningful increase in deflation risk in comparison with the situation in 2015 or 2016 at the same time survey based measures of longer term expected inflation had remained stable the longer term expectation in the latest march survey of professional forecasters stood at 1 8 0 1 percentage points below the survey result recorded over the period from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2018 moreover other surveys of long term inflation expectations namely by consensus economics and the euro zone barometer remained broadly in line with the ecb s inflation aim euro area financial conditions had tightened marginally but had remained looser relative to the start of the year since the governing council s april monetary policy meeting the slight tightening in euro area financial conditions could mainly be ascribed to heightened trade tensions which had caused the euro to appreciate in nominal effective terms and equity prices to decline the decline in equity markets had occurred despite an improvement in corporate earnings expectations meanwhile the expected timing of an ecb policy rate lift off had shifted out substantially with some market perceived chance of rate cuts turning to money and credit developments the annual growth rate of broad money m3 had picked up in april to 4 7 in year on year terms thereby remaining rather resilient to the declining mechanical contribution of app purchases from a counterpart perspective while private credit continued to be the main source of money creation since july 2018 the decline in the contribution of the app had been replaced by external monetary inflows and to a lesser extent by bank credit to general government at the euro area level the composite lending rates for non financial corporations and for households for house purchase stood at 1 62 and 1 75 respectively falling to new historical lows deposit rates remained stable at very low levels as regards fiscal policy after 0 5 in 2018 the euro area general government deficit ratio was projected to increase this year to 0 9 of gdp and to remain constant thereafter despite falling interest payments this reflected a mildly expansionary fiscal stance monetary policy considerations and policy options summing up mr lane remarked that while the most recent hard data for first quarter economic activity were better than expected in part due to temporary factors weak global trade and the prolonged presence of uncertainties continued to be a drag on euro area growth developments this was reflected in another downward revision of the growth outlook in the june 2019 eurosystem staff projections bank lending conditions for firms and households remained very favourable even if overall financial conditions had tightened marginally since the governing council s april monetary policy meeting largely on account of the re escalation of trade tensions the balance of risks remained tilted to the downside despite the downward revision to the growth projections largely on account of persistent sources of uncertainty relating to the international environment these uncertainties could weaken or delay the recovery in external demand beyond what was already reflected in the june projections and further weigh on investment and consumption trade tensions had re escalated uncertainty about brexit was extended in time and fragilities in emerging market economies remained despite signs of stabilisation in some of them hicp inflation had decreased in may mainly on account of temporary factors measures of underlying inflation had continued to move sideways even if labour cost pressures had continued to strengthen and broaden as labour markets had tightened further the june 2019 eurosystem staff projections broadly confirmed the march outlook for inflation which would reach only 1 6 in 2021 some distance below the governing council s inflation aim market based measures of inflation expectations had further declined mr lane therefore saw the need to update the monetary policy stance to provide the monetary accommodation necessary for inflation to remain on a sustained path towards levels that were below but close to 2 over the medium term accordingly he proposed the following adjustments first to extend the calendar element of the ecb s forward guidance on the path of interest rates to at least through the first half of 2020 second to confirm the forward guidance on reinvestment and third based on the assessment of the bank based transmission channel of monetary policy and the developments in the economic outlook to set the interest rate of the upcoming series of targeted longer term refinancing operations tltro iii equal to the average rate on the main refinancing operations mro plus 10 basis points over the life of the respective operation and as low as the average deposit facility rate plus 10 basis points for those banks whose eligible net lending exceeded a benchmark this struck a reasonable balance between acknowledging the sound developments in bank lending and the importance of preserving the accommodative stance these measures were appropriate in the current economic environment and would provide the necessary monetary accommodation for inflation to move towards levels that were below but close to 2 over the medium term looking ahead the governing council needed to be determined to act in case of adverse contingencies it should stand ready to ease the monetary policy stance further by adjusting all of its instruments as appropriate to achieve the ecb s price stability objective possible measures could include extending forward guidance further restarting net asset purchases and decreasing policy rates in addition following on from what had been communicated in april 2019 the governing council could indicate that at the current point in time the positive contribution of negative interest rates to the accommodative monetary policy stance and to the sustained convergence of inflation was not undermined by possible side effects on bank based intermediation however the governing council should continue to monitor carefully the bank based transmission channel of monetary policy and the case for mitigating measures complementing mr lane s remarks mr cœuré pointed out that in its communication of 7 march 2019 the ecb had specified that further details on the precise terms of tltro iii would be communicated in due course the executive board was now putting forward proposals on the remaining details of the tltro iii programme taking into account a thorough assessment of the bank based transmission channel of monetary policy as well as further developments in the economic outlook but also considering the experience gained with tltro i and tltro ii a technical press release to be published after the governing council meeting would set out details regarding tltro iii pricing the definition of the lending benchmark and the performance target the definition of tltro iii groups the borrowing allowance and reference periods as well as the concentration limits to be applied to every tltro iii operation the eurosystem would provide further communication to counterparties in due course 2 governing council s discussion and monetary policy decisions economic and monetary analyses with regard to the economic analysis members broadly shared the assessment of the outlook for economic activity in the euro area provided by mr lane in his introduction despite the somewhat better than expected data for the first quarter of 2019 the most recent information indicated that global headwinds continued to weigh on the euro area outlook the prolonged presence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors the rising threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets was leaving its mark on economic sentiment at the same time further employment gains and increasing wages continued to underpin the resilience of the euro area economy and gradually rising inflation this assessment was broadly reflected in the june 2019 eurosystem staff projections which foresaw annual real gdp increasing by 1 2 in 2019 1 4 in 2020 and 1 4 in 2021 compared with the march 2019 ecb staff projections the outlook for real gdp growth had been revised up for 2019 and down for 2020 and 2021 considering the outlook and risks for the external environment members highlighted the ongoing weakness in global trade and concern was expressed about more pervasive and prolonged uncertainties in the external environment and their adverse impact on the global growth outlook for some time to come persistent uncertainty and trade tensions were negatively affecting international production and supply chains with likely repercussions on investment plans risks to the external environment were generally seen to be increasing or to have already increased notably related to the deteriorating trade relationship between the united states and china and to the continuing uncertainty regarding the united kingdom s withdrawal from the eu it was underlined that markets appeared to see heightened trade conflicts as a proxy for a more fundamental shift in the multilateral world order against this background the risks to the external environment were assessed to remain on the downside on account of the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors the threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets turning to euro area activity members noted that recent data had been mixed with real gdp having risen by 0 4 quarter on quarter in the first quarter of 2019 following an increase of 0 2 in the fourth quarter of 2018 however further economic data and survey information pointed to somewhat weaker growth in the second and third quarters this reflected ongoing weakness in international trade in an environment of prolonged global uncertainty which was weighing in particular on the euro area manufacturing sector at the same time the euro area services and construction sectors were showing resilience and the labour market was continuing to improve in this context it was argued that in recent economic indicators a gap had opened between hard data notably on employment and wages which remained supportive of domestic demand and some of the confidence indicators and market perceptions which seemed to be more negative attention was drawn to an apparent dichotomy between economic projections and prevailing market perceptions of the outlook as reflected in market prices both globally and for the euro area a view was expressed that markets might be prone to overreaction and overshooting while economic projections tended to be somewhat sluggish in revising the outlook and subject to mean reversion the point was made that financial markets tended to give greater weight to tail risks than the baseline discussing the june 2019 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections in greater detail members underlined that the baseline remained broadly consistent with the march 2019 ecb staff projections and that changes were not very substantial especially with regard to inflation compared with the downward revisions that had been observed in the march exercise it was highlighted that domestic demand had so far been rather resilient underpinned by strong employment and wage growth favourable lending conditions and support from a very accommodative monetary policy stance and a mildly expansionary fiscal stance emphasis was placed on the staff projections for employment which had been continuously revised up it was also noted that the risk of recession was low attention was also drawn to the dispersion of growth rates across countries which pointed to the observed soft patch in activity being mainly due to two of the larger euro area economies which had sizeable export oriented manufacturing sectors while activity elsewhere appeared to be more robust however it was also cautioned that the manufacturing slowdown observed in these two economies might yet spread further in view of integrated intra european value chains the balance of risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook was assessed by members to remain tilted to the downside on account of the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors the threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets with respect to the outlook for fiscal policy members noted that the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance was providing support to economic activity it was recalled that in order to reap the full benefits from the ecb s monetary policy measures other policy areas had to contribute more decisively to raising the longer term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities with regard to price developments there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by mr lane in his introduction according to eurostat s flash estimate euro area annual hicp inflation was 1 2 in may 2019 after 1 7 in april mainly reflecting lower energy and services price inflation on the basis of current futures prices for oil headline inflation was likely to decline over the coming months before rising again towards the end of the year looking through the recent volatility owing to temporary factors measures of underlying inflation remained generally muted but labour cost pressures continued to strengthen and broaden amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets looking ahead underlying inflation was expected to increase over the medium term supported by the ecb s monetary policy measures the ongoing economic expansion and rising wage growth this assessment was also broadly reflected in the june 2019 eurosystem staff projections which foresaw annual hicp inflation at 1 3 in 2019 1 4 in 2020 and 1 6 in 2021 compared with the march 2019 ecb staff projections the outlook for hicp inflation had been revised up by 0 1 percentage points for 2019 and revised down by 0 1 percentage points for 2020 confidence in the upward movement in the path of inflation was expressed and it was underlined that the recent pronounced volatility in inflation data should be temporary and had in significant measure been due to the timing of public holidays and to methodological changes regarding seasonal adjustment in the euro area s largest economy reference was made to the downward shift in the option implied distribution of inflation expectations the five year forward inflation linked swap rate five years ahead had fallen back to levels near the previous lows recorded in september 2016 at the same time it was recalled that while technical factors might affect the information content of market based measures of inflation expectations and while no such strong deterioration could be detected in other measures notably surveys there should be no room for complacency with unit labour costs expected to decelerate somewhat over the projection horizon as productivity gains outpaced wage growth increasing profit margins were seen as the main factor behind rising inflation in the projections however it was argued that stronger profit margins might not materialise in an environment of decelerating domestic demand and in the presence of substantial cash buffers held by companies which could be used to accommodate shocks in uncertain conditions hence the pass through from wages to prices might not be observed for some time however it was also underlined that while the limited pass through from wages to prices remained a puzzle and there were uncertainties and lags in the relationship the fundamental economic forces remained in place for inflation to pick up over time with regard to the monetary analysis members widely shared the assessment provided by mr lane in his introduction the sustained rates of broad money growth were seen to reflect ongoing bank credit creation for the private sector and low opportunity costs of holding m3 the narrow monetary aggregate m1 continued to be the main contributor to broad money growth on the components side on the counterparts side lending to the non financial private sector had remained robust overall and continued to be supported by very favourable borrowing costs for firms and households across the euro area which remained close to their historical lows members also broadly shared the assessment that at current levels the ecb s negative interest rate policy continued to support loan growth and ultimately economic growth and inflation the immediate costs of the negative interest rate policy arising from banks paying a negative rate on their excess reserves and deposit facility holdings were considered to be overall limited in size so far these costs were outweighed by the overall benefits from the generation of larger lending volumes and the reduction of risks and loan loss provisions due to the more favourable macroeconomic developments fostered by negative interest rates the point was made that such findings warranted further analysis and that this assessment might not hold for lower policy rates or for horizons longer than those currently envisaged in the governing council s forward guidance monetary policy stance and policy considerations with regard to the monetary policy stance members widely shared the assessment provided by mr lane in his introduction overall financial conditions had tightened marginally since the governing council s april monetary policy meeting largely on account of the renewed escalation of trade tensions at the same time bank lending conditions for firms and households remained very favourable while further employment gains and rising wages still underpinned the resilience of the domestic economy and gradually rising inflation pressures an ample degree of monetary accommodation remained necessary to support the euro area expansion the ongoing build up of domestic price pressures and thus headline inflation developments over the medium term there was also broad agreement with the assessment that an update of the monetary policy stance was called for in the light of the prolongation of uncertainties and their implications for the inflation outlook confidence in the baseline projection and a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation continued to be warranted but inflation was still projected to reach only 1 6 in 2021 which was seen to remain some distance away from the governing council s inflation aim it was hence considered important for the governing council to demonstrate its determination to act in line with its reaction function by adjusting its monetary policy stance at the current meeting and to further prepare for adverse contingencies in the period ahead against this background members expressed broad agreement with the overall package of monetary policy proposals put forward by mr lane in his introduction first to adjust the calendar based component of the governing council s forward guidance on the key ecb interest rates to indicate that the governing council now expected rates to remain at their present levels at least through the first half of 2020 second to reiterate the governing council s forward guidance on reinvestment and third based on the assessment of the bank based transmission channel of monetary policy and the developments in the economic outlook to set the interest rate on the forthcoming tltro iii operations equal to the average mro rate plus 10 basis points over the life of the respective operation and as low as the average deposit facility rate plus 10 basis points for those banks whose eligible net lending exceeded a benchmark at the same time some nuances were expressed about individual elements of the policy package responding to the further weakening of the economic outlook and the muted inflation developments in the context of prolonged uncertainties the extension of the calendar element of the forward guidance on interest rates was widely seen as appropriate the point was made that if the calendar based component was progressively aligned with market expectations in response to changes in the macroeconomic environment the independent value of the calendar element could be seen to be diminished the forward guidance on the interest rate path nonetheless remained the principal instrument for adjusting the monetary policy stance and had proved effective moreover the extension of the calendar based component by six months was seen to be in line with a gradual approach to adjusting policy which would allow monitoring in the period ahead to see whether the observed prolonged soft patch proved to be persistent in addition it was underlined that the state contingent element embodied a powerful automatic stabiliser as indicated by the very substantial downward shift in the entire interest rate swap curve since the beginning of the year with regard to the pricing of the tltro iii operations members widely supported the proposal made by mr lane and agreed with his assessment that this struck a reasonable balance between acknowledging the solid developments in bank lending and the importance of preserving the ecb s accommodative monetary policy stance the pricing of a minimum rate at the deposit facility rate plus 10 basis points was widely seen as very favourable and maximising the policy effectiveness of the forthcoming operations some arguments were made in favour of a pricing more in line with that of tltro ii this was seen as making the contribution of tltro iii to the monetary policy stance even stronger at the same time it was acknowledged that bank lending was overall much stronger now than had been the case when tltro ii was announced in the context of their regular assessment members also broadly shared mr lane s assessment in his introduction that at the current point in time the positive contribution of negative interest rates to the accommodative monetary policy stance and to the sustained convergence of inflation was not undermined by possible side effects on bank based intermediation at the same time there was also broad agreement that the governing council should continue to monitor carefully the bank based transmission channel and the case for mitigating measures in this context it was underlined that the possible side effects of a low interest rate environment would also need to be addressed by adequate macroprudential policies a call was therefore made to strengthen the effectiveness of macroprudential frameworks and prudential tools to address possible financial stability risks arising from rates remaining at very low levels over a prolonged horizon against this background the president ascertained that all members agreed with the overall package of monetary policy proposals put forward by mr lane in his introduction which was seen as appropriate in the current economic environment to provide the monetary accommodation necessary for inflation to remain on a sustained path towards levels below but close to 2 over the medium term at the same time there was broad agreement that in the light of the heightened uncertainty which was likely to extend further into the future the governing council needed to be ready and prepared to ease the monetary policy stance further by adjusting all of its instruments as appropriate to achieve its price stability objective potential measures to be considered included the possibility of further extending and strengthening the governing council s forward guidance resuming net asset purchases and decreasing policy rates in this context it was also noted that should the environment of too low inflation continue to prevail considerations of a more strategic nature might be warranted in order to reinforce the credibility of the ecb s monetary policy and support the achievement of a sustained adjustment in inflation to its inflation aim the point was made that the governing council s communication should put more emphasis on the symmetry of its medium term aim by clarifying that deviations of inflation from the governing council s inflation aim would be tolerated in a symmetrical fashion in both directions as long as this supported the achievement of the governing council s inflation aim in a sustained manner over the medium term at the same time the point was made that care needed to be taken to ensure that any considerations of a strategic nature could not be seen as moving the goalposts at a time when it proved challenging to achieve the governing council s inflation aim monetary policy decisions and communication taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members on a proposal from the president the governing council decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 0 00 0 25 and 0 40 respectively the governing council expected the key ecb interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the first half of 2020 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels below but close to 2 over the medium term the governing council intended to continue reinvesting in full the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme for an extended period of time past the date when it started raising the key ecb interest rates and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation regarding the modalities of the new series of quarterly tltros the governing council decided that the interest rate in each operation would be set at a level that is 10 basis points above the average rate applied in the eurosystem s main refinancing operations over the life of the respective tltro for banks whose eligible net lending were to exceed a benchmark the rate applied in tltro iii would be lower and could be as low as the average interest rate on the deposit facility prevailing over the life of the operation plus 10 basis points further modalities would be set out in a technical press release to be published at the end of the press conference the members of the governing council subsequently finalised the introductory statement which the president and the vice president would as usual deliver at the press conference following the end of the current governing council meeting introductory statement press releases meeting of the ecb s governing council 5 6

menafn dailyfx how to trade geopolitical risks talking pointsthe global economy is showing increasing weakness and fragility eroding economic fortitude exposes markets to geopolitical risks examples of political threats in asia latin america and europe see our free guide to learn how touse economic news in your trading strategy analyzing geopolitical risks as 2019 continues to unfold political risks are growing increasingly relevant to watch as their capacity for inducing market wide volatility is significantly expanding globally liberal oriented ideologies that is those favoring free trade and integrated capital markets are being undermined by nationalist and populist movements the result though not always is violent volatility stemming from uncertainty against the backdrop of a slowing global economy and central banks pausing or reversing their rate hike cycles the introduction of additional uncertainty will likely create even more volatility what makes political risk so dangerous and elusive is the limited ability investors have for pricing it in traders may therefore find themselves hot under the collar as the global political landscape continues to unpredictably shift generally speaking markets do not really care about political categorizations but are more concerned with the economic policies embedded in the agenda of whoever holds the reigns of the sovereign policies that stimulate economic growth typically acts as a magnet for investors looking to park capital where it will garner the highest yield these include the implementation of fiscal stimulus plans fortifying property rights allowing for goods and capital to flow freely and dissolving growth sapping regulations if these policies create adequate inflationary pressure it could prompt the central bank to raise interest rates as a response and lead to a stronger exchange rate for the country concerned conversely if you have a government whose underlying ideological predilections go against the gradient of globalization this may cause capital flight regimes that seek to rip out the threads that have sown economic and political integration usually create a moat of uncertainty that investors do not want to traverse themes of ultra nationalism protectionism and populism have frequently shown to have market disrupting effects if a state undergoes an ideological realignment traders will assess the situation to see if it radically alters their risk reward set up if so investors may then reallocate their capital and re formulate their trading strategies that tilt the balance of risk to reward in their favor however in doing so volatility will likely follow as the reformulated trading strategy is reflected in the market wide redistribution of capital across various assets europe eurosceptic populism in italy in italy the2018 election roiled regional markets and eventually rippled almost throughout the entire financial system the ascendancy of the anti establishment right wing lega nord and ideologically ambivalent 5 star movement was founded on a campaign of populism with a built in rejection of the status quo the uncertainty accompanying this new regime was then promptly priced in and resulted in significantly volatility the risk premium for holding italy s assets rose and was reflected in an over one hundred percent spike in italian 10 year bond yields due to investors demanding a higher return for tolerating what they perceived to be a higher level of risk this was also reflected in the dramatic widening of the spread on credit default swaps on italian sovereign debt due toincreased fears that italy could be the next epicenter of another eu debt crisis eurusd eurchfplummeted as mediterranean sovereign bond yields spiked amid fears of another eurozone debt crisis theus dollar japanese yenandswiss francall gained at the expense of theeuroas investors re directed their capital to anti risk assets the euro s suffering is being prolonged by the dispute between rome and brussels over the former s budgetary ambitions the government s fiscal exceptionalism is a feature of their anti establishment nature that in turn introduced greater uncertainty and was then reflected in a weaker euro latin america nationalist populism in brazil while president jair bolsonaro is generally characterized as a fire brand nationalist with populist underpinnings the market reaction to his ascendency was met with open arms by investors his appointment of paulo guedes a university of chicago trained economist with a penchant for privatization and regulatory restructuring boosted sentiment and investor s confidence on brazilian assets ibovespa daily chart since june 2018 the benchmark ibovespa equity index has risen over 46 percent compared with only a little over 9 percent in thes p 500over the same time period during the election in october the ibovespa rose over 12 percent in one month as polls revealed that bolsonaro was going to triumph over his left wing counterpart fernando haddad ibovespa spiked almost five percent after october 7 vote and polls showed bolsonaro in the lead since bolsonaro s ascension to the presidency the oscillations in equity markets and rate of capital inflow frequently move in tandem with the level of progress on his market disrupting pension reforms investors are anticipating these structural adjustment will be strong enough to pull brazil s economy away from the precipice of a recession and toward a strong growth trajectory unburdened by unsustainable public spending asia hindu nationalism in india the re election of prime minister narendra modi was broadly welcome by markets though lingering concerns were raised about the effect of hindu nationalism on regional stability however modi also has a reputation of being a business friendly politician his election lured investors into diverting a significant amount of capital into indian assets following his ascendancy to the presidency however the optimistic outlook from investors could be undermined if risk appetite sours amid rising tensions in the region in the first breathes of 2019 india pakistan relations drastically escalated amid a skirmish over the disputed kashmir region ever since the 1947 partition the hostility between the two nuclear powers has always remained a regional risk india nifty 50 benchmark equity index s p 500 futures andaudjpyfall amid political volatility nationalist campaigns and governments are embedded with political risk because the very nature of such a regime relies on displaying strength and frequently equates compromise with capitulation in times of political volatility and economic fragility the financial impact of a diplomatic breakdown is amplified by the fact that a resolution to a dispute will likely be prolonged due to the inherently stubborn nature of nationalist regimes us president donald trump and modi employ a similar brand of strong rhetoric both on the campaign trail and within their respective administrations in a rather ironic way their ideological similarity may in fact be a force that causes a rift in diplomatic relations tensions between the two have escalated recentlywith markets worrying thatwashington may start another trade war in asia only this time it will be with india why political risks matter for trading countless studies have shown that a significant decline in living standards from war or a severe recession increases the propensity for voters to occupy radical positions on the political spectrum as such people are more likely to deviate from market friendly policies such as capital integration and trade liberalization and instead focus on measures that turn away from globalization and are deleteriously inward facing the modern globalized economy is interconnected both politically and economically and therefore any systemic shock has a high probability of echoing out into the world during times of

mixed signals left bond investors to their own interpretations the broad bloomberg barclays u s aggregate bond index generated 3 1 its highest quarterly return in over seven years despite signals of

event that is widely interpreted as signaling an impending recession through june that yield curve relationship stayed inverted and fueled expectations that the federal reserve would cut rates in the

24 a record low in june these pressures prompted the european central bank president mario draghi to reiterate that the bank would either cut interest rates or continue with asset purchases if inflation remained low the bank of japan also maintained a dovish policy it kept interest rates at negative 0 1 in june and continued to buy government bonds the euro and the yen modestly strengthened against the dollar over the quarter emerging markets were also susceptible to geopolitical pressures in june the price of argentina s sovereigns fell on the hint that a leftist candidate might

sherry bahrambeygui pricesmart s chief executive officer sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer thank you maarten good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today since our last call we ve been quite busy with club openings both of which are our new smaller format designs the first is pricesmart veraguas panama which opened on may 1st it s our first smaller format club of approximately 38 000 square feet of sales floor and although it s still early we re pleased with the reception of this club as indicated by strong membership sign up i d like to mention some things about club veraguas it s located in a more agricultural rural area of santiago de veraguas panama about a 120 miles or about three hours from our nearest clubs there this club has been specifically built in merchandise with the local market characteristics in mind we re watching it closely because if it performs as we expect we believe this broadens our opportunities for healthy growth in secondary locations within our existing market the second club opening was just two weeks ago i attended in santo domingo in the dominican republic this smaller format club is different in the sense that it s in a densely populated urban setting recognizing the demographic there we ve emphasized fresh organic and prepared foods and more specialty items merchandised with a more updated look and feel there are also additional modalities that we re testing there in club bolivar we re trying various newer initiatives to drive sales within a smaller footprint by exercising very strong sku discipline and leveraging technology that supports our ability to use alternative and efficient means to get merchandise to our members at a good value this club provides us with the opportunity to see how we can drive sales within a smaller footprint i also want to mention that we put real effort into green initiatives in practice with this club including more biodegradable packaging solar power recycled materials for the steel superstructure and use of indigenous materials in the construction although it s only been two weeks we re seeing higher than average penetration of food service sales which we attribute to the central location and the updated offering and we expect this to drive frequency and traffic to the club i have to acknowledge how impressed i was with our team that i saw firsthand in the days and nights before the opening and how meticulous they were about addressing every last detail to ensure that each of the fixed rates of merchandising are being employed it s really a beautiful club and we re excited about its prospects in this urban setting we are also getting ready for the opening of two additional clubs the next opening will be our new club in panama city panama this will be our seventh club in panama and will be followed by the opening of our fourth club in guatemala located in san cristobal our goal is to open both of these clubs by the peak holiday shopping season during q3 we also closed on a key property in a location that we ve been very excited about in cayala guatemala i m very appreciative of our real estate operations logistics and buying teams to really accelerated the pace and are working very hard to basically open four new clubs within a six to seven month period in addition to a lot of activity on the real estate front we continue our work on the development of pricesmart com our vision is to create an omni channel member experience that includes a comprehensive digital catalog of merchandise available to be picked up at or delivered from the club or a regional distribution center as well as merchandise that s available for delivery directly from our vendors that will technical difficulty and also we will include cross border shipments as we develop our omni channel capabilities we to continue to improve upon our analytics to help us better understand our members with a focus on improving their pricesmart experience this is no small task and requires promoting a culture that embraces the capabilities that come with digital transformation turning to supply chain inventory flow has improved during q3 and through june inventory levels are roughly flat relative to a year ago and that s with an additional club and the build up for the bolivar club i personally observed the improvement firsthand when i recently visited four of our clubs in the dominican one of my early efforts was to focus on efficiency of our supply chain and we re beginning to see results especially with the reduction in out of stock we continue to dedicate efforts to evaluate the most intelligent ways to effectively flow merchandise from our vendors and dcs to our clubs and ultimately to our members taking into consideration various factors changing dynamics such as china tariffs and ways to maximize the optionality and resources we re building with our regional distribution center regarding membership we are pursuing opportunities to build more on our business membership and we re investing resources to strengthen the value and the services that we can provide our business members we continue to expand on ways to provide better value for our pricesmart members for example we ve rolled out optical services and merchandise in seven clubs in costa rica which has proven to be quite successful and we currently plan to add another approximate 18 locations within the next fiscal year in several additional markets overall we re seeing traffic up in all countries even nicaragua which continues to suffer from political instability and honduras where there have been massive protests against the government and costa rica which has imposed new tax laws which imposed vat on certain products and that s had an impact of increasing prices and also there is an increase on personal income tax rates at certain levels expected to go into effect this month so now let me turn to our results with an overview of q3 total revenues were 788 6 million an increase of 0 8 over the comparable prior year period revenues consisted of primarily warehouse sales of 755 million 8 3 million in export sales 13 1 million in membership income and 12 1 million in other revenue and income net merchandising sales were 755 million an increase of 0 6 over the prior year period currency fluctuations had a negative 3 7 impact on net merchandise sales comparable net merchandise sales in our 40 clubs opened more than 13 5 month decreased by 0 8 with currency fluctuations impacting comparable sales negatively by 3 8 as a reminder we ended this quarter q3 with 42 warehouse clubs compared to 41 clubs at the end of the third quarter fiscal year 2018 net income for the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 was 14 1 million or 0 46 per share compared to 18 7 million or 0 61 per share in the comparable period last year this year s results includes a 0 09 per share impact from a combination of our ongoing investments in the development of our omni channel platform and technological capabilities costs associated with the acquisition we made in march 2018 and the operations of the legacy business associated with that acquisition turning now to sales by segment the central american segment where we had 23 clubs at quarter end had a 1 2 decrease in total merchandise sales and a 1 8 decrease in comparable sales sales were impacted by what we believe in general weakness in the economies in costa rica panama honduras and nicaragua some of those things i described a little earlier these countries contributed approximately 1 5 of the total comparable sales decrease the impact of currency on total and comparable sales to the central american segment were each negative 3 regarding the caribbean the caribbean segment where we had 12 clubs at quarter end had total merchandise sales growth of 6 5 with comparable sales growth of 2 9 jamaica and trinidad led the way in the segment reporting strong with strong same store sales growth of approximately 12 6 and 2 9 respectively and contributed 70 positive basis points to overall comparable sales aruba and usvi were also positive contributors while same store sales were adversely affected in the dr by the opening of the san isidro store the san isidro store which is not included in same store sales cannibalize sales from other clubs that are included in the calculation which had a negative impact on net comparable sales of approximately 50 basis points the impact of currency on both total and comparable sales to the caribbean segment was negative 1 1 and last colombia where we had seven clubs at quarter end had a 3 9 decrease year over year with a comparable sales decline of 4 5 the impact of currency on total and comparable sales in colombia was significant it was negative 13 and negative 13 3 respectively in terms of merchandise category highlights we saw sales increase in our overall us foods and fresh foods we saw strong growth in our seafood deli and meat department we had good us dollar comp growth in categories including canned seafood soda and beverages pet supplies tires and small appliances we were flat to slightly lower in local foods and non food with regard to membership we finished the quarter with approximately 1 6 million accounts which is a 2 4 increase fiscal year to date membership income was up by 2 2 during the quarter the 12 month renewal rate at the end of may was consistent at 85 in addition the platinum program grew 45 year over year and is now being rolled out in panama costa rica the dominican republic usvi honduras jamaica and barbados platinum memberships represented almost 3 of our total membership base and as you can see our membership base continues to grow that s a good sign for our unique business model especially considering that we are weathering some headwinds in many of these markets turning quickly to june sales which were released this week net merchandise sales were 253 1 million an increase of 3 9 versus a year ago fx fluctuations negatively impacted merchandise sales by 3 for the four weeks ended june 30 2019 comparable net merchandise sales increased by 1 9 with a negative fx impact of 3 1 in closing we have confidence in our business model and we re encouraged by the loyalty of our members and the reception we re seeing in our new location with our disciplined focus on the fixed rate and by continuing to challenge ourselves to operate more efficiently at every level of the company we believe we ll be able to drive significant revenue growth from same store sales over time we also believe that by adding new sources of growth from new clubs and new format in conjunction with our digital omni channel capability that we re strengthening our foundation to drive membership and shareholder value once again i want to especially recognize and thank our approximately 9 100 employees internationally for their dedication and commitment to our company thank you for your time i ll now turn the call over to maarten jager our chief financial officer who ll go into further detail about our third quarter results maarten o jager executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you sherry starting with margins merchandise margins for the period came in at 13 9 versus 14 6 a year ago total gross margins decreased to 16 1 from 16 6 a year ago mainly due to lower net merchandise margins along with lower margins on non merchandise revenues of our legacy aeropost business which decreased the gross margin to total revenues ratio by approximately 10 basis points offset by 30 basis points of margin increase due to the payment and reclassification of shared income generated from co branded cards sg a of the total business was 13 3 versus 12 9 a year ago warehouse club and other operations expense increased by approximately 20 basis points due to the opening of the new veraguas club in panama the remaining increase is attributable to pre opening expenses for the two clubs that had already been opened by the close of q3 and for the two other clubs which will be opened after q3 operating income was 22 million 2 8 of total revenue versus 28 4 million or 3 6 of total revenue a year ago operating income for the core warehouse club business decreased to 25 9 million versus 29 9 million a year ago again largely due to the lower net merchandise margins as well as the higher pre opening expenses for the four clubs in one calendar year moving on to tax for the quarter the effective tax rate was 34 7 the increase versus the 30 3 rate in the same quarter last year was driven largely by the loss of tax asset value incidental to us tax reform impacting us by 6 4 partially offset by the adjustment of costs incurred to expand our omni channel capabilities of 2 2 consistent with our estimates in q2 we currently expect a full year tax rate to be 36 this is higher than our first three quarters primarily due to timing of the effects from us tax reform recall from the last earning s call that aeropost the acquisition we made in march of 2018 consists of both the legacy business and our investment in the pricesmart com digital platform which we believe will drive member value in coordination with our warehouse clubs and distribution footprint the legacy aeropost business adversely impacted net income by 1 0 million for the quarter the investments into our digital platform during the past quarter adversely impacted net income by 1 8 million and finally as i ve mentioned before there are the acquisition related accounting impacts which adversely impacted net income by 0 1 million for the quarter the total of these three buckets is 2 9 million of net income impact or 0 09 per share moving on to the balance sheet which remains very strong the company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of 114 0 million an increase of 17 1 million during the first nine months of the year during the first nine months cash provided by operating activities was 113 million versus 90 8 million in the same quarter last year for a favorable swing of 22 2 million this was primarily due to improved working capital net cash used in investing activities declined by 81 2 million primarily due to the non recurring business acquisition purchased last year in other words the aeropost acquisition of 29 million along with significantly fewer purchases of short term investments investing activities for this year were primarily associated with the construction of a four new warehouse clubs again veraguas metropark bolivar and san cristobal that s in panama the dominican republic and guatemala respectively net cash used in financing activities increased 9 1 million primarily due to the regularly scheduled loan payments in summary we ve seen some headwinds in us dollar reported sales which were largely impacted by a continuation of foreign currency devaluation the fundamentals of our business as evidenced by our membership counts and renewal rates our constant currency sales overall reinforce that we have a strong business model and significant growth opportunities we will continue to focus on the six rights driving same store sales delivering on our announced real estate pipeline and launching and continuing to develop our digitally enabled omni channel platform our balance sheet liquidity and cash flow remains strong which provides a solid foundation for driving same store sales and future growth that will benefit our members and shareholders alike operator we will now turn it over to q a questions and answers operator we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions our first question comes from jon braatz of kansas city capital please proceed jon braatz kansas city capital analyst good morning sherry and maarten sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer good morning maarten o jager executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning jon braatz kansas city capital analyst well let s turn into gross margins a little bit gross margins merchandise margins came at 13 9 or i should say warehouse margins came in at 13 9 that was the lowest we ve seen since may of 2016 or third quarter of 2016 when you had to reduce margins to move some merchandise is this something is this at sort of a new level of margins that we re looking at has there been a change in competitive conditions i know you re trying to drive same store sales but is this something that we should be looking to see continue a little bit of pressure on margins sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer in short the answer is that is not our expectation we are focused on margin we had clearly some competitive dynamics that we addressed but also in focusing on improving our inventory flow there were certain markdowns that took place that allowed us to improve on the flow and help drive sales but the short answer is no there is focus on margin and there is an expectation that we ll be able to increase margin going forward maarten do you want to add anything maarten o jager executive vice president and chief financial officer no thanks sherry no that s exactly right we are focused on it and we re expecting to improve on it let me just give you a little bit more color on it some context we saw some of these margin erosion in all of our regions colombia so there is 70 basis points that you see in the numbers of reduction about 10 of that came in colombia about 40 in central america and about 20 in the caribbean but then so that s a geographic breakdown if you were to look at it from different drivers there was a bit of fx in there that impacted us there was also as sherry mentioned markdowns that we took to clear up our inventory particularly of course in non foods so we took some markdowns there and the good news from that and sherry mentioned it earlier in her remarks is that that s behind us our inventory is roughly flat year over year at the end of may 31st and that s with an additional club open and with the bolivar club that while it wasn t open as of may 31st was already receiving build up inventory in anticipation of its opening and sherry also mentioned that in visiting the dr she saw that that there was less and there was more open steel and things were flowing better so the other factor there is some competitive pressure but i would not say that that s the primary factor particularly in one of our markets in the caribbean jon so then stepping back we are monitoring it we are managing it we ve cleared up the inventory that s clear we re asking also some additional questions in terms of sourcing and working with our suppliers we re looking at the mix of imported versus local and just making sure that we exercise pricing discipline and all of this of course needs to be done with member value in mind in the competitive dynamics but in short to sherry s summarize this is not the new normal and we think we can improve upon it sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer yeah we do have a strong focus and we are looking market by market very specifically at all aspects including the competitive landscape the cost of doing business so there is a very concerted focus on making sure that margins are set appropriately with all of the relevant factors in mind and all within the discipline of delivering good value to our members so there s a very disciplined approach we re taking to looking at margin going forward and so i would not expect that you would see the same as you have in last quarter jon braatz kansas city capital analyst maarten sherry if you were to maybe excel at some of these in the quarter some of these one time items you mentioned the markdowns and so on and so forth is there any sense or can you give us a sense as to what those one time items maybe amounted to in terms of reducing the margin maarten o jager executive vice president and chief financial officer let me try to help you in part so now we have mentioned markdowns in non foods and cleaning up some of the inventory that contributed about 30 to 35 basis points roughly ok of the 70 basis point line all right but then the rest of it i don t have at my fingertips but i think it ll give you a pretty good indication jon braatz kansas city capital analyst okay all right i appreciate that and then one final question sherry you talked about the new location in panama and using a lot more local merchandise compared to your other stores how much it did what percentage of your merchandise in that store is locally derived i m curious as to sort of the relative difference between the big stores and this one sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer i don t know that i said anything about local merchandise and you re talking about the veraguas club right now that is in more of an agricultural rural multiple speakers jon braatz kansas city capital analyst yes exactly sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer no i think the statement i made was that we were focused on meeting the member needs of that type of demographic which is very distinct for example from the membership that we have in the bolivar location just for the way of comparison but they re with the type of agriculture that s out there and the products that they need in terms of machinery or tools jon braatz kansas city capital analyst okay i m sorry i misinterpreted what you had said when you look at store such as this and if it is proved successful how might that expand your location opportunities across your markets sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer well it s too early to tell i mean to be perfectly honest personally i m excited about the prospect but it really is too early to tell because if it s something that we feel can perform at the levels that we re expecting veraguas to perform it really does open our minds up to other geographic areas other towns that have not been the subject of our focus so much in the past because the property is less expensive in these areas the footprint can be a bit smaller if we can tailor and meet the needs of our members in these locations it does open doors it opens doors for us to consider markets that really haven t been on our radar screen before but i don t want to overstate it because we really want to make sure we re doing this right and it s performing as expected and based on those results we re going to build on the positives but i do see there is a potential opportunity for good growth jon braatz kansas city capital analyst yup all right thanks sherry sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer my pleasure operator our next question comes from ronald bookbinder of ifs securities please proceed ronald bookbinder ifs securities analyst wow good afternoon and thank you for taking my questions thank you for the additional color on the merchandise gross margin but why the lower margin lower gross margin on the aeropost business versus last year maarten o jager executive vice president and chief financial officer ron i m going to have to get back to you on that one ronald bookbinder ifs securities analyst okay no problem maarten o jager executive vice president and chief financial officer later this afternoon ronald bookbinder ifs securities analyst okay sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer to give you a piece of information we ve discussed the fact that earlier in this process as we re building our pricesmart com we are using the aeropost com site to test certain things before we migrate over to the marketplace i m sorry to pricesmart com so there has been some effort to drive some of the activity over to pricesmart com once we ve proven that something is working well so what we re finding frankly ronald is that the activities of aeropost com and pricesmart are becoming a little bit more blurred as it should over time so i don t think we ve called out specifically that information but maarten can get back to you following that but i was trying to give you some background on what s happening ronald bookbinder ifs securities analyst okay and in colombia right now you re having just a tougher fx situation down there but what is the overall view of colombia it doesn t seem like you guys have opened a store there since chia in september of 2016 with these new smaller format stores could we see a ramping up in colombia and do you guys still have a real estate office in bogota sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer we are active in pursuing real estate and in looking for opportunities to grow in colombia we believe in that market no doubt the fx fluctuation and the currency devaluation there has been a challenge for us we re well received there membership is strong the if you look in constant currency our same store sales comps are doing well the issue for us right now is that we re trying to win as you know real estate is obviously a challenge there but yes with a small format it opens up more opportunities for us to find more suitable locations and then i have a separate point i wanted to make with regard to your comment on the effect of the currency we are also looking for ways to be smarter about matching up some of our expenses in for the company and with merchandise with the revenue that we generate through sales so we re not being passive in terms of the colombia fx effects we are looking to source more merchandise locally colombia is a very developed market it s one where we can source exciting merchandise that not only fit that market but expand exports into other markets and we re looking for smart ways to be able to naturally hedge if you will some of the impact of the negative fx so we are very very committed to colombia not just in terms of expanding club but cultivating resources that will strengthen the company overall ronald bookbinder ifs securities analyst okay and you guys have been performing actually your core business has been performing actually very well if you back out the fx impact and now you ve got this exciting opportunity of these smaller stores going into new markets given the lower valuation of your stock i know you don t have a share repurchase program and your q states that you don t expect to have one going forward but given where the stock is why wouldn t the board consider an authorization sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer our first priority is to make this company as strong as it possibly can be that s where all our efforts are focused at this time and beyond that i really don t have any other comment on it other than real estate in that there is the potential for real estate there that we could explore maarten o jager executive vice president and chief financial officer i think a great question we generate as you know a lot of operating cash flow from our business and we have we continue to believe that we have a lot of growth opportunity ahead of us in a number of markets which of course require significant real estate investment so our first focus in the broader context our focus is to do same store sales is to grow in new markets with new real estate is to invest in our supply chain to back it up and is to do omni channel and so our first protocol for the operating cash flow is to invest in our future growth ronald bookbinder ifs securities analyst okay great thank you for taking my questions and good luck in the new quarter sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer thank you maarten o jager executive vice president and chief financial officer i ll come back to you with a little bit more detail on the aeropost margins but there was a reclassification from g a to cogs that started in the fourth quarter of 2018 which creates a bit of a comparability issue quarter over quarter but i ll follow up with a more thorough answer ronald bookbinder ifs securities analyst would we expect that continuing in the future quarters maarten o jager executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah the reclassification would continue to hit us but i ll as i said i ll follow up with you thanks for the question sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer okay thank you operator the next question comes from rodrigo echagaray of scotiabank please proceed rodrigo echagaray scotiabank analyst thank you thanks for the call sherry and maarten i guess two questions on my end on the one hand it sounds like the new formats are promising early stages but it sounds like that s the case and so far i think we ve touched on the opportunity of smaller cities maybe more urban areas but what about new countries do you guys think that is also something that should be more likely as a result of these new formats sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer yes not just because of the new formats but because of the digital capabilities that allow us to potentially test new markets so as part of our ongoing efforts generally we are evaluating opportunities that exist in additional country i really don t have anything more on that at this point rodrigo echagaray scotiabank analyst and is that related to the analytics that you guys now have as a result of aeropost and all the online initiatives that you feel like that data is could potentially help you find new countries better is that would that be a correct assessment sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer it s not so much the analytics i m sure analytics can play into this but it s also the ability potentially down the road through omni channel and the technological capabilities that supports omni channel that would allow us to test different markets and the reception in different markets of the pricesmart brand but basically the pricesmart model and the merchandise that we provide rodrigo echagaray scotiabank analyst okay got it and if i take a step back there is a lot of progress in working capital there s new formats there seems to be a bit of a slight pickup in store openings and so what would you say sherry is your top priority for say next fiscal year and maybe mid term i mean there s a lot of things happening it sounds like some of these are very promising initiatives but what d you say it would be your top priority for next year sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer we continue to put substantial efforts in on the real estate side hand in hand with the development of our digital transformation and we see that in a relationship we want to really strengthen that inner relationship between the digital capabilities with the brick and mortar to be able to maximize our opportunity to flow merchandise in the most cost effective manner to the members so it s sort of it s holistic and it s all interrelated rodrigo echagaray scotiabank analyst got it sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer we re all focused on building our people investing in our people and strengthening further our management team so that we have the capabilities and the bandwidth to be able to continue to grow without being distracted or taking away from what we re doing very well rodrigo echagaray scotiabank analyst okay and maybe maarten on the same store sales of the most recent announcement what else would you say are some of the takeaways i mean there was an uptick on the number anything interesting that maybe you can touch on in terms of some of the regions or trends relative to the previous months i mean i think the fx obviously probably still impacting negatively but other than that anything else that you re seeing on the latest print that might be worth touching on maarten o jager executive vice president and chief financial officer rodrigo are you referring to the june sales release or are you referring to the rodrigo echagaray scotiabank analyst yes maarten o jager executive vice president and chief financial officer okay well i think the june sales release speaks for itself it s one month of good sales it was well received by the market we see some continuing momentum here in the early parts of july but i d want to be very cautious with that statement we also are managing as sherry and i have both addressed in our earlier comments we are also addressing our margins better so that s coming in well we see a little bit less of devaluation impact recently and particularly in colombia for the month i mean there is still it s still significant but relative to what it was it s abated a little bit and i think that s about as far as i would want to go rodrigo echagaray scotiabank analyst great very useful thank you guys maarten o jager executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you rodrigo sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer thank you operator the next question comes from thomas vester of lgm please proceed thomas vester lgm investments limited analyst yeah hi sherry and hi maarten just on the margin maybe i can ask it a little bit differently how much what should we what same store sales levels should you be at before you are comfortable on seeing margin sort of trending back to what you historically have so i m trying to understand what level because clearly the same store sales in us dollars is beneficial for margin but what level do you feel it takes to really see that swing back in march and because it has been compressed for quite a while maarten o jager executive vice president and chief financial officer well i appreciate the intent behind the question and trying to link sales to margin obviously there is a relationship but first and foremost we re focusing on driving same store sales through excellent merchandise i m sure from studying our business model and we know that the business model works best when you have same store sales kind of in the middle single digits to higher because then you start to leverage your expenses your variable expenses that increase with inflation and wage increases et cetera as well as to fixed increases and that allows you then to reinvest into value proposition so i don t want to draw an explicit link between the two although i understand the intent behind your question the same store sales that we re driving are focused on excellent merchandise we ve cleared out some of what we had in excess in q3 that in and of itself of course when you don t need to market down will help your same store sales right but really at the root of it is to make sure that we ve been excellent in merchandising offering for our members thomas vester lgm investments limited analyst okay great makes sense just on my second question is on the more rural store in panama that you touched up on sherry i mean two questions first of all when you say in terms of the evaluation it is too early but you see some promising signs can you tell us something about when do you expect to be able to evaluate it and secondly what is it you re looking for i mean obviously there is a number of factors but just it could be interesting to hear what you re really evaluating on what are the key parameters that will tell you whether or not this is something you should decide to go ahead with elsewhere or not so those two things would be helpful to get some clarity on sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer well so the evaluation is ongoing and obviously one of the threshold questions is relative to the investment that was required in order to build the club and what it costs to run the club the type of sales that we can generate out of that smaller footprint and sales per square foot those are things that we watch closely and to the extent that we can grow sales with less of a real estate investment as a result of being in a secondary market and other savings that come along with a smaller footprint that is a metric that we would pay close attention to and see if the returns are within our threshold our required threshold that would allow us to have some confidence going forward with other locations thomas vester lgm investments limited analyst yeah ok and then that brings me inaudible related to that because i guess the bottleneck for long time and also that s been the inclination i guess pre you becoming ceo and maarten you cfo has been one of the biggest bottlenecks for pricesmart has been sourcing real estate especially in colombia but also other places in i would assume but i guess that s my question whether or not i m right that your model should be much more fast scalable if it proves to be something that you want to roll out in the second tier cities because real estate has a bottleneck should be much less because it should be easier to source in these cities so you should be able to fast track that but maybe that s a wrong assumption sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer that s certainly the hope i mean i m sure you ve noted on the last three investment calls that at least we ve focused on the challenge of real estate for the company and how because of the costs associated with being in some of the central areas where we already do business that real estate was becoming a more challenging barrier for us and we re finding ways to solve for that and one of the explicit approaches that we shared with the investment community was we were going to look for ways to do it by way of bringing down our costs in real estate through smaller formats where appropriate where markets could support the type of sales that would justify the investment and also by investing in our omni channel capabilities to see if we can get merchandise to our members without the need for so much real estate by whether it s delivery directly from the merchants and from i m sorry from the vendors or through e commerce but using all these different approaches to reduce the cost of real estate so that we could have a healthy profit as a result of these additional cuts thomas vester lgm investments limited analyst yeah okay nice thanks i m just staying on real estate i mean because you are right sherry that we have seen a pick up in i guess sourcing up new site and converting that into new stores since you became ceo can you talk a little bit about what you ve done to the team there i mean has there been additional resources put in has there been chains of resource i mean it s definitely seems like something has happened sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer i can t take credit for it other than to say that there s a renewed energy there is a renewed energy there is a renewed focus there s a real commitment there is express discussion there people are being challenged they re being excited about the fact that we re having forward momentum in an area that seems to be lagging a bit for us and we re hoping to continue with this momentum and build on it going forward and i think our team is seeing that this is this could potentially open more doors for us in terms of market and even existing market the concept of saturating the market is not so much the concern anymore if we can expand into secondary markets where it makes economic sense and business sense for us to do so and we still have other markets that we could be considering outside of our existing market so yes there s been i d say a renewed energy a renewed motivation thomas vester lgm investments limited analyst yeah all right and then sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer and the commitment excuse me and the commitment from leadership that we will provide the support that s needed in order to expedite our efforts in this area thomas vester lgm investments limited analyst yeah okay and does that in any ways do you feel you have to compromise in terms of i mean your return targets because you mentioned also returns on the more rules so i mean clearly your return on capital is a key aspect for whether or not to play along with others but i mean i guess one of the ways also to convert more real estate is to sort of just pay off a bit do you feel you have been have to do that or do you have a step up in the case sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer i m sorry i didn t catch the last part of what you said another thomas vester lgm investments limited analyst basically whether or not you feel in some of the sites to basically secure them you basically have to compromise a bit on paying up because that is one way you can get real estate pretty quickly sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer well i mean at this point we ve got our own internal thresholds for we have a very active real estate committee on the board we ve got internal thresholds that we have to meet before a club will be approved i can tell you there s a lot of rigor that s applied to make sure that we don t overpay and that we re paying relative to the return that we expect we ll get by virtue of the sales and so now we re not compromising our standards if that s another way of putting it maarten o jager executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean just to add to that and i think i addressed this on prior calls it is as sherry said a very rigorous process we look at all the financials we look at it on an incremental basis we use different financial lenses to determine whether something will actually add shareholder value and those lenses include roi they include adjusted roi they include npvs all the different ways that you would expect i think any management team to do judiciously evaluate new projects yes some of the projects are more expensive and some of the areas that we re looking and but then of course we are making sure that we re going to get enough incremental sales and value from it and membership income from it thomas vester lgm investments limited analyst yes okay sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer so i mean to add a little bit more to this we see the opportunity potentially here to be doing to being a little bit more nimble and tailored in the size and the formats of our clubs depending on the markets where we re putting them so you can expect that if we are going to have another club in bogota which we think is a very fertile market for us we re going to be paying more for that but we expect the returns to justify it because of the opportunities that exist and so we re going to be looking at it on a case by case basis but i don t want to leave this conversation with an impression that we re only looking to secondary markets and we re only looking to lower we are we still have opportunities in very fertile markets like bogota that we are aggressively pursuing but we re doing that in tandem with our efforts to expand into secondary markets assuming that veraguas continues to prove that as we expect it to thomas vester lgm investments limited analyst yeah no ok that s definitely appreciative just maarten on the working capital what you ve done there is also appreciated but on the tax maybe in my head it s a little bit hard to understand why i mean looking at the various corporate tax rates in the jurisdiction you operate in and also the corporate tax rate in the us how if i mean it intuitively there should be some room to lower the top corporate tax rate for all of pricesmart going forward but again maybe help me if i m missing something there maarten o jager executive vice president and chief financial officer well i think you know our tax liability is principally the overwhelming majority is generated out of the market the liability tax liability that we have in the markets where we operate where we generate very little income in the united states and a very little tax liability here as you know because of tax reform the tax rate the corporate tax rate here in the us declined significantly kind of turned the whole balance upside down from the us being higher than our markets to now being lower and as a result of that shift we ve had to revalue technical difficulty our foreign tax credits and some of those have to be revalued and that s kind of what we re cycling through in this year having said all of that what we are always looking at is to optimize it in a judicious way and we ll evaluate that going forward thomas vester lgm investments limited analyst okay maarten o jager executive vice president and chief financial officer and you know there are losses in the us right i mean reported as losses i d like to think of them as investments that we are making for example in our aeropost business and our omni channel capabilities but we don t have income to generate to offset those and so that has been mathematically the impact of effectively raising our tax rate but we are looking at the tax question overall and opportunities that we may have operator we have the opportunity thank you thomas operator we have the opportunity for one more question operator our last question comes from charlie carter of ceredex please proceed charlie carter ceredex value advisors analyst just two quick ones the first is on going back to the june same store sales number if i believe last year central america was just disrupted by a lot of the political unrest all and double check that that doesn t that s not sort of driving the improvement we ve seen month and month it sounded like maarten by the tone of your voice that you were kind of generally encouraged that it was a sort of a broad based improvement so i just want to make sure that it s not just a very easy comp from nicaragua or again one of its neighbors and then lastly i didn t hear any specifics on the new distribution center in costa rica and i can t remember if that was already launched in the quarter or if that s coming and so just what effect that might have on your margins thanks maarten o jager executive vice president and chief financial officer i ll have sherry talk about costa rica in terms of the comps a good question and we do have we have 13 markets so it s never one kind of consistent story there is a number of markets that are helping us some markets that are still a little flatter nicaragua specifically has helped because we are lapping significant unrest a year ago it was a drag on our comp a year ago and it s helping us in june this year but that s not the whole turnaround sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer and also i think we have other issues going in the other direction like in honduras so that certainly is a very difficult situation there with the mass riots and street closures and we ve even been on alert a few times getting ready to close our clubs down to keep our members and our employees safe so that s a new challenge we have this year that we didn t have last year so there it s dynamic charlie carter ceredex value advisors analyst okay maarten o jager executive vice president and chief financial officer and then on costa rica sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer i m sorry on the costa rica rdc so that is an opportunity that we see to allow us to flow merchandise in a manner that would be most cost effective and allow us to have the net plaintiff ph cost be as competitive as possible by being able to sell merchandise for example from asia or even potentially europe directly to costa rica as opposed to having to go through miami and then have miami then redirect to either costa rica or specific countries or clubs and a very in depth study is going on now to actually look at our items and what is the most cost effective manner to get that item from the vendor to the clubs and in addition to just the cost of getting it to closer to the members and looking for savings there there s a business practice that can be improved by virtue for example in costa rica that s one of our largest market and when we re able to aggregate merchandise in the costa rica rdc and then pulse it into the clubs on a shorter term basis with real time knowledge of what the needs are in terms of inventory levels and sales activities in each of those clubs that will yield savings it ll will yield better or less out of stocks and better sales optimally so the costa rica rdc holds a lot of potential for us but it does require studying an in depth analysis of almost on an item by item basis frankly as to how and where is that merchandise best float stepping back for a moment what we ve achieved with the costa rica rdc though still is in process in terms of the work that needs to go into it to maximize that potential but what we ve achieved with that costa rica rdc is optionality for our company which i think is very important not just from a financial standpoint but from a supply chain standpoint from a reliability standpoint i mean dynamics are changing in the world there s political unrest there s tariffs there s tax law changes by having that additional flexibility and optionality for the company i think it s responsible and it s a smart business move on our part now it s up to us to make the most of it charlie carter ceredex value advisors analyst and just one quick follow up we re running out of time but on the on the tariff issue i mean i guess are you tariff on anything that imported into miami and then rerouted to your stores sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer we have a free trade zone there but i can t tell you which technical difficulty maarten o jager executive vice president and chief financial officer while there s some there is some merchandise that we get from china and that gives that goes through free trade zones and so that s not subject to tariffs but there s other merchandise that we buy from us flyers that in turn came from china that has been subject to tariffs and so if that part of it that we re really focusing on addressing multiple speakers charlie carter ceredex value advisors analyst but i guess multiple speakers yeah it does but i guess i m looking at it competitively so anybody that you re competing with on the same product by product or sku by sku they would be buying from the us as well so it s not as if you would be disadvantaged by tariffs because you re sourcing through the us in some ways maarten o jager executive vice president and chief financial officer i think competitively that s right but of course with a lens on member value we re looking for alternative ways of flowing that merchandise and trying to leverage our supply chain as effectively as possible including the free trade zones that we have sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer and we can source that merchandise and avoid the tariffs all together but obviously there s a bias in favor of doing that and by having that costa rica rdc that allows us to do that more effectively maarten o jager executive vice president and chief financial officer okay thank you very much operator i don t think there are any more questions in the queue operator that is correct this concludes the question and answer session at this time i would like to turn the conference back over to the management team for any closing remarks sherry s bahrambeygui chief executive officer i d just like to say thank you all for your time this morning we re very excited about the prospects for us moving forward we re all very committed to working hard on behalf of our members our employees and ultimately our shareholders have a good day maarten o jager executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator

by j bradford delong berkeley why did the policy response to the great recession only partly reflect the lessons learned from the great depression until recently the smart money was on the answers given by the financial times commentator martin wolf and my berkeley colleague barry eichengreen each has argued that while enough was remembered to prevent the 1929 size shock of 2008 from producing another great depression many lessons were plowed under by a rightward ideological shift in the years following the crisis since then the fact that the worst was avoided has served as an alibi for a suboptimal status quo now nobel laureate economist paul krugman has offered an alternative explanation plutocracy at the start of the 2010s the top 0 01 per cent 30 000 people around the world half of them in the united states cared little about high unemployment which did not seem to affect them but were greatly alarmed by government debt they began demanding austerity and as krugman contends the political and media establishment internalised the preferences of the extremely wealthy would the us economy of the 2010s have been materially different if the share of total income accruing to the top 0 01 per cent had not quadrupled in recent decades from 1 3 per cent to 5 per cent krugman certainly thinks so while vigilance can mitigate the extent to which the wealthy get to define the policy agenda he writes in the end big money will find a way unless there s less big money to begin with hence curbing plutocracy should be america s top priority in fact big money does not always find a way nor does its influence necessarily increase as the top 0 01 per cent captures a larger share of total income whether the average plutocrat has 1 000 or 50 000 times more than the average worker makes little difference in this respect more to the point big money was not the primary determinant of whether policymakers heeded or forgot the lessons of the great depression for example one lesson from that earlier episode is that high unemployment is extremely unhealthy for an economy and society a depression is not as the early twentieth century economist joseph schumpeter once claimed a good cold douche for the economy but this lesson was forgotten only by a lunatic fringe some of whom suggested that the great recession was needed to shift workers out of bloated sectors such as home construction as for lessons that were forgotten one is that persistent ultra low interest rates means the economy is still short of safe liquid stores of value and thus in need of further monetary expansion during and after the great recession denying this plain truth and calling for an end to stimulus became a litmus test for any republican holding or seeking office worse these politicians were joined by an astonishingly large number of conservative economists who conveniently seemed to forget that the short term safe interest rate is a good thermometer for the economy to be sure big finance did play a role here by insisting that the fed was trying to push value away from fundamentals even though economic fundamentals are generally whatever the fed says they are but an even more obvious culprit was hyper partisanship another lesson is that printing or borrowing money to buy stuff is an effective means for governments to address worryingly high unemployment after 2009 the obama administration effectively rejected this lesson in favour of the logic of austerity even though the unemployment rate was still 9 9 per cent a related lesson is that high levels of government debt need not lead to price instability or an inflationary spiral as john maynard keynes argued in january 1937 the boom not the slump is the right time for austerity at the treasury unfortunately in the early 2010s those of us who recalled this lesson were consigned to the margins of debate yet here big money influence was a secondary problem compared to the democratic party s broader surrender to neoliberalism which started under president bill clinton but reached its apotheosis in the obama era after all the plutocracy itself profits when money is cheap and lending is dear the larger issue then is an absence of alternative voices if the 2010s had been anything like the 1930s the national association of manufacturers and the conference board would have been aggressively calling for more investment in america and these arguments would have commanded the attention of the press labour unions would have had a prominent voice as advocates for a high pressure economy both would have had very powerful voices inside the political process through their support of candidates did the top 0 01 per cent put something in the water to make the media freeze out such voices after 2008 did the ultra wealthy create our modern campaign finance system in which elite social networks and door to door canvassing are less important than a candidate s fund raising totals the problem is not so much that the plutocracy has grown stronger as that countervailing powers have disappeared after all there are wealthy donors and philanthropists on the left as well as the right and some billionaires have even started to demand that they be taxed more of course the political implications of plutocracy are dangerous and destructive in the us olin money has captured the judiciary koch money has misinformed the public about global warming and murdoch money routinely terrifies retirees about immigrants but just because the public sphere is tainted and skewed by plutocratic influence does not mean that more rational policymaking is doomed once we are aware of the problem we can begin to work around it 1 krugman admits as much when he warns centrist politicians and the media not to pull another 2011 treating the policy preferences of the 0 1 per cent as the right thing as opposed to well what a certain small class of people want for journalists academics elected officials and concerned citizens generally the first task is to ask oneself everyday whose voices are getting more attention than they deserve and who is not being heard at all ultimately it is the public that will decide the fate of the public sphere j bradford delong is professor of economics at the university of california at berkeley and a research associate at the national bureau of economic research he was

let s say you are deciding between two models of federal reserve candidates one has no fixed principles and embraces whatever is most politically expedient the other has a blind commitment to a dangerously wrong set of beliefs to borrow from hamilton i know it s lose lose but if you had to choose or maybe you don t because with judy shelton you can get both last week president trump announced plans to fill two vacant fed slots with shelton now u s executive director at the european bank for reconstruction and development and christopher waller the research director at the st louis federal reserve bank waller has kept a low profile but looks like a serious researcher and reasonable candidate the same cannot be said of shelton who appears to have deftly tricked the president into thinking she supports all his bad ideas when she actually supports different possibly even worse bad ideas advertisement shelton a denizen of the republican gold bug circuit in some ways resembles trump s two recent failed fed picks stephen moore and herman cain like them she decried monetary and fiscal stimulus even while we were on the brink of depression when a democrat happened to be president but she supports ultralow rates and shrugs off deep deficits now when the economy is much stronger and can it be coincidence a republican occupies the white house follow this author catherine rampell s opinions follow back during the obama years easy money and profligate fiscal policy were about to stoke ruinous inflation and debase the dollar shelton argued zero percent interest rates were equivalent to stealing from savers she argued that the fed should stop trying to make its supposedly favored politicians look good or inflate financial markets today she has been transformed or she wants her audience of one to believe so anyway advertisement she believes interest rates should be cut to zero the fed should support the president s agenda and the central bank should help prop up markets after all people can evolve what s striking about shelton s evolutions however is that they concur exactly with what the president wants to hear these about faces alongside her other comments about the relationship between trump and the fed call into question whether she would safeguard the fed s political independence a feature necessary for it to function trump after all has made clear he s looking for a puppet having been disappointed that the four sitting board members he previously chose haven t done his bidding besides the flip flops shelton has demonstrated her personal loyalty with effusive praise of the president and by conducting at least four major media interviews from a trump hotel advertisement she has also pointedly mentioned multiple times that trump s mar a lago club would be a lovely place for a major international monetary conference a bretton woods for the 21st century this brings me to what her actual monetary policy views are and they re doozies there is one doctrine shelton has consistently promoted for decades including in recent public comments it s sometimes difficult for laypeople probably including the president to decipher unless you understand the sound money or dependable dollar code of the crank right wing fringe her radical vision involves replacing the fed s mandate of stable prices and maximum employment with a gold standard the gold standard is roundly rejected by economists and was abandoned ages ago worldwide for good reason gold prices are volatile a gold peg also crimps liquidity in times of crisis as it did during the great depression she also wants the rest of the world to adopt some version of the same thing resulting in either fixed exchange rates or even a single global common currency that s where bretton woods at mar a lago comes in advertisement there s a lot to say about why such a system would create more severe business cycles and more international financial contagion for now it s worth pointing out that if trump actually understood what shelton is promoting he probably never would have tapped her for the fed because it contradicts so much of what he stands for such a system would mean ceding u s sovereignty over its currency as well as tighter monetary policy and at least theoretically tighter fiscal policy too she s riding two horses at the same time says american enterprise institute fellow desmond lachman shelton has tried to reconcile her grand globalist un trumpian vision with trumpian policy goals with some skillful sleights of hand in a recent post op ed for instance she complained that other countries are cutting rates to manipulate their currency what trump wants to hear but proposed as a solution a new dependable dollar an unsubtle wink to her fellow gold bugs but if confirmed to the fed she might eventually have to choose a lane lackey or crank
good thursday want this by email sign up here the only way is down for the fed jay powell the fed chairman strongly signaled yesterday that the fed could cut interest rates when it meets later this month jeanna smialek and matt phillips of the nyt write the fed expects unemployment to stay low and inflation to gradually rise mr powell told the house financial services committee but he added that uncertainties around trade tensions and concerns about the strength of the global economy continue to weigh on the u s economic outlook investors saw the comments as a virtual guarantee of rate cuts stocks leapt yesterday with the s p 500 briefly trading above 3 000 for the first time the index is up nearly 20 percent this year and is enjoying one of the longest bull markets on record
a round the world investors businesses and central bankers are grappling with a startling fact at the end of july america s economy will have been growing for 121 months the longest run since records began in 1854 according to the nber a research body history suggests there will be a recession soon and plenty of people are gloomy bond markets have been sounding the alarm as long term interest rates sink below short term ones often a harbinger of a downturn manufacturing firms are wary indices of business confidence are tumbling yet equity investors are still buoyant the stockmarket is going gangbusters rising by 19 so far this year and in june america s economy created a whopping 224 000 new jobs more than twice as many as needed to keep up with the growth of the workforce the result is a puzzle that matters a great deal america s economy accounts for a quarter of global output so if it stumbles the world will too but if it proves able to extend the cycle a lot longer it may be time to rewrite the rules for how all rich economies behave listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element the conflicting signals reflect an unusually sluggish and stretched expansion some of that is to be expected after the worst financial crisis in 80 years but as our briefing explains it is also owing to deeper changes in america s 21trn economy growth is slow but more stable as activity has shifted to services and intangible assets thanks to new regulations and the recent memory of the bust there are few signs of wild mortgage lending over investment or reckless financial firms inflation is remarkably subdued these forces mean that a placid expansion can continue well beyond historical norms but also suggest that the way it will eventually end will be different recessions used to be triggered by housing bubbles price surges or industrial busts now you should worry about globally interconnected firms a financial system addicted to cheap money and a political system that is toying with extreme policies because living standards are not rising fast enough average gdp growth during this expansion has been a mere 2 3 much lower than the 3 6 that was seen in america s three previous expansions that reflects some deep malaises the workforce is ageing big firms hoard profits and invest less productivity growth has been slow robert gordon an economist worries that america s genius for innovation is flagging emojis and bitcoins are no substitute for breakthroughs such as jet engines or the internet that is the bad news the good news is that the economy may be less volatile a third of america s 20th century recessions were caused by industrial slumps or oil price shocks according to goldman sachs today manufacturing is just 11 of gdp and each dollar of output requires a quarter less energy than in 1999 services have become even more vital at 70 of output instead of fickle factories and florida condos investment has shifted to intellectual property which now accounts for more than a quarter of the total after the searing experience of 2008 the value of the housing stock is 143 of gdp well below the peak of 188 banks are rammed full of capital most remarkable of all is very low inflation which has averaged 1 6 over the course of the expansion in many past downturns the jobs market overheated causing inflation and leading the federal reserve to hit the brakes today the dynamics are different the unemployment rate has fallen to 3 7 close to the lowest in half a century but wage growth is only a tepid 3 workers have less bargaining power in a globalised economy the fed s credibility helps too most people believe that it can keep long run inflation at about 2 given that racing prices are less of a worry and that it lacks the ammunition to deal with a serious downturn the fed is being more active at signalling that it will ease policy when growth dips this week the fed signalled it would soon nudge rates down from today s 2 25 2 5 to keep growth going all this supports the idea that the familiar triggers for recession are still absent and that the moderately good times can roll on for years yet the trouble with this logic is that just as the economy has changed so have the risks inevitably it is hard to identify exactly what might go wrong but three new kinds of problems loom large first america s glossy corporate champions have unfamiliar vulnerabilities although fewer make physical goods most rely on global production chains that are being shaken by the trade war see article this is depressing investment and could yet produce a shock imagine if apple was cut off from its factories in china tech firms meanwhile now account for a third of all investment by listed firms including intellectual property other businesses outsource their need for it services to a few giants one of them alphabet spent 45bn in the past year five times more than ford but 85 of its sales come from advertising which has been cyclical in the past it and other tech firms also face a regulatory storm the second risk is financial although house prices and the banks have been tamed total private debts remain high by historical standards at 250 of gdp an edifice of asset prices and borrowing rests on the assumption of permanently low and stable interest rates making it more fragile than it looks if rates rise there will be distress among some firms and trouble in debt markets there was a sell off in late 2018 if by contrast the fed has to cut rates to near zero for a prolonged period to sustain growth it could weaken the banks as europe has found a recession made in washington the last danger is politics as the economy has trodden a narrow path the boundaries of economic policy have been blown wide apart partly out of frustration at a decade of sluggish wages president donald trump has tried to gin up growth by cutting taxes and attacking the fed most democrats are keen to let rip on government spending more extreme policies hover in the wings on the left modern monetary theory a kind of money printing and massive state intervention are popular one of mr trump s new nominees to the fed board supports a gold standard the greatest threat to america s long and placid expansion is that a new era of wild policy may be just beginning
j ohn maynard keynes once fantasised about a world of permanently low interest rates in the final chapter of the general theory he imagined an economy in which abundant available capital causes investors bargaining power and hence rates to collapse in such a world markets would reward risk taking and entrepreneurial talent but not the mere accumulation of capital the result would be the euthanasia of the rentier listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element that low rates could feature in a leftish utopian vision might come as a surprise today it is commonly argued that a decade of monetary policy stimulus has filled the pockets of the rich low rates and quantitative easing qe are said to have sent stock and bond markets soaring thereby exacerbating wealth inequality they have also boosted house prices adding to intergenerational tension a glance at financial markets suggests more of the same is coming long term rates have tumbled this year in anticipation of monetary easing while stockmarkets have boomed central bankers have defended their policies by arguing that without loose money unemployment would have been much higher badly hurting the poor that is true but the effect of monetary stimulus on financial markets has nonetheless angered left and right alike judy shelton one of president donald trump s new picks for the board of the federal reserve has blamed central banks for exacerbating income inequality she has called for a return to the gold standard the left meanwhile prefers fiscal loosening such as giving money to the poor or fiscal monetary hybrids such as the people s qe once advocated by jeremy corbyn the leader of britain s labour party under which the central bank would finance government investment who is right do low rates spell euthanasia or euphoria for those who live off capital and should concerns about inequality determine which policy lever to pull in a downturn a starting point is that falling interest rates make all streams of future income more valuable that includes dividends from stocks coupons on bonds and homeowners privilege of being able to occupy their houses without paying rent but the resulting increases in asset values can be captured easily only by people who are willing to change their plans imagine a homeowner a higher house price is of little benefit to him if he has no desire to sell and move similarly a bondholder about to retire may need the steady stream of coupon payments the bond provides a capital gain from selling bonds today might fund a lavish around the world cruise but blowing through retirement funds is unlikely to be prudent now consider a penniless millennial she sees no capital gain when low rates boost asset prices but she does have assets that will yield income in the future education and skills were this human capital valued on financial markets it too would rise in value when interest rates fall she too could change plans and spend more today but by borrowing cheaply rather than selling assets a recent paper by adrien auclert of stanford university sets out a framework for judging who wins and who loses from changes in monetary policy three channels must be considered one concerns the impact of lower rates on the macroeconomy the effect trumpeted by central banks another concerns the higher inflation that lower rates might cause that hurts creditors and benefits debtors who see the real value of their obligations shrink the third channel concerns asset prices it is wrong to claim that asset holders generally benefit when rates fall says mr auclert what matters is the full picture of an individual s assets and liabilities the latter he defines to include future consumption plans such as whether the homeowner wants to stay in his house or whether the retired person seeks to maintain a steady standard of living only by looking at an individual s balance sheet in full can you judge whether he wins or loses from low rates or whether in the jargon he has unhedged interest rate exposure the crucial question is whether someone s assets and liabilities mature at different points in time people with short dated assets but long dated liabilities for example a saver with lots of cash in the bank to fund a purchase ten years hence do badly when rates fall they are the euthanised rentiers who must save more to fund spending later a rare example of lower rates depressing consumption but those who wish to spend today and hold long dated assets such as long term government bonds do well what does this framework imply for rich and poor mr auclert presents some evidence that americans who are older or whose incomes are higher tend to be on the losing end of asset price effects when rates fall but he says it is hard to measure the effect precisely a recent working paper by panagiota tzamourani of the bundesbank finds that within the euro area average unhedged interest exposure varies a lot between countries seemingly in line with the prevalence of floating rate mortgages but ms tzamourani also finds that younger households and those with low net wealth benefit from lower rates almost everywhere good hedges make good neighbours that seems to turn conventional wisdom on its head far from helping the well heeled the changes to financial markets induced by low rates could be hurting them just as keynes argued some might object that they do not deserve the hit surely those who save in cash for future consumption are more responsible than those who wish to borrow and spend keynes would have retorted that in a world awash with capital extra saving does not benefit society in a slump it is harmful in any case if fiscal stimulus is preferred to low interest rates taxpayers would end up with debts instead monetary stimulus may not help the poor as much as deficit financed welfare or progressive tax cuts structural problems in the economy such as market power may allow the rich to earn high returns even as rates fall but egalitarians and those without wealth probably need not fear doveish central banks sources monetary policy and the

what you need to know today many fomc participants saw that the case for a somewhat more accommodative monetary policy had strengthened period do not fight the fed or other central banks so in yesterday s note i said that jay powell s prepared statement the one he was about to give to congress would be released to the masses media at 8 30 so watch the futures and learn what he was about to say and so like clockwork futures had been under pressure overnight and into the morning hours as the jury was still out at 8 29 am s p futs were lower by 9 pts while the dow was down nearly 66 pts and then at 8 30 am not 10 seconds after the release of the statement s p dow nasdaq and russell futs all spiked higher the s p went from 9 to 18 and stayed there until the mkt opened and then surged another 13 pts piercing up and thru s p 3000 in the moments leading up to the start of powell s speech so by then you pretty much assumed what he was about to say rates are going down and they are going down in july and so it is then once the circus started it became even clearer while the fed had opened the door to the possibility of a rate cut last month he walked thru it yesterday saying in no uncertain terms that plenty more data has arrived to back up the view that manufacturing trade and investment are weak all around the world and while the june jobs report was great news it is not enough to tilt the balance because wages aren t rising fast enough to trigger much inflation and in fact inflation is too low and on that news the bets are now increasing once again that what he really meant is that rates will go down by 50 bps although that is a bit of an outlier the broader consensus view is that we will get a 25 bps cut at month end today he gets to do it all over again as he revisits capitol hill and sits in front of the senate committee one of the other items of interest was this conversation about libra that new fb crypto currency that was announced only weeks ago when questioned powell made it clear that this digital currency has many risks privacy money laundering and consumer protections while also posing very serious risks to global financial stability that being said the fed is working with other central banks and federal agencies as this conversation moves on again the issue is fb and with their history of lack of protections on consumer privacy etc and while they may be trying to do the right thing if history is any guide this conversation has a long way to go by the end of the day yesterday the indexes all closed higher off their intraday highs but still higher the dow added 76 pts or 0 29 the s p surged by 13 pts or 0 45 the nasdaq tacked on 60 pts or 0 75 and the russell added 2 pts or 0 16 and like i said yesterday as well look for the s p to challenge the next century mark 3000 and then back off which is exactly what it did as the euphoria settles down so what happens today can he possibly say anything else that is different than what we now know and now the bets are building is 50 bps actually an option well fed funds futures are now pointing to a 25 chance of a 50 bps cut up from 4 yesterday while the consensus view remains in the 25 bps camp but the data suggests that there is no misunderstanding traders are now pricing in a 100 probability of some kind of cut and that is what is causing the mkts to move up so that being said listen to the media they have marched out everyone that supports a cut they have marched out everyone that is now looking at the second derivatives second derivatives really the second derivative is defined as the derivative of the derivative of a function did that clear it up easier to understand dude speak english no one is looking at second derivatives they are looking at the macro data they are looking at earnings they are looking at global central bank policy and global interest rates they are now pricing in the cost of money at 2 25 vs the current 2 5 something that appears a bit much but either way investors traders and algo s loved it and the mkts surged the fed now joins the ecb european central bank and the pboc people s bank of china and other central banks that are considering more easing think lower rates and mkts around the world which had been under a bit of pressure due to uncertainty are now free asian mkts closed a bit higher nothing dramatic but they were up and european mkts are churning they were up and now are down not dramatically but they are churning as investors there digest the idea that us rates are going lower europeans are also digesting the latest boe s bank of england financial stability report which reported that british banks do in fact hold enough capital to deal with the broader geo political risks think a no deal brexit an ongoing trade war between the us china the us europe the us mexico blah blah blah and speaking of a trade war news hits the tape this morning that france has approved a digital tax on american tech companies thumbing their noses at the white house the french finance minister bruno le maire defending this 3 tax which is expected to raise some 500 mil euros 560 mil the tax would apply to the french revenues of some 30 major tech companies mostly us so as you can imagine trade rep bobby lighthizer will now investigate this tax to determine if it unfairly targets is discriminatory unreasonable or restricts us commerce and if it does then expect that the us will retaliate by doing what bingo imposing new tariffs on french goods and services taking the trade war to new heights oh boy so that is a good thing ftse 0 13 cac 40 0 01 dax 0 27 eurostoxx 0 04 spain 0 09 and italy 0 66 us futs are pointing higher in line with global mkts the dow 65 pts the s p is up 7 pts which would kiss 3000 once again the nasdaq is up 26 pts and the russell is up 2 now while the news was well received the fact is the mkt is feeling a bit extended with the s p up 19 ytd the nasdaq up 24 ytd the dow up 15 ytd and the russell up 16 ytd the focus is now squarely on earnings with the rate discussion now behind us expect the mkts to prepare for the onslaught of earnings and while we are expecting a weaker season consensus is for a 2 6 decline y y the tech sector is expected to be down by more than 9 y y and while we are prepared for this unless you ve been living under a rock the risk is if the estimates are much worse than the expectation and while the nasdaq and s p are hitting new highs the dow and dow transports are not confirming a substantial move higher just yet the trendlines drawn on the s p do suggest that it is a bit toppy and my gut tells me that the next move is a lower consolidation leaving us in a 2925 3000 range and if earnings really start to disappoint then a test of the 50 dma at 2888 is in sight dal just reported and guess what they beat 2 35 sh vs the expected 2 25 sh and the guidance is bullish revenues surging dividend increase of 5 cts sh the stock is up 31 on the year and is up 15 this month alone and while the stock is quoted up 1 right now do not be surprised if you see the stock under pressure as the trader types cash in on the move oil now look at that oil which had pierced all 3 resistance trendlines last week setting itself up for a surge higher had backed off a bit causing what i called a head fake last week trying to rattle the branches to see who falls out and again yesterday after the rattle buyers once again took it up and thru resistance setting it up for that move to 65 that i spoke about geo political issues between the uk and iran now adding tension to the conversation as the iranians tried to block a british tanker as it navigated the straits of hormuz a building storm in the gulf of mexico causing us producers to cut output ahead of the first major storm this hurricane season in addition us crude inventories fell by 9 5 mil barrels as demand surged hello much higher than the 3 mil

take into account the impact on the global economy and commodity prices trade conflicts and uncertainty are projected to reduce the level of canadian gdp by as much as 2 per cent by the end of 2021 carolyn wilkins the bank of canada s senior deputy governor said wednesday as she and her colleagues unveiled a monetary policy report that flags the severity of their concern trade concerns go beyond

have been encouraging the trade climate continues to be the biggest wild card in our outlook ms wilkins said as the globe and mail s bill curry reports the central bank held its benchmark rate steady at 1 75 per cent wednesday as it tweaked its economic outlook now expecting slightly stronger growth this year and weaker next there are certainly positive developments the central bank noted the u s has killed its steel and aluminum tariffs on canadian imports while the new u s mexico canada trade deal is moving closer to ratification still for a sense of how the trade uncertainty and other measures are affecting canada here are some other facts and figures from the monetary policy report exports are still projected to rise over the next couple of years but we forecast them to be around 1 5 per cent lower than they would have been without the trade uncertainty ms wilkins said we have also marked down the level of investment by 3 per cent in 2021 for the same reason the central bank said it expects investment outside the energy sector to rise at a solid pace but the forecast for investment would be stronger however were it not for elevated trade policy uncertainty then there are

according to the monetary policy report the impact goes well beyond canada of course trade conflicts between the united states and china are dampening global economic activity the central bank in its monetary policy report their effects are slowing growth in these two economies and spilling over to other countries through trade and investment it added trade has slowed sharply particularly in china and in countries that share supply chains with it including those in emerging asia and japan indeed the bank of canada now projects that a combination of tariff increases over the last two years plus the uncertainty will cut global gdp by 0 6 per cent by the end of 2021 the monetary policy report included two scenarios both of which should be considered extreme ms wilkins said open this photo in gallery source bank of canadathe globe and mail the first the downside scenario assumes the u s slaps 25 per cent tariffs on all imports and countries fight back with similar levies that would cut global gdp by about 3 per cent knock down commodity prices about 30 per cent and eat into canadian gdp to the tune of 6 per cent that underscores how much we all have to lose of the trade war escalates ms wilkins said the upside scenario in turn which assumes the world returns to the trade regime before 2017 would boost global gdp by 1 per cent by the end of 2021 and canadian gdp by about

the bears that are gathering will soon enough be picking flesh off the sun bleached bones of this market even the fed chair who usually does all he can can to avoid dismal pictures and to sound optimistic is finally talking downcast about the us economy powell helps trump trade war he didn t do much but powell genuflected in trump s direction giving him a nudge where he needed it in trade powell s congressional comments today helped trump out a little with his trade deficit problem by causing the dollar to plunge in value click to enlarge cnbc since trump has been in office the trade deficit has widened by 25 as has the us budget deficit the trade deficit is widening because countries are importing fewer us goods and because they are lowering the value of their currency against the dollar and we measure trade in dollars as foreign currency devalues it takes fewer of those dollars to buy the same amount of goods that devaluation of foreign currencies good for us consumers but bad for us exporters because the price of their goods in foreign currencies goes up because they start out being built and priced in dollars so they sell fewer goods abroad it s also bad for us trade statistics when other nations lower their currency the lower price of goods in us dollars increases the amount of goods on the foreign side of the ledger that the us imports widening the trade deficit it turns out tariff wars are trickier than trump said they were which is partly why trump is constantly cudgeling fed chair jerome powell to lower interest as that correspondingly has the effect of devaluing the dollar on foreign exchanges as other nation s are doing it helps us in a trade war by getting into a currency war the enemy fights back as it turns out and so far the enemy is winning in terms of the trade balance sheet powell s remarks also helped trump by giving his prize badge the stock market a boost i had said in a comment on this site yesterday that i anticipated the s p would break briefly through its 3 000 barrier and it did that intraday today so that didn t take long whether it closes there having settled back beneath that level remains to be seen my comment was actually in respect to my agreement with nearly everyone else s opinion that the most likely scenario for july is that the fed will lower interest rates by 0 25 near the end of the month that i said will give stocks a brief bump not much of one because it is already price in but there is always a little halelujah dance when the moment arrives and does what it was supposed to a relief rally as the pressure of waiting and wondering is lifted related warning signs emerge for boeing then reality sets in a day or two later my most likely scenario for june and july has been that trump and xi would agree to continue talks but not get much accomplished and that powell would talk the market up and will ultimately give the 0 25 rate increase the market is demanding i ve never believed he has the courage to crash the market the worst case scenario i presented for june and july however i have said all along what happens economically in the run up to that big day and in the days after that rate cut matters more because the rate cut is already priced in that s why it s only going to deliver a bump powell aligns with me on recession though he doesn t have a clue i exist what happens during those days leading up to and after the powell put is going to be increasingly bad economic news in fact that news i ve said will press powell into delivering the rate cut that both the bond market and stock market are demanding which is why i moved some of our own money into bonds this month that news will be trouble for stocks and probably good for bonds lowering yields which makes the bonds that are already in bond funds worth more because they have higher yields money moving out of stocks could seek safe haven in bonds pressing bond yields down ever more under the new economic paradigm the fed single handedly created during its recovery regime the bad economic news is good news for stocks here in wonderland because it assures more free fed funds are coming soon since free money happens quicker and easier than earning money the hard way that is currently all investors care about that is until things go so bad with the economy that there is no way to keep up the pretense that business is going along with all the falderal earnings are about to change the picture that is where powell is finally winding up just as i said he would be as july wore on he is starting at last to see the economy my way his talk shifted notably this week from past months of saying the economy was sound and expanding to sounding concerned about growing recessionary forces here are the specific concerns powell laid out most of them are concerns he is expressing for the first time powell said in prepared remarks that the inflation outlook looks muted and that the central bank will act as appropriate to sustain economic expansion cnbc in other words powell sees that deflationary pressures have returned earlier in the year he saw inflation as being above the fed s 2 0 target so he spoke in terms of a symmetric target meaning as i pointed out in one of my premium posts titled teasing out the fed s big plan for our future the fed would be aiming for inflation above 2 in what powell termed a make up strategy for the years when the fed couldn t get inflation up to save its life the fed hoped to run the economy hot powell sees that hope rapidly fading away now and that is much greater incentive for him to give that rate cut and to restart quantitative easing as i ve said for years the fed will have to do when it realizes its great recovery is failing due to its great recovery rewind balance sheet reduction good unemployment numbers especially now that they are hinting at turning the wrong way are not going to dissuade the fed from aiming to raise inflation by lowering interest rates declining inflation provides the ready excuse for powell and the boys and girls at the fed to do what stocks and bonds are both demanding in order to avoid a tantrum they do not want to be seen as being responsible for i said in earlier comments that if powell is leaning toward giving the market what it demands look for his comments to start focusing on falling inflation so that powell can say at the end of july the fed is cutting rates due to inflation rather than due to being the market s slave and trump s boy now here we have it there is a risk that weak inflation will be even more persistent than we currently anticipate we are carefullymonitoring these developments and we will continue to assess their implications for the u s economic outlook and inflation powell said in his testimony just from this tease stocks rose and bond yields which had been rising due to stronger job numbers settled back down today all was made well as papa powell comforted his markets where the market was recently concerned that a blip up in job number might keep the fed from doling out cheap money those concerns are now assuaged my sense is that powell is more concerned about global financial conditions weak global pmis low global inflation weakening growth everywhere than he is pacified by a strong us labor market jim caron managing director of global fixed income at morgan stanley investment management wrote in an emailed statement the other growing concern powell fixed on was trade i said earlier this month trump would keep trade concerns on the fed s front burner through july even if he could solve them which he probably can t in order to extract his rate cut from powell powell is now paving a path to capitulate it appears that uncertainties around trade tensions and concerns about the strength of the global economy continue to weigh on the u s economic outlook he added powell hit the drum numerous times on both low inflation and rising trade war problems in fact he hit the trade note more times than any other thing he talked about in both his own speech and during questions and answers and he didn t just go there when democrats led him that way with questions so powell not only laid a clear path to rate cuts based on the fed s inflation mandate but also laid a path to blame the need for those cuts on the trump administration by basing growing economic troubles on trump s trade war rather than on fed monetary tightening business conditions are also declining which powell tied to trade problems and that is resulting in lowered capital investment certainly a recessionary move that has now caught powells eye too just as i ve said recessionary forces would start to do in july the central bank leader also noted that business investments across the u s have decelerated of late as worries over the economic outlook dog executives across the country finally powell noted slower growth in economies all over the world as a pressure on the us economy in all cnbc described our reserved chairman s testimony as striking a downbeat tone which perfectly sets the tone for his rate cut but it also means the rate cut will be happening as i ve been saying for months would be the case as recessionary winds in the general economy begin to blow and no matter how much good news is bad news here in wonderland no stock market has ever weathered a recession well related china weighs rare earth export ban there is now economic evidence that the outlook for the u s economy is not that great said juan perez senior currency trader at tempus inc in washington ultimately what that means is that the federal reserve will need to intervene cnbc as i ve said the dizzy stock market looks at economic weakness as hope of dope from the fed s free dispensary and it will be that for sure but what the market is completely failing to grasp is that years of fed meds boosted the market after it has already plunged into the basement it is entirely different when the fed starts down the interest rate cutting path after the end of a long expansion it is one thing to boost a market valued low because it has already collapsed and to do it as economic times are starting to recover it is another thing entirely to boost the stock market when values are at record heights and to do so as the economy is falling put your money there if you want it should be good for a bounce this month but good luck with that later in the summer as all the forces powell is now finally starting to openly fear continue to build exactly as you ve been reading about here all year as the bulls crack the corks on their champagne bottles when the fed makes it first rate cut in years at the end of july just remember how the fed s first rate cuts in 2000 and 2007 turned out the so called fed put was of little use in 2001 and 2007 when s p 500 index earnings growth fell to 0 moreover earnings growth has been slowing more rapidly than economic data suggests companies in the s p 500 index are expected to see an earnings decline in the second quarter according to factset marketwatch here s a graph i ve presented more than once as i ve built my case for a summer recession and for the fed s first increase being the perfect start to such a recession notice where the fed s first rate cuts after a long period of rate increases typically times out and how far the fed has to keep cutting before the attending recession ends click to enlarge you don t get nicer correlation than that maybe that will stuff the cork back in your champagne and save you from a major hangover later remember drinking and cliff climbing don t mix by david haggith more top reads from safehaven com
this article is more than 4 years old 2019 bloomberg finance lp gold has enjoyed quite a spectacular price run in 2019 up 11 since the fireworks greeted new year s day investor demand for bullion has really lit up in the past few weeks amid expectations of central bank rate cuts and the escalating diplomatic and military crisis in the middle east yellow metal values have retraced a little since striking six year highs around 1 437 per ounce at the start of july but as i type this article gold is just 10 bucks off those significant peaks and latest world gold council wgc comments suggest that the safe haven metal could be poised to charge again in the second half of the year watch the fed signs of increasingly doveish monetary policy from central banks across the globe has been a significant driver of bullion of late that classic hedge against inflationary threats and the council has predicted that the prospect of lower interest rates should support gold investment demand in the latter half of 2019 the wgc comments that global monetary policy has shifted by 180 degrees and it placed particular emphasis on the evolving attitudes of the federal reserve in that period expectations of additional rate hikes through 2019 a year ago have given way to predictions of benchmark rates remaining frozen in december and now the market is anticipating two or possibly three rate cuts by the end of the year it says the odds of the washington bank slicing rates in the near future tumbled further overnight following remarks from fed chairman jerome powell he said that uncertainties around trade tensions and concerns about the strength of the global economy continue to weigh on the us economic outlook and that while the domestic economy remains strong at present he asserted that we re committed to using our tools to keep it there central bank rate contagion sure any easing of monetary policy is by no means an inevitability but like the wgc says the fed may not do what the market asks but it generally doesn t like to surprise it either the bullion body suggests that we should be prepared for more accommodative policy outside the us too following on from the european central bank s recent suggestion of bond rate purchases or rate reductions to support the flagging economy expectations are rising that the bank of japan could be next to ease policy and that emerging market banks are likely to follow a similar path as well as signs of a worsening global economic slowdown the wgc says identified a number of risks that could emerge in the coming months to force policymakers to loosen policy these include worsening trade disputes between the us and its trade partners those aforementioned tensions between the us and iran and the impact of brexit and other economic and political issues in europe rate cuts though are not the only possible actions that could emerge in the medium term the wgc argues it says that in the event of a recession central banks may also be forced to rely on quantitative easing and new non traditional measures to stimulate the global economy naturally this bodes well for gold prices as the wgc says our research indicates that the gold price was higher in the 12 months following the end of a tightening cycle central banks to keep buying bullion possible central bank activity is not the only likely driver for gold prices in the months ahead though the wgc suggested that the us dollar may remain rangebound as trade tensions and lower rates offset continued economic growth thus removing a traditional hurdle for commodity values like that of gold on the other side of the coin a backcloth of weaker economic growth and intense gold price volatility could hamper consumer demand in the second half of 2019 the wgc says and especially so in those critical emerging markets it added that the introduction of tax charges on gold imports in the critical indian market could also constrain second half demand a 2 4 sales reduction is estimated for the whole of 2019 solely because of the new levy however purchases of physical gold by central banks should remain positive for the foreseeable future according to the council and that this should help take the sting out of lower consumer demand it notes that these net purchases from these institutions clocked in at 247 tonnes in the five months through may and at a cost of 10 billion
ep 12 bhaskar on bernie talking democratic socialism with jacobin editor bhaskar sunkara we dive back into bernie s speech on democratic socialism with the help of bhaskar sunkara founder and editor in chief of jacobin magazine bhaskar explains why it makes sense for bernie to call himself a democratic socialist and traces the long history of democratic socialism in america plus we hear from a few more parents what democratic socialism means to them bhaskar s book the socialist manifesto transcript bernie sanders now when we talk about oligarchy let us be clear about what we mean briahna joy gray when bernie talks about wealth inequality he likes to throw around some pretty striking numbers bernie sanders right now in the united states of america three families control more wealth than the bottom half of our country some 160 million americans the top 1 own more wealth than the bottom 92 and 49 of all new income generated today goes to the top 1 in fact income and wealth inequality today is greater in the united states than in any time since the 1920s briahna joy gray but wealth isn t just wealth it s power it s the power to decide what gets built and where whether a key measure passes in your state s legislature how many minutes you as an employee are allowed for lunch or to use the bathroom yes we as americans are free to voice our opinions to vote in elections and to pick up and move to a new neighborhood if you can afford it but take a moment to think about all the things that affect your life often profoundly over which you have no power at all a basic economic presumption is that willingness to pay equals ability to pay but anyone who s ever been faced with an exorbitant bill for life saving medical treatment knows that that s less a maxim than a taunt this is hear the bern a podcast about the people ideas and politics that are driving the bernie sanders 2020 campaign and the movement to secure a dignified life for everyone living in this country my name is briahna joy gray and i m coming to you from campaign headquarters in washington dc last week on the heels of bernie s big democratic socialism speech we talked democratic socialism with our parents and i felt like we made some progress in explaining why we ve chosen to define our movement as a democratic socialist one many of you asked to hear more of bernie s speech so for this episode we re diving back in this time with the help of bhaskar sunkara who as founder and editor in chief of jacobin magazine has done much to familiarize folks with democratic socialism in recent years i m probably not telling you anything new but bernie sanders likes to talk a lot about the economy like a lot a lot bernie sanders we now have an economy that is fundamentally broken and grotesquely unfair even while macro economic numbers like gdp the stock market and the unemployment rate are strong millions of middle class and working class people struggle to keep their heads above water while at the same time the billionaire class consumes the lion s share of the wealth that we are collectively creating as a nation in the midst of a so called booming economy real wages for the average worker have barely risen at all and despite an explosion in technology and worker productivity the average wage of the american worker in real dollars is no higher than it was 46 years ago and millions of people in our country today are forced to work two or three jobs just to survive briahna joy gray his point is that although we live in a productive wealthy country the hard work of americans isn t translating into tangible gains at least not for the 99 the reason people are struggling isn t because they re lazy or undeserving as certain politicians have argued over the years paul ryan we have got this tailspin of culture in our inner cities in particular of men not working and just generations of men not even thinking about working or learning the value and the culture of work briahna joy gray it s because the profits of their labor are being stolen by the rich this concept is intuitive to working people and it even went over well with jaime marquez the father of my coworker bianca marquez who we spoke with on last week s democratic socialism episode mr marquez was born in venezuela and was generally opposed to the label democratic socialism though he generally likes bernie sanders but when it came to basic labor theory we were all on the same page i am a capitalist let s in this hypothetical bianca marquez oh i thought you were about to make a self proclamation there and like break that on this podcast and i was really excited briahna joy gray no i feel like my twitter following would have some thoughts and feelings about that but let s say that i ve got a bunch of wood i m in the business of making tables okay you are a laborer you re worker i have 10 worth of wood products because i have capital for reasons historically maybe i colonized someone who knows but i have capital so i have 10 worth of wood and i say to you can you make this into a table you are able to do so you fashion this table for me and now i m able to sell it to bianca for 20 there is 10 worth of profit there you made those 10 worth of profit i provided 10 worth of materials you provided 10 worth of profit through the work of your labor and now i m selling it to bianca for 20 bucks now for me to recoup my investment i have to take 10 right and for me to make any profit at all i ve got to take some of the profit that you put into this table right you put in 10 but you can t get 10 back or i don t have any incentives to do this right the issue isn t that we shouldn t incentivize people to make tables but imagine if you had an ownership stake in my business so that all of the profit that i make some of it goes back to you as well the question isn t should the government own my business should the government take the wood and make you work for the government the question is should the people who are laboring people who are working and actually generating the profit in this country generating all of the goods that make america actually great should they get a bigger share of the pie instead of me saying hm you re poor you would take 1 you would take 50 cents you would take 25 cents right that s the squeeze we re trying to stop jaime marquez i agree with that briahna joy gray when it s presented this way it s clear to lots of folks that income inequality is a moral issue access to capital isn t just about fancy cars or nice houses it s about life itself bernie sanders and here is something quite incredible that tells you all that you need to know about the results of unfettered capitalism all of us want to live long happy and productive lives but in america today the very rich live on average 15 years longer than the poorest americans in 2014 for example in mcdowell county west virginia one of the poorest counties in the nation life expectancy for men was 64 years in fairfax county virginia a wealthy county just 350 miles away life expectancy for men was nearly 82 years an 18 year differential the life expectancy gap for women in the two counties was 12 years in other words the issue of unfettered capitalism is not just an academic debate poverty economic distress and despair are life threatening issues for millions of working people in this country while the rich get richer they live longer lives while poor and working families struggle economically and often lack adequate health care their life expectancy is declining for the first time in modern american history briahna joy gray the fact that your wealth dictates your lifespan should be something out of a dystopian novel not something we re resigned to as a fact of american life and yet the corporate media concerned with more pressing things like a candidate s comfort food choice or their favorite tv show treats bernie s emphasis on these issues as obsessive speaker what he s trying to make happen in the country things like well the government s going to work for everybody it s not going to belong to the billionaires anymore the billionaire class the millionaires the billionaires i mean this is the broken record of bernie sanders bhaskar sunkara why does bernie keep talking about the economy because the economy impacts almost every aspect of our lives people are constantly thinking about the economy when they feel they have no cash in their pockets and they know it s the end of the month is coming up briahna joy gray right that was bhaskar sunkara who has been editing leading democratic socialist writers since he founded the jacobin magazine nine years ago as an undergraduate at george washington university bhaskar argued that what the media sometimes paints as an obsessive distraction is actually at the core of why bernie s message resonated so unexpectedly in 2016 bhaskar sunkara this is on people s minds and we just need to convince them that it s actually worthwhile to go out there and not only vote but organize and campaign and actually come out because i think that a lot of working class americans like our message but there is a degree of cynicism that creeps in after decades of politics not doing anything for you briahna joy gray yeah yeah understandable cynicism bhaskar sunkara yeah especially you don t even get the day off briahna joy gray right right bhaskar sunkara it s like is it worth standing in line for an hour and a half to vote briahna joy gray right that s what you heard from a lot of these the parts of the country that historically were these democratic socialist bastions in which also were the turning point for 2016 places where people didn t turn out to vote when you go and you get narrative accounts instead of just looking at polls when you ask them why it was that they didn t vote these are often not apolitical people these aren t people that didn t care these are people who said after decades and decades of voting for politicians who may gave us a lot of lip service and didn t seem to be offering anything constructive how many generations of us are going to have to live as second and third class citizens bhaskar sunkara that s why we need a candidate that doesn t waffle and equivocate but actually says here s what i m for you might disagree with it but this is what i believe in i think that ll really work briahna joy gray yeah maybe a candidate who decides on a random wednesday to give a 40 minute speech on democratic socialism bhaskar sunkara it just might be briahna joy gray in his speech bernie argued an important point democratic socialism isn t just a good in and of itself it s a unique antidote to the kind of fascism that s taking root all over the world bernie looked to the 20th century for parallels to our current moment of unbridled capitalism and the related rise of right wing extremism he reminded us that fascism was not only a european phenomenon it showed its face in this country too bernie sanders the challenge we confront today as a nation and as a world is in many ways not different from the one we faced a little less than a century ago during and after the great depression of the 1930s then as now deeply rooted and seemingly intractable economic and social disparities led to the rise of right wing nationalist forces all over the world in europe the anger and despair was ultimately harnessed by authoritarians demagogues who fused corporatism nationalism racism and xenophobia into a political movement that amassed totalitarian power destroyed democracy and ultimately murdered millions of people including members of my own family but we must remember that those were not the only places where dark forces tried to rise up and capture power today we are all rightly repulsed by the sight of neo nazis and klansman openly marching in charlottesville virginia and we are horrified by houses of worship being shot up by right wing terrorists but on february 20th 1939 over 20 000 nazis held a mass rally not in berlin not in rome but in madison square garden in front of a 30 foot banner of george washington bordered with swastikas in new york city new york city briahna joy gray if america had its own homegrown fascists bhaskar explained that we had our own democratic socialists too bhaskar sunkara american democratic socialists have been around for a very very long time about a hundred years ago the mayors of cities like berkeley troy milwaukee were all socialists we had members of congress like victor berger was a socialist eugene debs got 1 million votes in some places like oklahoma it was really one of the largest parties around was a socialist party so you could say that socialism was maybe not the mass force that it was in europe but in certain parts of the us it was and it seemed like it was becoming that way socialists themselves embedded themselves as part of much larger reform efforts and this was true throughout the 20th century in the early years socialists were fighting for things like women s suffrage they were fighting to create labor unions then to democratize and integrate those labor unions you have this massive expansion of industry and westward movement but life out there in the west and these mining towns and places like that where it s extremely precarious so often one company would be the largest company that would run basically a town and then all these workers would be herded together in the worst conditions possible you have the perfect moment where people realize that they re either going to starve in this country many of them are immigrants in this place that was completely new to them or they were gonna figure out a way to band together and organize collectively they did organize across different nationalities people who spoke different languages across different races they figured out a way to fight together and socialists were there with a very confident and simple appeal the appeal is something that s been very consistent from the time of eugene debs to norm thomas to now bernie sanders which is that you work hard you re playing by the rules so you deserve more but it s not just a matter of us banding together and getting more because we re asking nicely but in fact there is powerful people that have a benefit from the status quo we re going to have to take wealth and power away from them if we re going to build a better world for everyone briahna joy gray yeah bhaskar sunkara and that message has been consistent briahna joy gray while democratic socialists never came close to controlling congress or the presidency their ideas influence the new deal which in turn steered the country away from the dead ends of oligarchy and fascism bernie sanders we in the united states thank god made a different choice than europe did in responding to the era s social and economic crisis we rejected the ideology of mussolini and hitler and we instead embrace the bold and visionary leadership of franklin delano roosevelt then the leader of the progressive wing of the democratic party together with organized labor leaders in the african american community and progressives inside and outside the democratic party roosevelt led a transformation of the american government and the american economy like today the quest for transformative change was opposed by big business by wall street by the political establishment by the republican party and by the conservative wing of fdr s own democratic party he faced the same scare tactics then that we experience today red baiting xenophobia racism and antisemitism in a famous 1936 campaign speech roosevelt stated and i quote we had to struggle with the old enemies of peace business and financial monopoly speculation reckless banking class antagonism sectionalism war profiteering they had begun to consider the government of the united states as a mere appendage to their own affairs we know now that government by organized money is just as dangerous as government by organized mob and roosevelt concluded and i quote never before in all our history have these forces been so united against one candidate as they stand today they are unanimous in their hate for me and i welcome their hatred briahna joy gray now fdr never described himself as a democratic socialist and many today ask if bernie is hearkening back to the politics of fdr and the new deal why call himself a democratic socialist when other terms are perhaps more familiar to the american public bhaskar explained that the label makes sense for bernie both personally and strategically bhaskar sunkara well first of all it s what he is since his in the early 1960s he got politicized in the young people s socialist league this is his tradition his background his world view was forged by communicating with socialists by taking part in the socialist movement and civil rights movement and the labor movement so there s that why would he lie about how he came to these ideas and how he identifies himself i think first of all his credibility is the most important thing that sanders has going for him because even people who disagree with his policies at least say oh that s an honest guy briahna joy gray yeah bhaskar sunkara he has that going for him that s the reason why even a lot of self described moderates vote for sanders over other politicians briahna joy gray yeah bhaskar sunkara and will support him in this coming election beyond that they re going to call him a socialist anyway briahna joy gray yeah bhaskar sunkara they called obama a socialist briahna joy gray right bhaskar sunkara for the most mild reform program possible a program that many of us on the left thought was in part there was good aspects to it like medicaid expansion they called that radical socialism they re going to call us socialists anyway we might as well define and explain what it s about briahna joy gray bhaskar also argued that the label democratic socialism describes something unique and significant about bernie s approach his theory of change how real political growth actually happens in this country beyond individual policy proposals or incremental ideas even good ideas don t go very far without an appetite for conflict and the backing of a whole lot of people bhaskar sunkara we actually have a vision of change we have a vision of politics that s why sanders always talks about the need for us to band together and organize so it s not just a matter of passing good policy or releasing policy papers and things like that though of course that s important but we actually need to figure out how to join in unions join tenant unions to figure out how to talk to our neighbors politics can t just be the internet even though the internet is great there is lots of great stuff out there also lots of terrifying stuff out there briahna joy gray facts bhaskar sunkara i think that world view that has a vision of conflict has to be there it s not that we like conflict but when some people are hungry and some people don t have health insurance and some people are in danger losing their jobs it s there s already a conflict going on there is already a class war being waged by the elites on ordinary people we just are trying to wage it in the other direction to improve our conditions briahna joy gray as we talked about a little last week bernie s demsoc roots influenced not just his commitment to economic freedoms but to racial justice as well civil rights leaders from a philip randolph to martin luther king jr all embraced democratic socialism and were skeptical of the prospect of racial equality emerging under unfettered capitalism bhaskar sunkara bosses across not just the south but the north too benefited from the fact that workers are split into different groups and you have in the case of black americans this group of people that are the most exploited and marginalized group you could be a boss and not be personally a racist but still say if i could get away with paying this person 5 an hour instead of 8 an hour i m going to pay them 5 an hour briahna joy gray yeah bhaskar sunkara i think they understood that connection that in fact there were real economic interests that had a vested interest in continuing this stratification of people and in other places other contexts that stratification happens differently so in india there might be cast or whatever else but capitalism everywhere has seemed to produce or at the very least benefit from this division and beyond that they realized that if you re talking about helping the most marginalized groups in the country so in this case black americans you have to be talking about distributing power and wealth and if you re talking about distributing power and wealth you re talking about class conflict you re talking about class you re talking about all these other things that socialists had a really useful analysis for beyond that there was a social connection which was simply from the 1920s and 30s onwards socialists were at the forefront of the struggle so to the extent that you could find white americans that were putting their neck on the line to organize black workers and to participate in these struggles a lot of them identified as socialists there is a lot of credibility built up among socialists and communists in these communities but i think we often forget they you had to the march for jobs and justice briahna joy gray yeah bhaskar sunkara the march on washington was about more than just formal equality briahna joy gray yeah bhaskar sunkara because we re seeing today that the civil rights movement what we ended up with was a partial victory briahna joy gray yeah bhaskar sunkara there was real advances made but also if you consider mass incarceration poverty rates unemployment all these things are the result of not being able to finish the revolution not being able to use the power of the state to do things like guarantee jobs to everyone who wants to work briahna joy gray yeah bhaskar sunkara and all these other programs medicare for all these things we sometimes think of as oh this is a good program but it won t really help with racism or it won t really help with sexism actually in fact relieving the precarity and the hardship that people find themselves in will in fact help with these other forms of oppression too briahna joy gray yeah bhaskar sunkara even though we need separate campaigns about them as well right now we have this image of the rustbelt for instance that just angry white workers who lost their jobs and obviously there is a lot of those people too we need to organize them but we forget that a lot of these manufacturing jobs were unionized jobs that black workers had that actually closed the racial wealth gap that propelled people to the middle class that and the combination with public sector employment i know it s not a very sexy socialist topic but the united states postal service is fantastic briahna joy gray yep bhaskar sunkara and also they have far less discriminatory hiring practices and other things so they ve been a huge pathway to the middle class for black families briahna joy gray yep bhaskar sunkara when we talk about fighting against austerity fighting med cuts when we talk about restoring jobs to american cities that have been disinvested from we are also talking about these issues too briahna joy gray last week we spoke to dr greg carr a professor of african american studies at howard university who echoed that refrain dr greg carr world war ii a philip randolph who starts a union and people know about the brotherhood of sleeping car porters and chambermaids these black men and women who were working on these trains what we don t always pause to remember is that the brotherhood extended past the united states there were chapters in canada this union movement isn t just localized that s one reason why black people could understand socialism and what we now call democratic socialism or even communism because they didn t see it as an american issue they saw it as a fairness issue and part of the threat in america always to the specter of something like democratic socialism is the idea that there are values that somehow transcend the united states briahna joy gray and as bernie has always made exceedingly clear some of the most powerful forces in this country and in the world are going to oppose us every step of the way just as they did fdr bernie sanders by rallying the american people fdr and his progressive coalition created the new deal one for terms and created an economy that worked for all and not just the few today new deal initiatives like social security unemployment compensation the right to form a union the minimum wage protection for farmers regulation of wall street and massive infrastructure improvements are considered pillars of american society but while he stood up for the working families of our country we can never forget that president roosevelt was reviled by the oligarchs of his time who berated these extremely popular programs as socialism similarly in the 1960s when president lyndon johnson brought about medicare medicaid and other extremely popular and important programs he was also viciously attacked by the ruling class of this country and here is the point it is no exaggeration to state that not only did fdr s agenda improve the lives of millions of americans but the new deal was enormously popular politically and help defeat far right extremism for a time today america and the world are once again moving toward authoritarianism and the same right wing forces of oligarchy corporatism nationalism racism and xenophobia are on the march pushing us to make the wrong choice that europe made in the last century today we now see a handful of billionaires with unprecedented wealth and power we see huge private monopolies operating outside of any real democratic oversight and often subsidized by taxpayers with the power to control almost every aspect of our lives they are the profit taking gatekeepers of our health care our technology our finance system our food supply and almost all of the other basic necessities of life and let us name them they are wall street the insurance companies the drug companies the fossil fuel industry the military industrial complex the prison industrial complex and giant agribusiness they are the entities with unlimited wealth who surround our nation s capital with thousands of well paid lobbyists who to a very significant degree write the laws that we live under briahna joy gray and so bernie called for us to finish what the new deal started bernie sanders today in the second decade of the 21st century we must take up the unfinished business of the new deal and carry it to completion this is the unfinished business of the democratic party and the vision we together must accomplish in order to accomplish that goal it means committing ourselves to protecting political rights to protecting civil rights and to protect economic rights for all of the people in our country briahna joy gray as i sometimes like to tweet the people get it this is tyler evans a digital media coordinator for the campaign talking to his mom donna a home health nurse from fort worth texas he interviewed her last week for last week s podcast but his tape came in a little too late to include with all the other parents still it s worth listening to tyler evans when i say the words democratic socialism what comes to mind and what does it mean to you donna i really don t know what socialism is but when i hear socialism i think of canada and health care for all tyler evans would you say that s a good thing donna yes tyler evans okay so it sounds like you have a good view of socialism then donna yes tyler evans all right would you describe yourself then as a democratic socialist donna yes tyler evans okay why would you say that donna i just believe in health care for all because i just see too many people going without because they don t have the healthcare and can t afford health care all the deductibles and the copays it s just when these people would have to choose between food and medicine they usually go with the food i just think it should be equal for everybody briahna joy gray for many americans like donna who have seen a health crisis up close it s as simple as that we choose life if we can dish based on the comments you and i both know that this podcast has got something going on i think it s the kind of podcast you can share with people who aren t necessarily committed to the bernie sanders campaign but who generally share progressive politics and they d actually enjoy it we try not to be too propagandistic we try to keep an open mind and just be

from the central bank said chris rupkey chief economist at mufg in new york fed officials are unlikely to cut interest rates more than one or two times this year no matter how badly the trump economics team wants even more stimulus to stoke the economy s engines of growth going into next year s presidential election president donald trump has repeatedly urged the fed to cut rates because

weak inflation will be even more persistent than we currently anticipate following june s solid increase in the core cpi fed officials will be watching to see if that translates into a rebound in both consumers and market based inflation expectations which have dropped over the past year one of the primary reasons the fed is going to cut rates is that inflation expectations have fallen so if expectations bounce back it may limit the scope of the impending easing cycle said eric winograd senior economist at alliancebernstein in new york i think it will take a few months of data for that to

federal reserve chairman jerome powell signalled wednesday that the fed could soon cut interest rates sending stocks higher as the benchmark s p 500 stock index briefly traded above 3 000 for the first time the new zealand dollar rose after us federal reserve put the rate cut back on the table the kiwi was trading at 66 41 us cents at 8am in wellington from 65 97 cents at 5pm powell testifying before the house financial services committee highlighted ongoing risks to the us economy from president donald trump s trade war and a global economic slowdown suggesting a cut may be likely when the fed meets again later this month that the fed is considering a rate cut at a moment when the us economy is strong and job market gains are solid underscores powell and his colleagues concern about the future of a record economic expansion the fed expects unemployment to remain low and inflation to gradually increase but powell said that uncertainties around trade tensions and concerns about the strength of the global economy continue to weigh on the us economic outlook the fed which has not cut rates since slashing them nearly to zero during the financial crisis has been under pressure from trump to lower borrowing costs the president has called the fed the biggest risk to the us economy and has said repeatedly that powell does not know what he s doing let s take a look at the economy and let that be the report card powell said when asked about the president s criticism pointing to the record long expansion and low unemployment powell has insisted that the fed will not bend to political pressure and will do what is needed to sustain the expansion his testimony pushed markets higher as investors ignored possible economic storm clouds and cheered the increased likelihood that the fed will soon lower borrowing costs falling interest rates lift stocks for several reasons even when they come amid mounting economic risks they lower the returns on new investments in bonds the main alternative to stocks for many investors that makes stocks look more attractive to investors a rate cut also makes it cheaper for consumers and companies to borrow and that can buck up economic activity and help corporate profits the s p 500 is up 19 4 per cent in 2019 after already enjoying one of the longest bull markets on record since the climb began in march 2009 the index has more than quadrupled stocks closed higher though the s p had retreated to 2 993 07 by the end of trading you ve got some modest growth you ve got moderate inflation you ve got a decent labor market and you ve got valuations in the market that aren t stretched said scott wren senior global equity strategist at the wells fargo investment institute what is worrying the fed now are looming risks to the economy powell told lawmakers that uncertainties about the outlook have increased in recent months adding that a number of government policy issues have yet to be resolved including trade developments the federal debt ceiling and brexit referring to britain s negotiations to exit the european union wall street welcomed news of the rate cut photo getty images the federal debt ceiling may need to be raised early this fall for the government to borrow more money and avoid default the united states and china have agreed to restart trade negotiations but powell said that did not eliminate the economic risks emanating from the dispute which has begun to hurt confidence and business spending around the globe trump has already placed tariffs on 250 billion worth of chinese goods and china has retaliated against american products a resolution is far from certain we ve agreed to begin discussions again with china while that s a constructive step it doesn t remove the uncertainty powell said adding that a strong june jobs report did not change the outlook on interest rates the uncertainties around global growth and trade continue to weigh on the outlook he said in addition inflation continues to be muted investors fully expect a cut of a quarter percentage point at the fed s july 30 to july 31 meeting and bets that the move could be as big as half a percentage point climbed wednesday powell did not explicitly say a rate cut is coming but he pointed to mounting economic concerns and made no effort to walk back market pricing for expectations of a cut this month he also did not rule out the possibility of a larger cut when given the chance to do so the fed s pre meeting blackout period starts july 20 so officials have just this week and next to manage expectations the 17 member fed policymaking committee was split in june over whether the central bank should cut rates this year with eight officials projecting a cut before the end of the year and nine pointing to no change or a rate increase minutes from the june meeting that were released wednesday reinforced powell s message many fed officials thought an rate cut could be warranted in the near term if uncertainty persisted the notes show that sentiment seems to be holding up james bullard president of the federal reserve bank of st louis and the lone dissenter in favor of lower rates in june said on a call with reporters wednesday that he would argue for a rate cut of a quarter percentage point at the next meeting he has penciled in half a percentage point in cuts before the end of the year that would depend on how the economy developed and especially on how inflation and inflation expectations developed he said if the fed lowers borrowing costs the move may please the president trump has been jawboning the fed to cut rates for months aiming a barrage of tweets and comments at the central bank powell reiterated that he was not acting at the behest of political pressure which has included reports that the white house has looked into demoting him from chair to a fed governor asked by a lawmaker what he would do if trump tried to fire him powell responded that he would not step down of course i would not do that powell said my answer would be no he added that the law clearly gives me a four year term and i fully intend to serve it political pressures aside tepid price gains are making a rate cut more likely inflation climbed just 1 5 per cent in the year through may well below the fed s 2 per cent target weak prices are a problem because they increase the risk of economy harming deflation and leave policymakers less room to cut rates in a downturn the nz dollar rose off the back of the us news photo getty images fed officials are also increasingly alert to slow wage growth and powell made what might be his strongest comments yet that the labor market was not behaving the way most economists would have expected unemployment is at a 50 year low but wages have yet to rise in the way they typically should if there are more jobs than available workers we don t have any basis or any evidence for calling this a hot labor market powell said to call something hot you need to see some heat and while we hear lots of reports of companies having a hard time finding qualified labor nonetheless we don t really see wages really responding he said so i don t really see that as a current issue moving rates lower even just slightly could signal that the fed is ready to defend its 2 per cent inflation goal and show that it is prepared to act to offset fallout from the trade war and slowing foreign growth when discussing reasons to potentially cut rates at their june meeting several fed officials said they saw less upward pressure on inflation from tight labor markets than they had expected a few were concerned that inflation expectations had already sunk too low based on the meeting minutes powell will get a second chance to convey expectations about a potential rate cut thursday when he testifies before the senate banking committee written by jeanna smialek and matt phillips photographs by tom benner 2019 the new york times
abdulrahman al hussein published 11 07 2019 jordan stands at a serious crossroads and its future remains tenuous the u s and gulf backed hashemite kingdom located between saudi arabia syria jordan and iraq has played a pivotal role in the u s vanguard against terrorism despite receiving generous financial support from its benefactors jordan is beholden to their whims considering the myriad crises currently facing the monarchy aside from increased tensions with citizens over proposed reforms and the expanding refugee population of 1 3 million syrians jordan is stuck in an economic and political vise grip that threatens to extinguish the nation s future between growth that has tumbled over the last few years to a mere 1 8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018 and high structural unemployment of 19 percent economic momentum is just one of the many shortfalls that could wind up toppling king abdullah and ending the hashemite reign dependency that drives foreign influence saudi arabia and the united states are responsible for much of the aid money that keeps the jordanian leadership structure intact unsurprisingly there are strings attached to their aid whether in the religious dimension of saudi arabian wahabism or u s demands that the jordanians support the israeli palestinian peace process efforts to broker peace have expanded divisions between amman and its gulf neighbors especially as saudi arabia aspires to have a greater role in islamic affairs in jerusalem in tandem with its support for the forthcoming trump peace plan however support for a peace plan has angered the jordanian government as saudi arabia arranges rescue financing worth 2 5 billion to assist the struggling jordanian economy in 2018 assuredly saudi funding has declined over the years but that does not mean the jordanian king does not call upon his benefactors when beckoned the jordanian economy is reeling from financial obligations that have brought debt to gdp close to a staggering 94 23 percent in 2016 the country accepted a 723 million loan from the international monetary fund imf contingent on the kingdom engaging in a number of fiscal reforms to bring down debt levels while using funds to drive inclusive growth and job creation however efforts to reduce debt and improve growth via the accompanying austerity measures caused an extreme backlash the resulting price increases and measures designed to reduce debt sparked a great deal of protest forcing the resignation of former prime minister hani mulki in 2018 a saudi commitment of 250 million per year over five years to aid the jordanian government budget alongside similar efforts from kuwait and the united arab emirates uae has done little to assuage jordanian citizen s animosity toward the gulf cooperation council however when considering that reforms including higher income taxes and the removal of subsidies for key staples including fuel bread and electricity were met with extreme public protest jordan has been forced to accept the funds at the expense of foreign policy independence that still has not fixed the debt situation or spurred growth evidenced by the world bank recently increasing its financing commitment to jordan by an additional 1 45 billion through a second equitable growth and job creation development policy loan or dpl2 the same is true when evaluating the jordanian relationship with the united states the 1 billion plus annual foreign aid check from the u s to jordan is a means of peddling influence making the u s the single largest foreign aid donor to jordan support does come with a price tag jordanians are to support u s initiatives to build lasting peace between israel and jordan these efforts have been met largely with consternation from jordan possibly complicating the economic and political outlook for the king moreover u s efforts to wind down its palestinian aid commitments through the united nations relief and works agency for palestine refugees in the near east unrwa has increased the kingdom s fury considering it is home to nearly 2 million registered palestinian refugees additionally the war being waged in neighboring syria has done lasting damage to jordan creating an influx of refugees and straining the country s finances ever further at a time when the economy can ill afford to feed more mouths however trying to transform this dependency might have more immediate consequences for the king as he allegedly seeks new allies either in qatar or turkey and possibly makes quiet overtures towards iran although publicly denied even if communication with iran is simply media speculation it is a sign that the king faces real domestic opposition willing to blacken his reputation even possibly within his inner circle growing political insurrection intensifies struggles king abdullah faces a major internal power struggle forcing him to fight the opposition by predominantly firing those who present challenges and leveling unsubstantiated charges of corruption in the last year alone the cabinet has been replaced three times after the former prime minister was sacked nearly a year ago shuffling the cabinet is the latest of many strategies designed expressly to redirect criticism leveled at the government much of this criticism is warranted especially when considering the endemic corruption that sprawls across the kingdom complicating the king s tenuous rule when faced with criticism or challenges to his rule king abdullah goes back to his late father s dismissal playbook of accusing rivals of corruption or shuffling cabinet ministers yet instead of firing his opposition and purging adversaries in the government and judiciary he should instead turn his focus inwards towards fixing ailing infrastructure and building the foundations needed to attract growth capital and promote jobs in the country only through proper economic management and the end of heavily embedded top down corruption does king abdullah stand a chance of clinging to power the imf led efforts will continue to fail unless a real plan and strategy for the economy that does not involve the nation s corrupt elite comes to fruition furthermore foreign aid should be better directed to ensure that the population and not the inner circle of jordanian commercial and political elites is the sole beneficiary of this support instead of begging allies old and new to prop up the government with more funding every year abdullah should change tack and focus on the economy though loath to hear the u s administration s peace plans despite the accompanying economic incentives for jordan to participate it does represent a light at the end of the tunnel for staving off escaping complete financial collapse between the acute water crisis and limited funds to restore any modicum of economic prowess or build supportive economic infrastructure defiant stubbornness will certainly not provide the way out of the kingdom s conundrum in an age when protests and rallies can quickly challenge the incumbent power structure and reduce it to rubble in a matter of weeks king abdullah must act swiftly and abandon the status quo or risk becoming another failed middle eastern or north african mena state mired in conflict while he certainly does not want to cede political and foreign policy independence to gulf states and the u s without addressing the economy in a way that produces demonstrable results for a population that has seen its standard of living only decline the kingdom s future may prove terminal middle east

on the face of it bank of canada governor stephen poloz and his deputy carolyn wilkins had some excellent news about the canadian economy in yesterday s monetary policy report the happy story included falling mortgage rates continued employment strength and growing business investment that have pushed canadian economic growth rates higher in the first half of the year than almost anyone expected but as global trade threats linger canada s top central bankers warn that many people who should know better including stock market investors seem to think cuts to interest rates can solve all problems in a complex world riven by trade disputes they say there are simply limits to the power of central bankers to patch things up the warnings including hints of the possibility of a new bout of stagflation were effectively a message that rate cuts are no easy answer for the damaging effect of a global trade war significantly negative scenario the underlying shock would be very bad for economic growth it would be bad for the level of productivity it would be quite harmful to profitability said poloz of a potential growing trade spat it would be a pretty significantly negative scenario more on that later but first a look at why the canadian central bank foresaw canada s interest rates remaining steady while on the same day u s central banker jerome powell implied in congressional testimony that u s interest rates were about to fall while that sounds like the u s and canada diverging the senior deputy governor of canada s central bank said at yesterday s news conference instead it was a sign that the two economies were growing together in fact it s a sign of convergence and this is because the two countries are at different points in our economic cycles said wilkins the u s is slowing to a more sustainable pace while canada is moving back up to its trend growth at the end of last year there were signs businesses were shying away from new canadian investments due to fears a new nafta would not be resolved even as that fear faded the u s steel and aluminum tariffs and u s president donald trump s threats against mexico over immigration left a lingering feeling of caution while u s federal reserve chair jerome powell testified to congress that he was considering cutting rates the bank of canada said it would hold rates steady erin scott reuters wilkins said resolving all those difficulties plus renewed strength in the canadian oil and gas sector have helped to stimulate business investment confidence signs of a return to confidence in the canadian housing market including five year mortgage rates returning to levels of five years ago mean real estate will once again be a growth stimulant rather than a drag of course as poloz remarked canadian business still has an interest rate advantage u s interest rates at 2 5 per cent are well above canada s 1 75 per cent futures markets foresee canada holding interest rates steady this year while the fed makes three quarter point cuts barring other potential shocks that would put the two rates back into sync jobs complexity while business confidence and a partial return to strength in oil and housing markets are clear drivers the central bankers say continued strength in new hiring is slightly more mysterious wilkins says economists have had trouble working out a clear relationship between the timing of gdp growth and waves of new hiring just one of the complexities that make looking into the economy s future a far from exact science what companies have on their minds is they need to hire in fact to be ready for the growth that they tell us they expect to see she suggested despite resolution of many of the trade worries the bank has described in the past poloz and wilkins say they and their advisers still believe the biggest risk for canada s economic future remains trade the bank s strategy for trying to address something it cannot control is to draw up two divergent scenarios workers pour concrete outside a toronto highrise among the difficulties of predicting the economic future there is no clear link between the increases in gdp and the hiring of workers said wilkins don pittis cbc for those interested the two extreme outlooks are described in box 2 on page 21 of the monetary policy report and of course the gloomier one an all out trade war is the more interesting in describing this bleaker scenario poloz foresees that central banks with their single superpower of making money cheap simply may not be equipped to deal with the repercussions and he says it is here that stock market investors blithely assuming lower rates will always make stocks go higher may be mistaken the markets are not really onto the complexity of it said poloz describing an event where trade barriers raised the cost of imports while a falling loonie added to the effect ultimately it could lead to a situation where the economy was weakening while prices were rising a classic example of what north america experienced during the stagflation of the 1970s in that moment you have a trade off between a slowing economy and rising unemployment and rising inflation at the same time said poloz and obviously monetary policy would not be able to buffer both of those all the more reason for canadians to hope the bank of canada s good news scenario where the global economy broadly returns to pre 2017 trade arrangements and uncertainty about future trade policy dissipates is the one that comes true follow don on twitter don_pittis

the bank of canada s firmly entrenched holding pattern on rates will be put to the test by the country s ability to withstand a deceleration in the world s largest economy and its biggest trading partner the ottawa based central bank left the overnight rate unchanged at 1 75 per cent on wednesday for a sixth straight decision and indicated it s in no rush to introduce easier policy despite a mounting drag from the u s china trade war and a widely anticipated interest rate reduction by the federal reserve later this month canada doesn t need to follow the fed in large part because its growth will be superior to that of the u s without additional monetary accommodation according to policy makers the central bank forecasts a pick up of 1 9 per cent growth for the canadian economy in 2020 from 1 3 per cent this year and for u s activity to tail off to 1 7 per cent from 2 5 per cent that might sound like divergence but in fact it s a process of convergence carolyn wilkins bank of canada senior deputy governor said in a press conference return to synchronicity deep trade linkages have ensured a high degree of historical synchronicity between canadian and american economic performance with episodes of decoupling arising over the past decade due to major commodity price shocks and differences in the timing of fiscal stimulus indeed the consensus among economists surveyed by bloomberg is for both economies to expand by 1 8 per cent in 2020 canadian growth is supported by a monetary policy stance that s currently more stimulative than in the u s while domestic centric headwinds related to housing and the energy sector look to be ebbing it s entirely consistent for canada in this circumstance to grow just a little bit faster than the u s as we adjust towards potential from below and they adjust from above said wilkins that s an apt diagnosis according to toronto dominion bank senior economist brian depratto who sees the central bank on hold through 2020 if anything the bank of canada is setting a low bar for the near term growth outlook he said which will help bolster the case for keeping rates on hold with easing going on south of the border and the bleed through in funding conditions that does sort of prime things for a bit of a return to that growth pattern with housing and consumption he said and then you ve got the human stimulus argument canada s continuing to have healthy population growth which translates into labor force and job gains most economists who track the bank of canada also expect rates to be on hold through 2020 that sets governor stephen poloz up for a poetic pause if the current holding pattern on rates lasts through the first half of 2020 he ll be poised to end his seven year term just as he started it with more than a year and a half of unchanged policy but traders aren t completely on board with the message a 25 basis point rate cut isn t fully priced in over the next year though the implied odds of an ease roughly doubled to 80 on wednesday in the wake of the central bank s decision in concert with dovish remarks from fed chair jerome powell story doesn t hold a handful of economists share the market s doubts canada has imported easier financial conditions in the form of lower bond yields without matching the extent of the dovish turn taken by central banks globally but the nation hasn t been a complete free rider on this trend according to avery shenfeld chief economist at canadian imperial bank of commerce five year bond yields which tend to move along with five year fixed mortgage rates the dominant product in the canadian real estate market have some degree of bank of canada easing baked into them which will reverse if the central bank fails to deliver it s reasonable for now for the bank of canada to not give too many clues one way or the other on interest rates as they had this wisdom of not hiking as much as the fed shenfeld said but there will be enough of a global slowing that the impact on canada from that coupled with the threat of canadian dollar appreciation if the bank of canada stays on hold forever will be enough to prompt a token ease cibc expects a cut in the second quarter of 2020 macquarie capital economist david doyle agrees pointing to a nasty shock awaiting canadians poised to renew mortgages next year a stark contrast to the limited stress on those doing so this year it s funny to me that the boc in their growth model indicates a big part of the inflection in growth you re getting is coming from residential investment and also have consumption relatively stable he said that strikes me as odd because of that rate reset headwind which was specifically brought up as an element that s supporting activity in the current year becomes a wall of a headwind as you move into 2020 disappointing growth in 2020 will elicit rate cuts starting in the middle of the year concludes doyle that s because this time unlike in 2018 canada won t be able to ride the coattails of a booming economy stateside
by valerie hernandez international banker the annual gross domestic product gdp growth of the united states was recently recorded at 3 2 percent for the first quarter of 2019 indicating that the world s biggest economy continues to expand at a healthy rate indeed should positive growth remain uninterrupted for the next few months this current period of economic expansion will be the longest on record nevertheless recent months have seen their fair share of gloomy forecasts being posted many of which have predicted an outright recession on the horizon a february gallup poll for example found that 39 percent of us adults believed that the economy was slowing down while a further 17 percent believed it was already in a recession or depression and reuters polls of economists in march and april revealed a 25 percent probability of a recession hitting during the next 12 months the highest figure recorded since 2014 further evidence of heightened recession fears has also been found in the more cautious approach being taken by insurers a recent survey of top investment and finance professionals from the insurance industry found that an economic contraction either next year or in 2021 is now a major concern the survey which was carried out by goldman sachs asset management gsam found that of the 307 executive participants 35 percent identified a recession in the world s biggest economy as being their main worry much higher than the 24 percent recorded the previous year and of those respondents 82 percent expect that recession to transpire in 2020 or 2021 although only 2 percent believe it will happen this year according to michael siegel gsam s global head of insurance asset management insurers are predicting that a us recession is coming but just not this year as a result they are continuing to commit capital but are more selective in the risks they are taking insurance is not the only industry that has expressed caution due to recessionary worries in recent times moreover online lenders have taken a similar position the possibility of a recession is very top of mind for us lendingclub ceo scott sanborn recently told reuters it s not a question of if it s when and it s not five years away sanborn is just one of several online lending executives who anticipate deteriorating economic conditions ahead kathryn petralia president of the small business lender kabbage meanwhile acknowledged that her company has been waiting for the next recession to happen for the past five years and that more people feel confident that it s imminent such bearish sentiment will no doubt have been strengthened by recent activity in the bond market on march 22 fears of a recession were inflamed when the yield on the 10 year us treasury note briefly fell below that of the three month bill this situation known commonly as an inverted yield curve has invariably indicated a coming recession in the past as it suggests that investors are expecting that lower interest rates will be required in the future compared with the present on this occasion the yield curve became inverted for the first time since 2007 indeed an inverted yield curve has emerged prior to each of the last seven recessions and although on this occasion it has bounced marginally from negative territory since march it remains dangerously close to returning but not everyone is convinced that negative growth looms for the united states far from it jpmorgan chase economists for example have significantly reduced their projections of a recession emerging within 12 months from 65 percent at the end of 2018 to just 15 percent four months later while the start of the year saw business confidence taking a hit as well as weak consumer sentiment and a tepid housing market amid a painful government shutdown the outlook seems to have become more upbeat as the year has progressed one of the biggest reasons for the increasingly positive sentiment in some quarters is the decidedly more dovish stance that the federal reserve took in january when it made clear it does not expect to raise interest rates for the remainder of 2019 despite previously projecting two hikes during the year although this was initially decided on the basis of slower economic growth than expected the recent increase in the gdp growth rate for the first quarter does not seem to have swayed the fed into raising rates with inflation continuing to come in well below its target of 2 percent the us central bank appears to have a more pressing challenge of building upwards momentum in prices and wages the head of the federal reserve bank of chicago charles evans remarked that there is the distinct risk that inflation expectations are too low and that it will be slow to recover to levels that are consistent with our symmetric 2 percent goal this view is also supported by bank of america with ethan harris its head of global economics research recently suggesting that the fed will hold rates indefinitely it s got nothing to do with growth data the growth data look fine the economy is coming back to trend in fact if anything the data are slightly better than expected right now so it s all about inflation as such many don t see a us recession materialising imminently wells fargo economist sam bullard for example sees gdp growth slowing over the next 18 months as fiscal stimulus tailwinds fade and previous tighter monetary policy actions take hold but also acknowledges that event risk is high and has the potential to provide the catalyst for the next downturn such risk would seemingly include the continued escalation of the trade war between the us and china a further increase in tariffs could have a substantial dampening effect not only on both respective economies but also on the global economy indeed business confidence remains underwhelming in no small part due to the ongoing uncertainty regarding us china trade relations but for the time being it s difficult to look past the strong gdp growth and the lowest unemployment levels since 1969 and conclude that the economy is currently in anything other than a robust position and although this current hot streak of growth will come to an end at some point whether it does so in the near future remains to be seen

consumers and market based inflation expectations which have dropped over the past year one of the primary reasons the fed is going to cut rates is that inflation expectations have fallen so if

this month for the first time in a decade delivering the central bank s semiannual report to congress powell said since fed officials met last month uncertainties around trade tensions and concerns about the strength of the global economy continue to weigh on the u s economic outlook in addition inflation has dipped further below the fed s annual target level the chairman s remarks led investors to send stock prices up bond yields down and the value of the u s dollar lower on expectations of lower interest rates the s p 500 index briefly traded over 3 000 for the first time testifying to the house financial services committee powell was asked as he has been before what he would do if president donald trump tried to fire or demote him powell offered the same terse reply he s given in the past when asked about trump s attacks on his leadership and the president s insistence he has authority to remove the chairman powell said he intends to serve out his full four year term which ends in early 2022 the president has repeatedly accused powell and the fed of keeping credit too tight for too long and of thereby holding back the economy and the stock market most experts dispute trump s assertion he has authority to either fire powell or demote him from the chairman s post and his attacks have raised alarms he s undermining the fed s long recognized independence from political pressure powell s description wednesday of a more downbeat economic landscape led most economists to conclude a quarter point rate cut is a virtual certainty at the fed s meeting in three weeks with many forecasting further rate cuts to come some characterized a likely rate cut late this month as an insurance policy against an economic downturn i think it will be the start of a series of rate cuts added sung won sohn economics professor at loyola marymount university in los angeles powell wants to provide fuel for the economy down the road expectations of a pending rate cut drew additional support wednesday when the fed released the minutes of its june 18 19 meeting the central bank held rates unchanged then but the minutes showed some officials felt looser credit could soon be needed to address economic weakness investors have collectively put the odds of a rate cut this month at 100 percent the fed s benchmark rate stands in a range of 2 25 2 5 percent after it raised rates four times last year action that incited the initial attacks on the powell fed from trump in the prepared remarks he delivered wednesday before taking questions from the house members powell made no mention of the president s criticism he did thank congress for the independence it has given the fed to operate free of political intrusion but later in the question and answer period several democratic committee members offered support for powell s leadership and a rejection of trump s criticism rep maxine waters who leads the committee declared this president has made it clear that he has no understanding or respect for the independence of the federal reserve waters and other democrats urged powell to stand up to trump s attacks have no fear rep david scott d ga told the chairman we in congress both democrats and republicans have got your back powell s remarks wednesday began two days of his testimony on capitol hill today he will address the senate banking committee at the moment the u s economic landscape is a mixed one the job market appears resilient but economic growth is slowing many forecasters predict growth has slowed to an annual rate of around 2 percent in the just completed april june quarter in his testimony powell said the economy has fared reasonably well over the first half of the year but he noted crosscurrents such as trade tensions and concerns about global growth have been weighing on economic activity and the outlook he said growth in business investment seems to have slowed notably possibly because of concerns over slowing global growth and the trade battle between the trump administration and china the fed chairman told the house committee he thinks average worker pay isn t rising fast enough to accelerate low inflation even with the unemployment rate near a five decade low an absence of inflation pressure makes it easier for the fed to cut short term rates referring to rates powell repeated a pledge the fed made in its june policy statement that officials would act as appropriate to sustain the expansion but notably he added many fed official saw that the case for a looser monetary policy had strengthened the fed hasn t cut rates since 2008 at the height of the financial crisis trump and chinese president xi jinping declared a truce last month in what had threatened to become an escalating u s china trade war and agreed to resume talks toward a deal that would meet the administration s demands to better protect u s technology that step eased fears that trump would extend punitive tariffs to an additional 300 billion in chinese goods in the process inviting retaliation from beijing on american exports and likely weakening both nations economies and last week the government reported that after a tepid job gain in may u s employers sharply stepped up their hiring in june an indication of the economy s durability

climate change plan that aims to create 10 6 million new jobs through nearly 11 trillion in public and private spending advertisement much of what warren proposes in her clean jobs plan is drawn from measures that she has previously rolled out including expanded job training making all new cars and small trucks electric or otherwise non emissions producing tightening building codes and retrofitting homes to meet energy efficiency standards but in the plan warren lays out how she believes these proposals will result in millions of new jobs based on the assumption that increased federal spending would spur additional private spending money laundering and other financial crimes warren vowed to crack down on global money laundering and other financial crimes if she s elected president warren said she d press for legislation that would require so called shell companies legal entities that are often created to hide the ownership of an asset to identify their owners arguing

new deal jumping off the green new deal a proposal from alexandria ocasio cortez that warren has signed onto the blue new deal seeks to address how climate change is affecting oceans and other waters while ensuring a vibrant marine economy warren said the plan would expand protected waters end new fossil fuel leases in federal waters while accelerating permits for renewable projects require equipment for offshore wind farms to be made with american raw materials invest in regenerative ocean farming and reduce pollution at us ports advertisement part time worker protections warren would require most employers in the retail hospitality cleaning and warehouse industries to notify employees of their work schedules two weeks in advance countering the increasingly common practice of on demand scheduling in which algorithms assign employees to shifts at the last minute such a change also would effectively ban companies from scheduling their workers for on call shifts in which employees are required to be available for shifts they may or may not actually work white nationalism calling the end to domestic terrorism a top priority if elected president warren outlined a series of measures she d enact to curb white nationalist violence she would require state and local governments to fully report suspected incidences of bias motivated crimes so that federal officials could more accurately assess the scope of the white nationalist threat she also would create a federal interagency task force to address white nationalist crime with a focus on early intervention warren

nationwide right to counsel and establish a federal grant program aimed at benefiting low income tenants facing eviction warren promised to withhold federal funding from corporate landlords with a history of harassing or red lining tenants and to direct the federal housing administration to deny all financial support to landlords that violate tenants rights advertisement medicare for all warren promised to spend more than 20 trillion over the next decade to provide government funded health care to every american without raising middle class taxes her plan is built on transferring to the

employers to pay slightly less than what they are projected to pay today and through existing taxes warren wrote in a 20 page online post detailing her program companies with fewer than 50 employees would be exempted and in a nod to unions whose support will be key in the democratic primary warren said that employers already offering health benefits reached under collective bargaining agreements will be allowed to reduce how much they send to federal coffers provided that they pass those savings on to employees if the program fails to raise 8 8 trillion warren says she d make up the difference by imposing a supplemental contribution requirement for big companies with extremely high executive compensation and stock buyback rates to manage the transition warren said she would use her first 100 days in office if elected president to dramatically expand government health insurance she offered an aggressive four year timeline to transition the nation to medicare for all warren s plan would turn the sweeping transformation of health care coverage into a two step process advertisement judicial ethics as part of a sweeping judicial ethics plan warren wants to close a loophole that allows federal judges to skirt investigations of misconduct by retiring or becoming elevated to the supreme court a move that would allow officials to re open probes into supreme court justice brett kavanaugh and president trump s sister lgbtq rights warren says she would reverse trump s ban on transgender individuals serving in the military on day one she said she d push for passage of the equality act which codifies a number of anti discrimination measures environmental justice warren would direct the environmental protection agency to extensively map which communities are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change so federal clean air and water rules can be adjusted and she promised to hold an environmental justice summit within her first 100 days in office she would also direct one third of a proposed climate investment under the green new deal into communities most at risk of adverse environmental effects which she said would equal at least 1 trillion over the next decade superpacs warren said she d put additional restrictions on the use of political action committee pac money banning federal candidates from accepting pac money created by corporations including foreign corporations she d also attempt to curb the practice of nominating donors to ambassadorships by banning campaign contributions from being taken into consideration when choosing diplomats warren would also place new limits on the ability of lobbyists and corporations to donate to a presidential inauguration committee warren s plan would also place online political advertising in the same category as print and broadcast ads subjecting them to more regulations as well as set up a larger public campaign financing system and tighten contribution limits to candidates and parties public education warrens wants to boost spending on public schools eliminate high stakes testing and end federal funding for charter school expansion as a part of her comprehensive education reform plan she promised if elected president to use federal funding as an incentive for more states to better integrate their schools a move she said is crucial to achieving the best educational outcomes for all students she added she would push states to dedicate more money per student to high poverty school districts unions and labor warren would expand existing labor law protections to include previously exempted groups make it harder for companies to classify employees as independent contractors repeal the federal law that allows states to enact right to work laws that limit union funding and give new power to the national labor relations board she also would seek to boost pay by raising the federal minimum wage to 15 an hour and making millions more workers eligible for overtime she pledged that any nominee for the supreme court must be a demonstrated advocate for workers and would ban the permanent replacement of workers who go on strike and make it easier for workers to organize boycotts in addition to curbing employer lockouts anti corruption plan warren says her plan to fight corruption in government is at the core of her presidential campaign it would ban lobbyists from many fund raising activities and serving as political campaign bundlers tighten limits on politicians accepting gifts or payment for government actions and bar senior officials and members of congress from serving on nonprofit boards the plan would prohibit federal judges from avoiding misconduct investigations by leaving their posts prevent courts from sealing settlements in public health and safety cases and ban class action waivers for all cases involving employment consumer protection antitrust and civil rights warren would also close a loophole that currently allows judges to avoid misconduct investigations if they are elevated to the supreme court or retire as part of the plan warren released a proposal to re establish the office of technology assessment which once provided congress with analysis of complex scientific and technology issues warren said the move would allow congress to make decisions about technical subjects without relying on lobbyists warren would also impose a steep tax lobbying expenditures over 500 000 and ban huge companies from hiring senior government officials for at least four years or face multimillion dollar fines she would also seek a law that would apply perjury law to companies that lie to federal regulators warren also promised to take aggressive steps to erase the trump administration s influence on the federal government her first day in office warren pledged to ask all political appointees to resign and direct the justice department to appoint an independent task force to investigate corruption that took place during the trump administration tax plans warren s wealth tax would target the richest families in america the annual tax would target 2 percent of all assets of more than 50 million and 3 percent of assets of more than 1 billion this would raise an estimated 2 75 trillion over 10 years from what warren refers to as the tippy top 0 1 percent of american families according to an analysis by economists emmanuel saez and gabriel zucman at the university of california at berkeley a separate corporate tax would affect amazon and the nation s other most profitable companies the plan would place a 7 percent levy on profits beyond 100 million resolving what she called a disparity between the profits that corporations report to their shareholders and what those same corporations tell the irs the tax would affect about 1 200 corporations and raise approximately 1 trillion over 10 years warren said higher education warren wants to wipe out massive amounts of student debt her plan would cancel up to 50 000 in student loan debt for every person with a household income under 100 000 for those with higher incomes she proposes canceling less in a series of steps for example a person with an income of 130 000 would get 40 000 in debt canceled the plan offers no relief to households that earn more than 250 000 she also wants to implement free undergraduate tuition and fees at all public two and four year colleges and create a fund of at least 50 billion to help historically black colleges and universities and other institutions that serve minority students specifically she said she d pay for it with her ultra millionaire tax on accumulated wealth in january warren announced she believes she could use executive authority to cancel student loan debt without congressional action child care warren s universal child care plan would aim to ease the burden faced by working families trying to find quality day care for their preschool age children it would create a network of child care providers and scale up the federal head start program which offers early learning services to low income families families earning less than 200 percent of the poverty line would have access to free child care while those earning more would pay on a sliding scale topping out at 7 percent of a family s income warren said her ultra millionaire tax would pay for the plan housing in march warren reintroduced ambitious legislation to create millions of new affordable housing units and help tackle ongoing housing segregation and the yawning wealth gap between white and black americans the bill would boost federal funding to build more than 3 million affordable housing units for low and middle income families and create a 10 billion grant program that would give money to communities who overhaul zoning rules that currently prevent affordable housing construction to address past discrimination in federal housing policy warren s bill would provide down payment assistance to first time homebuyers living in areas that had been redlined or officially segregated before such practices became illegal an outside analysis found the plan would not add to the federal deficit because of changes to the estate tax public lands warren called for a ban on new fossil fuel leases on federally controlled land proposed reversing the trump administration s cuts to national monuments and said entry to all national parks should be free filibuster warren announced in april that she supports drastically changing the senate by eliminating its legendary filibuster to give her party a better chance of implementing its ambitious agenda the change would mean a 60 vote supermajority would no longer be necessary to advance most bills farmers warren in march called for breaking up some of the biggest farming corporations so that they not only do not have that kind of economic power so that they re wiping out competition so they re taking all the profits for themselves but also so that they don t have that kind of political power reparations the concept of reparations takes different forms depending on the school of thought but generally it involves some sort of monetary compensation for the forced enslavement of africans in the united states prior to emancipation the issue has divided the 2020 primary field and warren has not explicitly endorsed the idea rather warren says she is in favor of creating a commission to study the issue and make a report to congress she expanded on her thinking during a cnn town hall electoral college warren supports dismantling the electoral college the system that allocates votes to presidential candidates based on the size of the state s congressional delegation the electoral college system has elected a president who did not win the popular vote on five separate occasions including president trump in 2016 eliminating the electoral college would most likely require a constitutional amendment big tech breakup warren would target major technology companies like amazon and google by strengthening existing regulations and using the antimonopoly laws that once reined in microsoft for example warren s plan would prevent amazon from promoting its own products to the detriment of competitors on its platform opioids warren s opioid plan is a revival of a bill she championed in the us senate and is modeled on a landmark 1990 law passed in response to the aids epidemic that sent federal funding to areas hardest hit by the crisis as part of warren s plan massachusetts would see about 56 6 million annually in state grants plus another 63 5 million in local grants targeting the counties hardest hit by the opioid crisis puerto rico as part of legislation she reintroduced in the senate warren argued the island of puerto rico should be allowed to erase its debt like other us cities if certain criteria are met her plan would also allow some holders of puerto rican debt such as island residents and pensioners to be compensated for any losses incurred as a result of any discharge economic patriotism in a sweeping proposal warren made a broad argument that the federal government should intervene in private industry to protect american jobs and she outlined a number of ways to accomplish this she called for more active management of the us dollar using federal research dollars to create domestic jobs increasing export promotion and restructuring worker training and she proposed transforming the commerce department and other agencies into the department of economic development green energy warren s green energy plan released the same day as her economic patriotism proposal has three prongs 400 billion in funding for clean energy research a 1 5 trillion commitment from the federal government to purchase domestic clean energy products and a 100 billion green marshall plan that would help other countries purchase clean energy technology from the united states warren cited an analysis from moody s analytics that said her plan would be paid for with a tax she wants to levy on corporate profits and by ending federal oil and gas subsidies and closing some corporate tax loopholes roe v wade warren called on congress to pass a law guaranteeing abortion access outlined in the supreme court s roe v wade decision and threw her support behind an existing bill that would block so called trap laws which place a host of restrictions on abortion services in an effort to limit access pentagon ethics warren s plan for the department of defense would target what she calls the revolving door of former officials who return to lobby for lucrative defense department contracts on behalf of companies like boeing and lockheed martin the plan would impose a four year ban on giant contractors hiring senior defense officials or former defense employees who managed their contract minority entrepreneurship warren is proposing a 7 billion fund to help minority entrepreneurs start small businesses through grants rather than loans the fund would be limited to entrepreneurs with less than 100 000 in household wealth she also said she d require the federal government to seek out more diverse asset managers for pension funds voting rights warren wants congress to standardize elections for federal office with uniformly designed ballots and brand new voting machines in every polling place nationwide combined with a fort knox like security system to prevent tampering the system would be run by a new federal secure democracy administration automatic and same day voter registration would be mandated nationwide and warren s proposal would make it more difficult to purge voters from the rolls election day would become a federal holiday with expanded polling hours and voters could cast ballots a minimum of 15 days before an election state department warren who said the defense department is 40 times the size of the state department called for doubling the number of diplomats working in the foreign service with an eye toward more diverse recruitment opening new offices in areas that do not have a us presence and enhancing diplomats professional development with training programs racial wage disparities warren said she d use an executive order to mandate a 15 minimum wage among federal contractors and ban employment practices that she argues tilt the playing field against women of color such as asking a job applicant for her prior salary or requiring new hires to sign employment agreements that restrict their rights if they leave the company or make a complaint warren also said she d require federal contractors to disclose information on their employees pay and job title along with demographic data and stop working with companies with large disparities immigration warren s sweeping plan to reshape the nation s immigration system would significantly expand opportunities for migrants and refugees to come to the united states while taking steps to protect them and provide a path to citizenship for undocumented people already here countering trump policies she would establish a federal task force to investigate claims of abuse against immigrant detainees eliminate expedited removal proceedings that deny migrants full legal hearings and create a national corps of public defenders to provide counsel for immigrants fighting deportation warren pledged to expand community alternatives to detention and to issue guidance to federal agencies to ensure detention is only used for people who pose a risk of not appearing in immigration court or are deemed a danger to the public wall street regulation with her regulatory plans targeting big banks warren escalated her long battle with wall street calling for new rules to curtail the private equity industry by making firms responsible for the debts and other obligations of the companies they purchase and changing tax rates and loopholes that aid them accusing the industry of legalized looting warren castigated private equity firms for lining their pockets even when the companies they purchase fail connecting the issue to the growth of corporate profits and the stagnation of wages in the american economy trade senator elizabeth warren proposed a sweeping overhaul of american trade policy that would put labor and human rights along with consumer and environmental protections ahead of the needs of big corporations the proposals from the democratic presidential candidate would set preconditions for future deals but also apply to existing ones effectively requiring the renegotiation of major trade agreements the extensive plan includes changes to every facet of the complex trade agreements that govern how goods are exchanged between the us and other countries from negotiation to ratification by congress to enforcement the reforms broadly aim to tip the scales of power within the agreement in favor of labor and the environment rural communities warren proposed a multifaceted approach to improving conditions for americans living in rural areas which have faced inequities in health care and internet access and have been hit hard by the opioid crisis and trade wars in perhaps the most significant change warren would replace a long established farm subsidy system with one that allows the government to buy products in the form of a loan until farmers are able to secure better prices from private purchasers the government would store the products in reserves and would release the supply in and out of the market to stabilize consumer prices and farmers incomes on health care warren would require the federal trade commission to curb hospital mergers that leave less populated areas of the country without access to hospital care to improve access in currently underserved areas warren wants to increase funding for community health centers to increase internet access in rural communities that private companies have passed over warren wants to allow municipalities to build their own publicly funded networks and also create a program that offers grants to nonprofits looking to expand broadband access gun control warren outlined a series of gun control measures with an ambitious goal of slashing rates of gun deaths by 80 percent including firearms licensing and an assault weapons ban warren would also implement universal background checks and significantly hike taxes on gun manufacturers to as high as 50 percent on ammunition she would set a nationwide one week waiting period to buy guns and cap the number of guns that can be purchased per month at one her legislation would also raise the minimum age to buy any type of gun to 21 and strengthen meaures to combat so called straw purchases involving a person buying a gun on behalf of someone who is prohibited from buying it warren s plan endorses red flag laws that allow guns to be seized from individuals deemed dangerous to themselves or others she also proposed extending restrictions of firearms sales to those convicted of hate crimes stalking or who have restraining orders native american issues senator elizabeth warren denounced the federal government s treatment of native americans and offered a suite of proposals to improve the lives of indigenous people a plan that won praise for its ambition but risked reviving a fraught subject for her presidential campaign warren called for the federal government to do more to honor its treaties with tribal nations safeguard tribal lands and improve funding for programs that provide native americans with health care education housing and other critical services criminal justice senator elizabeth warren is proposing a host of new initiatives in a sweeping overhaul of the nation s criminal justice system outlining changes that would affect policies ranging from school disclipline to sentencing guidelines to the use of force by police similar to her approach on voting rights warren s plan relies on the use of federal money as leverage to encourage local law enforcement and local prosecutors to adopt many of her changes which include decriminalizing truancy ending stop and frisk repealing the 1994 crime bill ending solitary confinement boost public defender funding and relying on advice from a more diverse pool of voices including the formerly incarcerated climate change warren released a plan to address climate change by transitioning the nation to 100 percent clean energy in a decade pledging to adopt a key goal of former democratic presidential campaign rival jay inslee and calling on the rest of the primary field to do the same warren is proposing to pay for the plan which would cost 1 trillion over 10 years with revenue generated by reversing president trump s tax cuts enacted by congress in 2017 for large corporations and wealthy individuals warren s administration would eliminate coal fired power plants within a decade and require utilities to move to 100 percent carbon neutral electricity generation by 2030 warren wrote she d ensure protections for coal miners by funding health care and pensions by 2035 warren would aim to achieve an electric grid that is all clean renewable and zero emission social security warren s proposal would increase benefits by 200 a month for social security recipients and extend the program s solvency by two decades through increased contribution requirements on the top two percent of earners warren proposed to pay for the plan by boosting the social security contributions effectively a tax increase of those making more than 250 000 a year she cited an analysis from moody s analytics that found the benefits hike would lift 4 9 million

washington ap pointing to a weaker global economy rising trade tensions and chronically low inflation chairman jerome powell signaled wednesday that the federal reserve is likely to cut interest rates late this month for the first time in a decade delivering the central bank s semiannual report to congress powell said that since fed officials met last month uncertainties around trade tensions and concerns about the strength of the global economy continue to weigh on the u s economic outlook in addition inflation has dipped further below the fed s annual target level the chairman s remarks led investors to send stock prices up bond yields down and the value of the u s dollar lower on expectations of lower interest rates the s p 500 index briefly traded over 3 000 for the first time testifying to the house financial services committee powell was asked as he has been before what he would do if president donald trump tried to fire or demote him powell offered the same terse reply he s given in the past when asked about trump s attacks on his leadership and the president s insistence that he has authority to remove the chairman powell said he intends to serve out his full four year term which ends in early 2022 the president has repeatedly accused powell and the fed of keeping credit too tight for too long and of thereby holding back the economy and the stock market most experts dispute trump s assertion that he has authority to either fire powell or demote him from the chairman s post and his attacks have raised alarms that he s undermining the fed s long recognized independence from political pressure powell s description wednesday of a more downbeat economic landscape led most economists to conclude that a quarter point rate cut is a virtual certainty at the fed s meeting in three weeks with many forecasting further rate cuts to come some characterized a likely rate cut late this month as an insurance policy against an economic downturn i think it will be the start of a series of rate cuts added sung won sohn economics professor at loyola marymount university in los angeles powell wants to provide fuel for the economy down the road expectations of a pending rate cut drew additional support wednesday when the fed released the minutes of its june 18 19 meeting the central bank held rates unchanged then but the minutes showed that some officials felt looser credit could soon be needed to address economic weakness investors have collectively put the odds of a rate cut this month at 100 the fed s benchmark rate stands in a range of 2 25 to 2 5

period several democratic committee members offered support for powell s leadership and a rejection of trump s criticism rep maxine waters who leads the committee declared that this president has made

monaca pa if you want a sense of the challenges democrats face in 2022 s house races look no further than two districts that share a common border in western pennsylvania pennsylvania s 12th district which includes pittsburgh as well as suburbs to the east and south looks to be solidly democratic a deep blue stronghold the district is home to democratic candidate summer lee who has built her campaign around environmental justice and income inequality the state s 17th district which holds some of pittsburgh s suburbs and all of rural exurban beaver county looks much more like a toss up the district is home to democratic candidate chris deluzio who focuses on his veteran status and his work to help unionize the university of pittsburgh s faculty both districts include parts of allegheny county the home of pittsburgh but the two offer very different terrains for democrats not long ago this entire area was democratic in the 2000 presidential race democrat al gore carried allegheny county by 16 points while carrying beaver by 9 points but 2020 showed how the map had changed joe biden carried allegheny by 20 points but donald trump carried beaver by 18 points what happened pittsburgh still considered the steel city by many americans has morphed into a medical and tech center about 43 percent of the 25 and over population has a bachelor s degree but many of the suburbs around the city like those in beaver are still rooted in the area s industrial past about 26 percent of adults in beaver have a bachelor s degree the emerging differences are clear to see on the ground last week in pittsburgh we met with jasiri x the co founder and ceo of 1hood a community organizing group in the city his concern is whether democrats are doing enough on the issues that black voters face on a day to day basis 2018 was this very pivotal year for pittsburgh he said we had a very high profile police killing of a young man named antwon rose we also had the tree of life massacre later on that year it began to be like ok well protesting by itself isn t enough he continued can we move to come together to actually create and change laws he says that these voters haven t seen the return on their investment and want democrats to push harder on progressive policies instead of being passive an hour drive away from the city in the far northern reaches of the northwestern pittsburgh suburbs the united steelworkers local 1016 held a meeting in wheatland pennsylvania there we heard a very different message of what the country needs trump s new brand of union workers were more worried about issues like the emerging supreme court decision on abortion united steelworkers district 10 director bernie hall studied his crowd of union leaders closely taking stock of what political questions arose a biden voter himself he was worried about candidates increasingly going to extremes if the supreme court can overturn a law like roe v wade from 1973 what about the 1935 wagner act that said employees have a right to establish a union we ll have dozens of these across the state he said i m concerned that people aren t getting facts in general not only about president biden but just about the political process and issues that face our country in aliquippa after the local steel mill shut down nature is slowly reclaiming empty homes and many of residents of this hard hit african american community are well beneath the poverty line aliquippa mayor dwan walker d urged democrats to unite the rural voters and urban progressives the way forward in western pennsylvania he says is to remind people the area is the birthplace of the unions there s 72 000 democrats light blue he said but they ll vote republican just based off the message the message just has to be claimed

were echoes of last friday s trade when the index put on 30 plus points ahead of a critical us jobs report this time it was ahead of a critical fed testimony we recall that the index then crashed on monday when the news was bad more jobs than expected last night the news was good fed rate cut coming so our futures are up 5 this morning deciding yesterday was enough local traders also decided enough was enough at lunch time as the asx200 gradually gave back half its gains through the afternoon one wonders how much of the strength in the market presently is due to offshore interest with the aussie at 69 the cash rate at 1 0 and dividend yields of 5 or better available when the us cash rate is at 2 25 lower bound about to become 2 0 and the average dividend yield on the s p500 is around 2

for discretionary stocks and decided the rate cuts tax cuts and a stabilising housing market have set the most promising scene for retail in years the broker upgraded several stocks in the space albeit most from underperform to neutral the sector rose 1 2 citi would presumably not have been thrilled thus when the westpac consumer confidence survey was released this confidence index has fallen this month by 4 1 to a two year low 96 5 from 100 7 and hence into pessimism from optimism despite as westpac economists noted all of the above that citi is excited about digging down pessimism appears to be related to concerns over the direction of the australian economy while stock market traders laud rate cuts as good news consumers see them for what they are the bond proxies were back in favour again yesterday helping industrials up 1 0 and utilities up 0 7 it blindly followed the nasdaq as usual up 1 8 the nasdaq hit another new high last night the banks sat it out while materials were the only sector to go backwards 0 5 base metal prices were indeed all lower overnight but iron ore surged 4 and the big miners were again sold yesterday it would appear recent volatility in the iron ore price has investors a little wary the asx200 is still over 70 points away from last friday s new high and a fairly muted response on wall street overnight does not suggest anything explosive today but it seems our market is happy to explode spontaneously whenever it is so inclined phew friday night s strong jobs number led to investors questioning the assumed certainty of a fed rate cut this month but last night it was uncertainty that underscored that certainty fed chair jay powell all but confirmed to the house there will be a rate cut gone are assumptions of low inflation being transitory as was the case late last year gone is any notion of being patient as was the case earlier this year now the buzzword is uncertainty as was oft repeated in powell s testimony very oft in fact the major sources of uncertainty are slowing global growth and the trade war while the latter feeds into the former it also feeds into a stalling in us business investment and a decline in manufacturing output the trade war was meant to be over in march and despite a truce being declared at the g20 peace seems just as far away as ever hence the uncertainty while some still believe july will bring a full 50 point cut the money is on 25 points to correct the mistake made in december with the chance of another 25 in september to provide actual easing in response to powell s testimony the s p hit 3000 for the first time it hit 2000 for the first time in 2014 but that was an intraday high before a close of 2993 the nasdaq did hit a new all time high but all up the response was relatively muted as expectations had already been baked in most notably the us two year yield plunged 8 basis points while the ten year sat still at 2 06 the yield curve has thus steepened suggesting the rate cut or cuts will stave off recession the us dollar index dropped 0 4 and commodity prices took off gold jumped twenty bucks oil prices leapt 3 5 but were further bolstered by news of a cyclone forming in the gulf it seems the oldsmobiles are in early this year the energy sector thus helped drive the dow and s p while the tech sector is enjoying renewed faith as evidenced by the

federal reserve chairman jerome powell said downside risks to the us economy are lingering as trade wars soften business investment and inflation stays weak signaling that policy makers may be poised to cut interest rates as soon as this month since fed officials met in june it appears that uncertainties around trade tensions and concerns about the strength of the global economy continue to weigh on the us economic outlook powell said in prepared remarks to u s lawmakers wednesday inflation pressures remain muted the fed chief s semiannual testimony supports the market view that the central bank is preparing to reduce borrowing costs at its july 30 31 meeting despite a strong june jobs report traders cemented bets that a quarterpoint rate cut is coming this month and moved to price in closer to three quarterpoint reductions by the end of 2019 us stock futures reversed a decline treasuries rallied and the dollar weakened powell s remarks come amid mounting pressure from president donald trump to cut rates he opened his testimony by embracing the central bank s mandates for maximum employment and stable prices as well as its independence noting that it comes comes with a need for transparency and accountability powell carefully explained the reasons why the policy committee has shifted its views this year and noted that crosscurrents have reemerged creating greater uncertainty despite a current trade war truce with china powell continued to stress downside risks to the outlook uncertainties about the outlook have increased in recent months powell said in the text of his remarks economic momentum appears to have slowed in some major foreign economies and that weakness could affect the us economy moreover a number of government policy issues have yet to be resolved including trade developments the federal debt ceiling and brexit he noted that policy makers are carefully monitoring developments including the risk that weak readings on inflation could be even more persistent than we currently anticipate the hearing before the house financial services committee is scheduled to begin at 10 a m in washington in addition powell pointed to a slowdown in business investment decelerating global growth and declines in housing investment and manufacturing output the statement released after the last meeting also cited rising uncertainties and muted inflation in its shift toward a rate cutting bias last month some analysts say the case for a cut is intact even after the trump administration dialed down its trade war with china and the june employment report showed payroll gains climbed a solid 224 000 last month investors expect a quarter point reduction this month according to pricing in interest rate futures contracts recent us economic data have been mixed but analysts cite a variety of indicators the fed could point to supporting a cut a gross domestic product tracking indicator from the atlanta fed suggests second quarter economic growth slowed significantly powell noted that while the labor market remains healthy gains have been uneven for many americans citing unemployment rates for african americans and hispanics that remain well above the rates for whites and asians income inequality has become a rallying cry for democratic candidates as the 2020 presidential race kicks off the fed chief gave lawmakers a list of troubling economic issues that would be better solved by fiscal policy rather than by the central bank finding ways to boost productivity should remain a high national priority he said powell is testifying before the house and again before the senate on thursday as trump has relentlessly attacked him blew it trump tweeted june 24 after the fed left rates on hold the week before comparing it to a stubborn child if the fed knew what it was doing it would cut rates the president told reporters sunday trump announced his intentions to nominate two potentially dovish members to the fed last week either of whom might be a fed chair pick for trump when powell s term ends in 2022 assuming the president wins reelection next year one is christopher waller research director at the st louis fed trump s other pick is judy shelton who has a record as a hard money advocate but tweeted after the announcement that she will strive to support the u s progrowth economic agenda with the appropriate monetary policy
o il it is often noted can bring a country both wealth and woe in venezuela by some measures home to the world s largest proven oil reserves it has mostly been the latter of late petróleos de venezuela pdvsa saw production peak in 1998 when hugo chávez was elected president in the years that followed the left wing tribune and his authoritarian successor nicolás maduro purged pdvsa s professional staff strong armed its international partners and raided its coffers a sweeping american probe of bribery at the company has so far charged more than 20 people its current boss is a brigadier general with no oil experience since january when america announced tough sanctions on pdvsa production has plunged to the lowest levels per citizen since the 1920s meanwhile millions of venezuelans lack food and basic medicine listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element pdvsa is a caricature of mismanagement but a survey of state controlled energy giants in latin america which accounts for around 10 of global oil output and 20 of proven reserves shows dysfunction is not confined to venezuela five years after the oil price crashed output remains depressed in much of the region even as the industry as a whole faces unprecedented disruption the shale boom helped the united states produce 15 3m barrels of oil a day last year about one sixth of global output concerns about carbon emissions and the rise of electric cars mean that worries about peak supply have been supplanted by fears of peak demand this uncertainty has added new urgency to the old question of how to maximise the value of crude reserves instead of tackling this head on latin america s national energy champions or rather their political taskmasters are relitigating debates of yore subject firms to political pressures or keep them independent invite foreign investment or shun it maximise efficiency or create jobs subsidise petrol or let prices move with the market their responses have for the most part been discouraging states control about 90 of the world s oil and gas reserves they do so in different ways as latin america illustrates in guyana the region s youngest petrostate production is about to boom following a discovery in 2015 by exxonmobil but the country has yet to create its own oil company pemex by contrast was founded as a state owned monopoly in mexico in 1938 other countries have both state companies and foreign ones often in an uneasy partnership brazil s state run giant petrobras listed shares in america in 2000 its argentine and colombian counterparts also have private minority shareholders in ecuador the state controls more than 80 of oil output perupetro peru s firm cum regulator oversees private companies exploration and production venezuela having opened up its oil sector in the 1990s in 2006 declared that pdvsa would take majority control of oilfields managed by foreign firms bp and chevron were among those that agreed exxonmobil and conocophillips packed their bags despite their different corporate forms most of latin america s oil giants share three problems in common the first is mismanagement of cash in good times that included pouring too much money into government coffers and too little into investment for future growth in 2013 when the oil price topped 100 a barrel pemex transferred about half of its revenue to mexico s government despite rising crude prices petrobras saw its share price decline as it loaded up on debt and invested in too many marginal projects as oil prices plummeted latin america s oil companies racked up long term liabilities of more than 400bn or 8 5 of their countries combined gdp according to data from the natural resource governance institute a think tank petrobras accounted for nearly half the total some politicians and executives also used the companies as personal piggy banks the second common problem corruption scandals rocked petrobras petroecuador and pemex as well as pdvsa petrobras took a particular nosedive when it emerged that construction firms paid brazilian politicians billions of dollars in bribes in exchange for padded contracts to build refineries and other infrastructure this combined with the mountain of debt led credit rating agencies to downgrade petrobras to junk in 2015 between august 2014 and february 2016 the company s market capitalisation shrivelled by 115bn or 80 only some of that was down to the collapsing oil price exxonmobil s stock dipped by 18 in the period see chart there are signs the sleaze is being cleaned up in brazil and elsewhere several senior petrobras executives and scores of brazilian politicians have been prosecuted over the petrolão big oily affair on july 5th mexican authorities said they had issued an arrest warrant for emilio lozoya who led pemex from 2012 to 2016 and has fled the country as lenín moreno ecuador s president mops up the mess at petroecuador american prosecutors continue to file charges alleging bribery at the company during the tenure of his predecessor rafael correa however companies remain susceptible to political whims the third and most vexing shared challenge start with petrobras the region s biggest producer has made progress last year it agreed to pay minority shareholders 2 95bn in a class action settlement in america pedro parente who became chief executive in 2016 cut costs began selling less profitable assets reformed pricing policy and set about boosting production from vast resources tucked under thousands of metres of salt beneath the seabed still petrobras remains vulnerable to political undulations last year the government reintroduced petrol subsidies to appease angry lorry drivers mr parente resigned and petrobras shares took a knock jair bolsonaro brazil s new president appointed roberto castello branco a well regarded economist who had served on the company s board and looked set to continue mr parente s market friendly policies but faced with the risk of another strike in april mr bolsonaro asked him to scrap plans for a 5 7 increase in the price of diesel petrobras s share price which had risen sixfold since the trough in 2016 wobbled the government rushed to calm the market announcing the auction of several oil refineries and a price increase only slightly lower than planned but investors are shaken you re not going to sell a single screw of a refinery until the market has confidence that there won t be government interference says one local oil veteran crisis of abundance the situation in mexico second to brazil in regional oil production looks worse pemex has been a symbol of sovereignty and national pride since lázaro cárdenas expropriated oilfields in 1938 with oil tethered to politics strategy has been liable to swing from one presidency to the next as mexico realised the potential of the giant offshore cantarell field in the 1970s josé lópez portillo the president declared that all mexico needed to do was manage the abundance instead the cantarell boom bred complacency and investment declined last year the field produced 80 000 barrels per day down from 2m in 2014 complicating matters for years pemex has borrowed money to pay its taxes accumulating government guaranteed loans this has turned it into a vehicle for public debt leaving mexico particularly vulnerable to its waning fortunes pemex has overtaken petrobras as the world s most indebted oil company with long term liabilities equivalent to 15 of mexico s gdp on june 6th fitch ratings stripped it of its investment grade pemex is now led by a political ally of andrés manuel lópez obrador mexico s populist president with no experience in oil or gas it had sought foreign partners to jump start production but mr lópez obrador has frozen future auctions of exploration sites keen to reduce dependence on american fuel imports he plans to build a refinery in his home state of tabasco for 8bn or more which may aggravate pemex s woes not alleviate them mr lópez obrador s finance minister has just resigned apparently in part because he objected to the president s strategy for pemex see article further plans for the company are expected this month jpmorgan chase a bank described an earlier rescue package as worse than underwhelming fitch thinks taxes would need to be halved for the company to retain enough cash either to invest in its business or pay down debt the president s goal of raising crude production by around 50 by 2024 from 1 7m today looks fanciful latin america s other state oil champions are minnows next to petrobras and pemex but their experiences are nevertheless instructive in argentina the oil industry has been scarred by the decision in 2012 by the then president cristina fernández de kirchner to renationalise 51 of ypf privatised 19 years earlier ms fernández s market friendly successor mauricio macri has made it easier for foreign firms to invest in the country as it competes with overseas rivals and forms occasional partnerships with them ypf is at last beginning to tap argentina s rich shale deposits in the vaca muerta formation in northern patagonia but in dollar terms the company s share price languishes 80 below its peak in 2005 progress could be undone if ms fernández s peronist ally wins the presidency the former president herself is currently campaigning as his running mate in some ways the region s brightest spot has been colombia álvaro uribe president from 2002 to 2010 set about restructuring ecopetrol his changes included the creation of an independent regulator and the listing of 11 of ecopetrol shares which provided an infusion of capital that helped the company enlist better managers in 2015 it recruited felipe bayón pardo a former senior executive at bp a british oil giant who became boss in 2017 after the downturn in oil prices at the end of 2014 ecopetrol slashed spending when prices ticked up spending rose though more slowly than in mexico but ecopetrol s reserves are dwindling to boost them it is teaming up with international oil majors and investing 500m in fracking success is not assured in colombia or elsewhere the international energy agency an intergovernmental forecaster predicted that brazilian output would boom last year yet output dipped as new oilfields were slow to begin production and mature ones fell those concerned about climate change might argue that the region s inefficient state run firms would do well to return more money to shareholders and invest the rest in cleaner energy rivals in other parts of the world are taking tentative steps in that direction statoil norway s titan has reinvented itself as equinor its portfolio comprises both oil projects and wind farms even the world s oil colossus saudi aramco is making a bet on petrochemicals and refining demand for which should remain robust even if a global carbon price one day depressed that for crude latin american oilmen are too consumed by old challenges to deal with these new ones
washington pointing to a weaker global economy rising trade tensions and chronically low inflation chairman jerome powell signaled wednesday that the federal reserve is likely to cut interest rates late this month for the first time in a decade delivering the central bank s semiannual report to congress powell said that since fed officials met last month uncertainties around trade tensions and concerns about the strength of the global economy continue to weigh on the u s economic outlook in addition inflation has dipped further below the fed s annual target level the chairman s remarks led investors to send stock prices up bond yields down and the value of the u s dollar lower on expectations of lower interest rates the s p 500 index briefly traded over 3 000 for the first time testifying to the house financial services committee powell was asked as he has been before what he would do if president donald trump tried to fire or demote him powell offered the same terse reply he s given in the past when asked about trump s attacks on his leadership and the president s insistence that he has authority to remove the chairman powell said he intends to serve out his full four year term which ends in early 2022 the president has repeatedly accused powell and the fed of keeping credit too tight for too long and of thereby holding back the economy and the stock market most experts dispute trump s assertion that he has authority to either fire powell or demote him from the chairman s post and his attacks have raised alarms that he s undermining the fed s long recognized independence from political pressure powell s description wednesday of a more downbeat economic landscape led most economists to conclude that a quarter point rate cut is a virtual certainty at the fed s meeting in three weeks with many forecasting further rate cuts to come some characterized a likely rate cut late this month as an insurance policy against an economic downturn i think it will be the start of a series of rate cuts added sung won sohn economics professor at loyola marymount university in los angeles powell wants to provide fuel for the economy down the road expectations of a pending rate cut drew additional support wednesday when the fed released the minutes of its june 18 19 meeting the central bank held rates unchanged then but the minutes showed that some officials felt looser credit could soon be needed to address economic weakness investors have collectively put the odds of a rate cut this month at 100 percent the fed s benchmark rate stands in a range of 2 25 percent to 2 5 percent after it raised rates four times last year action that incited the initial attacks on the powell fed from trump in the prepared remarks he delivered wednesday before taking questions from the house members powell made no mention of the president s criticism he did thank congress for the independence it has given the fed to operate free of political intrusion but later in the question and answer period several democratic committee members offered support for powell s leadership and a rejection of trump s criticism rep maxine waters who leads the committee declared that this president has made it clear that he has no understanding or respect for the independence of the federal reserve waters and other democrats urged powell to stand up to trump s attacks have no fear rep david scott d ga told the chairman we in congress both democrats and republicans have got your back powell s remarks wednesday began two days of his testimony on capitol hill on thursday he will address the senate banking committee at the moment the u s economic landscape is a mixed one the job market appears resilient but economic growth is slowing many forecasters predict that growth has slowed to an annual rate of around 2 percent in the just completed april june quarter in his testimony powell said the economy has fared reasonably well over the first half of the year but he noted that crosscurrents such as trade tensions and concerns about global growth have been weighing on economic activity and the outlook he said that growth in business investment seems to have slowed notably possibly because of concerns over slowing global growth and the trade battle between the trump administration and china the fed chairman told the house committee that he thinks average worker pay isn t rising fast enough to accelerate low inflation even with the unemployment rate near a five decade low an absence of inflation pressure makes it easier for the fed to cut short term rates referring to rates powell repeated a pledge the fed made in its june policy statement that officials would act as appropriate to sustain the expansion but notably he added that many fed official saw that the case for a looser monetary policy had strengthened the fed hasn t cut rates since 2008 at the height of the financial crisis trump and chinese president xi jinping declared a truce last month in what had threatened to become an escalating u s china trade war and agreed to resume talks toward a deal that would meet the administration s demands to better protect u s technology that step

washington mayor pete buttigieg is accusing president donald trump of racially and politically motivated manipulation of the census as the president works to add a citizenship question to the census despite being rebuked by the courts in an interview with nbc news craig melvin buttigieg predicts that asking about citizenship will lead to under representation on the 2020 census making the whole country worse off there s a reason why the courts ruled that this is wrong buttigieg say i ll let other scholars talk about why the president s actions may be unconstitutional but it s very clear that it s wrong buttigieg spoke hours before trump was expected to use an afternoon news conference to announce he s attempting to add the citizenship question to the census using executive action after the supreme court blocked the administration from including the question based on the rationale initially put forward buttigieg s remarks come as he puts a laser focus on increasing his appeal to african americans and hispanics who have been slow to warm to his campaign his struggles in appealing to a broad cross section of the democratic primary electorate have raised growing questions about his continued viability in the primary the south bend mayor also rebuked trump over his administration s planned immigration raids across the country saying they are designed to strike fear into people at a moment when fear is something we have got way too much of in this country if rumors start going around about raids let alone if it starts actually happening it immediately makes the community less safe it makes people less likely to participate in the economy less likely to talk to law enforcement when they need help dealing with something that really is a matter of danger buttigieg said as he works to show black voters in particular that he s the best candidate to improve their lives buttigieg earlier thursday released an 18 page proposal dubbed the douglass plan that his campaign hopes will stand out as the most comprehensive of any put forward by a 2020 democratic candidate buttigieg said he s been working on the plan for months as way to better answer black voters inquiries on the campaign trail about how he is best positioned to improve their lives but this isn t just aimed at black voters buttigieg says frankly there needs to be a conversation with white america with white audiences about how none of us can or should be willing to live in a system where these kinds of systemic racist dimensions persist
the canadian dollar is in demand u s federal reserve chair jerome powell s testimony to congress and the bank of canada boc interest rate statement and monetary policy report mpr delivered a one two punch to the nose of canadian dollar bears the boc left interest rates unchanged at 1 75 no surprises there the monetary policy statement was somewhat ambiguous it had fodder for bullish and bearish outlooks but the initial reaction by canadian dollar traders was to sell the currency that sentiment changed upon closer reading of the mpr and during boc governor poloz s press conference the mpr was rather upbeat the second quarter gross domestic product forecast got upgraded to 2 3 the report also noted that improvements in consumption labour growth and a more balanced housing market the mpr also noted positive developments in the oil and gas sector however the china us trade dispute and china s restrictive trade policies on some canadian exports canola meat products were a serious concern the mpr models warned that the canadian economy would suffer far greater from a negative us china trade result than it would gain by a positive outcome nevertheless financial markets concluded that the boc was neutral and not as dovish as expected the canadian dollar rallied and tested significant resistance at the usd cad 1 3040 level powell s congressional testimony and the minutes from the federal open market committee fomc meeting of june 19 were key drivers of canadian dollar demand powell is concerned that the u s china trade war is restraining domestic growth he said in our june meeting statement we indicated that in light of increased uncertainties about the economic outlook and muted inflation pressures we would closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and would act as appropriate to sustain the expansion many fomc participants saw that the case for a somewhat more accommodative monetary policy had strengthened since then based on incoming data and other developments it appears that uncertainties around trade tensions and concerns about the strength of the global economy continue to weigh on the u s economic outlook the fomc minutes were more explicit about cutting rates they said many judged additional monetary policy accommodation would be warranted in the near term should these recent developments prove to be sustained and continue to weigh on the economic outlook several others noted that additional monetary policy accommodation could well be appropriate if incoming information showed further deterioration in the outlook the u s dollar came under pressure following powell s comments selling continued overnight and it is trading in toronto lower than where it closed the canadian dollar got an added benefit from a surge in wet texas intermediate oil prices after a british navy ship in the strait of hormuz stopped iranian navy ships from harassing a u k oil tanker it was escorting rahim madhavji is the president of knightsbridgefx com a canadian currency exchange that provides better rates than the banks to canadians
monaca pa if you want a sense of the challenges democrats face in 2022 s house races look no further than two districts that share a common border in western pennsylvania pennsylvania s 12th district which includes pittsburgh as well as suburbs to the east and south looks to be solidly democratic a deep blue stronghold the district is home to democratic candidate summer lee who has built her campaign around environmental justice and income inequality the state s 17th district which holds some of pittsburgh s suburbs and all of rural exurban beaver county looks much more like a toss up the district is home to democratic candidate chris deluzio who focuses on his veteran status and his work to help unionize the university of pittsburgh s faculty both districts include parts of allegheny county the home of pittsburgh but the two offer very different terrains for democrats not long ago this entire area was democratic in the 2000 presidential race democrat al gore carried allegheny county by 16 points while carrying beaver by 9 points but 2020 showed how the map had changed joe biden carried allegheny by 20 points but donald trump carried beaver by 18 points what happened pittsburgh still considered the steel city by many americans has morphed into a medical and tech center about 43 percent of the 25 and over population has a bachelor s degree but many of the suburbs around the city like those in beaver are still rooted in the area s industrial past about 26 percent of adults in beaver have a bachelor s degree the emerging differences are clear to see on the ground last week in pittsburgh we met with jasiri x the co founder and ceo of 1hood a community organizing group in the city his concern is whether democrats are doing enough on the issues that black voters face on a day to day basis 2018 was this very pivotal year for pittsburgh he said we had a very high profile police killing of a young man named antwon rose we also had the tree of life massacre later on that year it began to be like ok well protesting by itself isn t enough he continued can we move to come together to actually create and change laws he says that these voters haven t seen the return on their investment and want democrats to push harder on progressive policies instead of being passive an hour drive away from the city in the far northern reaches of the northwestern pittsburgh suburbs the united steelworkers local 1016 held a meeting in wheatland pennsylvania there we heard a very different message of what the country needs trump s new brand of union workers were more worried about issues like the emerging supreme court decision on abortion united steelworkers district 10 director bernie hall studied his crowd of union leaders closely taking stock of what political questions arose a biden voter himself he was worried about candidates increasingly going to extremes if the supreme court can overturn a law like roe v wade from 1973 what about the 1935 wagner act that said employees have a right to establish a union we ll have dozens of these across the state he said i m concerned that people aren t getting facts in general not only about president biden but just about the political process and issues that face our country in aliquippa after the local steel mill shut down nature is slowly reclaiming empty homes and many of residents of this hard hit african american community are well beneath the poverty line aliquippa mayor dwan walker d urged democrats to unite the rural voters and urban progressives the way forward in western pennsylvania he says is to remind people the area is the birthplace of the unions there s 72 000 democrats light blue he said but they ll vote republican just based off the message the message just has to be claimed

jerome powell s testimony to congress on wednesday has made it apparent that between them donald trump and us equity investors have bullied and coerced the federal reserve into creating a powell put jerome powell s testimony to congress was interpreted as a clear signal that the federal reserve is about to cut us interest rates despite an economy performing reasonably well credit ap the fed chairman s clear signal that the fed will cut its policy rate at the end of the month is reminiscent of the greenspan put of the 1990s where markets knew the fed would bail them out by lowering rates at the first hint of stress there is no evidence within the us economy that signals the need to cut interest rates with the economy growing at just over 3 per cent in the march quarter and unemployment at historic lows powell described the labour market as healthy and said consumer spending had bounced back and was running at a solid pace although business investment had slowed and inflation had declined
the chairman of the us federal reserve jerome powell faced a problem when he came to deliver his semi annual report to congress on wednesday and outline the central bank s monetary policy and its views on the state of the economy on the one hand he had to give a clear indication that the fed would meet the demands of the stock markets and their spokesman president trump for interest rate cuts possibly starting at its next policy meeting at the end of this month on the other he had to maintain the official fiction that the fed acts independently concealing the reality that it is the direct instrument of wall street and the financial oligarchy accordingly powell began his testimony by noting that congress has given the fed an important degree of independence so that it could pursue its goals based on objective analysis and data then both in his prepared testimony and in response to questions from members of the house of representatives financial services committee he proceeded to emphasise data that he said supported the demands of the financial markets a pattern that will continue today when he speaks to the corresponding body of the senate powell said the bottom line was the uncertainties about global growth and trade that continue to weigh on the outlook he also pointed to weaker readings on inflation suggesting that inflation rates below the fed target of two percent could be more persistent than previously anticipated this was a significant change from previous language in which the fed said continued low inflation was due to transitory factors powell said low inflation strengthened the case for a somewhat more accommodative policy he also pointed to the agreement between trump and chinese president xi jinping to resume trade talks as constructive but said it did not remove the uncertainty that we see as weighing on the outlook rounding out a presentation calculated to provide justification for wall street s insatiable demand for cheaper money to finance its parasitic activities powell pointed out that business investment has slowed notably and that overall growth of the us economy in the second quarter appears to have moderated in the lead up to powell s testimony the markets had been concerned that the june jobs report which showed that employment numbers had increased by 224 000 for the month had weakened the case for a rate cut he went out of his way to give assurance that it had not asked whether the report had changed the fed s outlook powell eschewed the usual obfuscations of fedspeak and replied that the straight answer was no powell s testimony was warmly welcomed by wall street during the course of the day s trading the s p 500 index went over the 3 000 level marking a 50 percent increase from the 2 000 level reached in 2014 before falling back marginally while other indexes finished close to the record highs they reached last week the official line of the fed is that a more accommodative monetary policy is necessary to provide a boost to the economy this is a lie from start to finish any cut in interest rates like the much touted tax cuts the trump administration claimed would boost the creation of well paying jobs will do nothing to lift investment and expand the real economy rather they will help finance the ever greater accumulation of wealth at the heights of society placing more money in the hands of the financial oligarchy and providing cheap funds for job destroying mergers and acquisitions and share buy backs that boost the value of wall street stock far from facilitating economic expansion the process of ever greater wealth creation at the top is accompanied by a major restructuring of key sections of industry particularly the auto industry involving the destruction of tens of thousands of jobs in order to boost profits at the same time vital services are being cut teachers and others demanding an increase in their wages and increased spending to meet the worsening conditions they confront are continually being told there is no money there is a profound objective connection between these two processes there is no money because all the economic and financial agencies of the capitalist state operate as institutionalised mechanisms for siphoning up the wealth produced by the labour of the working class this process of wealth extraction is being intensified to meet wall street s demands while the stock market appears to be a kind of financial heaven where money provided at ultra low interest rates seems to simply beget more money it does in the final analysis rest on the surplus value extracted from the working class thus the process of financial accumulation is necessarily accompanied by the development of new methods for increasing this exploitation and cutting social services which constitute a drain on the surplus value available for appropriation in the form of profit by finance capital these processes are not merely the outcome of the policies of the trump administration which can be corrected by reforms to the operation of the financial system and the underlying economy trump is simply the personification of a process going back decades this month marks the 75th anniversary of the bretton woods conference of 1944 which played a key role in laying the foundations of the post world war ii capitalist order the post war boom which it helped establish provided rising profits the expansion of the productive forces of society and rising living standards for the working class both in the us and other major capitalist economies it appeared that the contradictions that had torn apart the capitalist economy in the first half of the 20th century with devastating consequences for the mass of the world s population had been overcome and that it was possible for the working class to advance its interests within the framework of the profit system but this was an illusion which began to be exposed in a relatively short period in august of 1971 the us sought to unilaterally extricate itself from the mounting economic problems it confronted by abrogating the bretton woods monetary agreement with the removal of the gold backing from the us dollar which had been at its foundation america first did not begin with trump but was initiated almost 50 years ago since then the entire economic post war order has disintegrated at an accelerating rate and is now in tatters trade war of the kind that led in the 1930s to the outbreak of world war ii in 1939 has replaced international obligations and agreements the global financial system as was so graphically revealed in the meltdown of 2008 has been completely destabilised all the financial and economic instruments of the state above all the fed are dedicated to the sole goal of enriching the financial oligarchy no matter what the consequences but the deepening economic breakdown and the growth of social inequality to historically unprecedented levels are bringing an international resurgence of the class struggle while only in its initial stage this movement will advance in the coming period the crucial issue is that it be armed with a socialist perspective the so called reforms advocated by various left tendencies such as those operating in the democratic party and the corbyn led labour party in britain are not only completely inadequate they are aimed at trapping the working class within the present order the key question for the rising movement of the working class is the formulation and development of a program and perspective aimed at the conquest of political power as the necessary first step in ending the depredations of the capitalist profit system

washington federal reserve chairman jerome powell on wednesday set the stage for the first us interest rate cut in a decade later this month pledging to act as appropriate to defend an economic expansion threatened by trade disputes and a global slowdown in testimony to a congressional committee powell pointed to broad global weakness that was clouding the us economic outlook amid uncertainty about the fallout from the trump administration s trade conflict with china and other nations though the us government reported strong job growth for june other major economies data have continued to disappoint that is very broad across europe and around asia and that continues to weigh the head of the us central bank said manufacturing trade and investment are weak all around the world we have agreed to begin trade discussions again with china and that is a constructive step it doesn t remove the uncertainty to the suggestion that the current low us unemployment rate could lead to a breakout of inflation powell noted that the overall pace of price increases remains muted and wage gains remain modest signs the fed could reduce rates without risk of an overheating economy we don t have any evidence for calling this a hot labour market powell told the us house of representatives financial services committee to call something hot we need to see some heat the hearing part of the fed chief s semi annual testimony on monetary policy to congress took place against the backdrop of us president donald trump s frequent criticism of the fed and the white house s demands that the central bank lower rates powell chosen by trump to run the fed but now out of his good graces has worked hard to build relations among lawmakers and even on a democratic controlled committee won plaudits and encouragement to stay on the job asked by representative maxine waters who chairs the committee if he would pack up and leave if the president demanded it powell replied with a curt no ma am the law clearly gives me a four year term and i fully intend to serve it in prepared remarks released before the hearing powell contrasted the fed s baseline outlook of continued us growth against a considerable set of risks including persistently weak inflation a slowdown in other major economies and a downturn in business investment driven by trade risks fed officials at their june policy meeting signaled those concerns might warrant lower rates and since then based on incoming data and other developments it appears that uncertainties around trade tensions and concerns about the strength of the global economy continue to weigh on the us outlook powell said apparent progress on trade turned to greater uncertainty and our contacts in business and agriculture reported heightened concerns over trade developments powell said noting that business investment an important component of economic growth seems to have slowed notably in recent months reuters powell is setting it up certainly for a july rate cut said jack ablin chief investment officer at cresset capital management in chicago to me it all depends on where you look in the economy but over the last decade the federal reserve has been banging the inflation beehive with a baseball bat and the bees haven t come out so they figure keep trying this until something happens us stocks were trading higher with the benchmark s p 500index briefly crossing the 3 000 point mark for the first time the us dollar dxy fell against a basket of other currencies government bond yields dipped with two year treasuries us2yt rr falling below 1 87 per cent from around 1 93 per cent earlier on wednesday meanwhile us interest rate futures appeared to price in greater odds of a 50 basis point rate cut this month tariff threats the fed which hiked rates four times last year has kept its current benchmark overnight interest rate in a range of between 2 25 per cent and 2 50 per cent since december since a series of trump trade related tweets in late may both investors and the fed have begun shifting their stance with markets now expecting a cut of at least a quarter of a per centage point when the fed s rate setting committee releases its next policy statement on july 31 the us economy did not change much in the days that followed trump s may 30 comments on twitter threatening to impose tariffs on mexico unless the country met his demands for tougher controls on immigrants crossing its northern border but trump s statements spooked financial markets so decisively and the threats to the global economy became so palpable that a rate cut of at least 25 basis points now appears a near certainty with a 50 basis point cut also considered possible as extra protection the fed is due to release the minutes from its last policy meeting at 2 p m edt 1800 gmt on wednesday the minutes should show the extent to which the thinking at the central bank shifted in the days following trump s mexico tariff threat and how the discussion was shaped by other concerns including weak inflation earlier rounds of us tariffs on trading partners including china had been dismissed by the fed as of little macroeconomic importance with central bankers in early may still anticipating its policy rate would remain unchanged for the rest of the year by contrast the higher tariffs announced against china in early may a rising sense the world s two largest economies might not be able to make a deal and the tariff threat against mexico added to a growing feeling that protectionism and higher tariffs were here to stay at a cost to investment and growth no immediate need the case for lowering borrowing costs isn t fully decided reducing rates at this point would be similar to the fed s efforts in the mid 1990s to nurse along a lengthy recovery rather than respond to a looming downturn and there s no immediate need to move philadelphia fed president patrick harker said on tuesday but trump s tweets about mexico had a particularly unsettling impact touching off enough volatility and doubt about the future that it pushed the fed towards the very rate cuts trump has demanded for other reasons at the fed s last policy meeting in mid june eight of the 17 policymakers saw the need for at least one rate cut by year s end and powell told reporters afterwards many others were leaning in that direction the minutes may show how strong that sentiment has become in the fed s monetary policy report issued last week ahead of powell s testimony the trade war received its own analysis a sign of the attention it is getting within the central bank powell will testify again on thursday before the senate banking committee reuters
washington pointing to a weaker global economy rising trade tensions and chronically low inflation chairman jerome powell signaled wednesday that the federal reserve is likely to cut interest rates late this month for the first time in a decade delivering the central bank s semiannual report to congress powell said that since fed officials met last month uncertainties around trade tensions and concerns about the strength of the global economy continue to weigh on the u s economic outlook in addition inflation has dipped further below the fed s annual target level the chairman s remarks led investors to send stock prices up bond yields down and the value of the u s dollar lower on expectations of lower interest rates the s p 500 index briefly traded over 3 000 for the first time testifying to the house financial services committee powell was asked as he has been before what he would do if president donald trump tried to fire or demote him powell offered the same terse reply he s given in the past when asked about trump s attacks on his leadership and the president s insistence that he has authority to remove the chairman powell said he intends to serve out his full four year term which ends in early 2022 the president has repeatedly accused powell and the fed of keeping credit too tight for too long and of thereby holding back the economy and the stock market most experts dispute trump s assertion that he has authority to either fire powell or demote him from the chairman s post and his attacks have raised alarms that he s undermining the fed s long recognized independence from political pressure powell s description wednesday of a more downbeat economic landscape led most economists to conclude that a quarter point rate cut is a virtual certainty at the fed s meeting in three weeks with many forecasting further rate cuts to come some characterized a likely rate cut late this month as an insurance policy against an economic downturn advertisement i think it will be the start of a series of rate cuts added sung won sohn economics professor at loyola marymount university in los angeles powell wants to provide fuel for the economy down the road expectations of a pending rate cut drew additional support wednesday when the fed released the minutes of its june 18 19 meeting the central bank held rates unchanged then but the minutes showed that some officials felt looser credit could soon be needed to address economic weakness investors have collectively put the odds of a rate cut this month at 100 the fed s benchmark rate stands in a range of 2 25 to 2 5 after it raised rates four times last year action that incited the initial attacks on the powell fed from trump in the prepared remarks he delivered wednesday before taking questions from the house members powell made no mention of the president s criticism he did thank congress for the independence it has given the fed to operate free of political intrusion but later in the question and answer period several democratic committee members offered support for powell s leadership and a rejection of trump s criticism rep maxine waters who leads the committee declared that this president has made it clear that he has no understanding or respect for the independence of the federal reserve waters and other democrats urged powell to stand up to trump s attacks advertisement have no fear rep david scott d ga told the chairman we in congress both democrats and republicans have got your back powell s remarks wednesday began two days of his testimony on capitol hill on thursday he will address the senate banking committee at the moment the u s economic landscape is a mixed one the job market appears resilient but economic growth is slowing many forecasters predict that growth has slowed to an annual rate of around 2 in the just completed april june quarter in his testimony powell said the economy has fared reasonably well over the first half of the year but he noted that crosscurrents such as trade tensions and concerns about global growth have been weighing on economic activity and the outlook he said that growth in business investment seems to have slowed notably possibly because of concerns over slowing global growth and the trade battle between the trump administration and china the fed chairman told the house committee that he thinks average worker pay isn t rising fast enough to accelerate low inflation even with the unemployment rate near a five decade low an absence of inflation pressure makes it easier for the fed to cut short term rates referring to rates powell repeated a pledge the fed made in its june policy statement that officials would act as appropriate to sustain the expansion but notably he added that many fed official saw that the case for a looser monetary policy had strengthened the fed hasn t cut rates since 2008 at the height of the financial crisis trump and chinese president xi jinping declared a truce last month in what had threatened to become an escalating u s china trade war and agreed to resume talks toward a deal that would meet the administration s demands to better protect u s technology that step eased fears that trump would extend punitive tariffs to an additional 300 billion in chinese goods in the process inviting retaliation from beijing on american exports and likely weakening both nations economies and last week the government reported that after a tepid job gain in may u s employers sharply stepped up their hiring in june an indication of the economy s durability send
