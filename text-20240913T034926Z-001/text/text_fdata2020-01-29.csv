the value of a currency depends on a number of factors that affect the economy of a country such as balance of payment government debt foreign exchange reserves foreign investment trade deficit economic growth rate inflation macroeconomic policies etc the general belief is that a strong currency would make imports cheaper and exports uncompetitive while a weak currency could make imports expensive and exports more competitive the price of an export commodity such as tea is influenced by both internal and external factors that would include quality and uniqueness of the product world supply and demand value of currencies of importing countries tariff and non tariff barriers etc according to the principles of economics short supply of a product could move the prices up and excess of supply would lead to lowering the prices if all other factors remain constant since over 90 percent of the sri lanka tea production is meant for exports the price of tea at the colombo tea auction is also subject to influence of a number of external factors in addition to the domestic issues of tea quality standards etc when the value of the currency of an importing country depreciates it will have a negative impact on the purchasing power of the buyer consumer and hence the importer may not be able to pay the same price as before or could reduce the volume of purchase depending on the necessity of the product to the end consumer also when the supply is more than the demand the buyers have more options to choose and the possibility of moving from high cost suppliers to low cost suppliers is greater unless a producing country offers a unique product that cannot be matched by the others the tariff and non tariff barrier issues will also have an impact on the demand and price of an exportable commodity irrespective of the exchange rate movements the recent mrl issue that affected the sri lanka tea exports to japan germany and taiwan is a good example of non tariff barriers that negatively affected the demand and prices of ceylon tea in a highly competitive market the quality of the product also plays a vital role in maintaining the prices as better quality products can fetch good prices the international sanctions on iran civil war in libya and syria are some other issues that influence the tea prices the purpose of this article is to examine how the movement of the sri lanka rupee in the recent past has influenced the average tea auction prices and average fob prices of bulk tea it does not examine whether sri lanka has gained or lost any markets due to the exchange rate fluctuation theoretically the depreciation of the rupee should have positively impacted on the colombo tea auction prices at the same or similar ratio of the depreciation however in realty this theory has not worked in the same manner due to the influence of the above mentioned internal and external factors movement of rupee an analysis of the movement of sri lanka rupee from 2011 2019 periods reveals that the local currency has continuously depreciated against the us dollar during the last eight years from point to point the average value of the rupee depreciated from rs 110 56 in 2011 to rs 178 77 per dollar in 2019 registering a depreciation of rs 68 21 or by 55 73 percent to the dollar during this period the average tea auction prices went up from rs 359 89 in 2011 to rs 544 54 per kg in 2019 an increase of rs 184 65 per kg or 51 30 percent and average fob price of bulk tea excluding 10kg packages moved up from rs 495 86 in 2011 to rs 715 74 per kg in 2019 an increase of rs 219 88 per kg or by 44 34 percent these point to point analyses have revealed that tea auction prices have gone up by almost a similar margin of depreciation of the local currency while average fob prices of bulk tea exports have gone up by a lower margin against the level of the depreciation of the rupee however an in depth analysis of the movement of average tea auction prices and average fob prices of bulk tea against the movement of value of the local currency on an annual basis from 2012 to 2019 shows somewhat a different picture as the influence of both internal and external factors are captured in the annual prices table 1 in 2012 the average value of the rupee depreciated from rs 110 56 to rs 127 60 against the dollar a reduction of 15 41 percent but the average tea auction prices increased only by 8 82 percent while the average fob price of bulk tea moved up by about 11 60 percent in 2013 the rupee further depreciated by 1 18 percent but the average tea auction prices increased by 12 96 percent and the average fob price of bulk tea went up by 12 59 percent in a much higher proportionate than the depreciation of the local currency in 2015 the rupee depreciated by 4 11 percent over 2014 and contrary to the general belief that depreciation makes the price of tea more attractive to the buyers the average tea auction prices came down by 12 93 percent and average fob price of bulk tea also came down by 10 93 percent this scenario changed dramatically in 2016 when the rupee depreciated by 7 11 percent against the us dollar and largely due to the crop shortage the average tea prices at the colombo tea auction went up by 16 52 percent more than double the ratio of the depreciation of the rupee but the average fob price of bulk tea was unable to maintained the same momentum due to the external factors and the average fob price of bulk tea went up by 6 94 percent only it is observed that a large portion of increase in the auction price of tea was born by the exporter as they were unable to pass the price increase over to foreign buyers in 2017 the rupee depreciated by 4 70 percent over 2016 but the average tea auction price went up by 31 90 percent while the average fob price of bulk tea too went up by 33 43 percent the general acceptance that the depreciation would make local tea products more competitive was proved wrong in 2018 and 2019 when the average tea prices failed to gain despite the depreciation of the local currency in 2018 the rupee depreciated by 6 62 percent and further depreciation of 9 98 percent was registered in 2019 despite the depreciation of the local currency the average prices at the colombo tea auction came down by 5 86 percent and 6 42 percent respectively in 2018 and 2019 due to the sluggish demand from foreign buyers with over supply of tea in the world market however the average fob prices of bulk tea exports in the two years came down by 0 16 percent and 2 78 percent only it appears that there is no strong co relation between the depreciation of the local currency and price of tea as the price is always influenced by a number of internal and external factors further it is also evident that the average fob prices of bulk tea behave differently to the movement of tea auction prices due to addition of export taxes blending cost export packing and different trading terms used by the exporters exchange rates of major tea buyers a review of movement of exchange rates of top 12 buyers of ceylon tea during the last six years has revealed that except the value of euro and uae dirham all the other currencies have depreciated against the us dollar table 2 over 50 percent of average depreciation of the currency is recorded from iran turkey russia syria and azerbaijan while china and chile have registered depreciations of their currencies by more than 10 percent during the 2014 2019 period since iran tea buyers use the open market rate of the dollar for tea imports the fluctuation of the iran rial is more than the depreciation of the official rate by 62 3 percent although the uae currency remains unchanged it did not help the colombo tea auction prices as its imports from sri lanka reduced during the last five years as a result of the lower demand from her major re export markets such as iran iraq and cis etc since the export of ceylon tea to the eu markets accounts for less than 10 percent of the total tea export volume of sri lanka the stable euro also failed to make a significant impact on the tea prices it is observed that the buying power of major importing countries of ceylon tea has significantly reduced in the last six year period that may have negated the benefit of depreciation of the local currency to the local tea trade world production and exports the world supply of black tea has gone up from 3 543 268 mt to 3 932 338 mt over 2014 2018 periods this reflects a growth of 389 070 mt or 10 98 percent during the last five year period however sri lanka has experienced a setback with her black tea production coming down from 334 837 mt to 301 405 mt during the same period registering a decline of 9 9 percent the international tea committee statistics reveal that the world tea exports reached 1 469 million mt in 2018 against the volume of 1 484 million mt in 2014 registering a marginal decline of 1 01 percent in the last five years while sri lanka black tea exports declined by almost 15 2 percent during the same period in terms of volume sri lanka has lost 47 million kg of tea of its exports during the same period since the global black tea production has gone up by a significant volume and exports have come down by only one percent in the last five years the foreign buyers who were patronising sri lanka could have moved to other destinations for procurement of their black tea requirements which could have also negatively impacted on the tea prices at the colombo tea auction despite the depreciation of the local currency table 3 the recent world bank commodity outlook report has stated that the global tea prices declined by one percent in the third quarter of 2019 against the previous quarters and remained 6 percent below the same period of 2018 the tea prices at auction centres in india and kenya also came down in 2019 due to the excess supply situation in the world market especially the ctc tea varieties as per the available data the average tea prices at mombasa auction in kenya came down from us 2 81 per kg in 2017 to us 2 43 per kg in 2018 and us 2 22 per kg in 2019 the average indian tea prices remained almost same at indian rupees 140 26 per kg in 2018 and indian rupees 141 17 per kg in 2019 thanks to the large domestic consumer base the eu and us sanctions imposed on russia since 2014 tightening of usa financial sanctions on iran in may 2018 civil war in libya syria iraq etc mrl issue with japan eu and taiwan and the failure to maintain the tea quality standards could have also affected the tea prices at the colombo tea auction in the recent past when there is huge competition in the world tea market the depreciation of the local currency alone cannot push the tea prices up conclusion although the averages may not show the complete picture of tea price variances in relation to exchange rate fluctuations it is evident that there is no single factor responsible for the movement of the prices of agricultural commodities including tea but rather a set of factors the general beliefs that the depreciation of the local currency will always leads to enhance the prices of tea or export commodities is subject to fulfilment of various internal and external factors since the external factors are beyond the control of the sri lanka tea trade members what is necessary is to address the domestic issues affecting the tea prices a consorted effort by all stakeholders is necessary to overcome the domestic issues to attract more foreign buyers towards ceylon tea sri lanka s position as the leading supplier of orthodox tea to the world market is challenged by other countries due to the decline in tea production volume and the standard of tea unless these issues are addressed immediately the country may not be able to command higher prices for its tea finding new markets and development of more strong sri lanka tea brands could be the long term solution to enhance the tea prices at the colombo tea auction

forex window omo bills auction policy keep naira stable the monetary policy committee mpc members agreed last week that the relative stability in the foreign exchange forex market provides confidence to foreign investors the stability was triggered by over 60 billion turnover achieved in the investors and exporters i e forex window since april 2017 and central bank of nigeria s cbn s policy to restrict investments in open market operation omo bills auction writes collins nweze not many investors local and international gave it any chance to succeed when it was unveiled but since april 2017 when the investors and exporters i e forex window was launched by the central bank of nigeria cbn it has attracted over 60 billion to the economy and contributed in stabilising the naira the economy has also benefited from the cbn policy restricting individuals and non bank institutions from investing in open market operation omo bills the policy has made domestic investors to shift from money market to equities market omo is basically designed to be a short term market instrument that the cbn uses to control the supply of money to the economy whenever the cbn believes the inflation rate is high due to increased money supply it sells omo bills at high interest rates mopping up excess liquidity from the economy on the flip side if it believes there is a liquidity squeeze due to high interest rates it buys back omo bills flooding the financial market with cash these are short term bills that should not be more than 90 days except that these days omo bills are sold with maturity as long as 365 days competing with treasury bills the monetary policy committee mpc members also noted that lower money market interest rates reflected the liquidity overhang in the banking system resulting from the restriction of individuals and non bank corporate in the domestic economy from participating in omo bill auctions consequently the monthly weighted average inter bank call and open buy back obb rates fell to 3 82 and 3 24 per cent last december from 11 42 and 10 73 per cent the previous month the committee noted the improved performance in the equities market as the all share index asi and market capitalisation grew by 11 61per cent and 18 27 per cent between last october and january 10 this year this was indicative of the shift by domestic investors from the money market to the equities market in response to cbn s policy to restrict their investments in omo bills auction the mpc also noted the improved performance and sustained resilience of the banking system evidenced by the continued moderation of the non performing loans npls ratio from 6 6 per cent last october to 6 1 per cent last december the committee noted that the improvement reflected the cbn s continued deployment of heterodox policies to ensure that npls fell below the prudential benchmark of five per cent i e forex window the i e forex window has also remained one of the key instruments expected to help stabilise the local currency against other currencies in this year the naira has remained relatively stable at the official and parallel markets the local currency exchanges at n362 to a dollar at the parallel market and n306 to dollar at the official market the i e forex window seen as a willing buyer willing seller window allows foreign investors to bring in dollars at any price of their choice provided they could find buyers the figure at the window has also impacted positively on the purchasing managers index pmi cbn governor godwin emefiele said the i e forex window is one of the policies that sustained the stability of the naira and will continue to raise foreign capital inflows into the economy at the 54th annual bankers dinner in lagos at the weekend emefiele said as part of the bank s priorities for next year the regulator was determined to maintain its stable exchange policy stance in the near to medium term given the relatively high level of reserves emefiele who spoke on the theme delivering a strong sustainable growth for the nigerian economy added that the dollar inflows through the window has supported naira s stability he said with a moderated inflation rate positive gross domestic product gdp growth and improvements in our external reserve position the naira dollar exchange rate at the i e forex window has remained stable for the past 29 months at n360 1 and we have witnessed significant convergence in the exchange rate across the various market windows local currency has also remained at n306 to dollar at the official market a report by fsdh research said that prior to the i e forex window introduction the market and exchange rates were in turmoil however in a dramatic turn of events the acute shortage of forex which businesses and individuals grappled with witnessed an unprecedented improvement with banks and bureaux de change bdcs desperately looking for forex buyers the fsdh research monthly economic and financial market outlook said the positive domestic and external environment would further lead to external reserves accretion in the short term a development the report predicted will further stabilise the foreign exchange rate defending the naira the cbn injected over 10 97 billion into the forex market between last january and october to defend the naira against other major currencies

as tuition fees medical bills and basic travel allowance are also allocated funds from the intervention before i e forex window before the introduction of the forex window the local equities market and the forex market were in a shambles the all share index alsi was shrinking and the naira weakened against other currencies especially the dollar the i e window has become the attraction making many of the business concerns to take another look at their exit from the country the introduction of the window was followed by continuous interventions by the cbn which enabled banks and bdc operators to meet forex demand at the retail end of the market thus the window has become a life saving pill for the domestic economy as it has attracted about 60 billion into the market enhanced transparency and made forex available to the end users read also cbn cautions against rising debt the operations of companies especially manufacturing has been on the upward swing with an improvement in inflation figures as well as equities market performance before the stability in the forex market and naira the economy witnessed a depressed gross domestic product gdp growth which culminated in a recession in 2016 there was also rising inflation which peaked at almost 19 per cent in january 2017 and a persistently rising unemployment rate to 14 23 per cent in 2016 fourth quarter from 6 41 per cent as at 2014 fourth quarter there was also a significant depreciation of the exchange rate reaching n525 to 1 in february 2017 and witnessed a fast depletion of the reserves which was drained down

foreign investors appetite for nigerian assets leading to impressive appreciation in the equities market and stabilising the naira before the introduction of the window foreign investors appetite for local assets waned significantly on the back of currency crisis which in turn fundamentally weakened macroeconomic performance dragged corporate earnings and also impacted on equities market viability

is a market participant at the window to promote liquidity and professional market conduct he said the apex bank assured that the exchange rates of the transactions would be as agreed between authorised dealers and their counterparties besides he said the regulator reserved the right to intervene as a buyer or seller as it deems fit in the window even as information on transactions between

geneva jan 24 2020 ips the failure of large scale bailout operations historically low interest rates and rapid injection of liquidity to bring about a strong recovery from the 2008 2009 financial crisis and recession created a widespread concern that advanced economies suffered from a chronic demand gap and faced the spectre of stagnation the subsequent growth experience has reinforced these concerns since the crisis the us has sustained the longest economic expansion in history but it is also one of the slowest in terms of income investment and job creation lagging other post war recoveries despite exceptionally favourable monetary policy recovery has been slower and more erratic in europe recently advanced economies have slowed further and global growth in 2019 was the lowest since the financial crisis intensifying the fear of another recession sluggish investment and growth rising inequality low inflation and interest rates and rapid debt accumulation have become common features of major advanced economies and indeed much of the global economy at large these are all interrelated at the centre of this state of affairs lies inequality wage suppression and concentration of wealth it is the main reason for the chronic demand gap exceptionally low inflation and interest rates and rapid build up of debt in sharp contrast with a long standing belief that income shares stay relatively stable in the course of economic growth there has been a secular downward trend in wage shares in all major advanced economies with real wages falling or lagging behind productivity growth in most countries this started in the 1980s and continued unabated in the new millennium both before and after the 2008 2009 crisis in china too the wage share started to decline in the 1990s although this was reversed after 2010 as a result of efforts to establish a buoyant domestic consumer market the wage share in china remains significantly lower than that in major advanced economies wage suppression has been accompanied almost everywhere by growing concentration of wealth resulting also in greater inequality in the distribution of incomes from assets three factors have played an important role in growing inequality first liberal policies have led to the erosion of labour market institutions weakening labour while consolidating the power of large corporations second the increased size scope and influence of finance financialization has widened inequality and the demand gap as well as reducing growth potential by diverting resources to unproductive uses finally globalization has shifted the balance between labour and capital with the integration of china india and the countries that constituted the soviet union into the global economy the erosion of labour market institutions and financialization have gone further in the anglo american world and this explains why inequality is greater in the us and the uk than in other major economies the growing gap between labour productivity and wages means declines of the purchasing power of workers over the goods and services they produce this together with the increasing concentration of wealth and asset incomes results in underconsumption although sustained declines in wages would reduce the cost of production and increase the surplus in the hands of the capitalist class they would also limit the extent of the market since wages are the most important component of aggregate demand wage suppression thus creates the classical marxian problem of monetary realization of the surplus a reason why keynes also rejected declines in wages as a recipe for unemployment it adversely affects demand and profits expectations and hinders investment regardless of how low the cost of borrowing is exports can provide a way out until the 2008 2009 crisis china germany and japan all relied on foreign markets in different degrees to fill the demand gap using macroeconomic labour market and exchange rate policies gdp grew faster than domestic demand in all three economies thanks to a strong growth in exports after the crisis china s exports plummeted and the country first moved to a debt driven investment bubble and then sought to boost consumption to close the demand gap while moving to a significantly lower growth path germany replaced china as a major surplus country and japan also increased its reliance on exports to address the demand gap however this solution is not feasible for major underconsumption economies taken together it faces fallacy of composition and breeds trade conflicts the global south outside china is not big enough to provide an adequate market for the us europe japan and china they would need to run trade deficits in the order of several percentage points of their gdp for each percentage point trade surplus needed to avoid stagnation in the underconsumption economies they cannot rely on international capital flows to sustain such deficits the alternative is debt driven expansion sluggish wages reduce price pressures and allow and encourage central banks to create credit and asset bubbles to overcome stagnation without fear of inflation there is indeed a remarkable correlation between the declining wage share and declining interest rates in the us over the past three cycles the fed has been quite restrained in raising policy rates at times of expansion while cutting them drastically during contractions creating a downward bias in interest rates this policy stance creates destabilizing interfaces between debt and interest rates lower wages and subdued inflation lead to lower interest rates which together with financial deregulation encourage debt accumulation and asset bubbles this in turn makes it difficult for central banks to raise policy interest rates without causing disruptions in financial markets thereby making low interest rates self reinforcing indeed the downward bias in interest rates in g7 countries has been associated with a strong upward bias in debt since the mid 1980s suggesting that ultra easy monetary policies made possible by wage suppression and low inflation have led to a debt trap financial boom bust cycles generated by attempts to reignite growth by monetary easing and financial deregulation exacerbate the stagnation problem by creating waste and distortions on the supply side and reducing potential growth during booms the financial sector crowds out real economic activity and cheap credit entails massive capital misallocation diverting resources to low productivity sectors such as construction and real estate misallocations created by the booms are exposed during the ensuing crises when the economy would have to make a shift back to viable sectors and companies but this is often impeded by credit crunch and deflation second boom bust cycles also aggravate the demand gap by increasing inequality in the us for instance the crisis impoverished the poor particularly those subject to foreclosures while policy interventions benefitted the rich in the recovery the top one per cent captured almost 60 per cent of total growth from 2008 onwards real hourly wages stayed behind hourly labour productivity and the share of wages fell both during the contraction and the subsequent recovery two thirds of households in 25 advanced economies were in income segments whose market incomes did not advance or were lower in 2014 than they had been in 2005 these imply that when credit and asset bubbles burst and the economy contracts even a bigger bubble may be needed for recovery and growth in the us the bursting of the savings and loans bubble of the 1980s was followed by a bigger technology dot com bubble in the 1990s which ended at the turn of the century followed by an even bigger subprime bubble and bust leading to more aggressive interest rate cuts and liquidity expansion the past ten years have been relatively calm and stable several instances of heightened market volatility including during the taper tantrum of may 2013 and on the eve of the first rise in us policy rates in december 2015 did not lead to a lasting turbulence however this period of tranquillity has encouraged excessive risk taking and a rapid build up of debt thereby sowing the seeds of future instability very much as during the so called great moderation preceding the great recession permanently low interest rates and massive injection of liquidity have led to a search for yield in high risk high return assets globally starting with the us major stock markets have reached record highs and global debt has shot up to exceed 255 trillion or 320 per cent of world gdp in 2019 emerging economies in particular have seen a rapid build up of private debt in reserve currencies and increased penetration of their markets by international capital and firms heightening their external vulnerabilities and entailing large transfer of resources to advanced economies through financial channels as recognized by the world bank despite exceptionally low interest rates this wave of debt accumulation could follow the historical pattern and eventually end in financial crises in the next global economic downturn an important part of the debt accumulated in the past ten years could become unpayable leading to debt deflation and asset price declines the central banks would no doubt try to respond in the same way as they did during the 2008 2009 crisis but the scope for cuts in interest rates are now limited because they are at very low levels and there is already plenty of cheap money in the system these may severely compromise their ability to stabilize the economy a countercyclical keynesian fiscal reflation may save the day but much more would be needed to address the structural demand gap and its underlying causes a permanently bigger government financed by progressive income and wealth taxes and money printing greater state ownership of productive assets and control over economic activity income redistribution through the budget a level playing field between labour and capital a shift to wage led growth and taming financial capital yilmaz akyüz

the north american free trade agreement nafta erased the border with mexico to a degree full transcript donald trump s jobs plan speech politico june 28 2016 remarks as prepared for delivery declaring america s economic independence it is great to be here i d like to thank alumisource and all the amazing workers here for hosting us today i am going to talk about how to make america wealthy again we are thirty miles from steel city pittsburgh played a central role in building our nation the legacy of pennsylvania steelworkers lives in the bridges railways and skyscrapers that make up our great american landscape but our workers loyalty was repaid with betrayal our politicians have aggressively pursued a policy of globalization moving our jobs our wealth and our factories to mexico and overseas globalization has made the financial elite who donate to politicians very wealthy but it has left millions of our workers with nothing but poverty and heartache when subsidized foreign steel is dumped into our markets threatening our factories the politicians do nothing for years they watched on the sidelines as our jobs vanished and our communities were plunged into depression level unemployment many of these areas have still never recovered our politicians took away from the people their means of making a living and supporting their families skilled craftsmen and tradespeople and factory workers have seen the jobs they loved shipped thousands of miles away many pennsylvania towns once thriving and humming are now in a state despair this wave of globalization has wiped out our middle class it doesn t have to be this way we can turn it all around and we can turn it around fast but if we re going to deliver real change we re going to have to reject the campaign of fear and intimidation being pushed by powerful corporations media elites and political dynasties the people who rigged the system for their benefit will do anything and say anything to keep things exactly as they are the people who rigged the system are supporting hillary clinton because they know as long as she is in charge nothing will ever change the inner cities will remain poor the factories will remain closed the borders will remain open the special interests will remain firmly in control hillary clinton and her friends in global finance want to scare america into thinking small and they want to scare the american people out of voting for a better future my campaign has the opposite message i want you to imagine how much better your life can be if we start believing in america again i want you to imagine how much better our future can be if we declare independence from the elites who ve led us to one financial and foreign policy disaster after another our friends in britain recently voted to take back control of their economy politics and borders i was on the right side of that issue with the people while hillary as always stood with the elites and both she and president obama predicted that one wrong now it s time for the american people to take back their future that s the choice we face we can either give in to hillary clinton s campaign of fear or we can choose to believe in america we lost our way when we stopped believing in our country america became the world s dominant economy by becoming the world s dominant producer the wealth this created was shared broadly creating the biggest middle class the world had ever known but then america changed its policy from promoting development in america to promoting development in other nations we allowed foreign countries to subsidize their goods devalue their currencies violate their agreements and cheat in every way imaginable trillions of our dollars and millions of our jobs flowed overseas as a result i have visited cities and towns across this country where a third or even half of manufacturing jobs have been wiped out in the last 20 years today we import nearly 800 billion more in goods than we export this is not some natural disaster it is politician made disaster it is the consequence of a leadership class that worships globalism over americanism this is a direct affront to our founding fathers who wanted america to be strong independent and free our founding fathers understood trade george washington said that the promotion of domestic manufactur will be among the first consequences to flow from an energetic government alexander hamilton spoke frequently of the expediency of encouraging manufactur in the united states the first republican president abraham lincoln warned that the abandonment of the protective policy by the american government must produce want and ruin among our people our original constitution did not even have an income tax instead it had tariffs emphasizing taxation of foreign not domestic production yet today 240 years after the revolution we have turned things completely upside down we tax and regulate and restrict our companies to death then we allow foreign countries that cheat to export their goods to us tax free as a result we have become more dependent on foreign countries than ever before ladies and gentlemen it s time to declare our economic independence once again that means reversing two of the worst legacies of the clinton years america has lost nearly one third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997 even as the country has increased its population by 50 million people at the center of this catastrophe are two trade deals pushed by bill and hillary clinton first the north american free trade agreement or nafta second china s entry into the world trade organization nafta was the worst trade deal in history and china s entrance into the world trade organization has enabled the greatest jobs theft in history it was bill clinton who signed nafta in 1993 and hillary clinton who supported it it was also bill clinton who lobbied for china s disastrous entry into the world trade organization and hillary clinton who backed that terrible agreement then as secretary of state hillary clinton stood by idly while china cheated on its currency added another trillion dollars to our trade deficits and stole hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property the city of pittsburgh and the state of pennsylvania have lost one third of their manufacturing jobs since the clintons put china into the wto fifty thousand factories across america have shut their doors in that time almost half of our entire manufacturing trade deficit in goods with the world is the result of trade with china it was also hillary clinton as secretary of state who shoved us into a job killing deal with south korea in 2012 as reported by the economic policy institute in may this deal doubled our trade deficit with south korea and destroyed nearly 100 000 american jobs as bernie sanders said hillary clinton voted for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions of jobs trade reform and the negotiation of great trade deals is the quickest way to bring our jobs back to understand why trade reform creates jobs we need to understand how all nations grow and prosper massive trade deficits subtract directly from our gross domestic product from 1947 to 2001 a span of over five decades our inflation adjusted gross domestic product grew at a rate of 3 5 however since 2002 the year after we fully opened our markets to chinese imports that gdp growth rate has been cut almost in half what does this mean for americans for every one percent of gdp growth we fail to generate in any given year we also fail to create over one million jobs america s job creation deficit due to slower growth since 2002 is well over 20 million jobs and that s just about the number of jobs our country needs right now to put america back to work at decent wages the transpacific partnership is the greatest danger yet the tpp would be the death blow for american manufacturing it would give up all of our economic leverage to an international commission that would put the interests of foreign countries above our own it would further open our markets to aggressive currency cheaters it would make it easier for our trading competitors to ship cheap subsidized goods into u s markets while allowing foreign countries to continue putting barriers in front of our exports the tpp would lower tariffs on foreign cars while leaving in place the foreign practices that keep american cars from being sold overseas the tpp even created a backdoor for china to supply car parts for automobiles made in mexico the agreement would also force american workers to compete directly against workers from vietnam one of the lowest wage countries on earth not only will the tpp undermine our economy but it will undermine our independence the tpp creates a new international commission that makes decisions the american people can t veto these commissions are great hillary clinton s wall street funders who can spend vast amounts of money to influence the outcomes it should be no surprise then that hillary clinton according to bloomberg took a leading part in drafting the trans pacific partnership she praised or pushed the tpp on 45 separate occasions and even called it the gold standard hillary clinton was totally for the tpp just a short while ago but when she saw my stance which is totally against she was shamed into saying she would be against it too but have no doubt she will immediately approve it if it is put before her guaranteed she will do this just as she has betrayed american workers for wall street throughout her career here s how it would go she would make a small token change declare the pact fixed and ram it through that s why hillary is now only saying she has problems with the tpp in its current form ensuring that she can rush to embrace it again at her earliest opportunity if the media doesn t believe me i have a challenge for you ask hillary clinton if she is willing to withdraw from the tpp her first day in office and unconditionally rule out its passage in any form there is no way to fix the tpp we need bilateral trade deals we do not need to enter into another massive international agreement that ties us up and binds us down a trump administration will change our failed trade policy quickly here are 7 steps i would pursue right away to bring back our jobs one i am going to withdraw the united states from the trans pacific partnership which has not yet been ratified two i m going to appoint the toughest and smartest trade negotiators to fight on behalf of american workers three i m going to direct the secretary of commerce to identify every violation of trade agreements a foreign country is currently using to harm our workers i will then direct all appropriate agencies to use every tool under american and international law to end these abuses four i m going tell our nafta partners that i intend to immediately renegotiate the terms of that agreement to get a better deal for our workers and i don t mean just a little bit better i mean a lot better if they do not agree to a renegotiation then i will submit notice under article 2205 of the nafta agreement that america intends to withdraw from the deal five i am going to instruct my treasury secretary to label china a currency manipulator any country that devalues their currency in order to take advantage of the united states will be met with sharply six i am going to instruct the u s trade representative to bring trade cases against china both in this country and at the wto china s unfair subsidy behavior is prohibited by the terms of its entrance to the wto and i intend to enforce those rules seven if china does not stop its illegal activities including its theft of american trade secrets i will use every lawful presidential power to remedy trade disputes including the application of tariffs consistent with section 201 and 301 of the trade act of 1974 and section 232 of the trade expansion act of 1962 president reagan deployed similar trade measures when motorcycle and semiconductor imports threatened u s industry his tariff on japanese motorcycles was 45 and his tariff to shield america s semiconductor industry was 100 hillary clinton and her campaign of fear will try to spread the lie that these actions will start a trade war she has it completely backwards hillary clinton unleashed a trade war against the american worker when she supported one terrible trade deal after another from nafta to china to south korea a trump administration will end that war by getting a fair deal for the american people the era of economic surrender will finally be over a new era of prosperity will finally begin america will be independent once more under a trump presidency the american worker will finally have a president who will protect them and fight for them we will stand up to trade cheating anywhere and everywhere it threatens an american job we will make america the best place in the world to start a business hire workers and open a factory this includes massive tax reform to lift the crushing burdens on american workers and businesses we will also get rid of wasteful rules and regulations which are destroying our job creation capacity many people think that these regulations are an even greater impediment than the fact that we are one of the highest taxed nations in the world we are also going to fully capture america s tremendous energy capacity this will create vast profits for our workers and begin reducing our deficit hillary clinton wants to shut down energy production and shut down the mines a trump administration will also ensure that we start using american steel for american infrastructure just like the american steel from pennsylvania that built the empire state building it will be american steel that will fortify american s crumbling bridges it will be american steel that sends our skyscrapers soaring into the sky it will be american steel that rebuilds our inner cities it will be american hands that remake this country and it will be american energy mined from american resources that powers this country it will be american workers who are hired to do the job we are going to put american produced steel back into the backbone of our country this alone will create massive numbers of jobs on trade on immigration on foreign policy we are going to put america first again we are going to make america wealthy again we are going to reject hillary clinton s politics of fear futility and incompetence we are going to embrace the possibilities of change it is time to believe in the future it is time to believe in each other it is time to believe in america this is how we are going to make america great again for all americans we are going to make america great again for everyone greater than ever before thank you candidate donald trump delivered a well crafted speech on tuesday which attacked the globalist economy as harmful to american workers and destructive to the middle class he criticized powerful interests like red china for its currency manipulation and our own government for its policies that have become such a menace to the general good globalization encompasses immigration outsourcing and so called free trade all of which have been job killers for working people but the globalist economy works very well for powerful elites in business and politics so the system has continued long past the time when it was shown to be a failed faith see also

dear shareholders for the three months ended december 31st 2019 the third avenue value fund trades portfolio the fund returned 13 60 compared to the msci world index which returned 8 19 1 strong fourth quarter performance in both absolute and relative terms brought full year 2019 performance to 12 85 a figure we would describe as satisfactory in absolute terms on a relative basis however fund performance trailed exceptionally strong msci world index performance which totaled 28 44 for 2019 for global indices this past year was again dominated by the outsized performance of u s large cap growth oriented equities from the fund s perspective trade war escalation accompanied by a flattening and at one point inverted u s yield curve defined the middle four months of the year and was associated with a particularly challenging period of fund performance fund performance recovered quickly and ended the year strongly style and performance roughly one year ago our team published an analysis of the historical performance of the third avenue value fund trades portfolio we found that not surprisingly the fund s strategy has been extremely effective in periods in which value investing strategies have produced attractive relative performance and conversely far less effective in periods in which growth strategies have outperformed as an aside we conducted the same analysis for the third avenue international value fund previously managed by one of the fund s portfolio managers and came away with very similar findings these are not ground breaking revelations and we are clearly aware that devotion to our deep value strategy sets the fund up for periods of underperformance which at times can be wildly frustrating the last several years has been one such period however most well respected data series of which we are aware clearly show that value strategies as defined by statistical cheapness have substantially outperformed growth strategies over long periods of time buying cheap businesses has worked over time but far from all of the time one encouraging aspect of the 2019 year was that in the discreet periods in which value strategies performed well most notably the final four months of the year the fund performed exceptionally well which provides one more corroborating data point in advancement of our earlier work on the historical performance pattern of the strategy we have conducted a more detailed review of the last 20 years by analyzing fund performance in periods in which value strategies both outperformed and underperformed our study examined rolling 12 month periods over the trailing 20 years which provides 229 data points and a number of interesting observations first even though the msci world growth index has produced a cumulative total return roughly 67 percentage points above that of the msci world value index over the last 10 years 197 vs 130 the msci world value index has produced a cumulative total return roughly 56 percentage points higher than msci world growth index 194 vs 138 over the last 20 years2 second while historically superior in aggregate value strategy outperformance is nothing if not inconsistent marty whitman our firm founder often derided the claim that consistent outperformance is the mark of investing skill as one of academic finance s most counterproductive paradigms using our rolling twelve month periods over the last 20 years we found that msci world value index outperformed msci world growth index in only 48 of the periods meaning a minority of the time yet while the value strategy underperformed slightly more often than not it outperformed meaningfully in aggregate third our analysis shows that over the last 20 years in the rolling 12 month periods in which value outperformed growth the fund outperformed the msci world index 71 of the time which we consider to be quite a high hit rate said another way when value has outperformed on a rolling twelve month basis the fund has outperformed a strong majority of the time long only value strategies will not and dare we say cannot consistently outperform relevant broad global indices yet have been quite an effective way to outperform over long periods of time fourth the most recent 3 year period from 2017 2019 includes 25 rolling 12 month periods not a single one of which showed value outperformance relative to growth not surprisingly this has been a frustrating stretch of performance for the fund and most value investors over the most recent 5 year period containing 49 rolling 12 month periods msci world value index only outperformed msci world index in 12 periods primarily generated by strong value performance in calendar year 2016 in those 12 periods the fund outperformed the msci world growth index 10 out of 12 times for a hit rate of 83 which is even higher than the fund s 20 year hit rate in other words we can debate whether value as a strategy is permanently broken reprising a debate that raged during the tech bubble of the late 1990 s but there is not much debate about whether the fund can thrive in periods when value is successful fifth inclusive of the recent stretch of relative underperformance the third avenue value fund trades portfolio has meaningfully outperformed the msci world index as well as its value and growth subsets over the last 20 years the cumulative total return figures are 208 7 for the fund 169 9 for msci world index 194 3 for msci world value index and 138 3 for msci world growth index the fund s absolute and relative record are both substantially more impressive if measured since inception finally it is our more qualitative view that value investing s long walk through the desert has caused a significant amount of attrition among its practitioners as a result of fund closures firm closures mergers and acute institutional pressures leading to style drift several who are fortunate enough to be in such a comfortable position simply returned client capital and now pursue their strategies in solitude one silver lining is that our team feels encouraged by a less crowded contrarian value investing space as capital and talent pools have shrunk as we all know fund management teams can t provide assurances about future returns even when we view the historical data to be so compelling however we can provide assurances that while we constantly strive to improve upon our execution we will not diverge from our orthodox deep value approach to the extent that one believes that the effectiveness of value investing has been dormant rather than deceased we will continue to be here delivering on the third avenue strategy many of life s failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up thomas edison facts matter eventually separate from recent performance and style considerations we find many fundamental reasons to be encouraged a key component of third avenue s contrarian strategy is to invest in companies going through cyclical depressions that are priced as though the depression is secular similarly we are excited by opportunities to invest in companies that are priced as though they are imminently entering into a depression while we perceive that outlook to be too draconian while in the shortterm stock prices may or may not respond to fundamental developments we tend to measure progress against our long term investment theses by whether fundamental data emerging from companies and industries is in keeping with our expectations calendar year 2019 produced many encouraging sets of fundamental data luxury auto industry when we first discussed the fund s investment in bmw ag xter bmw bmw in our march 2018 letter our view was that the company s stock was fully if not more than fully priced for an expected cyclical downturn in sales of bmw s we argued that bmw was valued at levels reflecting an enormous amount of pessimism and that the luxury auto industry is generally less competitive than mass market tends to produce higher operating profit margins and is historically less cyclical than mass market a trait that is counter intuitive to many people but real nonetheless over the last couple of years talk of slowing car sales in the u s and collapsing car sales in china have dominated headlines china s car market fell off a cliff this year it faces a long road back cnn 7 10 2019 it is possible that never before has the difference between the luxury auto industry and the mass market auto industry been both so important and so obvious below are historical charts of bmw s sales volumes in china and the united states the world s largest auto markets there are several evolutions taking place throughout the global auto industry today and one that is not well discussed is that the strong have been getting stronger and the weak getting weaker meanwhile because of its sales and operating success bmw maintains a high level of profitability as well as what may be the industry s best balance sheet putting it in a terrific position to not only navigate a potential acceleration in global electric vehicle sales but also to be even more dominant on the other side of the transition profit and a great balance sheet have also allowed bmw to pay eur 7 50 per share of dividends in the roughly two years since we initiated our investment which is a substantial number in light of the eur 71 share price today the share price is just about the only thing that looks like a cyclical depression offshore drilling several of the fund s offshore oil services investments appreciated materially during calendar 2019 particularly in the latter portion of the year on the other hand our offshore drilling investments were among the fund s poorest performers we are aware that there may be readers who view this to be a logical outcome given the pervasive disdain for the oil and gas industry and rampant talk that we are witnessing the beginning of the end one s hopes for radical changes to how the world powers itself aside the facts are that global oil consumption continues to rise u s onshore production growth has predictably begun to slow and the reserve replacement ratio for the world s offshore oil and gas resources is too low to keep production at the current level indefinitely international oil companies who today are producing near record cash flows have always understood this to be the case in early 2019 they began to act upon this fact pattern by increasing investment in offshore resources albeit from incredibly low levels for example for the global jackup drilling rig market the number of utilized rigs fell from roughly 450 in 2014 to a low of roughly 300 in 2017 rendering the industry in a position of rampant excess capacity dayrates prices for premium jackups fell from a 2014 peak of somewhere around usd 175 000 per day to a 2018 low of roughly usd 50 000 per day it was during this carnage that borr drilling borr was newly formed and successfully accumulated one of the world s largest fleets of premium jackups from a variety of distressed sellers with the number of contracted jackup rigs rising by approximately 25 over 2018 and 2019 and a substantial portion of rigs having been scrapped in the downturn the global fleet of modern jackups is once again approaching 90 utilization rate the amount of work contracted in 2019 as measured by jackup rig years awarded rose from less than 200 in 2018 to roughly 280 in 2019 this past year marked the first time since 2013 that the jackup industry enjoyed a book to bill ratio larger than 1 0x and outstanding tenders for future work are substantially higher than 12 months ago dayrates have risen from usd 50k per day to levels now approaching usd 70 000 to 90 000 per day we estimate that a more normalized dayrate for premium jackups is somewhere near usd 150 000 per day the cyclical industry recovery that we have anticipated has clearly begun and we expect that it will continue to improve european banks the fund owns two disparate european banks each with distinct investment merits that fortunately are not particularly related to rising interest rates although that would help by far the less complex of the two holdings is bank of ireland plc lse birg boi during 2019 boi continued to dispose of portfolios of non performing assets crossing a self imposed goal of less than 5 of total assets cleaning up the last vestiges of the global financial crisis boi is also in the midst of substantial investment in one of the industry s most comprehensive technological upgrades and has still managed to build meaningful capital during the year over and above the spending once the investment period is over boi s cost structure is intended to be fundamentally lowered and its reinvestment needs substantially reduced finally boi sold its uk credit card business during the year further simplifying the bank into its core competencies and areas where reasonable returns can be earned we are to date quite pleased with actions taken by boi management and remain of the view that the bank is deeply undervalued deutsche bank ag db financial db on the other hand has far more complicated obstacles to overcome and has been the posterchild for europe s banking maladies that said 2019 was a far less bad year for db than several previous years in fact the revolving door of ceos seems to have stopped revolving as a result of the alacrity with which current management has moved on a variety of critical initiatives most notably cost reduction targets are on track to date and revenue attrition resulting from the restructuring efforts appears less significant than many had feared operating performance of various divisions its traditional german banking business for example appear satisfactory and its corporate banking business has performed fairly well management has also successfully exited its european prime brokerage business among its most capital intensive units providing an important step in its effort to reduce headline leverage ratios getting surprisingly little attention however is that during the year db management formed a capital release unit to house assets of discontinued businesses it intends to liquidate over time management committed to reduce leverage exposure within the cru by 95 by 2021 and estimated that its liquidation would facilitate a return of capital to shareholders of roughly eur 5 billion beginning in 2022 for perspective the entire market cap of db is approximately eur 15 8 billion today as of the end of september the cru had approximately eur 9 8 billion of equity embedded within so the liquidation is intended to both enable the return of capital and bolster db s retained capital position according to a december disclosure the cru liquidation plan is running ahead of schedule finally it is also certainly worth noting that db still owns a 79 5 stake in publicly traded dws group ag whose shares provided a total return of 42 in 2019 bringing its market cap to eur 6 5 billion making db s stake worth eur 5 2 billion today or roughly one third of db s market value while db indisputably has much more work left to do we admire the progress made during 2019 and can see many paths for substantial value to emerge quarterly activity during the quarter ended december 31st the fund initiated positions in the equity of mall owner the macerich company and chilean holding company quiñenco s a the fund exited three long held positions in brookfield asset management inc bam financial investor ab osto invea financial and wheelock co ltd hkse 00020 financial additionally the fund added another layer of spdr s p 500 trust put options3 during the quarter the macerich company mac financial macerich during the quarter the fund initiated a position in the equity of macerich a real estate investment trust which owns and develops high end market dominant malls in densely populated u s geographies including a number of gateway markets investing in malls may be among the world s most contrarian investments today and that prevalent view has certainly been reflected in the share price of macerich during the last three years while the industry is undoubtedly going through a significant transition which is rendering a number of lower quality undifferentiated and poorly located malls obsolete all malls are not created equal strong operators in desirable locations have not only performed fairly well but also have the opportunity to repurpose various spaces and to some extent reinvent the modus operandi of the historical shopping mall towards a more service based and experiential destination location and demographics are also critical and mall properties located in thriving densely populated geographies often have mixed use redevelopment opportunity namely office and residential space while a spate of recent retail bankruptcies and an existing debt load that is larger than we would prefer make these transitions somewhat more complicated for macerich operating performance of the underlying assets has been strong and we are confident that we are materially underpaying for the equity relative to net asset value we expect that the company will pull a combination of the levers it has available to it whether it be dividend reduction partial asset disposal into a joint venture structure or further debt refinancing at very attractive rates in order to navigate through this evolutionary period in the event that macerich delivers on various initiatives we expect the equity to be priced at a far smaller discount to underlying net asset value yet another possibility is that an industry or financial buyer with the available financial resources to enhance the value of the macerich portfolio might find the company to be a very attractive acquisition quiñenco s a xsgo quinenco quiñenco the fund initiated a position in chilean holding company quiñenco s a during the quarter october in chile was marked by violent protests in response to a government attempt to increase subway fares which were seen to be unduly burdensome on lower income chileans protests quickly evolved into a broader call to arms to create a more egalitarian chile protests have since subsided and the specifics of future government action have not yet been identified meanwhile early data on the impact of protests on the chilean economy appears to be quite benign that said chilean equities and the chilean peso had a substantial reaction to the protests quiñenco has controlling stakes in banco de chile s a chile s 4th largest bank and compania cervecerias unidas s a ccu chile s largest brewery and soft drink company but also large stakes in businesses in cable manufacturing container shipping ports and fuel distribution some of which have very little activity in chile from the middle of september to the middle of november the share price of quiñenco fell roughly 18 in chilean pesos and more than 25 as measured in us dollars we have been familiar with quiñenco its management and its controlling family for well more than a decade and various third avenue funds have been shareholders of multiple associated companies though have never before owned shares of quiñenco we view the underlying companies as well managed and conservatively financed often with dominant market positions indeed various quiñenco controlled companies are respected business partners for global companies such as heineken citigroup and shell seeking to operate in chile it is our view that we were able to purchase shares at a time when both the underlying businesses were atypically inexpensive and the size of discount offered through shares of quiñenco was unusually large spdr s p 500 etf trust put options spy financial spy puts during the quarter the fund purchased additional put options related to the s p 500 which should help mitigate against any significant u s equity market disruption given our view that current fund holdings are particularly attractive at this moment in time the use of put options as a method of risk mitigation is desirable in that it allows for full portfolio exposures to be maintained and can be implemented at a small cost thank you for your confidence and your loyalty we look

bird songs nestled in the andes mountains and perched on the secluded coast of a peninsula jutting into lake titicaca sahuiña is an enchantingly quiet place it s also an independent one thanks to many years of government decentralization across bolivia the village has a great deal of freedom to do as it wishes without answering to the state at its entrance a wiphala flag a seven colored square representing the indigenous peoples of the andes flapped in the breeze no national flag symbolizing the bolivian republic stood beside it as i crossed the hamlet the people of sahuiña chatted with one another in the local indigenous language of aymara they spoke slowly walked slowly chewed slowly on coca leaves they boasted about the crisp air and the scarcity of crime most of them fished or farmed for a living just as locals in the area have for millennia sahuiña s remoteness and self reliant atmosphere make it easy to assume that national politics is of secondary importance to its residents the village keeps to itself moves at its own pace and makes decisions about its own land but the people there are in fact enamored of the self described socialist who runs their country evo morales morales the villagers pointed out has invested in their community like no other national leader before him before he took office the route into sahuiña was rough and narrow now it s paved and wide making it easier to transport goods in and out of the area and allowing children to be driven to school in nearby copacabana before morales people would draw water from wells now they have running water in their homes more recently the government has financed the creation of a small hospitality center composed of a dining hall and a few cottages to encourage tourists to see sahuiña as an outdoor getaway undoubtedly sahuiña s most charming attraction is its collection of endangered ranas gigantes giant frogs that are kept in a makeshift conservatory on a floating island on lake titicaca and a small airport is currently being built with public funds in a valley near the village the people i met also praised the system of bonos or cash transfers that are given to parents of young students pregnant women and the elderly compared to previous governments our government takes us into account simón khantuta a gregarious community guide told me as we sat by the lake current issue view our current issue sahuiña is an emblem of how life has changed for millions of ordinary bolivians over the past 13 years since taking office in 2006 morales a former coca grower and labor activist has nationalized key industries and used aggressive social spending to reduce extreme poverty by more than half build a nation with modern infrastructure and lower bolivia s gini coefficient

biden s zionist bubble jeet heer it s now clear that a redistributionist agenda has not been ruinous to bolivia s economy far from it during the morales era the economy has grown at twice the rate of the latin american average inflation has been stable the government has amassed substantial savings and an enterprising and optimistic indigenous middle class has emerged given the nightmarish economic collapse of nearby venezuela the right s poster child for the evils of socialism the idea that such a system can be the path to affluence and stability in bolivia is remarkable its left wing political trajectory which began roughly around the same time as venezuela s shows that socialist projects can help societies escape poverty rather than condemn them to it bolivia might be the world s most successful country that calls itself socialist noah smith a center left economics columnist at bloomberg news wrote earlier this year related article the rise and fall of the latin american left omar g encarnación nevertheless morales s fate and his legacy are uncertain in a 2016 referendum he asked the public if he could scrap constitutional term limits in order to run for an extra term in 2019 he lost but after winning a highly controversial legal fight in a sympathetic court he s opted to run for reelection anyway this fall s elections which will take place on october 20 have raised questions of whether morales has become yet another leftist leader who will undermine democracy in the name of economic revolution morales s clutch on power has angered many bolivians including parts of his indigenous base who view his next run as an act of flagrant corruption but the president is hoping the strength of the economy will deliver him another victory and he s making pledges to continue fulfilling the vision that inspired his first run when morales arrived in office he pledged to fundamentally alter the nature of bolivia s economy his predecessors had been forced to resign by militant protest movements that demanded that profits from the nation s enormous natural gas reserves should go to the public not foreign multinational corporations as head of the federation of social movements known as the movimiento al socialismo or movement toward socialism morales was trusted as someone who could realize that vision he became the first president to win an outright majority of votes since the 1952 revolution during which peasants and miners toppled a military regime and instituted a host of populist reforms he was also notably bolivia s first indigenous president morales s left wing program was one of many that swept through latin america in the pink tide of the 2000s during which populist leaders in brazil venezuela argentina ecuador chile and elsewhere rose to power with socialist and social democratic agendas morales went in with a mandate to shatter the neoliberal policies of austerity and privatization that had shaped bolivian society for the past two decades from 1985 until election in 2005 bolivia was under the yoke of one version or another of the washington consensus mark goodale an anthropologist at the university of lausanne told me once in office morales passed a law seizing tens of thousands of square miles of land deemed unproductive or illegally held and redistributed it to landless peasants he placed the natural gas oil telecommunications and electricity industries under state control and he continually raised the minimum wage which has tripled since he entered office morales also dramatically increased social spending he poured money into building roads schools and hospitals an expansion of infrastructure that was particularly transformative in the countryside and he established modest but deeply popular cash transfer programs a universal noncontributory pension system for bolivians over the age of 60 assistance to households with elementary school aged children who can demonstrate their children are attending school and funds for pregnant women or mothers with children under the age of 2 without health insurance they re small amounts of money but for very poor people they ve made an enormous impact on their family income linda farthing the la paz based author of evo s bolivia continuity and change told me during the morales era bolivia has seen per capita income increase threefold and has rapidly transitioned from a low income country to a lower middle income country in the eyes of the world bank inflation and the exchange rate have remained exceptionally stable and all the while bolivia levels of inequality went from well above the latin american average to well below it related article a new climate movement in bolivia naomi klein rural communities like sahuiña have seen their quality of life improve over the past decade but the sense that things are on the upswing is just as visible in urban areas in the bustling capital of la paz shops restaurants and movie theaters are springing up across the city for people eager to make use of their bigger wallets indigenous women dressed in traditional pollera skirts and bowler hats can be found selling food on street corners but many can also be seen purchasing expensive hats at trendy boutiques take a ride on the mi teleferico the world s largest high altitude urban cable car system to the neighboring city of el alto and you ll see miles and miles of lively markets and small businesses el alto also features a growing number of chalets or spectacular brightly colored buildings designed by aymara architects that represent the rise of an urban aymara bourgeoisie bolivia s movement toward socialism has defied right wing predictions of food shortages labor camps and the collapse of private life instead it has stepped in the direction of european social democracy and illustrated how a developing economy can modernize and grow swiftly without subjecting itself to austerity what really sets bolivia s socialist experiment apart is its relative longevity the pink tide has largely ebbed virtually all of the leftist parties that dominated the era have been kicked out of power in no small part because of the collapse of a regional commodities boom venezuela is a holdout thanks to bald authoritarian maneuvering the regime is presiding over one of the greatest economic catastrophes the western hemisphere has seen in recent history bolivia though has endured because of three distinguishing qualities the first of these is what could be called a cautiously optimistic reformism morales aligned himself rhetorically with the late venezuelan firebrand hugo chávez in the 2000s but in practice morales pursued a more careful policy agenda than chávez did and gave more thought to the future venezuela s economy has relied entirely on one resource oil and chávez managed it extremely poorly he overspent on social programs quintupling public debt and setting aside no money for a rainy day leaving the country acutely vulnerable to the crash in the price of oil in 2014 and his strict foreign exchange controls helped ignite a crippling inflation crisis morales by contrast has been more focused on the long term bolivia s main money makers are natural gas and mineral exports like zinc but morales has shown an interest in diversifying the economy by investing in agriculture and industrialization he has nationalized some important industries but has left most sectors private he s invested in health education and aid for the poor but began with a fairly minimalist welfare state to ensure sustainability it s worth noting that morales s deliberate economic strategy has been accompanied by a reckless one on the environment despite passing the world s first law that gives equal rights to all living things morales s infrastructure efforts and expansion of extractive industries have been destructive for bolivia s vast rain forests rivers and wildlife since 2013 he s passed at least four laws that permit increased agricultural use of fragile forested areas and environmental experts say that his loosely regulated policies of allowing small scale farmers to use fires to clear land are to blame for an out of control blaze in the bolivian amazon in recent weeks bolivia s gradualist economic outlook is informed by morales s long standing finance minister luis arce arce is known in bolivia as a tight fisted technocrat who persuasively plays devil s advocate during spending debates in the morales administration critics on the left sometimes pan him and his associates as the chuquiago boys a clever moniker meant to liken him to the neoliberal latin american economists who hail from the university of chicago s austerity obsessed economics department chuquiago is the aymara word for la paz related article what the un report gets right and wrong about the crisis in venezuela gabriel hetland santiago anria a political scientist at dickinson college characterizes arce as a prudent populist anria told me that he interviewed arce in 2013 and at the time arce described being traumatized by bolivia s crippling hyperinflation in the 1980s he told me something along the lines of we can t have a revolution without sound macroeconomics anria said arce is widely seen as the reason that bolivia accumulated massive foreign exchange reserves during the 2000s and early 2010s which have helped keep the boliviano stable and allowed the country to maintain social spending as commodity prices have dropped in recent years another quality that s helped bolivian socialism endure has been morales s emphasis on racial inclusiveness a feature that has both widened participation in the economy and also inspired more buy in from bolivia s majority indigenous population morales has wielded symbolic power as bolivia s first indigenous president but also used the letter of the law to create a society that embraces and defends its multicultural diversity the constitution he passed in 2009 which changed the country s official title from the republic of bolivia to the plurinational state of bolivia officially recognized 36 indigenous languages laws have been passed banning racial discrimination and requiring children to learn local indigenous languages there s also been a rise in the number of lawmakers who identify as indigenous as i traveled through bolivia this spring i asked scores of people what the term socialism meant to them personally time and time again people spoke about how it meant rejecting racism sometimes without even explicitly mentioning the economy while the us left debates whether racial identity is a distraction from class identity in bolivia many people on the left consider the two inextricably intertwined many cited examples of how before morales an indigenous woman could get kicked out of a shop just for wearing traditional attire now an aymara woman in la paz can open up a business in a mall she might not have been allowed to step foot in before morales s decisive reelection for second and third terms and his ability to keep up his movement toward socialism came about to no small degree because he placed indigenous liberation at the center of his agenda the third key feature of bolivian socialism is not a quality of the government but rather one of the population as a whole bolivia s citizenry is astonishingly organized and militant protests are a way of life that means morales s base has had an unusual amount of leverage when pressuring him to keep his promises if you talk to a blue collar worker and ask if they re part of any organizations you re likely to hear a long list of unions and associations in response tied to their job neighborhood and school district these aren t just networks for collaboration they re also street armies and voting blocs bolivia is one of the most mobilized societies in the world calla hummel a political scientist at the university of miami told me the latin american public opinion project found that bolivians participated in protests at more than double the rate of us citizens in 2017 and bolivians aren t exactly quiet picketers in recent memory protesters have used mass demonstrations economically suffocating roadblocks street fights with the police kidnappings and dynamite to fight for their grievances protests are what pushed morales s two predecessors out of power and protests have continued throughout his own tenure most notably forcing him to suspend a major project for an amazon highway that isn t to say morales necessarily listens to protests in fact he regularly tries to co opt and divide social movements to weaken their threat to his power there are concerns among activists opposed to his run that he could become more manipulative still as he makes his bid for a fourth term in office on october 20 or become more emboldened to find authoritarian ways to stay in power if he wins it he could for example try to use repressive laws to weaken critics and political opponents as he s done in the past with laws ostensibly meant to regulate ngos but experts say bolivia s mobilized citizenry could act as a partial check against political misbehavior bolivia has a long no reelection tradition morales has clearly crossed a red line in his attempt to run once again anria told me this has already resulted in a fairly significant backlash maybe not as widespread as one would hope but it has led to the articulation of an opposition that while still disunited has more traction than before for all his questionable antics morales is currently leading in the polls by a sizable margin and most political analysts predict that he has a very good chance of being reelected running against morales is tricky business despite declining approval ratings he s still beloved by his core base carlos mesa a former vice president of bolivia and morales s only serious threat in the presidential race has framed his run as an attempt to protect democratic rule from a corrupt strongman president morales is no longer part of the present and much less of the future he is part of the past mesa said last year this is because he unfortunately has decided that power is more important than the project but notably mesa has been wary of issuing a strong critique of morales s management of the economy and his spending programs there are plenty of ways in which the economy could be seriously improved increasing the small number of private sector white collar jobs for example but mesa is focusing instead on political issues that s a testament to the current strength of the economy mesa knows it s hard to hammer morales on it when it s so outwardly stable it s also a way for mesa to try to avoid bringing up his biggest political liability the fact that he served under president gonzalo goni sanchez de lozada a man whose thuggish neoliberal agenda culminated in overseeing the massacre of over 60 people protesting against the privatization of natural gas in el alto in 2003 and whom bolivians haven t forgotten about it was actually my people who died in that war their blood is on his hands and he won t take any responsibility nirvana guerrero a feminist activist from el alto said of mesa guerrero a college student who taught herself english using youtube videos was not uncritical of morales either but she talked about her preference for him over mesa as a practical matter the money that was all in the rich people s house is now going for the rest she said and then paused for a moment i think that s good enough for the moment

intro in hindsight for investors 2019 was about as easy as it gets aside from a few temporary pullbacks most asset classes surged on january 1st and never looked back by the end of the year nearly every asset class posted positive returns with many delivering double digits equity investors were rewarded for continuing to ride out this record breaking bull market with us large caps up 31 49 and mid and small caps not far behind at 30 54 and 25 96 respectively developed international stocks returned 22 01 despite the ongoing brexit saga and even the trade war drama couldn t keep emerging market stocks from posting a solid 18 42 return fixed income returns were similarly impressive across the board with high yield bonds up 14 41 in 2019 to put into context how well every asset class performed in 2019 consider the 8 72 return from the bloomberg barclays us aggregate bond index the agg near the bottom of the table on opposite page figure 1 while this return looks disappointing relative to other asset classes on the table it was the best year for the agg since 2001 for all around asset class performance this was the best year for investors since 2009 taking a 10 year lookback is a good way to remind ourselves that long term market outcomes are often shaped not so much by the large singular headline events but by the aftershocks the 2008 financial crisis is no longer in our 10 year rearview mirror but the resulting effects economic regulatory and behavioral continue to define markets as we enter the next decade some of these effects like regulations on banks and more restrictive consumer lending standards are beginning to lessen central banks however after a decade of accommodative monetary policy are finding it much more difficult to put the genie back in the bottle finally the behavioral impact may be the longest lasting a generation of investors came of age during a devastating financial and housing crisis making them far more riskaverse than prior generations and skeptical of home ownership yet amidst these challenges there is much reason to be optimistic as we enter the new decade yes the 2000s have thus far been shaped by two of history s biggest stock market crashes this does not mean that another crash will be the defining event of the 2020s rather the next major catalyst may be a positive event spurred from one of the breakthroughs in technology that are occurring every day it wasn t long ago that 2020 sounded like the faroff future we may not have flying cars but we do have self driving ones powered by technology that seemed like science fiction a decade ago this technological renaissance makes it incredibly difficult to forecast 10 years out but it is a necessary exercise to evaluate what has changed since last year and update our baseline asset allocation expectations we hope you find our 2020 outlook helpful and wish you the best of success in your next decade of investing exhibit 1 periodic table of investment returns 2009 2019 source hanlon research economic backdrop the most significant development in 2019 was a policy shift from the us federal reserve the fed pausing for the first half of the year and then ultimately reversing the prior three hikes to bring the federal funds rate to 1 50 1 75 the dovish pivot put the us central bank more in sync with its international peers many of which have eased their respective benchmark rates to negative territory as we close the year the fed seems content to hold rates steady for the time being inflation data has been consistently soft at just 1 6 as measured by the core personal consumption expenditures index there was not much justification for the fed to raise rates in the first place and the fed was possibly looking to get its benchmark rate up to a level that would provide capacity for future cuts i e create some dry powder the fed is now determined to lift prices inflation to or symmetrically above its 2 target on a persistent basis by keeping rates unchanged through 2020 the us economy is on stable footing heading into the new year unemployment is at a 50 year low giving consumers confidence to continue to spend consumers have been carrying the bull market as businesses have shown reluctance to engage in significant capital spending largely due to uncertainty surrounding the trade war us gdp grew at a 2 1 pace in the third quarter but is widely expected to soften slightly to just under 2 in the coming year the expected slowdown in us gdp coincides with an anticipated global growth decline euro area gdp growth continues to sputter along around 1 2 and will likely remain around this level the chinese economy is the driving force for growth in emerging markets but this too has fallen to the low end of the government s target range at 6 in 2019 even with a phase i resolution to the tariff dispute high levels of consumer debt should keep chinese gdp growth below 6 in the coming year the years of explosive 7 9 chinese growth are behind us how economic data is measured in a modern service driven economy has increasingly become the subject of debate federal reserve chairman jerome powell raised the topic in october suggesting that productivity measures which have been relatively weak are inadequate and missing a good deal of the actual output produced in modern society the traditional formula for measuring productivity gdp divided by total hours worked is a good enough approximation for hourly employees in a manufacturing driven society however the us economy and most developed economies worldwide are now heavily driven by services which can be much more difficult to distill into units of output furthermore nearly 50 of us workers are salaried employees and with the advent of technology many workers are always on the clock with the workday extending into late night and weekend emails as technology continues to advance we anticipate changes to the way we measure economic output will be needed us equity a year ago we cautioned that while the record setting bull market was potentially winding down it was likely too early to rotate out of high growth names and into value stocks as prior market cycles have demonstrated equity bull markets typically have a blow off top rather than a slow fade to black with the most substantial gains to be had in the high momentum growth stocks for most of the year the s p 500 growth index outpaced the s p 500 value index however value stocks have come into favor in the last quarter bringing 2019 total returns for the growth and value indices near parity at 31 13 and 31 93 respectively was this year the last gasp of the venerable bull market considering that over the long run growth in gdp correlates with growth in corporate earnings it would be reasonable to expect us equities to cool off a bit from this year s excellent returns as overall economic output declines however we don t anticipate a rush out of us equities just yet given the dominant role us companies play in the global marketplace us equity valuations are slightly high with the price to earnings p e ratio of the s p 500 at around 20 3 based on actual and estimated fullyear 2019 operating earnings compared to a 25 year average trailing p e of 19 6 but the trade war resolution would provide potential for improved earnings prospects and propel stocks higher while a surprise from the fed is no longer a major concern uncertainty over the outcome of the 2020 us presidential and congressional november elections will undoubtedly weigh on us equities for much of the year buying opportunities will likely arise for financial sector stocks particularly bank stocks which were beaten down as interest rates declined banking industry stocks look attractively priced with a p e multiple of just 11 5 as measured by the spdr s p 500 bank etf ticker kbe significantly below most of their peers in the s p 500 while also providing higher than average dividend yield the big banks have long served as the democratic punching bag and calls for tougher regulation will surely occur in the debates however privacy and 1st amendment issues have made big tech a favorite target of late and the sector may share the attention of the candidates criticism during the democratic primaries for most investors we believe maintaining us equity exposure is necessary even though markets could be choppy or move sideways until there is more clarity on the election outcome and earnings prospects in the event of a trade resolution or with a trump re election markets would likely maintain their positive trend with longer term forecasts calling for lower us equity returns over the next decade event driven opportunities like this could become increasingly rare developed international equity compared to us equities developed market dm and emerging market em equities looked like the walking dead for the last decade with annualized returns of just 5 43 and 2 91 respectively compared to the s p 500 s 13 46 annualized rate eurozone economies stumbled out of the great recession like zombies that continue to stagger on one reason for the difference in returns is america s dominance in the technology sector globally aggressive central bank stimulus has thus far failed to improve german manufacturing activity while adversely affecting the large european financial sector as we have pointed out in prior years however long term investors who omit dm equities from their asset allocation are ignoring roughly 35 of the global equity market many investors have shunned dm equities as the brexit debacle played out over the past several years but with a resolution in sight inflows may return and prices appreciate dm equity valuations are only slightly higher than historical averages with some areas such a japanese equity still priced relatively cheap japanese equities measured by the nikkei 225 index are currently priced at a multiple of around 17 times estimated 2020 earnings below historical norm the low multiples have triggered a surge in share buybacks and a 4 5 20 72 return in 2019 a trade war resolution and a weakening in the us dollar could give japanese equities a further boost emerging market equity many emerging market stocks that rely heavily on exports have suffered the most under president trump s aggressive trade tactics in addition to tariffs em economies can be highly concentrated in only 1 2 economic sectors and are subject to currency and commodity related volatility as well as political risks from governmental instability societal volatility and wars for the past decade em stocks have failed to deliver returns that justify the additional risks inconsistent earnings growth has disappointed investors and led to em equities becoming less attractive heading into 2020 em is finally starting to show some relative strength against domestic equities a de escalation in the trade war dubbed phase one of the ongoing talks provided a preview of what can be expected if a larger agreement finally materializes with the us presidency in play in 2020 common sense continues to dictate that it is in president trump s best interest to get a comprehensive deal completed if this occurs the upside moves in em may be swift and considerable despite the uncertainty and volatility inherent in em investing we feel the potential returns that will occur outweigh the current risks and advocate for continued em exposure em equities also can provide attractive dividend flows while one waits for anticipated price appreciation longer term the story remains the same as in prior years the potential for economic growth is heavily concentrated in the em economies even as china transitions to a consumption led economy the gdp growth rates should still be roughly triple that of the us the demographics also favor em where populations are heavily skewed towards younger workers and absent a comprehensive trade agreement other em markets such as vietnam and mexico stand to gain from a supply chain restructuring that is already under way technology will increasingly become the equalizer with em populations aggressively adopting new technologies to enable commerce and connectivity the last decade was painful for emerging market equity investors but we know from prior decades that the asset class can quickly make up lost ground therefore we continue to recommend most investors stay the course and own at least a market weight position in em with an overweight position for aggressive investors fixed income the outlook for fixed income investors in both the short and long term is challenging yield continues to be scarce with us fixed income heavily in demand from both domestic and foreign investors in 2019 the downward pressure on the long end of the yield curve resulting from huge investor demand led to a temporary yield curve inversion a phenomenon considered to be a harbinger of recession the yield curve has since reverted to its normal state though this does not guarantee a recession has been avoided the prior three yield curve inversions all reverted in advance of their respective subsequent recessions the desperate search for yield has also extended into credit markets with high yield hy bonds heavily in demand as we close out 2019 pushing spreads down to 3 5 the tightest reading since october of 2018 investors are showing a larger risk appetite as the year ends bidding up the riskiest bonds exhibit 2 yield curve inversions prior to recessions shaded areas indicate us recessions source federal reserve bank of st louis for much of the year the most speculative triple c rated segment of the bank of america merrill lynch us hy index was relatively unchanged while the higher rated bb and b bonds saw significant spread compression however cccs have experienced solid demand late in 2019 increased risk tolerance is also evident in the investment grade ig credit market despite alarms over the proliferation of triple b rated bonds in recent years the bbb segment sits just above hy in credit rating and are therefore susceptible to forced selling if eventually downgraded to below bbb aka junk status bbbs now hold a dominant position in broad ig bond markets at the expense of a diminished proportion of highly rated aaa bonds our long term forecasts for fixed income asset returns reflect these challenges and we see little chance of global central banks turning hawkish in unison we believe investors should allocate more heavily to the shorter end of the yield curve and pay close attention to the high yield market which looks expensive and vulnerable to a pullback we continue to recommend investors diversify exposure by allocating to local currency dm and em bonds as well to capitalize on the potential for a weakening us dollar which coincides with the fed s desire for higher domestic inflation exhibit 3 growth of bbb rated debt as percentage of global investment grade corporate bond market source bloomberg barclays commodities and alternatives broad basket commodities underperformed in 2019 with tariff induced weaker demand and efficiency driven increased supply exerting downward pressure on prices crude oil prices surged at the start of the year but for the 2nd half west texas intermediate has been trading firmly in the 55 60 range with less volatility than in prior years opec actively intervened throughout the year attempting to support prices with dubiously adhered to production cuts an attack on saudi arabian oil fields attributable to iran resulted in the biggest daily price spike since the financial crisis but the capacity was quickly restored with minimal impact in addition to oil other commodities stand to benefit from a us china trade deal with chinese agricultural purchases being a key component and the potential for increased natural gas exports also on the table while in the near term we may see a solid year from commodities dependent on the trade war outcome our longer term expectations are constrained by globally low inflation and a generally lowered global gdp moreover just in time delivery supported by massive improvements in supply chain management and commodity harvesting techniques will also provide for a smoother ride and less upside in prices for commodities among the other alternatives real estate investment trusts reits were the standout performer in 2019 keeping pace with the s p 500 for most of the year before fading in november we anticipate reits will continue to deliver given their historical ability to grow dividends the sector yields roughly 3 2 more than 50 higher than the s p 500 making reits an attractive way to diversify portfolios while generating income within the sector performances can be disparate with high growth tech oriented reits specializing in data centers or cell phone towers at one end compared to deep value brick and mortar retail reits at the other final thoughts the start of a new decade is always an exciting event with the prospect of a blank slate for the next 10 years of investing it seems near certain that this bull will eventually breathe its last breath at some point before 2030 but the stage is set for continued positive returns albeit potentially less than the long term averages the next ten years will likely come with a new set of challenges with the maturing business cycle bringing lower return forecasts across the board despite this more challenging environment exploitable opportunities are bound to arise for investors who maintain a flexible approach to asset allocation
executive summary for the past three weeks a new coronavirus has originated in china and spread across asia more recently the virus was confirmed to have entered several other countries around the world sparking reminders of the sars epidemic that plagued china and asia in the early 2000s these fears have reached financial markets with asian and chinese asset prices coming under pressure over the past few weeks with travel restrictions surrounding the lunar new year china s economic activity data could also be affected developments are extremely fluid and uncertainties around the severity of the virus remain prevalent accordingly we think it s important to lay out our base case scenario as well as favorable and adverse scenarios and potential implications for the chinese economy and currency markets as of now we place a high probability on our base case scenario and expect china s economy to grow at 5 8 this year down from 5 9 before the coronavirus outbreak what is the coronavirus and what is the impact over the past few weeks a new coronavirus originating from the city of wuhan china has spread across asia and into the united states and other countries to date there have been more than 6 000 confirmed cases around the world while the virus has claimed at least 130 lives the virus is still in its early stages but has already drawn comparisons to the outbreak of sars severe accurate respiratory syndrome that plagued china and other parts of asia in the early 2000s as of now doctors and scientists have indicated the wuhan coronavirus is not as severe as sars however this has not prevented chinese authorities from taking preemptive action in an effort to stem the virus effect and prevent it from spreading globally in just the last week the chinese government has implemented travel restrictions in and out of the city of wuhan while other municipalities have placed constraints around the use of public transportation in addition the world health organization who has determined the virus is not yet a global public health emergency a designation used for complex epidemics that can easily spread internationally but noted it may yet become one in addition to its health effects the coronavirus has rattled investors and financial markets particularly in china and financial hubs across asia since its peak the shanghai composite equity index has sold off about 4 7 while the hong kong hang seng equity index is down over 6 0 the onshore chinese renminbi has also moved lower as a result selling off roughly 1 2 over the same time period while the offshore renminbi has weakened about 1 4 other emerging asian currencies have also weakened as investor sentiment toward the region has soured with the currencies of countries closely linked to china under the most pressure the impact has also spread outside of local asian markets with most emerging currencies selling off sharply oil prices and most commodity prices have come down significantly dragging commodity linked currencies such as the russian ruble chilean peso and south african rand lower as well as far as effects on the chinese economy it is too early to make any specific determinations at this time however it is currently the lunar new year in china which is typically a time for increased travel and retail sales given the travel restrictions in and out of china and general fear of contagion there is likely to be a slowdown in economic activity to start the year which would likely have an effect on the overall growth prospects while the sars epidemic may not be a perfect comparison a brookings institution analysis estimated the economic impact of the sars virus as reducing annual gdp in china by about 1 0 around 2002 2003 with this in mind we lay out a few scenarios for how the coronavirus situation could evolve and highlight the possible impacts on the chinese economy as well as potential currency moves base case scenario coronavirus contained our base case scenario which we assign a 70 80 probability is that the current coronavirus outbreak gets mildly worse in the near term but measures taken by the chinese government contain the virus we anticipate that the chinese government will continue to tighten restrictions on tourists in and out of china and continue to take preemptive measures such as entry screenings at major airports and school closures with the outbreak occurring during the chinese lunar new year a peak time for travel and consumer spending we expect the virus to have a slight impact on china s growth prospects before the virus we forecasted china s economy to grow at 5 9 this year however given the expected slowdown in economic activity we now expect china to slow to annual growth of 5 8 as far as the chinese currency we believe the renminbi will eventually strengthen and are comfortable with an outlook for modest cny strength over the medium term we also believe emerging asian currencies will begin to strengthen as well while the u s dollar will gradually weaken as demand for the safe haven qualities of the greenback dissipate in addition we would expect the euro to modestly strengthen from current levels favorable scenario crisis conditions managed despite our base case assumption there is the possibility that the chinese government takes more aggressive and preemptive measures to contain the virus more effectively and quicker than expected in this event we would expect investor sentiment to turn positive as the chinese government proves its ability to manage crisis conditions and limit the impact of the virus on financial markets and the chinese economy in this favorable scenario we would expect the impact on the chinese economy to be relatively limited and could even see growth prospects improve to 6 0 for full year 2020 as fear of the coronavirus fades we would expect the renminbi to firm back to pre virus levels and potentially stronger while we are optimistic on the currency s medium term prospects in addition emerging asian currencies would likely strengthen while we would expect the u s dollar to significantly weaken against both g10 and emerging currencies as risk on sentiment spreads across currency markets benefitting the euro as well adverse scenario virus spreads globally the likelihood of an extreme adverse scenario also exists we define this scenario as the coronavirus spreading aggressively and globally with the virus unable to be contained in this scenario fear spreads globally negatively impacting investor sentiment and global growth prospects stricter travel restrictions are likely implemented with domestic chinese activity slowing sharply in this scenario we forecast the chinese economy could slow significantly falling to annual 2020 growth of 5 0 this growth effect is similar to the impact sars had on the chinese economy developments surrounding a global spread of the coronavirus would likely have a major influence over currency markets and we anticipate the chinese renminbi to exhibit uncommon volatility while china sensitive currencies are likely to selloff as far as the path of the u s dollar we would expect the greenback to strengthen significantly against g10 and emerging currencies while the euro would likely decline key takeaways as of now we place a 70 80 probability that our base case scenario materializes given how fluid the current situation is we will be monitoring coronavirus developments very closely and will keep readers abreast of any updates to our scenarios and if our base case changes meaningfully however given some degree of confidence in the base case we remain comfortable with our assumption that the chinese economy will grow slightly slower in 2020 than previously anticipated
this year can be a decisive one for brazil s transition to a more robust and sustainable growth path but only if the government commits to fiscal and structural reform if brazil s leaders fail to take this opportunity to lay the foundations for long term prosperity it may not be long before the economy stalls again washington dc brazil s economy has endured a difficult few years after a deep recession in 2015 2016 gdp grew by just over 1 annually in 2017 2019 but things are finally looking up with the international monetary fund forecasting a 2 2 2 3 growth in 2020 21 the challenge now is to convert this cyclical recovery into a robust long term expansion two problems have undermined brazil s economic dynamism anemic productivity and a bloated public sector as weak productivity growth has constrained the economy s overall growth potential steadily rising public spending has become increasingly unsustainable this is not a new problem but in the first decade of this century it was obscured by the commodity price super cycle which drove annual growth above 4 in 2012 2014 pro cyclical fiscal and public bank driven credit expansion fueled growth further but exacerbated imbalances that would come back to haunt brazil when the commodity boom ended now brazil is shifting to a new economic model in which lower for longer interest rates and increased private finance and investment make up for more restrained fiscal policies and reduced public bank credit this year could bring substantial progress in this transition but only if the government remains committed to fiscal and structural reforms on the fiscal front brazil has already taken significant steps in 2016 the government passed a 20 year public spending ceiling last year s pension reform is an important example of this new regimen but the pension reform alone is not nearly enough to restore fiscal health not least because the associated reductions in public spending will be spread out over several years

do not rise significantly and annual gdp growth averages around 2 the public sector gross debt to gdp ratio could decline from over 77 in 2018 to 66 in 2030 if gdp growth averages 3 that ratio could fall to just 49 the extent to which the government manages to make space for pro growth discretionary spending will play an important role in determining which scenario prevails financial markets offer further reason to hope that brazil s macroeconomic recovery will succeed beyond low interest rates the country s risk spreads have fallen to their lowest level in nearly a decade while capital flowed out of the country in net terms in 2019 that mainly reflected the unwinding of the interest rate premium paid on domestic debt as well as pre payment of foreign debt by brazilian corporates meanwhile domestic funding to brazilian non financial corporates has returned to pre recession levels and corporate debt securities and equities have grown significantly capital markets have begun to compensate for the decline in subsidized credit from the brazilian development bank bndes and bank lending to businesses has picked up in addressing weak productivity gains brazil has a longer way to go over the last two decades labor force expansion has accounted for more than half of brazil s per capita income growth but as brazil s demographic dividend ends continued progress will require existing workers to become more productive since the mid 1990s productivity has been increasing at an average annual rate of just 0 7 inadequate physical investment has contributed to this inertia but the main culprit has been a lack of progress in total factor productivity tfp a result of poor education weak infrastructure and a challenging business environment to spur tfp growth brazil s government should use concessions and privatization to convince the private sector to channel its large savings now in search of yields toward infrastructure to this end fine tuning the regulatory framework governing private investment in areas like transport and sanitation is essential at the same time the government must improve the business environment reforms that simplify tax administration including by harmonizing the tax base across levels of government are particularly urgent moreover trade opening measures and agreements which may run up against political obstacles abroad relating to environmental and other concerns must be pushed forward this year can be a decisive one for brazil s transition to a more robust and sustainable growth path but only if the government commits to reform if instead brazil s leaders simply reap the short term benefits of improved macroeconomic performance without laying the foundations for long term prosperity it may not be long before the economy stalls again

of boj s january 20 21 meeting it s noted that there has been no further increase in the possibility that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target will be lost therefore it s appropriate to keep monetary policy unchanged nevertheless the possibility of inflation losing momentum continues to warrant attention it s appropriate to tilt toward monetary accommodation also japan

support turned resistance holds in case of recovery in the bigger picture rebound from 1 0879 is seen as a corrective move at this point in case of another rise upside should be limited by 38 2 retracement of 1 2555 to 1 0879 at 1 1519 and down trend from 1 2555 2018 high would resume at a later stage however sustained break of 1 1519 will dampen this bearish view and bring stronger rise to

quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2019 net interest income decreased 2 8 million due to an increase in interest expense as a result of premium expense associated with calling and reissuing brokered certificates of deposits at lower rates and a decrease in interest earning assets driven primarily by a decrease in average balances of interest earning deposits in other banks and securities in addition the federal open market committee lowered the federal funds rate in both the third and fourth quarter of 2019 reducing the yields on bank interest earning deposits and securities this was partially offset by an increase in average loans primarily due to an increase in mortgage warehouse loan balances compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 net interest income decreased 5 2 million due to a 213 0 million decrease in average interest earning assets a 302 4 million increase in average interest bearing liabilities and a 205 basis point increase in the rates on interest bearing liabilities average interest earning assets decreased primarily due to a decrease in interest earning deposits offset by an increase in securities and loans the decrease in interest earning deposits was primarily due to the investment of such funds in higher yielding securities and loans the increase in securities resulted from purchases of fixed rate commercial mortgage backed securities and adjustable rate residential mortgage backed securities while the increase in loans was primarily driven by an increase in mortgage refinancing increased mortgage warehouse loan demand and increased production of multi family residential loans offsetting a decrease in loans related to the sale of the business loan portfolio in the first quarter of 2019 yields on earning assets benefited from the increase in securities relative to interest earning deposits in other banks and an increase in interest income primarily due to increased mortgage warehouse loan balances the increase in rates on interest bearing deposits was primarily due to the issuance of callable brokered certificates of deposits which were used to fund fixed rate commercial mortgage backed securities both associated with a hedging strategy which is discussed in further detail under balance sheet securities noninterest bearing deposits generated by the digital currency initiative are primarily invested in securities and interest earning deposits net interest margin for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 2 97 compared to 3 39 for the third quarter of 2019 and 3 59 for the fourth quarter of 2018 the decrease in the net interest margin compared to the third quarter of 2019 was driven by an increase in interest expense due to premium expense associated with calling and reissuing brokered certificates of deposits at lower rates the yield on interest earning assets declined 11 basis points due primarily to reductions in the federal funds rate during the third and fourth quarters of 2019 which was partially offset by increased balances of higher yielding mortgage warehouse loans the net interest margin decrease from the fourth quarter of 2018 was primarily due to increased interest

third quarter of 2019 and 1 7 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 the reversal in the third quarter of 2019 was due to improvements in qualitative factors related to the loan portfolio and the continued low charge off rates the reversal in the fourth quarter of 2018 was primarily due to reclassifying 125 2 million in loans held for investment as loans held for sale in connection with the company s november 2018 agreement to sell the bank s business loan portfolio noninterest income noninterest income for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 3 1 million an increase of 0 5 million or 20 4 from the third quarter of 2019 the primary driver of this increase was a 0 7 million gain on sale of securities which is discussed in further detail under balance sheet securities noninterest income for the fourth quarter of 2019 increased by 1 1 million or 57 2 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 this increase was driven by a 0 7 million or 90 6 increase in deposit related fees along with the 0 7 million gain on sale of securities partially offset by a decrease in service fees related to off balance sheet deposits deposit related fees increased primarily due to increases in cash management

to an 8 3 million increase in interest income partially offset by a 6 9 million increase in interest expense the increase in interest income was due to both an increase in average earning assets and higher yields on those assets driven in part by an increase in higher yielding securities and a reduction in lower yielding interest earning deposits which offset higher rates on interest bearing deposits as a result of the new callable brokered certificates of deposits associated with the company s hedging strategy noninterest income for the year ended december 31 2019 was 15 8 million compared to 7 6 million for 2018 the increase in total noninterest income was primarily due to the increase in fee income from our digital currency customers and a 5 5 million gain on a branch sale

decrease of 50 8 million from the prior quarter end and a 238 1 million decrease compared to december 31 2018 the decrease in total deposits from the prior quarter reflects changes in deposit levels of our digital currency customers the increase in total deposits from december 31 2018 reflects an increase of 325 0 million in callable brokered certificates of deposit associated with our hedging strategy offset by decreases from our digital currency customers and a 74 5 million decrease from the sale of our san marcos branch in the first quarter of 2019 the weighted average cost of deposits

more stimulus measures a government economist said in remarks published on wednesday the fast spreading outbreak could cut first quarter gdp growth by about 1 percentage point caijing magazine quoted zhang ming as saying gdp growth in the first quarter of 2020 could be about 5 0 and we cannot rule out the possibility of falling below 5 0 zhang said zhang an economist at the chinese academy of social sciences a top government think tank said his forecast was based on the assumption that the outbreak will peak in early to mid february and end by the end of march zhang is among many

non gaap measures the company presents non gaap measures including free cash to provide a basis for evaluating underlying earnings and liquidity trends in the company s business that can be compared

company s consolidated financial information to compare profitability on a long term basis including assessing future profitability with that of the company s peers these non gaap measures have no standardized meaning and are not defined by gaap and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies the presentation of these non gaap measures is not intended to be considered in isolation from as a substitute for or as superior to the financial information presented in accordance with gaap non gaap performance measures the company uses adjusted earnings results including adjusted income and adjusted diluted earnings per share eps to evaluate the company s operating performance and for planning and forecasting future business operations and future profitability these non gaap measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operating results because they exclude certain significant items that are not considered indicative of

these significant items may include but are not limited to restructuring and asset impairment charges individually significant gains and losses from sales of assets the foreign exchange fx impact of translating the company s debt and lease liabilities discrete tax items and certain items outside the control of management these items may not be non recurring however excluding these significant items from gaap results allows for a consistent understanding of the company s consolidated financial performance when performing a multi period assessment including assessing the likelihood of future results accordingly these non gaap financial measures may provide insight to investors and other external users of the company s consolidated financial information significant items that impact

diluted eps management is unable to reconcile without unreasonable efforts the forward looking adjusted diluted eps to the most comparable gaap measure due to unknown variables and uncertainty related to future results these unknown variables may include unpredictable transactions of significant value in past years cp has recognized significant asset impairment charges management transition costs related to senior executives and discrete tax items these or other similar large unforeseen transactions affect diluted eps but may be excluded from cp s adjusted diluted eps additionally the u s to

customers this invaluable time spent with our people partners and customers reinforced to me the vitality and global alignment we re seeing behind our velocity growth plan our people are energized

system we create opportunity for our colleagues across the system at every mcdonald s gathering there s a story to tell of the crew person who s also a grandparent and excited to begin a new chapter

of stress being integrated into communities worldwide we know the very real challenges our customers face and we show up with solutions as we have grown we ve recognized our responsibility as one of the world s leading companies to use our scale to gain traction on some of the globe s most pressing challenges it s the strength of our business over the past 65 years that enables mcdonald s to play this role and a humbling responsibility to lead an organization with the ability to make an impact on the world kevin will drill down on our quarterly results before then i d like to share with you some headlines for the year in 2019 our system marked a historic milestone 100 billion in systemwide sales for the year we grew global comp sales 5 9 the highest increase we ve seen in over a decade 2019 was our third consecutive year of global comp guest count growth to put that in perspective mcdonald s and our franchise partners now serve nearly 70 million people in over 100 countries every 24 hours and owner operator cash flow is at or near all time highs in most of our largest markets and in the u s it s at an all time high turning to segment highlights our international operated markets segment or iom generated comp sales growth of 6 1 for the year this was underscored by every market in the segment delivering both comp sales and comp guest count growth at the same time our international developed licensee segment or idl generated comp sales of 7 2 and importantly our three largest idl markets china japan and brazil all posted positive comp sales leading a list that includes nearly all of our idl markets we also have strong momentum in the u s in fact we re now seeing the results of our most ambitious turnaround of the u s history for the full year comp sales growth grew 5 our best comp since 2006 or 13 years ago across the country we re seeing clear evidence of the power of bigger bolder vision 2020 which is our u s adaptation of the velocity growth plan developed in combination with our franchisees the initiatives we and our franchise partners deployed in 2017 and 2018 including a new value platform fresh beef delivery eotf modernization and more were met with strong approval by our customers and this led to continued strong top line growth over the past three years as one of the architects of our velocity growth plan it gives me a great sense of pride to watch two million restaurant crew around the world execute our strategies with such care and conviction i continue to have great confidence in our ability to grow and shape our industry and i m equally confident that we have the right leadership in place to meet our customers evolving needs with increasing ambition and speed joe erlinger an 18 year veteran of our company is now head of our u s business where he s responsible for the operations of nearly 14 000 restaurants across the country joe returned to the u s after several years of increasing responsibility around the world most recently he served as president of our international operated markets where we had oversight for mcdonald s wholly owned markets outside the u s with joe s transitioning ian borden has expanded his role to oversee both our iom and idl segments ian began his mcdonald s career 25 years ago in our finance department in canada and have spent 23 of these 25 years in markets outside of north america in his most recent role as president of our idl segment ian worked with our developmental licensee partners across more than 80 markets under his leadership we will drive greater collaboration across all markets and accelerate our pace of best practice and innovation sharing building on our rich heritage of learning from each other it s an important role for mcdonald s as we maximize the full potential of our 3 legged stool of company franchisee and supplier resources both ian and joe have deep track records of delivering profitable growth while building high performing teams and strengthening collaboration with our franchisee community importantly ian joe and i have also worked closely together as segment presidents over the past few years embodying the trust respect and unity of mission that are the hallmarks of our partnership culture i m thrilled to be working with both of them in their new roles now i ll turn it to kevin to talk about our fourth quarter results kevin kevin ozan executive vice president and chief financial officer chris talked about our impressive full year results so let me spend a few minutes talking about the quarter our strong top line momentum continued in the fourth quarter with global comp sales increasing 5 9 and as we ve seen consistently throughout the year each of the operating segments contributed meaningfully to our growth this marks over four years of consecutive quarterly global comp sales growth our comp sales performance is a significant achievement given a soft global ieo market and on top of strong prior year results our international operated segment which represents over 50 of total revenues and operating income generated comp sales of 6 2 for the quarter with strong performance across the segment france and the u k drove the segment s growth along with positive comp sales in every market and positive guest counts in nearly all markets france delivered its 11th consecutive quarter of comp sales growth with continued all time high market share the quarter benefited from delivery expansion digital engagement and continued deployment of eotf the market has also been successful with the balance of premium and core burger offerings the u k reported a remarkable 55th consecutive quarter of comp sales growth and continued to gain market share across nearly all dayparts the quarter benefited from extended breakfast hours compelling digital offers successful national ltos and delivery which has grown to about 10 of sales in the restaurants that offer it turning to the u s comp sales increased 5 1 for the quarter with balanced growth across all dayparts while traffic was negative the u s continues to drive significant average check growth with contributions from both product mix and strategic pricing similar to prior quarters in 2019 experience of the future contributed to positive comp sales in the fourth quarter another 500 eotf projects were completed during the quarter for a total of about 2 000 projects for the full year the u s now has nearly 10 000 restaurants that have been converted to eotf or about 70 of the estate in addition core favorites including our fresh beef quarter pounders and world famous french fries continue to resonate with customers and fueled growth for the quarter delivery was also a contributor for the quarter as the addition of new delivery partners like doordash and grubhub drove incremental orders and the deployment of dynamic yield s suggestive sell technology in over 11 000 drive thrus also contributed to the growth in average check that said returning to guest count growth in the u s remains our top priority sluggish industry traffic growth and unit expansion continue to fuel an aggressive battle for market share in particular the u s is centered on stemming traffic losses at the breakfast daypart by focusing on running better operations introducing new menu items and offering delicious food at a compelling price point finally in the international developmental licensed markets comp sales were up 6 6 for the quarter with growth across each geographic region the largest contributor to segment performance were brazil china and japan turning to the bottom line adjusted earnings per share was 1 97 for the quarter a 1 increase in constant currencies when excluding impairment charges in the prior year and tax law change benefits in both the current and prior year results reflect strong global comp sales and operating growth mostly offset by a higher tax rate versus the prior year consolidated franchise margin dollars increased 7 in constant currencies reflecting strong sales performance across all segments as well as expansion and the impact of refranchising franchise margin percent declined 60 basis points as franchise revenue growth was more than offset by higher depreciation related to eotf modernization in the u s and the impact of the new lease standard consolidated company operated margins improved 40 basis points to 17 9 for the quarter primarily due to strong comp sales growth iom segment company operated margins increased 30 basis points to a healthy 20 1 and u s company operated margins increased 150 basis points to 16 4 as solid sales performance more than offset continued commodity and wage pressures and eotf related depreciation overall our restaurant margins increased nearly 180 million in constant currencies for the quarter and over 600 million for the full year and finally excluding current and prior year special items operating margin increased 30 basis points to 43 4 for the full year we also achieved our three year target of returning 25 billion to shareholders this is a significant accomplishment given our substantial investments in experience of the future and technology to drive sustainable profitable growth as a perspective over the last three years we invested about 7 billion in the business to drive growth we increased our dividends per share by over 30 and paid out 10 billion in dividends and we reduced our shares outstanding about 10 by purchasing 15 billion of treasury stock this also speaks to the progress we ve made in enhancing our free cash flow profile as a result of refranchising efforts and rightsizing our cost structure over the past several years we ve evolved to a more stable and predictable business model in 2019 our free cash flow was 5 7 billion up over 35 from the prior year and free cash flow conversion which measures our ability to convert bottom line earnings to free cash flow was 95 a significant uptick from the prior year going forward our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged first to reinvest in existing restaurants and opportunities to grow the business second to continue growing our dividend and third to buy back shares we expect our free cash flow to continue to grow and we expect to continue to return all free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases now i ll turn it back to chris to talk more about our velocity growth plan and where we re headed in 2020 chris kempczinski president and chief executive officer thanks kevin nowhere is the power of our velocity growth plan and franchise model come more to life than in our restaurants in my recent travels to our european markets i saw this firsthand everywhere i went i was struck in particular during a visit to a restaurant in france a society that famously values good food and beverages and inviting atmosphere in the spirit of community there i saw an engaged owner operator who knew her customers by name and had made her modernized restaurant a vibrant gathering place for the community kids were everywhere much like their counterparts around the world young adults were busy multitasking between bites of burgers and fries parents appear to be appreciating a moment of rest and other adults were seated in singles and pairs some having a full meal others just having coffee with the scene that reinforced the fundamentals of the velocity growth plan by simultaneously pulling the levers of great tasting food with good value convenience and a pleasing customer experience this owner operator and many others across france and other international markets are growing visits a similar dynamic is playing out in the u k where our system is doing a great job meeting customers expectations for convenience and speed while providing differentiated experiences for guests dining in visiting the drive thru or ordering through mcdelivery this dynamic is playing out in italy where customer satisfaction scores are up at drive thru and dine in and across all three peak dayparts of breakfast lunch and dinner the excitement and energy behind our velocity growth plan is widespread it s a result of this commitment that our business is growing and our strategy continues to deliver at the same time there s a realization that we can and will do more to deliver better taste greater value and enhanced convenience for our customers this is the guiding philosophy behind our three accelerators experience of the future digital and delivery with experience of the future our strategy is focused on enhancing the customer experience by improving convenience hospitality and personalization as kevin said in the u s we completed about 2 000 projects in 2019 and are on track for just about all restaurants to be modernized by the end of 2020 customers are recognizing the changes we have made for their benefit customer satisfaction scores in the u s are at an all time high in our iom markets where the vast majority of our restaurants are now modernized we have a strong foundation for long term success by creating greater convenience comfort and hospitality for our guests meanwhile our digital journey another critical accelerator is focused on giving customers simpler smoother and more personal engagement with mcdonald s by leveraging the most relevant technology to that end we significantly strengthened our digital capabilities in 2019 in markets around the world for example a growing community of registered users is redeeming digital only offers giving our teams more opportunity to understand customer needs and create engaging digital customer experiences throughout the year we made targeted investments to accelerate our capabilities the suggestive sell capability of dynamic yield is now deployed in nearly all outdoor digital menu boards across the u s and australia in both markets we re using the technology to make smarter recommendations to customers of menu items they are likely to want there s no question that digital is transforming global retail across the system there is great excitement about the role it will play in transforming mcdonald s by strengthening and deepening relationships with our customers so we know there s great potential with digital but there s also a lot of hard work to do to realize our ambitions i recently announced creation of a new digital customer engagement team to accelerate customer focused digital initiatives including ordering personalization payments loyalty and delivery platforms lucy brady is leading this team lucy has been a driving force behind the evolution of the velocity growth plan and rapid expansion of our mcdelivery platform in her most recent role leading corporate strategy and business development lucy and her team will be responsible for developing new industry leading digital experiences for our customers and they ll partner with our global technology team to build new product road maps and technology solutions to fuel growth with our third accelerator we re bringing more customers the mcdonald s they love with the convenience of delivery today about 2 3 of our restaurants worldwide nearly 25 000 offer mcdelivery in just three years mcdelivery has gone from generating 1 billion in sales for mcdonald s company and franchise restaurants to over 4 billion in sales this past year we now have multiple 3pl partners in most major markets including the u s where the rapid scaling of doordash is showing consistent growth and the u k where we recently announced an agreement to partner with just eat we continue to see great runway ahead of us to drive awareness and trial and we re doubling down on our efforts to encourage frequency and retention as we inject speed agility and flexibility into our system through the accelerators of experience of the future digital and delivery we continue to focus on the fundamentals of running great restaurants and customers are noticing across our largest markets we ve reduced the time it takes a customer to receive their order by an average of 20 seconds with this change most markets saw overall customer satisfaction improve in 2019 our velocity growth plan provides a solid and sustainable foundation to grow our business in 2020 and beyond yet we know that we must stay in tune with evolving customer needs and adapt to changing market conditions the uncertainties before us are no surprise to anyone on this call whether due to geopolitical challenges slow ieo growth intensifying competition growing labor costs or continuous technological disruption the topics we ve shared before continue to impact the industry and will need to be overcome and that means continuing to align around a plan that always puts our customers first with great tasting food convenience and value it means collaborating with our franchisee community for a successful local execution that means building flexibility into our system for initiatives that accelerate and sustain growth and provide new opportunities for mcdonald s to build on that let me turn it back over to kevin kevin ozan executive vice president and chief financial officer we head into 2020 from a position of strength the velocity growth plan has resulted in strong operating performance over the past several years reinforcing confidence in our ability to deliver long term sustainable results i want to take a minute to walk through some of our financial expectations for 2020 we anticipate that we ll host an investor day this year to provide an update on the business and longer term expectations with our efficient business model in 2020 we expect to continue achieving an operating margin in the mid 40s range which includes the following higher depreciation expense of about 80 million versus 2019 related to eotf in the u s with the vast majority in franchise margins with most of our major refranchising efforts complete we expect gains on restaurant sales in 2020 to be roughly half of the amount in 2019 with most of the gains in the second half of the year and as we have become more efficient with g a required to run the business over the last few years we have invested in areas that are already contributing to business performance and that we believe will continue to accelerate growth including technology and research and development as a result we expect full year 2020 g a to increase 5 to 7 in constant currencies due to these investments this includes full year operating costs associated with the 2019 acquisitions of dynamic yield and apprente r d spend and costs related to our biennial worldwide convention we expect g a percentage increases will be significantly higher in the first half of the year than the second half of the year we also expect our annual tax rate will be 23 to 25 finally based on current exchange rates we anticipate currency translation will negatively impact eps by 0 01 to 0 03 in the first quarter and a similar amount for the full year as usual this is directional guidance only as rates will change as we move through the year moving on to capital we ended 2019 with capital expenditures of 2 4 billion in line with our expectations as we ve previously indicated in 2020 we expect to spend a similar amount about half of the total capital will be dedicated to the u s including the completion of roughly 1 800 eotf projects restaurant development also continues to be an important driver of our growth equation we plan to open about 1 400 new restaurants this year substantially all in markets outside the u s we ll spend approximately 800 million of our capital to open about 400 restaurants in our wholly owned markets and our developmental licensees and affiliates will spend their capital for the remaining openings of which over 450 are planned in china so while we expect total capital this year will be similar to 2019 we ve shifted about 200 million from reinvestment to new restaurants which are higher returning investments as we enter 2020 i m confident that we re well positioned to deliver sustained long term profitable growth for the system and our shareholders now i ll turn it back to chris to close chris kempczinski president and chief executive officer we ve been on an ambitious journey in the last few years from turnaround to transformation and through it all we ve made a path forward even as the landscape changes with these changes customer expectations evolve placing new demands on the world s leading brands we re ready for that challenge embracing it across our business with the enduring strength and values that make mcdonald s a force for positive social and economic development in every community we serve as we enter 2020 we do so from a position of strength and with an unwavering commitment to our velocity growth plan the accelerators driving it and the incredible people and partners who keep us nimble agile and open in new innovations and new possibilities we have some exciting milestones ahead of us in 2020 including worldwide convention in april on a final note i d like to offer a heartfelt thank you to everyone across the mcdonald s system who helped us achieve this milestone of 100 billion in systemwide sales this past year it s the sum of many things done right every day by every employee supplier franchisee and crew member around the world i m proud of our collective success and grateful for their commitment as we begin a new year with that let s begin questions and answers operator mike cieplak investor relations officer our first question is from andrew charles with cowen andrew charles cowen analyst chris i know you and joe are prioritizing u s traffic growth in 2020 but can you help outline your confidence this can be achieved on the one hand there s better alignment with operators at the start of this year versus a year ago which is aided by the simplification efforts that you guys have put in place but on the other hand breakfast competition is set to intensify shortly here will the same store sales benefit from experience of the future likely to be lower in 2020 versus what you saw in 2019 chris kempczinski president and chief executive officer yes good morning thank you andrew so as kevin talked about and as you alluded to getting the u s to positive guest count growth for us is the 1 priority i think the things that certainly give me confidence or make me feel better about our ability to do that is as you mentioned we have really strong alignment with franchisees at this point that this needs to be a priority one of the things that s i think sometimes not fully appreciated about the u s on an operator basis it s largely a franchise or it s largely a family business in the u s over half of our franchisees are second and third generation franchisees and so for them they completely recognize that no family business survives or thrives by passing on fewer customers from one generation to the next so that s an important part of this and then the second is we have a really good understanding of what it s going to take for us to drive guest counts to positive in the u s it starts with breakfast breakfast is the only daypart in the industry that s seeing traffic growth we have to win at breakfast there s obviously a lot of focus and attention that we re going to be putting on that in 2020 and then the second is a recognition that on rest of day deal or rest of day value that we need to be competitive on that so i think between alignment with the franchisees between really i think a pretty keen understanding of where we need to focus i feel good about that we did see in q4 modest sequential improvement on it but for us there is certainly not it s too early to call a trend on this we ve got to see this happen over four or five quarters and so it s going to be something we re going to be paying attention to and i m sure you guys will be asking us about it as well so more to come on that mike cieplak investor relations officer our next question is from eric gonzalez with keybanc eric gonzalez keybanc analyst it seems like the industry has become a bit more promotional since the start of the year would you agree with that or is that typical for this time of the year and then has your view changed at all in response to the current competitive environment in recent weeks as your competitor gets closer to rolling out breakfast chris kempczinski president and chief executive officer yes thanks eric january is always a highly competitive time of the year so i think the activity that we re seeing right now i wouldn t characterize it as being unusually pronounced i think again this is always something that happened at the beginning of the year but i think what you re talking about and what you mentioned is really a recognition that growth in this industry at this point is going to have to come through stealing share traffic in the industry is pretty muted there s very little traffic growth in fact if you re not growing units you ve got a headwind there so i think that s one recognition and certainly you re seeing i think just a lot of people really wanting to make sure that they can get the growth that they need to be able to offset some of the cost headwinds so i think between those two things it has been a competitive environment it s going to continue to be a competitive environment but i wouldn t say i m seeing an uptick right now mike cieplak investor relations officer our next question is from david tarantino with baird david tarantino baird analyst my question is on some of the investments you made on the technology side you made some pretty big bets across the last year or so and it looks like you re sort of staffing up to support that technology investment with your g a spending so just wondering one are there more big investments on the horizon that you see as needed and then two have you considered recouping some of those investments or sharing some of the cost of your franchisees through a technology fee or something similar that others have put in place chris kempczinski president and chief executive officer yes well as you noted we did do two acquisitions last year we bought dynamic yield which was going to help us with our suggestive sell capability and we bought apprente which is for voice recognition through the drive thru of that capability i would say our typical approach is partner not buy and so both of those for somewhat different reasons were i think unique situations i don t foresee that buying tech companies is going to be our approach going forward but we do want to be nimble enough where there are situations that come up that we will make an acquisition i think in the case of dynamic yield what we saw there was really an opportunity for us to accelerate our rollout of suggestive sell across most of our major markets there with what we believe to be kind of the leading technology in the industry and so with the idea of really wanting to drive an acceleration and do it with a leading partner we made that acquisition of dynamic yield fast forward even less than a year later we ve got dynamic yield in all 10 000 plus u s restaurants with a drive thru it s fully rolled out in australia and we re seeing a comp lift very consistent with what we had modeled when the acquisition was done similarly with apprente we ve got apprente in test in a handful of u s restaurants and we remain optimistic about that so i think what you re seeing really is for us just an emphasis on we believe digital has the opportunity to really be a huge growth driver for us when we can partner with people and do it kind of under our traditional model that s always our preference but if there are times that we need to do an acquisition we re certainly not going to take that off the table i think your question about is there a model in terms of how that gets shared with franchisees i think one benefit is when you get the lift that we are getting with something like dynamic yield we obviously participate through rent and service on that so i d say the first part is all of these are meant to drive top line growth and when we see that we certainly participate from rent and service on the ongoing costs the ongoing costs do get passed through to franchisees as part of our normal tech fee we kind of separate tech costs between development costs and sort of the ongoing operating costs we will typically pay for the development costs on our own and then the ongoing costs are what gets shared through a tech fee arrangement with our franchisees so that s been kind of our model for a long period of time i don t see that model changing mike cieplak investor relations officer our next question is from john glass with morgan stanley john glass morgan stanley analyst just following up on that in the u s chris how comfortable are you with the check growth that you ve experienced in 2019 it s more than 100 of the comp is it possible we would see the same kind of check growth in 2020 or are you less comfortable given that it may hurt the value proposition for the brand and if you are willing to share what is the comp lift that you modeled for dynamic yield that you re experiencing currently chris kempczinski president and chief executive officer thanks john one of the things that i do feel good about with the u s is when you look at the check growth that we ve gotten it s really come through a number of different things there has not been sort of a one trick pony on that we re seeing the majority of that growth is coming through mix as opposed to just kind of straight menu price but then as you decompose mix you ve got a number of factors that are worked there you ve got delivery which is delivering 2x the average check of a regular order you have dynamic yield which is typically leading to add ons to an order you have our self order kiosk where we know that people tend to have larger orders when they do self order kiosk you ve seen some of our promotional items like donut sticks d 1 2 3 as a value which are really driving add on activity so i think for me i do feel better about how we went after check growth in 2019 because it was heavily mix driven from that but there is a pricing element to this the inflation that we re seeing out there particularly on the labor side that does get priced through and so i think as we head into 2020 the conversation we ve been having with franchisees which gets back to the opening question is we ve just got to make sure that we have balance we need to have a balance between check growth and we need to get to transaction growth and that s what everybody in the u s is working toward right now kevin ozan executive vice president and chief financial officer and then regarding kind of quantifying the dynamic yield lift we generally don t quantify specific components of our comp what i would say is it will be potentially different in different countries so right now we re certainly getting a bigger lift from dynamic yield in the u s than in australia in australia they had a rudimentary suggestive sell already in the drive thru so as we put a dynamic yield there wasn t as larger a lift as we re certainly experiencing in the u s but the big positive about dynamic yield is our plans would be to take that similar decisioning engine type logic and be able to use that further in kiosk and global mobile app ultimately so that we need can continue getting further sales lifts in other digital mechanisms also mike cieplak investor relations officer our next question is from brian bittner with oppenheimer brian bittner oppenheimer analyst can you just talk a little bit more about the capex strategy moving forward when we met in december in new york it sounded like there was somewhat of a pivot happening in how you were thinking about the capex strategy even past 2020 i believe you were really starting to see areas you could invest in moving forward that would maybe keep capex elevated can you just talk about this and ultimately what does your steady state capex look like and what year do you expect that to occur chris kempczinski president and chief executive officer yes thanks brian so as we talked about we always said 19 and 20 would be similar so we had 2 4 billion in 2019 we ll have a relatively similar amount in 2020 and as we ve indicated we expect capex to come down some in 2021 the one area that we re currently reviewing and evaluating is our international business and potential unit expansion there as you know our international business is very strong we see very high returns on investments in new restaurants in those markets and we believe there s further potential for unit growth in many of those markets so we re currently evaluating the opportunity to invest in some of those new units outside the u s you ll see that we have gone up a little bit in our openings in 2020 growing about 1 400 new units that should between those and the ones we opened in 2019 contribute roughly 1 5 to our sales growth so that s the one area we re currently evaluating i think as far as longer term we want to get through this evaluation then we ll talk further about that when we have our investor day later this year mike cieplak investor relations officer our next question is from chris o cull with stifel chris o cull stifel analyst my question is about value it sounds like everyday value will be necessary to improve the systems relative market share this year and i believe franchisees are only required to feature a few items on the d 1 2 3 value menu so how does the company convince franchisees to be more aggressive with everyday value given the cost pressures they re facing chris kempczinski president and chief executive officer yes i think it s not just everyday value that are is part of the equation there s also what we would call deal value which is sort of the post on and off type of value and so i think from our vantage point it s probably going to be more of the latter in terms of how do we smartly and in a disciplined way pulse deal value throughout the year on this and where are there opportunities for us to do it that in a way can drive both traffic and can protect margins so we ve been having a lot of conversations on that as you would imagine i m not going to telegraph on this call in terms of how we actually plan to go about it but i think back to a couple of the earlier points that we ve talked about here there is strong alignment with the owner operators the u s that we need to be in a situation where we re getting both transaction growth as well as check growth and so it s up to us now to deliver on it but i do think there s good alignment to it and it s probably going to come more through deal than it is necessarily everyday value i think we ve got a good everyday value platform embedded already mike cieplak investor relations officer our next question is from matt difrisco with guggenheim matt difrisco guggenheim analyst there s been some reports about you guys closing some stores in china i wonder i know you guys don t give specific guidance for the year but can you sort of at least help us understand how much exposure the mcd shareholders have to that market whether that s in a worldwide revenue or your operating income chris kempczinski president and chief executive officer sure yes well obviously the situation in china is fluid and it s concerning right now as you would expect our priority is really on our employees on our customers doing everything we can to make sure that they are safe and taken care of and so in that vein we ve been working a lot with the local authorities particularly in the hubei province we have closed all restaurants in the hubei province which is several hundred restaurants that have been closed but importantly we do still have about 3 000 restaurants in the country that are still open so several hundred closed but 3 000 that are still open we ve also with the china team we ve put in place an epidemic prevention and control task force which is something we re doing again in combination with the local authorities there and it s everything from using our kitchens to help provide meals to healthcare workers in hospitals we re doing things in terms of giving medical screening for customers who come to some of our restaurants so it s really an all hands on deck effort from that vantage point china for us is a critical strategic market but i think it s probably more because of the potential that we see in that market as opposed to its materiality to the business today just to put it in perspective when you think about china it does represent about 9 of our global restaurant count but it s about 4 to 5 of systemwide sales and it s only about 3 of op income and so while again china is a critical market for us and we re very concerned about the situation over there its actual impact on our business is going to be fairly small assuming again that it stays contained to china mike cieplak investor relations officer our next question is from sara sara senatore with bernstein sara sara senatore bernstein analyst a question and also a follow up please so just on the outlook for g a i think at the investor event last month and certainly you reiterated just now the sort of very case specific reason to make acquisitions but i mean how should we think about tech spend going forward i think the guidance for g a this year was a little bit higher than i would have expected i know some of that is the owner operator convention maybe you could quantify that but just from the perspective of should we be thinking about technology as a line item that grows faster going forward sort of in that mid single digit range more similar to labor than to other investments just trying to anticipate that and then the clarifying question was you talked about franchisees having record owner operator cash flow this year in the u s does that give you any more flexibility in terms of the value that you can address or are franchisees more looking to kind of protect that after having had a couple of years of declining cash flows kevin ozan executive vice president and chief financial officer all right i ll talk about the g a first and then i ll let chris come back and talk about value and the franchisees related to g a a couple of points we ve talked about how we ve gotten more efficient with our day to day g a and we re investing in technology and r d so things like dynamic yield and apprente and the things we re investing in are either top line drivers or cost saving potentials so that s how we think about kind of some of these specific investments we have decreased our overall g a as a percent of sales from around 2 8 in 2016 to 2 2 in 2019 and roughly today roughly more than 10 of that g a spend is actually depreciation and amortization related to technology spend so a chunk of that g a is noncash as it relates to prior year spend we do as you indicate we expect full year g a in 2020 to be up 5 to 7 in constant currency due to those investments but that s because i m lapping partial year on some of the acquisitions we now will have full year in 2020 so that level of increase we certainly do not expect going forward but as we ve talked about for 2020 or as i mentioned in my script first half of 2020 will be significantly higher growth rates than the second half of 2020 and then i guess the only other thing i d say is we re in the midst of updating all of our analysis and long term models also with the g a but so far we haven t seen anything that significantly changes any of our thinking on g a long term so we don t think about it any differently today than i did a couple of years ago but i do have obviously to your point we had an increase in 19 we have a little larger increase in 20 but certainly we don t expect that increase to be a run rate increase going forward chris kempczinski president and chief executive officer on the point about or question about franchisee cash flow it s exciting when you see the system set a record for franchisee cash flow and in 2019 in the u s they did so in kind of a resounding way i mean they blew through the prior cash flow record and surpassed that by probably another 50 000 or something like that so it s a really good thing when you have wealthy franchisees who are making a lot of money because it means that their mentality is to be aggressive to invest in the business now that can take a number of different forms that could take investments in the restaurant and some of the capital investments that we ve been doing it can take the form of putting more labor in the restaurants and it can take the form of value as you talking about so to me it s more about the point that our u s owner operators are in a really healthy spot right now i think that s also reflected in their sentiment and they want to keep it going and so that s going to require staying aggressive on the business and i m confident they re going to do that kevin ozan executive vice president and chief financial officer sorry sara the one other thing you asked about was convention and i forgot about that but convention our operator convention that we have every other year is roughly 25 million to 30 million mike cieplak investor relations officer our next question is from jeff bernstein with barclays jeff bernstein barclays analyst so the question as we think about the 2020 financial performance chris i know you mentioned you re starting the year strong from a top line perspective on the flip side i guess you re talking about maybe some elevated g a in the short term so i m just wondering how you think about that in relation to your thoughts on achieving your long term algorithm which is for high single digit eps growth i know you don t necessarily guide specifically to any one year but just wondering how you see that potentially playing out whether this is a year where we could expect some more normalized comparison to long term growth and within that that return of cash that you mentioned i know you finished your three year target i m just wondering whether going forward we should now just think of it as you re going to return all free cash in any one year versus perhaps giving a target for one or multiple years chris kempczinski president and chief executive officer yes thanks jeff let me hit it s a couple of different things let me first talk about 2020 if you do the math basically with all of the guidance we ve given hopefully you get to similar places where we are which is we do expect eps growth for 2020 to meet the high single digit target certainly a lower tax rate is helping that growth rate and as you mentioned it may not be even growth rates quarter by quarter through the year because of some of the individual quarter pressures but as we look at the full year we do have an expectation of being within that high single digit eps growth rate target for 2020 regarding cash return we re fortunate to generate a substantial amount of cash flow and be able to fund both the investments that we want to make in the business and still return a significant amount to shareholders as i mentioned in my remarks our free cash flow was 5 7 billion in 2019 which was up over 35 free cash flow conversion was around 95 as we had internal discussions and discussed with several of our large shareholders we decided not to give a specific dollar target over a three year period for cash return but there is but i do want to reiterate our capital allocation philosophy because there is no change to that as i mentioned the priorities remain the same first to reinvest in existing restaurants and opportunities to grow the business second to continue growing our dividend and third to buy back shares we do expect to continue to return all free cash flow to shareholders and in our modeling we anticipate net incremental debt of roughly 1 billion each year for the next few years so that should give you an idea of kind of where the cash return comes out to that thanks mike cieplak investor relations officer our next question is from chris carril with rbc chris carril rbc analyst so with so much attention focused on the morning daypart given the rollout of breakfast by a large competitor how do you assess the opportunity to strengthen your competitive position in the other dayparts as breakfast becomes more of a focus for the industry chris kempczinski president and chief executive officer yes i think as you look at our business and you think about our 2020 plan when i look at it there is a good balance i mean we certainly have i think a pretty strong breakfast plan we have a combination of menu news at breakfast we have some service things that we re really looking at driving at breakfast and then certainly we plan on remaining competitive from a value standpoint in breakfast but there s a lot of other things that we still have on the calendar and so if you think about a couple of years ago we talked about really focusing on food and it was going to be a focus on burger chicken and coffee and i think you re going to see for us in 2020 that there s going to be burger news there s going to be things that we re doing there that continue to keep driving our qpc business which really has been a standout performer for us the last couple of years obviously a lot of discussion about chicken don t want to get specifically into timing and what we would do there but we re committed to really updating it and competing in an aggressive way in the chicken segment so you should expect something there and then we do see opportunities as well around beverages desserts so as the year unfolds i think you ll see us staying strong on breakfast but it s not going to be at the expense of rest of day mike cieplak investor relations officer our next question is from dennis geiger with ubs dennis geiger ubs analyst just wondering if you could touch a bit more on operations and throughput and the opportunities there specific to drive thru times i think you touched on globally perhaps how that s been progressing so specifically in the u s maybe how much of an opportunity that is in 2020 and perhaps what part technology plays in improving the operations and those throughput times chris kempczinski president and chief executive officer sure well i think in the u s i m really pleased with the performance that the team put up in 2019 as we talked about in our comments we re at record customer satisfaction scores in the u s driven by operations and we re seeing it broad based across a number of ops metrics that we re looking at the team did a really nice job in 2019 speeding up our drive thrus we saw good performance there but i think what we re also excited about is we think there s more that we can do there we think that there s certainly 20 30 additional seconds that we want to go try to get in 2020 and it s a combination of activities it s a combination of menu simplification moves it s a combination of training and really making sure we have the right focus we re doing things to bring fun into the restaurant to create kind of that competitive rivalry there and then technology is a component to that i d say right now in 2020 i don t see technology necessarily being a huge part of what s going to be driving cash flow or driving speed of service rather we have zoom timers which is an internal thing that we use that really gives the team a very detailed breakdown of each kind of part of the customer journey as they go through the drive thrus we can be very pinpointed on how to drive speed of service but that s now deployed in most of our restaurants so i think in 2020 it s going to be a lot of blocking and tackling longer term we re obviously very excited about what technology can do to help with speed of service which is why we ve done acquisitions like we did with apprente if we re able to get that commercialized and deployed that s certainly going to be something that helps us with the speed of service in the future mike cieplak investor relations officer we have time for one more question from greg francfort of bank of america merrill lynch greg francfort bank america merrill lynch analyst this is kind of a two parter but just in terms of the check i know i might be beating a dead horse here but just can you quantify how much of that is spend per customer versus customers per ticket as we try to think about maybe framing up like 7 check is not actually that much on a per customer basis and then the other question i know you just touched on it on chicken and you don t want to get into timing of new launches but can you maybe talk about what your competitors are doing that mcdonald i guess i would think that there s nothing that mcdonald s couldn t replicate that your customers are doing is it a space constraint of getting new equipment is it getting the right flavors or is there something else that you re focused on in trying to improve the chicken quality kevin ozan executive vice president and chief financial officer so i ll cover the check real quick and then chris can talk about chicken a couple of things on check so roughly right now 60 of check is mix and 40 is pricing so and that s been relatively consistent i ll say throughout i think we probably said roughly 2 3 but it s in that range really throughout the year for 2019 we are seeing in general we re seeing a little bit higher customers per ticket if you think about the way the business is evolving between things like delivery and the kiosks we generally now have a little bit higher number of customers per ticket so that is a piece of it but even knowing that we have been able to grow guest counts in many of our international markets so i don t want to imply that that would say that we should be able to grow guest counts in the u s the dynamics are changing but we believe we can still grow guest counts even with those change in dynamics chris kempczinski president and chief executive officer and on your chicken question you re right we have a very detailed and intimate understanding of what our competitors are doing there i think for us it s really all about finding a product that works in our restaurants and so that has an operations component our menu as you know is much more broad than some of our competitors so that s something we need to be mindful of in terms of how what we might do in chicken what knock on effect that might have on the rest of menu from a speed of service and then there are some equipment differences in terms of the equipment that we have in our restaurants versus what some of our competitors would have what we ve been out testing we re in a test right now as you probably know but we re testing a number of different approaches in terms of not just what you might do from a product standpoint but are there things that we might want to do differently from an operations standpoint or are there things we might want to think about differently from an equipment standpoint so like anything with menu in mcdonald s it s a little bit of a rubik s cube of what s the customer looking for what works operationally and then the business fundamentals under that but i think i feel good about where we re going to net add on chicken i think we re getting close to having something that we re excited to bring to customers mike cieplak investor relations officer thank

measures derived from our condensed consolidated statements of earnings organic revenue growth non gaap operating earnings non gaap net earnings and non gaap net earnings per diluted share we define organic revenue growth as revenue growth less the impact of revenue growth from our ctsi and interventional solutions businesses and adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange we define non gaap operating earnings as operating earnings excluding amortization of intangible assets amortization of inventory step up acquisition and integration related expenses or benefits significant litigation charges or benefits and legal costs these measures are not presented in accordance with nor are they a substitute for u s generally accepted accounting principles or gaap in addition these measures may be different from non gaap measures used by other companies limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes the non gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non gaap financial measures as an analytical tool we have provided a reconciliation of each non gaap financial measure used in this earnings release to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure we have not provided a reconciliation of non gaap guidance measures to the corresponding gaap measures on a forward looking basis due to the potential significant variability and limited visibility of the excluded items discussed below we utilize a number of different financial measures both gaap and non gaap in analyzing and assessing the overall performance of our business in making operating decisions forecasting and planning for future periods and determining payments under compensation programs we consider the use of the non gaap measures to be helpful in assessing the performance of the ongoing operations of our business we believe that disclosing non gaap financial measures provides useful supplemental data that while not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap allows for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operational performance we also believe that disclosing non gaap financial measures provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies non gaap operating earnings and non gaap net earnings exclude the following items except for gain and losses on equity investments and significant non recurring tax expense or benefit which are only excluded from non gaap net earnings amortization of intangible assets and amortization of inventory step up we do not acquire businesses and assets on a predictable cycle the amount of purchase price allocated to intangible assets the step up of inventory values and the term of amortization can vary significantly and are unique to each acquisition or purchase we believe that excluding amortization of intangible assets and amortization of inventory step up allows the users of our financial statements to better review and understand the historic and current results of our operations and also facilitates comparisons to peer companies acquisition and integration related expenses or benefits we incur expenses or benefits with respect to certain items associated with our acquisitions such as transaction costs hedging gains and losses changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities gain or expense on settlement of pre existing relationships integration costs and breakup fees we exclude such expenses or benefits as they are related to acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operations of our on going business significant litigation charges or benefits and legal costs we may incur charges or benefits as well as legal costs from time to time related to litigation and other contingencies we exclude these charges or benefits when significant as well as legal costs associated with significant legal matters because we do not believe they are reflective of on going business and operating results gains and losses on equity investments we may incur gains and losses from our equity investments in privately held companies we do not trade equity investments and we do not plan on these investments for the funding of ongoing operations we exclude such gains and losses because we do not believe they are reflective of our core business significant non recurring tax expense or benefit we may incur a significant tax expense or benefit as a result of tax legislation and or a change in judgment about the need for a valuation allowance that are generally unrelated to the level of business activity in the period in which these tax effects are reported we exclude such expenses or benefits from our non gaap net earnings because we believe they do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our continuing business operations we apply our gaap consolidated effective tax rate to our non gaap financial measures other than when the underlying item has a materially different tax treatment the following tables reconcile gaap and non

launching tomorrow in abidjan the afdb s flagship african economic outlook 2020 the theme developing africa s workforce for the future a preview of unctad s illicit trade forum 3 4 february geneva the ustr will hold a hearing on thursday into south africa s intellectual property protection and enforcement regime selected submissions the sa government s lengthy submission will be presented by dti ddg xavier carrim dr evelyn masotja the submission will explain why the petition is misdirected in that the proposed law that is being objected to has not yet come into effect is not part of south african law and accordingly no clear and present damage is being suffered by any us firm as a result of legislative changes recall the existing legal position in relation to protection of intellectual property applicable in south africa including some challenges experienced with the existing framework that led to proposed changes to the law being developed set out briefly key points in the proposed legislation currently being reviewed by the presidency in south africa including the objections to aspects of the proposed changes raised by the iipa and why these do not constitute valid grounds for the removal of sa from the gsp benefits knowledge economy international ustr is not qualified to act as a global licensing agent protecting the mpaa and riaa interests in every national dispute over performer rights and the notion that countries have sovereignty and should make their own laws accountable to their own citizens should have some weight too in matters like this the provisions in the south africa law regarding fair use which is modeled after the u s statute should be welcomed by the ustr and not sanctioned the iipa asserts that the south africa exceptions are more liberal than permitted by the bern convention or the trips but do not suggest the ustr litigate these issues under the wto dispute settlement system preferring instead a situation where the ustr itself decides sean flynn infojustice there are no ground on which ustr could conclude that the copyright amendment bill if enacted into law violates the international three step test one particularly odd complaint is that south africa has adopted a mix of specific exceptions and a general fair use clause every country that has a fair use or fair dealing general exception also has a list of specific exceptions the various exceptions that the south africa bill adopts are framed in terms that commonly appear elsewhere for example the bill s exception for educational uses of excerpts for teaching can be found in roughly 70 of developing countries in latin america and africa download the full set of submissions on the south african angle to the hearings here south africa trade surplus for 2019 foreseen

push global goals forward on tuesday tijjani muhammad bande and mona juul the president of the un economic and social council ecosoc introduced a joint initiative to establish a high level panel on financial accountability transparency and integrity called facti it is critical that member states get behind the panel s work both substantively and financially he urged noting that in light of the decade of action it would help promote faster progress towards achieving the 2030 agenda on sustainable development he said the flow of illicit cash and goods on the international black market impacts every nation s ability to mobilize domestic resources moreover it is a cross border problem that requires inclusive multilateral action ms juul set out a timeline saying the panel would be launched in early march and its members to meet face to face at least four times in different regions of the world it is a tight schedule but we are aware of the urgency to address these issues she stated the panel will produce an interim report in july 2020 and its final report with recommendations in january 2021 african logistics time for revolution african ceo forum the modernization of african logistics is one of the most important areas of development on the continent today despite the progress achieved over the past 15 years particularly in the field of ports which handle 90 of the continent s trade the sector remains insufficiently competitive and modern to support industrialization and african economic integration china s investment in logistics is 23 times greater than that

africa ceo forum in partnership with okan has published an exclusive report which makes pragmatic recommendations to accelerate a real revolution in the african logistics sector the report draws on case studies of several african success stories and examines the many challenges that are holding back the sector to formulate these recommendations for the benefit of investors and entrepreneurs six recommendations speed up port modernization create essential ports of call on the continent think as a bloc develop intra african logistics around multimodal corridors strengthen states capacities as

to 458 631 tonnes compared with 284 169 the previous year the decline was attributed to poor performance of cane overall sugar imports in january december 2019 totalled 458 631 tonnes against 284 169 tonnes in the same period last year attributed to a significant increase in table sugar imports in this year to bridge the rising domestic demand against the declining local production says the report

trump vs cortez clash of the titans in the decades that i have been listening to politicians clumsily trying to explain the economy there has never been a period with the possible exception of the early reagan years in which major party leaders were able to present a solid grasp of economic principles but i have never seen a time in which the levels of ignorance coming from those in leadership positions is so extreme the state of affairs can be illustrated by two interviews last week by donald trump and alexandria ocasio cortez for the democrats the two undisputed leaders of our major political parties both put forth visions this week that are illogical incoherent and that completely ignore both data and experience but these leaders are putting out beacons under which the vast majority of americans are congregating it s worse than the blind leading the blind and it bodes very poorly for our ability to deal with the next economic crisis which i believe is certainly slouching towards washington waiting to be born before i get into particulars let s dispense with the notion that aoc does not speak for the democrats she is the leader of the progressives and the progressives are in control the recent dust up between elizabeth warren and bernie sanders shows how far the moderate wing of the party has fallen while it may be true that warren is just as far left as sanders the democrat establishment is more comfortable with her as they know she would be willing to fake moderation and to tack toward the center if she wins the nomination on the other hand sanders has been an unrepentant communist his entire life and is unlikely to alter that message one iota if he faces trump in the fall in a 1981 today show interview sanders stated clearly that he does not support the capitalist idea of competition and that people work better under a cooperative system in other words he believes in the absurd marxist proposition that people are just as likely to work for the benefit of strangers than they would for themselves establishment democrats fear that trump will win that contest going away so they are in full panic last week they took the gloves off it began with warren s calculated allegations that sanders in a private conversation between the two had claimed that a woman could not be elected president the allegation was pressed by establishment allies at cnn through supportive commentaries and stilted questioning at the cnn sponsored debate leading pundits fell in line behind warren with an awkward twist on the believe all women mantra of the me too movement they painted sanders as out of touch at best and sexist at worst the next anti bernie attack came a few days later when hillary clinton let loose calling him unlikable and ineffective she even failed to commit to endorsing him if he were to win the nomination j easley a parnes the hill 1 22 20 this simply made hillary look like a more corrupt and opportunistic figure than many democratic activists previously thought but these attacks failed spectacularly and simply deepened mistrust about the clinton wing of the party and reaffirmed warren s reputation as an opportunist despite the full court press the warren campaign is now in free fall and the sanders campaign is surging the establishment is left hoping that doddery joe biden can somehow revivify over the next 10 months and escape any contamination from the ukraine affair but no one who is not receiving a paycheck from the dnc really believes this it s no accident that a major poll this week showed biden trailing sanders for the first time nationally and while bernie has now emerged as the soul of democrats everyone knows that he is not the party s future that honor is increasingly falling on his young and telegenic protégé from the bronx who would be running for president right now if she had enough candles on her cake to constitutionally qualify she will be eligible in 2024 for all his leftist authenticity sanders is also an old white man a trio of sins that modern woke progressives have a hard time forgiving on the other hand alexandria ocasio cortez is the fulfillment of their wish list she s ethnic young female and sees the united states as a notably racist sexist and tyrannical country that continues to be a slave state for its own citizens and an oppressor to the rest of the world and despite the fact that her resume is thin enough to be written on half a napkin she is bold enough to challenge the most senior members of her own party without paying the slightest price politically those in the establishment dare not cross her and her statements no matter how absurd they are treated as wisdom from the burning bush in that sense she looms over the democrats much the way that trump looms over the gop as absurd as it may sound there are remarkable similarities between the appeal of trump and aoc both are political outsiders who use social media fueled demagoguery to appeal directly to the people and are largely contemptuous of party establishments both shoot from the hip and spin stories that are completely unrelated to history or economic reality so with that preamble let s see what these two economic luminaries are now saying on january 22 in a sit down at the world economic forum in davos with cnbc s reliably pro trump anchor joe kernan the president delivered a self congratulatory turn that was brazen by even trump s legendary standards with a series of wildly inaccurate statements and i m not just talking about his idea that thomas edison invented the wheel trump claimed that the u s economy is now experiencing unprecedented economic growth that the world has never seen before this statement is absurd on its face in his first three years in office the u s economy has expanded at about 2 6 annually based on gdp statistics from frb st louis while this is just slightly higher than the growth seen in obama s second term which president trump described in his inaugural address as american carnage it is strikingly lower than the average growth rate we have had over the last 90 years based on gdp data from the u s bureau of economic analysis bea there are also many three or four year periods in our history in which gdp growth was multiples higher than the current growth rate and that doesn t even address the growth rates that have been seen in recent history in asian countries for much of the past 20 years chinese growth has been north of 8 annually does he not know that trump claimed that during his term in office the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by 47 i don t know where he got this statistic i have looked but i can t find it but it does not pass the smell test median wage in the u s is about 63 000 u s census bureau 2018 the bottom half of earners must earn less than that by definition people making that kind of money often have little to no assets or savings what savings they may have are usually more than compensated by household debt what factors would have resulted in a near 50 expansion of their net worth trump simply may be assuming that the 50 growth in the stock market since his election has created similar growth patterns in the broader economy but that is not the case at all as proof of economic success trump noted that for the first time there are more women in the workforce than men according to data from the u s labor department but what does that prove perhaps it points to the contraction of those sectors that have typically employed more men such as manufacturing and construction while the service sector jobs in education and health care which typically employ more women have been expanding this reality is in stark contrast to trump s typical boast that his policies have led to a boom in domestic manufacturing manufacturing jobs have declined consistently during his presidency trump also spent a lot of time with kernan talking about his opposition to interest rate increases or attempts to shrink the fed s balance sheet and his desire for negative interest rates showing no understanding of why debt is a drag on growth or why high rates would be good for the economy trump believes that negative rates would boost the stock market further and help the country pay off the debt in reality negative rates would only make it easier for the government to borrow more he then repeated the rhetorical question he asked at the signing ceremony for the phase 1 china deal regarding just who is dumb enough to buy negative yielding bonds the obvious answer that somehow eludes the president is central banks so trump wants the fed to be dumb so that he can look smart and keep pretending the economy is booming this then led to a discussion about trump s plan to tackle the growing deficits which in the first three years of his presidency are significantly higher than in obama s second term kernan asked if trump would favor relying more on tax increases or spending cuts to achieve that objective trump replied that he would do neither and that additional tax cuts in his second term would solve the problem it mattered little to trump that the tax cuts in his first term led to much larger deficits trump then went on to claim that he favors a strong dollar but immediately followed up on how great it would be for the economy if the dollar gets weaker instead ironically i think trump s wish will be granted but i suspect a weaker dollar will not deliver the benefits trump is hoping for it will push up interest rates and consumer prices and prick the bubble that trump so proudly claims constitutes the greatest economic boom in history for her part alexandria ocasio cortez sat down in nyc for a martin luther king day event with an equally sympathetic questioner ta nehisi coates the black author and activist in their extraordinary exchange aoc gave her clearest view to date of her absolute opposition to capitalism business ownership and economic freedom and her clear support for state seizure of wealth and the control of the means of production in other words she went full throated bolshevik the sad part is that unlike her mentor benie sanders aoc probably never studied anything about the russian revolution and its subsequent evils and failures while it s true that she only lived for 11 years in the 20th century i would have hoped that it would have come up once or twice in her history or economics classes at boston university but she behaves as if she is completely unaware of anything that happened before the 2016 election in her interview with coates aoc offered further development of the controversial you didn t build that claim made by barack obama in which the former president claimed that american business only succeed because of investments the government makes in education and infrastructure and while that statement is widely off the mark it s nothing compared to aoc s comment that in america no one ever makes a billion dollars you take a billion dollars her theory is rooted in marxist theories of labor which assumes that workers produce all the value of a company s products and services while owners simply sit on the couch and count the profits she sees profits coming solely from worker exploitation and that private ownership of capital is a modern version of slavery when asked how a billionaire entrepreneur like jeff bezos could regain his status as a moral person aoc says that the answer is simple turn your company into a worker cooperative of course aoc never delineated a threshold by which an owner of a company becomes an evil bloodsucker we know that she would apply that label to a billionaire with 1 000 employees but how about a less successful entrepreneur with only 100 employees and 10m net worth how about a store owner with 10 employees and 1m in the bank is it only the scale that makes the billionaire immoral who decides when that line is crossed clearly aoc s experience taking classes at boston university and mixing drinks in new york provide her with that expertise aoc claims that she wants to democratically transform the u s economy so that we finally give power to the people but what she really wants to do is to take the power the people already have and give it to the government instead aoc does not realize that capitalism empowers workers to decide where they want to work where they want to live and how they spend their money the entire system is based on the process of getting consumers more of what they want for less money jeff bezos became a billionaire because he made shopping easier for hundreds of millions of people collectively the world has benefitted more than bezos from his innovations aoc wants to replace the free market with a command economy where decisions are made by coercion rather than choice she further described capitalism as a fleeting and outmoded economic model she argues that a worker collective in which the workers themselves own the companies they work for is a better model she does not seem to realize that such structures are perfectly legal in the u s and that business partnerships happen all the time however she does not grasp how those structures become unworkable at large scale as executive authority is critical to making the decisions that keep a company alive she also does not understand that the vast majority of workers do not want to be business owners that requires sacrifices and risks that they are unwilling to assume business owners don t just lie back on a couch as she imagines they often put in far more hours than their paid employees workers want the security of a steady paycheck something business owners forego they also don t want to risk their savings on a business venture that may fail workers at any business are free to quit and join together to form their own cooperatives but few are willing to take the chance aoc s solution is to let someone else take the chance make the sacrifices and do all the work and then if they succeed employees can use their votes and the power of the state to steal the business apart from the immorality of legalized theft history shows that once confiscated successful businesses are quickly run into the ground if aoc knew anything about history she would be familiar with the mass experiments in socialization that have come to ruin and misery in the recent past she is similarly blind to the enormous strides in living standards that the developing world has made in recent years by embracing capitalism and rejecting socialism and of course she fails to understand the history of her own country which owes its prosperity to the system she despises so that s what this has come to clash of the titans two people whose collective ignorance of economics is staggering to behold vie for the soul of the country lord help us unfortunately i think a worst case scenario may be the most likely one and it goes something like this disarray in the democrat party allows for the nomination of bernie sanders who loses to trump in the general election but then the danger arises trump and the republicans could not have taken credit more forcefully for the current economy when the current bubble pops during trump s second term there will be no way for them to avoid the blame the more we cling to the ridiculous idea that the current economy is booming because of trump the more we create the conditions for bernie sanders and aoc to make us the next venezuela unfortunately i

it is easy to overreact to the chinese coronavirus recently a new coronavirus has been causing many illnesses and deaths the virus first became active in wuhan china but it has already spread to the rest of china scattered cases have been identified around the rest of the world as well there are two important questions that are already being encountered how much of an attempt should be made to limit the spread of the new virus for example should businesses close to prevent the spread of the virus should this disease be publicized as being far worse than flu viruses that circulate each year and cause many deaths among the elderly and people in poor health the median age of those dying from the new coronavirus seems to be about 75 unfortunately there aren t easy answers we can easily see the likely outcome of under reaction more people might die of the disease more people might find themselves out of work for a couple of weeks or more with the illness we tend to be especially concerned about ourselves and our own relatives the thing that is harder to see is that reacting too vigorously can have a hugely detrimental impact on the world economy the world economy depends on international trade and tourism china plays a key role in the world economy quarantines of whole regions that last for weeks and months can have a very detrimental impact on the wages of people in the area and profits of local companies problems with debt can be expected to spike the greater the reaction to the coronavirus the more likely the world economy will be pushed toward recession and job loss the following are a few of my thoughts regarding possible overreaction the chinese coronavirus seems to be extremely contagious even before a person who has been exposed shows any symptoms the only way we can be certain to contain the virus seems to be through quarantines lasting up to 14 days china s national health minister ma xiaowei has provided information that seems quite alarming with the new virus a person may become communicable shortly after he she has been infected but symptoms may not appear for up to 14 days this allows the infected person to infect many others without realizing that he she is a carrier for the disease today the united states and many other countries screen for the virus by checking passengers arriving on planes from affected areas for fevers given the information provided by china s national health minister this approach seems unlikely to be sufficient to catch all of the people who may eventually come down with the disease if a country really wants to identify all the potential carriers of the disease it appears that a 14 day quarantine for all travelers from infected areas may be needed such a quarantine becomes administratively difficult to handle for the huge number of people who are likely to travel from china such a quarantine would make it impossible for pilots and other airline workers to make a living for example they would be spending too much of their time in quarantine to do the work needed to support themselves and their families a related concern is that person to person transmission is very easy with the chinese coronavirus we don t know for certain how many people each infected individual infects but one estimate is that each infected person transmits the disease to an average of 2 5 other people with this transmission rate the number of people having the disease can be expected to grow exponentially perhaps for several months based on these concerns it seems to me that funds spent on trying to contain the coronavirus are likely to be largely wasted the new chinese virus will spread widely regardless of attempts to contain it at most quarantines will slightly slow the transmission of the disease at the same time quarantines will be quite disruptive of commerce they will tend to reduce both total wages and total output of goods and services of the area deaths from pathogens are part of the natural cycle they help prune back the population of the old and weak we know that in ecosystems one of the functions of naturally occurring fires is to clear out deadwood to allow healthy new growth to occur in fact some types of seeds seem to require smoke for germination when inadequate natural burning takes place bushfires as seen in australia and forest fires as seen in california become an increasing problem deaths from pathogens seem to play a similar role in human economies this is especially the case with pathogens that especially target the weak and old most flu viruses have this characteristic early reports of deaths from the coronavirus suggest that this same pattern of targeting the old and weak is occurring with this virus as well as noted above the median age of those dying from the new coronavirus seems to be about 75 years since the 1940s modern medicine has been able to develop antibiotics and vaccines to counteract the impact of many pathogens this of course makes citizens happy but it has the disadvantage of changing the population in a way that leaves the economy with a much higher percentage of elderly people and others in poor health this higher level of elderly and medically needy people makes it easy for viruses and other pathogens to make their rounds just as leaving deadwood on the forest floor makes it easier for fires to spread with this rising population of people who cannot support themselves tax rates for the remaining citizens tend to become very high young workers may become discouraged because they do not have enough income remaining after paying taxes to raise their own families in effect they cannot support both their young families and the many old people viewed from this unusual perspective the operation of the chinese coronavirus might even be considered a benefit to society as a whole the world has overcome the impact of measles typhoid polio and many other diseases in some sense it needs a new disease added to its portfolio to replace the ones that have been mostly taken care of by modern medicine in this way pensions and other payments targeting the old and weak don t become too great a burden on the young if the chinese coronavirus were simply allowed to run its course without publicity that it was in any way unusual somewhat less than 1 of the world s population might be expected to die to see what would happen if the chinese coronavirus were to run its course we might look at what happened with the spanish flu back in 1918 at that time doctors did not have a way of treating the virus and authorities downplayed concern for the disease the us center for disease control reports that 500 million people or one third of the world s population became infected at least 50 million people about 10 of those infected died we don t yet know with accuracy how many of those infected will die from the current virus a recent estimate is that about 2 3 of those who are infected will die of the disease based on 107 dying out of 4 600 infected if we assume that the percentage of the population that will ultimately catch the new virus is 30 then the share of the world s population that would be expected to die would be about the un estimates that the world s population can be expected to grow by about 1 05 in 2020 if this is the case the effect of the chinese virus would be to sharply dampen the population increase for the year instead of population rising by 1 05 it would rise by only 0 29 1 05 0 76 assuming all of the deaths associated with the chinese coronavirus take place within a year while this would be a change it would be fairly small temporary change all of these deaths would be tragic for the families involved but in a way they would be less of a problem than the deaths that took place back in 1918 at that time mortality was high for healthy 20 to 40 year olds making the flu particularly disruptive for families the total percentage of the population that died was also much higher about 3 instead of 0 76 a major danger of the virus seems to be one of overreaction today s world economy is fragile china like other countries has a large amount of debt debt defaults related to poor profits of companies closing their operations for a time and workers losing income could easily skyrocket closing down transportation from china would risk pushing the world economy into a very bad recession in fact simply having a very large number of people out sick from work would be expected to have an adverse impact on the economy spending a large amount of money on hospitalizations and face masks cannot compensate for the loss of productivity of the rest of the economy thus the tendency would be toward recession in china even if no action toward cutting off travel were taken china is a huge supplier of goods to the rest of the world in fact in 2016 it used more energy in producing industrial output than the united states india russia and japan combined china s economy has been growing very rapidly since 1990 figure 2 shows this one way in gdp comparisons using inflation adjusted us dollars figure 3 is similar to figure 2 except the growth comparison is made in 2011 purchasing power parity international dollars this adjustment is made because typically the currencies of less developed nations float far below the dollar in terms of what the local currency will buy the inflation adjusted ppp comparison compares output on a basis that is expected to be more consistent with what the local currency will really purchase on this ppp basis china s gdp surpassed the us s gdp in 2014 figure 3 also shows that the united states has slipped from about 20 of the world s gdp to about 15 on this basis we cannot simply cut off trade with china regardless of how bad the situation is china is too big and too important now the rest of the world desperately needs goods and services produced in china in spite of what is going wrong from an illness perspective china plays too key a role in supply chains of many kinds for the country to be left out even cutting off tourism becomes a problem the share of china s revenue from tourism amounted to 11 in 2018 while not all of this would drop off even a dip would lead to lower employment in this part of its economy jet fuel use would drop as well a particular problem today is low prices for many commodities including oil and other fossil fuels these prices are likely to fall further if china s economy falters further we used to hear that the world would run out of oil and that oil prices would rise very high in fact if the people who were concerned about the issue had studied history they would have figured out that a far more likely outcome would be collapse in such a situation prices of many commodities might fall too low revelation 18 11 13 provides a list of a number of commodities including humans sold as slaves for which prices dropped very low at the time of the collapse of ancient babylon the problem is a different squeeze than a high price squeeze it is more of a growing wage disparity problem with fewer and fewer of the world s workers being able to afford the goods and services made by the world economy this problem feeds back to commodity prices that fall too low for producers of many types the problem is an affordability issue rather than one of running out i have written about this issue many times prices of fossil fuels have been low for a very long time essentially since late 2014 opec has cut back its oil production because of low oil prices several us natural gas producers have taken big write offs on natural gas investments china s coal production has remained below its 2013 level because of low prices if china finds it necessary to cut back on production of goods and services for any reason excessive sickness within china visitors aren t traveling to china tariffs customers around the world aren t buying cars this reduction in output would be likely to further lower the prices of commodities more producers would go bankrupt countries exporting products as diverse as oil iron ore copper and lithium might have economic difficulties lower fossil fuel prices may lead to a cutback in their output but it is doubtful that this cutback would be offset by an increase in the production of renewables falling fossil fuel prices would make the price comparison of renewables to fossil fuels look even worse than it does today china has cut back on its subsidies for solar panels and this has led to decreasing chinese solar installations in both 2018 and 2019 the best approach might just be to let the chinese coronavirus run its course authorities might also discourage stories about how awful the illness is today we seem to think that we can fix all problems unfortunately this medical problem doesn t seem to be fixable in the near term we should probably do as governments through the ages have done which is not very much we should not publicize the disease as being a whole lot worse than flu viruses in general for example we should certainly look for inexpensive treatments for the disease for example there seems to be an effort to examine the possibility of using existing antiviral drugs as a treatment it seems like an effort could be made to look into ways of treating the disease at home perhaps using supplemental oxygen for a period in time perhaps a vaccine can be developed individuals around the world should be encouraged to get themselves in as good health as possible so that their own immune systems can fight off pathogens of all types not just this particular virus common sense should be used in washing hands and in avoiding being with sick people i doubt that it makes sense to encourage the use of masks goggles and other protective devices we as individuals cannot live forever on this earth we also cannot spend an unlimited percentage of gdp on health care it becomes too high cost for most citizens at some point we need to call a halt to the expectation that we can fix all problems we live in a world with limited resources we need to start lowering our expectations if we don t want to make our problems worse our finite world

earnings release available in the investor relations section of our website i will now turn the call over to dave david heinzmann president and chief executive officer thank you trisha good morning and thanks for joining us today before continuing i d like to first mention the top of mind for us is our for our company is the safety health and well being of our global associates their families and communities given the coronavirus outbreak in china our first priority is to our people we ve taken proactive measures to protect our people and will continue to take necessary actions in addition our global business continuity teams are closely monitoring the situation to limit disruption to customers now i will provide an update on the performance of our company littelfuse navigated a challenging macro environment in 2019 while our global teams remain focused on driving long term growth profitability and cash generation we actively managed costs to align the business conditions while advancing several strategic initiatives across transportation industrial and electronics end markets we serve demonstrating our ability to balance short term cost containment with long term strategic investments our fourth quarter performance was consistent with our expectations we recorded fourth quarter sales of 339 million and we delivered adjusted eps of 1 17 at the high end of our guidance for the full year we recorded sales of 1 5 billion and achieved an adjusted ebitda margin of 20 our disciplined cost management actions help mitigate the impact of the soft demand and channel inventory corrections to deliver adjusted eps of 6 82 we generated 183 million in free cash flow representing a 132 conversion from net income exceeding our 100 target we returned 140 million of our free cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases this deployment of capital during a period of soft demand reinforces the strength of our balance sheet confirms our commitment to deliver ongoing value to our stakeholders since late in 2018 we have seen a volatile global economic environment impacting the end markets that we serve in response to uncertain demand electronics channel partners and end customers have been rebalancing inventory and automotive manufacturers have lowered production these conditions impacted volumes within our electronics and automotive segments during 2019 across our electronics product segment our fourth quarter sales were generally in line with our expectations during the quarter we continue to see inventory destocking with distribution ems and oem partners as end market demand appeared to bottom as a result inventory levels in the electronics channel dropped meaningfully and are now approaching the mid point of the normal range and our electronics book to bill exiting in the fourth quarter was above 1 0 these improvements suggest that sell into distribution should begin to align with sell through by the end of the first quarter and we expect modest sequential recovery through 2020 our deep strategic relationships with our channel partners remain a significant factor at our long term best across our electronics product segment and we view our distribution partners as an extension of our global sales teams while this exposes us the greater sales volatility given more than 75 of sales in this segment are fulfilled through distribution these valuable relationships jointly drive demand in customer partnership and profitable growth as we execute our strategy and serve more than 100 000 end customers every quarter fourth quarter sales from our automotive product segment were also generally in line with our expectations sales levels continue to reflect an ongoing global car build decline which was down mid single digits compared to last year our passenger car fuse business which was impacted by the gm strike outperformed the global car build due to increasing content related to the electrification of vehicles this growth was offset by customer program delays in our sensor business and softness in our commercial vehicle business as we work through this period of soft end market demand we continue to focus on profitability improvement for the automotive product segment we made significant progress this year and achieved double digit operating margins during the quarter and for the full year later meenal will provide an update on our momentum we expect first quarter global car production to be down low single digit and for the full year 2020 we expect global car production to be modestly down our industrial products segment continues to deliver strong performance in the fourth quarter we exceeded end market growth and achieved organic growth of 7 we also achieved an operating margin of 22 above recent performance these results were driven by our continued operational execution and strength across a broad range of industrial applications including renewable energy and power conversion we are confident this business will continue to drive long term profitable growth during 2019 we executed several strategic initiatives we secured key design wins in electric vehicles solar energy storage motor drives telecom and data centers across our target end markets we continued integration activities across our semiconductor business and broke ground on a new facility that will expand our capabilities as a testament to our global execution oriented culture we earned the association for manufacturing excellence award for the fourth consecutive year operational excellence remains the foundation of our strong business fundamentals when developing our five year growth strategy we contemplated and expected a period of soft demand and experienced this in 2019 we are confident that the secular themes of safety resource efficiency and the ever increasing connected world remain key long term drivers of our above market growth targets strategic m a remains a key enabler of our growth strategy we remain disciplined closely examining fit to ensure opportunities aligned with our m a criteria of core consolidation technology or platform building geographic expansion and end market access during this past year we undertook several actions to optimize our cost structure and made investments to expand our worldwide capabilities and embarked and are embarking on others during 2020 these actions will position our company for profitable growth through the course of 2020 and thereafter our leading technologies global footprint close customer relationships and talented associates against the backdrop of strong secular trends will help drive the long term growth of our business with that introduction i will turn the call over to meenal who will provide additional color on the financial results meenal a sethna executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks dave now some highlights from our fourth quarter of 2019 we finished the year with fourth quarter sales of 339 million down 16 on a reported basis over last year and down 14 organically sales were in line with our guidance reflecting ongoing end market challenges across our electronics product segment our sales decline continued to reflect ongoing channel and end customer inventory reductions as expected automotive product sales were impacted by continued global auto production declines delay in auto sensor programs and softness in commercial vehicle end markets our industrial product segment grew 7 continuing its above market growth trajectory foreign exchange also reduced our sales growth of 1 over last year due to the weaker euro fourth quarter gaap diluted eps was 0 92 adjusted diluted eps of 1 17 for the quarter was at the high end of our guidance range benefits from a lower than expected tax rate contributed 0 11 of eps partially offset by 0 06 of unfavorability from foreign exchange outside of these we essentially finished at the midpoint of our guidance range gaap operating margins were 9 5 with adjusted operating margins of 10 7 adjusted margins finished slightly below our expectations as foreign exchange was a 50 basis point headwind versus our guidance lower volumes and associated leverage across the electronics product segment had the biggest impact to margins both year over year and sequentially as sales in the quarter were the lowest we ve seen in two years for the full year 2019 sales finished at 1 5 billion declining 13 overall and down a 11 organically this was our first sales decline in 10 years led by numerous macro factors impacting end market demand coupled with inventory destocking across our channels and end customers gaap diluted eps finished at 5 60 and adjusted diluted eps was 6 82 for the year gaap operating margins were 12 8 and adjusted operating margins finished at 14 3 we mitigated our margin decline versus 2018 with 50 million in cost reductions during the year split between reductions in variable and ongoing operating expenses for the year our gaap effective tax rate was 16 2 and our adjusted rate was 16 7 our tax rate favorability versus our forecast was largely due to certain discrete items and adjustments related to additional regulatory update in the us tax act now let me provide some additional highlights by segment for the fourth quarter and full year electronics product segment operating margins for the quarter were 8 8 and 15 1 for the year as we ve discussed through the year sales decline coupled with associated volume leverage was the main driver of margin reduction versus last year we moderated the impact of topline decline with both cost restructuring and synergies from our ixys acquisition across both gross margin and operating expenses as we start to see a return in sales growth we expect to see a commensurate improvement in our segment operating margin automotive product segment operating margins finished at 11 5 and 10 9 for the quarter and the year respectively we are seeing the benefits of the cost reduction activities we undertook in the past several quarters as margins continue to improve through the year this improvement more than offset foreign exchange headwinds which reduced 2019 operating margins by 200 basis points versus last year we have initiated additional activities that will drive further cost reductions with saving started in the starting in the back half of this year this will continue our path back to target operating margins in the mid teens for the segment our industrial products segment achieved a 22 4 and 19 6 operating margin for the quarter and full year respectively above market organic growth coupled with cost reduction activities we ve undertaken over the past few years have led to best in class margins for the segment moving on to cash flow we generated 61 million during the quarter and 183 million in free cash flow for the year resulting in a free cash conversion of 132 our strong finish with the combination of our ongoing focus on working capital optimization and deferral of certain capital earmarked for capacity expansion in light of the 2019 demand environment we maintained the strength of our capital structure and remain well positioned to achieve our dual strategy of accelerated organic growth coupled with strategic acquisitions during the year we repatriated over 200 million in cash back to the us we finished the year with 531 million of cash on hand with net debt leverage well under 1 0 time we took advantage of the market volatility buying back 95 million in shares this year at an average price of 164 per share for the year we returned 140 million to our shareholders via share repurchases and dividends and with that i ll turn it back to dave for more color on business performance and end market trends david heinzmann president and chief executive officer thanks meenal now i will provide commentary on the key end markets we serve beginning with transportation development of advanced driver assistance systems or adas continues to outpace expectations enhancements beyond level two on the near term horizon bring significant upside for content opportunities increasing global safety efficiency and connectivity requirements are propelling in electrical architecture revolution and cockpit transformation key factors for growth in automotive electronics and electrical systems in the fourth quarter we had strategic design wins across a wide range of applications in all regions in the electric vehicle space we won new business to protect battery systems and on vehicle chargers for manufacturers in europe and japan the planned launch of nearly 30 new electric vehicle models in 2020 with a broad range of automotive manufacturers where we are designed in remains a positive for our content opportunities our product quality and strong customer relationships help to secure a new circuit protection wins in japan and korea including design wins to protect window lift motors and power seat motors we won new power semiconductor business in india for ignition systems for two and three wheel vehicles with our excellent engineering support customer responsiveness and reputation for quality and reliability we had several key wins in china and europe across our automotive sensor portfolio from solar speed and position sensors the fluid level sensors turning to commercial vehicles during the fourth quarter we continued to see soft demand across most of our end markets and geographies versus last year we expect these conditions to persist through the majority of 2020 as the north american heavy duty truck market continues to come off of peak revenue and build rates slow in agriculture and construction our commercial vehicle business continues its push to expand beyond north america with key design wins in all three regions and across diverse end markets our product performance and durability helped win business with the european truck maker in china a strong customer relationship helped us secure new volume with a manufacturer of buses and in north america we continued our recent success with vehicle up fitters this time providing our configurable off the shelf solution we re a manufacturer of walk in vans and truck bodies used in package delivery operations with our ongoing strategic execution and strong funnel of global opportunities we are well positioned for long term content growth across transportation end markets across the majority of our industrial end markets we are seeing an increased demand for industrial protection and safety an evolution that requires higher power electrical protection and power conversion this transformation affords us the opportunity to deliver differentiated value by positioning our application engineers in front of customers leveraging our technical expertise to meet the evolving specifications of these applications during the quarter we continue to see good design win activity for solar projects with wins in north america and europe energy storage continues to deliver growth as we secured new design wins in korea we secured wins in north america for temperature sensor assemblies for use in a factory automation application as well as automated industrial hvac systems in addition we captured new business in north america and asia with a manufacturer of commercial test and measurement equipment we won new power semiconductor business with the key european manufacturer of industrial motor drives for pumps and compressors conveyors and manufacturing tool positioning systems we also increased our power semiconductor footprint and other industrial motor drive applications by winning additional business on a number of platforms with existing leading industrial manufacturers looking ahead this year we expect us non residential construction to be flat oil and gas precious metal mining motor drive and power conversion markets to grow low single digits and renewable energy markets to grow double digits as a trusted partner to our customers we see the expanded need for a full range of product technologies increasing across the industrial end markets as a result the business opportunity funnel is robust and we continue to invest to expand our addressable market to gain share with new and existing customers lastly across electronics end markets we continue to see good design win activity for a range of applications our circuit protection power control and sensing products are found in many electronics end markets applications are becoming increasingly connected and generate more and more data that require faster speeds and greater data storage providing great opportunities in telecom and cloud infrastructure ecosystems during the fourth quarter we saw strong wins for our circuit protection offerings as well as our power semiconductors products across data center applications as well as 4g and 5g base stations we won battery protection business for consumer electronics in korea and we secured new design wins in building and home automation driven by our close customer relationships and responsiveness of our field engineering teams we also delivered sensor solutions for use in smart connected home security systems in north america as well as the smart meter application in china the continued secular themes of smarter and more connected devices are driving demand for our products design activity is robust with programs launching on time we introduced a number of new products during 2018 and 2019 which were designed in a new programs with our customers with stabilizing end market demand we are seeing a pickup up of these programs in 2020 which we expect to bring additional growth our electronics business fundamentals are solid we look forward to capitalizing on improving demand by leveraging our broad product offerings and our strategic distributor relationships with far reaching access into diverse end market with that i ll turn the call over to meenal to talk about guidance meenal a sethna executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks dave now let me start with impacts that we are currently seeing from the coronavirus outbreak we are closely monitoring updates from local authorities as the potential business interruption impacts are still evolving local china authorities have extended the new year holidays one week at our production site additional impacts could include extended production stoppages staffing shortages as well as supplier and customer implications we have incorporated the cost impact of the longer new year holiday within our guidance outside of this both our first quarter and our full year forecast assume business as usual as this is a fluid situation we are not able to quantify further potential impacts to our forecast at this time now moving on to the first quarter of 2020 we expect sales of 352 million to 364 million versus last year the midpoint reflects 12 decline in total sales and an 11 organic sales decline we estimate foreign exchange to be about 1 headwind versus last year first quarter adjusted diluted eps is expected to be in the range of 1 21 to 1 35 this assumes an adjusted effective tax rate in the range of 18 5 to 19 5 for the quarter notably our guidance mid point reflects sequential improvement with 6 sales growth 9 eps growth and adjusted operating margin expansion our growth is dampened by an eps headwind of about 0 15 stemming from both foreign exchange and a higher tax rate excluding these items sequential eps growth would be 23 for the quarter we re estimating global car build to be down in the low single digits across our electronics product segment our book to bill is running above 1 0 we believe the majority of excess channel and oem inventory has been depleted and expect the remaining to burn through over the next few months now let me provide some additional guidance for the full year based on the current macroeconomic conditions we are forecasting to grow 2020 sales in the low single digits over last year our phasing assumes a sales decline in the first half of 2020 with growth returning in the back half of 2020 i ll add some color on our end market assumptions we expect channel and oem inventories will align to normalized levels over the next quarter we anticipate global car build to be down low single digits for the year and commercial vehicle end markets to be soft for most of this year however we do expect content growth to enable us to outperform the weaker transportation end markets we expect to see year over year operating margin expansion and leverage eps growth that dampened versus our typical levels due to a few items we have additional manufacturing and supply chain footprint actions slated for 2020 and we will communicate these new programs during the year overall we expect transition costs to reduce our eps by 0 30 to 0 35 this year with savings from these projects as well as the prior ixys footprint and synergy projects we ve discussed to begin in 2021 the combination of a higher tax rate and stronger currencies versus the us dollar generate a year over year eps headwind of approximately 0 20 we are projecting a 2020 tax rate range of 17 to 19 we are estimating 22 million in interest expense and amortization expense of 40 million for the year and we ve assumed 24 7 million for our full year share count we expect to spend 80 million to 85 million in capital expenditures for the year this elevated level of investment incorporates the footprint programs i mentioned and a resurrection of some of the capacity expansion programs we deferred last year looking ahead we continue to closely monitor our cost structure and spending levels proactively adjusting our activities to align with market dynamics amidst an evolving macro environment we remain focused on executing our long term growth strategy delivering additional value for all stakeholders and with that i ll turn it over to dave for some final comments david heinzmann president and chief executive officer thanks meenal in summary during 2019 we made significant progress across our business segments as we continue to execute our growth strategy in a challenging market looking ahead we are confident that our strong business fundamentals and operational excellence position our company for profitable growth through the course of 2020 the evolution of our company continues to highlight the importance and value of our board of directors and consistent with this i m pleased that maria green retired senior vice president and general counsel of ingersoll rand will join our board effective february 1 maria brings a wealth of global public company leadership experience and will be a great addition to the littelfuse board on that note i want to thank our littelfuse associates around the globe for the commitment in 2019 and i look forward to their contributions in 2020 and beyond as we create additional value for all littelfuse stakeholders with that we ll open the call for questions questions and answers operator thank you sir our first question comes from shawn harrison from longbow research please go ahead shawn harrison longbow research analyst hi meenal a sethna executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning shawn shawn harrison longbow research analyst good morning everyone i wanted to delve in more to the operating profit margin in the electronics business i have to go back to 2011 to find something this low and i understand volume and the incremental margins associated with that are high but it was surprisingly low and it seems like at least the lift implied in the march quarter guidance is going to be a little bit less than typical so if you could kind of walk me through the drags there and kind of how we should expect that margin to rebound as you progress through 2020 as distribution demand normalizes meenal a sethna executive vice president and chief financial officer sure hi shawn so just just stepping back the level of decline that we ve seen in our sales across electronics right we haven t seen this type of decline in 10 years so the combination of the macro factors that we ve seen plus the inventory destocking not just channel but also with end customers like ems and oems that s had a significant impact from an absorption perspective and just the variable margin that we see across electronics is fairly strong the other thing i would point out is that our margins have been running a little bit lower already with ixys coming into the fold and there is a while we ve recognized a fair amount of the synergies that we ve committed to there is still that last batch that we said that we ve got to work on that s really primarily going to impact gross margin so we also expect to see a gross margin uplift over the next 12 months to 24 months as those programs get into place and we start to see those efficiencies as well shawn harrison longbow research analyst i guess as you ramp here into the first half of the year it feels as if the leverage off the bottom is less than we would anticipate is there something incrementally from a cost perspective that s pushing down profitability be it some of the cost take out actions or something else that s limiting leverage off the bottom meenal a sethna executive vice president and chief financial officer i would say i mean if i just look at the overall company the other piece i would also talk about is foreign exchange that s also been a drag where if i go back to 2018 and 17 where foreign exchange we ve talked about had been a nice tailwind for us we saw some better pricing when there were shortages in the market but now we ve got foreign exchange that s now a headwind for us a big headwind in 19 but even in 20 going into the year and we ve seen pricing come back to more normalized levels across electronics shawn harrison longbow research analyst okay and then i guess just a quick follow up dave in kind of the full year view would you expect either your distributors or oem or ems customers to begin destocking is really the baseline view for the year that the destocking headwind you ve seen stops and you just get back to consumption sell in versus sell through kind of being normal versus anything else david heinzmann president and chief executive officer yeah as we talked a little bit in the prepared remarks certainly fourth quarter was pretty challenging we took significant amount of inventory out of the channels which needs to happen of course to kind of reach that equilibrium point there is still a bit more to go during the first quarter but we re reasonably confident that when we get through the first quarter we re kind of done with destocking sorts of work and just a matter fact that as you get past first quarter so you kind of look at fourth quarter first quarter is kind of the bottom of that that momentum on inventory correction you get an uplift just out of the matching of sell in and sell through but we also believe that we ll begin to see in the back half of the year some end market improvement as well with some penetration into some higher growth end markets so first half of the year is still going to be quite kind of challenging if you will but begin to show that improvement as we kind of move out of the first quarter and into the back half of the year we ll see stronger growth shawn harrison longbow research analyst thank you meenal a sethna executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you shawn we ll take our next caller please operator thank you our next question comes from christopher glynn from oppenheimer please go ahead christopher glynn oppenheimer analyst thank you meenal a sethna executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning chris christopher glynn oppenheimer analyst good morning hey meenal dave and so nice operating margin at automotive good momentum there in the back half last year and that s still with organic headwinds fairly pronounced this suggests you get back to the mid teens margin pretty quickly if you get top line and potentially even approach that in the back half of this year meenal a sethna executive vice president and chief financial officer well we are expecting for 2020 we are expecting to see continued margin expansion in automotive i d think a couple of things i mentioned part of the way through my full year commentary that we re working on some footprint programs some of which we ve talked about as they relate to semiconductor and our ixys acquisition but some of which are also with part of our automotive business as well so that s going to take us a little time as much as most programs do i d say the second piece is with foreign exchange we tend to see the biggest impact the outsized impact coming through automotive and so some of that is also going to depend on what happens with foreign exchange in a whole host of different countries from a year over year basis so we absolutely expect to make progress this year and i would say it s probably going to be more like 2021 before we see that mid teens improvement christopher glynn oppenheimer analyst okay and then just on the m a pipeline curious if you could comment on first the breadth of properties sizes sectors actionability those dynamics as well as your operational capacity to be active there because you said you have a lot going on with the footprint now david heinzmann president and chief executive officer sure and of course m a we ve talked about for the last several years being critical for our strategy to drive fundamentally organic growth improvements that has not changed and from an ability to take on acquisitions we think we re at a position to be able to do that and if you look back in the last year in 2019 where we didn t complete an acquisition what you have visibility to of course are the things that the fact that we didn t close any but you don t have visibility as to the work that s going on and potentially areas where we stepped away kind of final stages so we were quite active during 2019 but also created a discipline to make sure we stepped away when things weren t quite where we wanted them to be so we certainly expect to continue to be active i still think prototypical types of deals for us are in the 40 million to 100 million for the range is kind of the prototypical sweet spot for us we obviously will stretch larger if the right opportunity comes along and if it s highly strategic we ll also do smaller deals that might bring in a technology or market access the good news is we have good optionality because there are many of the end markets that we see opportunities for so continue to be quite active certainly expect to continue to use that as a growth driver as we move forward christopher glynn oppenheimer analyst thank you dave david heinzmann president and chief executive officer sure meenal a sethna executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you chris we ll take our next caller please operator thank you next question comes from karl ackerman from cowen please go ahead meenal a sethna executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning karl karl ackerman cowen analyst hey good morning hey good morning dave and meenal i appreciate hey i appreciate the color for the full year i did want to go back to gross margins for a minute clearly the inventory overhang at distributor partners has caused elevated inventory across the channel meenal but i think several of your peers have reported stability in order bookings then you actually made some comments in your prepared remarks on that in electronics so first are you seeing stability in industrial and auto markets yet like you what seems to be happening in electronics second of the weakness in electronics may you juxtapose demand dynamics between passives in power semis and third when should we expect inventory headwinds across all product lines to abate that i think would certainly enable you to improve factory loadings and margins from here and believe it or not i have a follow up david heinzmann president and chief executive officer okay that s a mouthful let me start a little bit to kind of talk about the market conditions and things like that meenal can speak to how that translates to gross margins our industrial business we ve been growing well above market we don t see that changing we continue to have good momentum in the industrial segment so we don t have an inventory overhang there that s really not been an issue for us in 2019 we don t see that in 2020 we continue to see that reasonably stable so although industrial markets are not robust globally right now we ve been able to grow nicely with our efforts to design and win beyond north america and in specific growth areas so we can see that certainly continue in 2020 on the automotive side and candidly all of these comments are really i put an astros as to we just don t understand the potential impact of the coronavirus both in china and globally so i ll make these comments kind of based upon what we know today regards to that automotive we certainly do not see car build growth in 2020 however we see a little more stability so the level of drop is reducing and slowing the good news is we had some challenges and made some decisions to step away from some pieces of business in the sensor side of the business in 2019 and specific applications we re through a big part of that have a little bit more to go but we remain highly confident in the passenger car side that we are seeing content growth beyond car build so we do expect growth out of automotive in 2020 commercial vehicle which falls in that segment is a bit more challenging and although we ll have good growth with design wins and some share gains in 2020 clearly the end markets are not moving in our direction so that will kind of weigh down a little bit on the automotive segment electronics talked about it in the previous comment we think we re through the course of the first quarter through the inventory corrections largely and we really begin to reach that stability level and we re really looking for improvements that come from just matching sell in and sell through but also would look to see end market improvements kind of in the back of the year so that s kind of our view on where inventories are and how we kind of see the demand patterns looking meenal maybe you can talk a little bit about how we see that translating into gross margins meenal a sethna executive vice president and chief financial officer sure another point i wanted to add to dave s comments on electronics so versus our peers that we ve mentioned in the past about 75 of the sales in our electronics segment go through distribution and through our channel partners and that s larger than most of the peer companies that i expect you re looking at and then we look at as well so we tend to have some higher peaks and lower valleys compared to our peers and that s why the monitoring of the inventory and inventory correction and even just some of the stabilization in the channel becomes more critical for us versus some of our peers so having said all that we ve talked about is we have strong variable margins definitely across electronics across industrial and you can see that come through when we have growth you typically will see the gross margins improve fairly rapidly and that drops down very well leveraging operating margin so that s what we expect to see a little of that in the first quarter but as dave mentioned earlier as we start to see some of the growth come back in the second half we ll definitely see some stronger improvements in gross margin commensurate with that karl ackerman cowen analyst very helpful if i may squeeze in one more your industrial business was a bright spot in the quarter i know in the past you have mentioned that ixys has acted as a beachhead for your industrial business opportunity and the sales teams that being ixys or your industrial sales teams are i think are tightly integrated with ixys less than halfway integrated like why wouldn t we see these growth rates in industrial sustaining for the next several quarters given these synergies across your product lines thank you david heinzmann president and chief executive officer yeah well first of all i think we re well beyond halfway integrated of ixys we re kind of nearing the final stages of that of the integration activities the footprint work we have to do is certainly getting approvals from customers and things like that take longer in the footprint work on ixys but sales integration systems integration those things were kind of in the back end of those activities we have seen improvements in our core industrial segment to our traditional products that have been helped by access to industrial customers from ixys so we have seen some of that synergy if you will from a sales perspective in those areas that s part of the help for us to grow beyond what the markets are doing in industrial meenal a sethna executive vice president and chief financial officer and just one other thing karl i might add is i just wanted to make sure i clarify our ixys products and semiconductor products are in our electronics segment so as dave was talking about the industrial products segment ixys in the electronics segment and so some of the channel issues that we just talked about we experienced with ixys less so than maybe some of our legacy business because we ve got more of direct sales there but we ve also seen inventory destocking with end customers like oems so that s also affected our ixys business as well within the electronics segment karl ackerman cowen analyst thank you very much meenal a sethna executive vice president and chief financial officer we ll take the next caller please operator thank you our next question comes from steven fox from cross research please go ahead meenal a sethna executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning steven steven fox cross research analyst good morning it s tough to follow on that one but i ll try so in terms of pricing i guess pricing has been returning to normal for your fuses and power semis over the last couple of quarters like where are we versus year ago comps are we when does sort of pricing equalize on a year over year basis and i guess that would be a decent margin help as you think about the year david heinzmann president and chief executive officer yeah so i think when we ve talked about pricing conditions 2018 was the anomaly not 2019 right so we ve probably had pricing conditions in 2018 that were maybe half of what we normally would see so through the course of 2019 we certainly saw a return to more normalized electronics pricing pressures which can be in that 4 5 6 range and that s what we re seeing today in the electronics side of our business that s consistent with what we ve seen in history and certainly our teams work hard to make sure all of our cost improvements and volume increases helped to offset those challenges so really it s been a return to normal there and that we saw that happening kind of in the early stages of 2019 so we expect that to continue in kind of its normal pattern steven fox cross research analyst got it that s helpful and then secondly dave you guys were early and accurate in sort of calling the inventory in the channel you re now going forward to sort of normalized by the end of this quarter which is consistent with what you guys were saying but the recovery that you mentioned sounded sort of a slow steady type recovery not anything dramatic which depending on who you talk to is a little more conservative than other guys is there anything you re contemplating in that comment relative to industry specific fuses and power semis or anything else in terms of puts and takes with content or do you think it s just a general market outlook that you re talking out there david heinzmann president and chief executive officer yeah no i don t nothing specific we re contemplating on that i mean we get a bit of a step function improvement when the inventory destocking is done right because you just you re no longer reducing sell in to take inventories down so you get that step function improvement that takes place which we kind of expect to see that after the first quarter we ll see that improvement beyond that we are expecting improvement but the improvements will really be driven out of fundamental end market improvements and i think our visibility as of today would say that yes it will begin to show that end market improvement in the back half of the year but our visibility to that is not great so we don t want to over commit in our kind of view on how the end markets are going to behave in the back half of the year so some might think we re being conservative but i think our view would be unless we see specific things that are going to drive that in the back half of the year we re not going to call it out that much so we hope there s some upside to that in the back half of the year and as visibility improves we ll certainly talk about that steven fox cross research analyst that s helpful thank you so much meenal a sethna executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you steven we ll take our next caller please operator thank you our next question comes from david leiker from baird please go ahead meenal a sethna executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning david erin welcenbach baird analyst hi good morning this is erin welcenbach on for david meenal a sethna executive vice president and chief financial officer hi erin welcenbach baird analyst hi so the my first question just i want to dig into your automotive segment organic growth a little bit given the 8 organic sales decline so at least based on my math it looks like commercial vehicle could be maybe as much as half of the organic sales decline within this segment i m wondering if you can help further contextualize your outgrowth or content growth in passenger car fuse versus commercial vehicle and then the sensor headwinds you had talked about as well david heinzmann president and chief executive officer yeah so when we talk about the sensor headwinds and we ve been talking about that for the last couple of quarters sensor headwinds end up creating a bit of a let s call it about a 1 drag on organic growth to the automotive segment certainly commercial vehicle has an impact on it as well as a drag what we re seeing today as we look forward we clearly are comfortable in the passenger car segment by the way inclusive of our sensor business at this stage looking forward we clearly are seeing content growth that s in that 3 to 4 range beyond car build obviously car builds in 2020 or we re not projecting to show growth but the content story continues to hold water as we look forward that looks still pretty solid for us and so we remain pretty confident in that erin welcenbach baird analyst okay great and then my second question is just can you to the extent possible detail the assumptions you have surrounding the coronavirus that s currently embedded in your guidance david heinzmann president and chief executive officer yeah what i would say is the impacts we have on that today is we know that in all of our factory locations in china and in a good part of our customers locations not all of course there has been a mandatory extension of the chinese new year holiday through an extra week our understanding of that that allows kind of that gestation period of 2 days to 14 days to get for the chinese government to get better visibility of what s going to take place there so what s embedded right now is the fact that we have embedded the one additional week of shutdown in china we haven t embedded in our forecasting changes beyond that at this stage because it s just too fluid it s hard to predict exactly what that s going to be it certainly has the potential of getting worse but right now we don t have that visibility erin welcenbach baird analyst great thanks for taking my questions david heinzmann president and chief executive officer sure meenal a sethna executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks erin and we ll take our next caller please operator thank you our next lease our next question comes from matt sheerin from stifel please go ahead meenal a sethna executive vice president and chief financial officer hi matt matt sheerin stifel analyst yes thank you good morning i just wanted to get back to your revenue guidance for the year for up modestly which shows a stronger back half in terms of by segment are you expecting each of the segments to be up as well or would it be more slanted toward the auto and industrial given that the correction is still playing out in electronics and then also relative to margin where margins shake out this year are you expecting to grow operating margin and operating profits this year despite the fact that you re still looking at some headwinds in terms of costs and transition costs and other things like that david heinzmann president and chief executive officer yeah matt let me talk a little bit about the revenue growth and meenal can talk about kind of the bottom line growth associated with that our current view today is that we expect growth in all three of the segments in 2020 to varying degrees we re not giving guidance on each one of those segments but we are expecting growth in all three of those areas certainly we know with the dynamics i talked about earlier in electronics and the comps so if you look at electronics it was falling steeply through the first half of 2018 so from a comp perspective yeah we re not going to have growth in electronics in the first half but we certainly expect to kind of return to growth in the back half and for that to outpace the level of decline in the first half so not showing growth in electronics and we expect with the content growth story in automotive even with kind of an end market challenge of car build we ll have growth there in industrial we continue to see good success we ve had in the last year from an operating margin perspective meenal why don t you talk to that meenal a sethna executive vice president and chief financial officer sure so matt as part of my prepared remarks what i mentioned is with the low single digit sales growth that we guided for for the full year we said that we would have year over year operating margin expansion and that we would see leverage in our eps growth but it would be lower than typical levels are lower than normal so as an example low single digits growth we might in a typical year we might see mid single digit eps growth it d be on the a little bit on the lighter end of that because of the couple of things i mentioned one being the footprint the footprint activities that we re undertaking but also really i ll call them general market dynamics around foreign exchange remains a headwind for us for 2020 today and then we have with our lower tax rate in 19 we have a little bit of a tax rate headwind as well so that s why it s more of a diminished leverage but we absolutely expect to grow eps and operating margin expansion david heinzmann president and chief executive officer sure so we certainly expect to get bottom line leverage just maybe dampened a little bit more than what we would like to see because of strategic investments we re making to set up for the long term matt sheerin stifel analyst okay and then meenal you did talk about transition costs relative to some further integration of ixys and other things is there anything incremental there that impacts the margins this year and that looking next year you ll have even more favorable comps meenal a sethna executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so as part of those remarks what i mentioned is we ve got footprint actions slated so some of these are these ixys footprint activities that we ve been talking about the past few quarters others are ones that we are going to embark on but we ve not shared yet and we will in future quarters the combination of all those projects we expect to have transition costs of about 0 30 to 0 35 and related to eps this year and just the question is well hey can you help me a little bit on the segment by far the bulk of that is going to be impacting the electronics segment from a year over year perspective because a lot of that is related to the ixys work and when i talk about transition costs it means we have to do some pre hiring in new locations and we ve got product qualification costs and some transfer costs that s all part of our adjusted operating margin and adjusted eps matt sheerin stifel analyst so you re going to run that through the p l then meenal a sethna executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah these are costs that we run through again it ends up being duplicate staff for example maybe in locations things like that matt sheerin stifel analyst got it okay thank you meenal a sethna executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you matt we ll take our next caller please operator thank you our last question comes from david kelley from jefferies please go ahead meenal a sethna executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning david david kelley jefferies analyst good morning thanks for taking my questions maybe starting with an auto s pricing question from me i think you referenced an uptick last quarter just curious if that s persistent or maybe even subsided now that the market seems a bit more stable or is pricing at this point more a function of the competitive landscape you re seeing at the moment david heinzmann president and chief executive officer yeah i would say pricing in the automotive segment for us we had talked about it being a little more challenging than we ve seen in the past i would say today our view would be pricing year to year kind of has this range maybe we re on the higher end of the range we re certainly not out of kind of a normal range in the automotive segment so we re not seeing kind of outsized pressures there at the current state david kelley jefferies analyst okay got it thank you and then maybe if you could provide a bit more color on the sensor program delays you referenced and also is that light vehicle or commercial vehicle customer specific david heinzmann president and chief executive officer yeah most of the delays in the programs we re talking about are in the passenger car light vehicle world and the issues these are customer delays not littelfuse delays and they vary there s a handful of them and they vary everything from there s one big program where actually they re delayed because another supplier can t supply components they need for their system so it s pushed out the introduction of the new system and in other cases oems have delayed the launch of changes to some of their systems so there s a variety of reasons there they re not long term they re not issues that are going to extend materially but there are delays that certainly impacted our fourth quarter a bit david kelley jefferies analyst okay great thank you last one for me and maybe ending on kind of a high level question you referenced the adas opportunity kind of outpacing expectations i guess how do you think about or how should we think about your addressable market and advanced data so like that level two what s called level two plus content and maybe if you could just kind of high level discuss some of your content opportunities you see as the adoption of the more advanced adas content grows david heinzmann president and chief executive officer yeah the first thing i would remind you and others is that those revenues show up actually in our electronics segments because they are our electronic technologies that are being designed into those automotive applications so it s not in the electrical infrastructure of the vehicle if you will so it shows up in the electronics segment of our business and what i would say is these are traditional circuit protection types of products whether they re over voltage protection over current protection over temperature protection and those sorts of things where we are designing in our electronic products with kind of automotive qualifications and there are slightly different designs and manufacturing processes that we use to support automotive requirements what i would say is the content growth in the electronic systems continues to grow in the vehicle our share in that space still allows for us to go after further share potential as well so it s really kind of they aren t particularly unique technologies for our portfolio they re kind of our core technologies focused in the automotive areas so we just see that lift in content and the opportunity for us continuing to drive growth in the electronics part of our business david kelley jefferies analyst all right perfect thank you meenal a sethna executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks david and thanks for joining us on today s call and your interest in littelfuse we look forward to talking with you again soon have a great day operator

as lacklustre economic conditions persist across the globe large scale high impact strategies such as zero interest rates and negative interest rates are being carefully considered by central banks around the world they are likely to become increasingly mainstream and it s important for investors to understand what their effects may be with the australian economic outlook looking weak the reserve bank of australia is now also considering employing unconventional monetary policies to stimulate growth to share some lessons learned in other markets we look here at japan and germany s approach to unconventional monetary policies and the impact they have had on different asset classes with a special focus on sovereign bonds a rationale for unconventional measures the uncertain economic outlook has prompted the reserve bank of australia rba to consider employing unconventional monetary policies to stimulate growth should the central bank choose to go down this path australia would follow the lead of a number of other nations there is much local investors can learn from the overseas experiences and it is worth exploring why countries choose to pursue unconventional monetary policies interest rates are one of the most important factors that influence financial markets they impact the cost of borrowing and returns on many assets including cash combined with other elements such as 10 year yields on government bonds interest rates also provide insights into the health of the economy and inflation this is vital information when constructing investment portfolios in response to an uncertain economic outlook central banks from many of the major developed markets have kept interest rates at exceptionally low levels in some countries rates have even been negative these are examples of unconventional monetary policies in recent history sweden was one of the first countries to explore unconventional monetary policies its central bank the riksbank introduced negative rates in july 2009 by cutting its overnight deposit rate to 0 25 then in june 2014 the european central bank ecb lowered its deposit rate to 0 10 other european countries and japan have since implemented negative interest rates in australia in 2019 the rba discussed the use of unconventional policies such as negative interest rates or buying government bonds to effectively lower longer term interest rates and generate activity while each situation is unique there are many lessons that can be applied from these events to what is happening in financial markets today lessons to take from japan and germany when central banks resort to unconventional policies such as quantitative easing the indicators suggest the economic outlook and environment are typically fraught and fragile for example they were used in japan in late 1991 and early 1992 after asset prices collapsed following a period of economic excess and inflation in the mid 1980s japan had an extremely dynamic economy with annual gdp growth of around 4 at the market s height in 1989 japan accounted for 45 of the global sharemarket by market capitalisation but soon after it succumbed to one of the longest running economic crises in financial history a period dubbed the lost decade by 2019 japan s share of the global bourse had fallen to just 7 recessionary conditions were long lasting and profound and extreme measures were needed this is why japan decided to introduce quantitative easing japan has had a number of forays into zero interest rates one was in february 1999 and it embarked on another round two years later in response to the dot com bubble bursting in addition to moving into negative interest rates in 2001 the country also pursued a program of quantitative easing this lasted until july 2006 when the bank of japan boj began to normalise rates a decade later in january 2016 the boj again adopted negative rates mostly to prevent an unwelcome strengthening of the yen from hurting the export reliant economy when the boj first introduced unconventional monetary policies its approach was viewed to be extreme and isolated to japan but only a few years later thanks to the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008 the us federal reserve the fed and the european central bank ecb took a similar approach japanese interest rates 1961 to 2019 source jcb team analysis based on data from bloomberg japanese interest rate policies 1995 to 2019 source jcb team analysis based on data from bloomberg the response to unconventional monetary policy the boj s accommodative monetary policies were designed to stimulate economic growth but instead they prompted a number of unexpected outcomes japanese households ignored the easy money and ended up saving more and spending less this suppressed demand which added to the country s economic troubles concurrently a credit crunch emerged as the japanese banks bad and doubtful debt exposures accumulated small medium and even some large sized businesses were unable to repay their loans the property market played a key role in the economy as this situation played out the frothy commercial property market that was one of the main features of the japanese market in the 1980s and 90s suffered immensely in the crash it has never fully returned to pre boom levels japan the bubble bursting led to poor outcomes across rents wages and property source jcb team analysis based on data from bloomberg as chart above shows from 1991 the commercial property sector endured fourteen consecutive years of falling valuations a trend that challenged the notion property investments are safe and accretive simultaneously rental levels plummeted as economic activity remained anaemic property owners who had enjoyed double digit yields at the peak of the bubble subsequently saw the value of their property drop below the value of their outstanding debt meanwhile low growth and deflationary pressures weighed on the japanese sharemarket equities reached historic lows in 1989 and the market subsequently saw a number of false dawns this was because corporates focused on restructuring balance sheets and paying down debt rather than growing their enterprises through borrowing at highly attractive interest rates germany s experience germany is another country where unconventional monetary policies have been used to try to reboot a lacklustre economy its industries have been weighed down by china s economic rebalancing the global trade war and evolving consumer trends investment spending has receded the labour market is tepid and business and consumer confidence are soft additionally the ageing demographic acts as an anchor on productivity growth and contributes to banking sector weaknesses on top of this weak lending high operating cost bases and poor profitability in the face of low interest rates are acting as handbrakes on economic output germany s monetary policy is decided by the european central bank ecb in 2012 it introduced zero interest rates followed by negative interest rates of 0 1 from june 2014 while these measures were viewed as extreme credit growth had been stagnant and the central bank wanted to encourage lending to make it punitive for banks to store excess cash nevertheless german and other northern european region banks still store close to 1 25 trillion in excess reserves so money has not flowed freely across the economy adding to the malaise unconventional monetary policies have caused european share markets to rally although financial sector stocks have not performed as well as defensive shares overall however the economy remains soft and policymakers continue to explore all options to support economic activity a comparison of performance over time the charts below show how assets have performed over time in japan the uk the eurozone and the us for local shares residential property and government bonds japan figures have been based to 100 starting in the year 2000 source

dividends and coupons are assumed to have been re invested into the relevant index past performance is not an indicator of future performance forced up the risk spectrum investors have been forced to take on more risk in pursuit of returns or yield as central banks have lowered interest rates to near zero zero or less as such investors have had to move up the risk spectrum to generate returns while being penalised for holding onto cash given the low interest rate environment this has encouraged investors to allocate funds to more speculative assets such as emerging market debt leveraged loans and private equity but while these instruments offer attractive yields they also carry material and often hidden risks with return expectations falling given myriad nearer term economic headwinds risk has been cheapened by these policies and risen in investor portfolios these are typical features of a late cycle environment at the same time central bank rhetoric has altered investor beliefs when poor economic data is released central banks have further eased monetary policy a strategy that has become increasingly ineffective more and more accommodation is required just to maintain economic growth risky assets rally hard in this environment but markets have been lulled into a false sense of security this has the potential to wrong foot investors especially in times of crisis the secular decline in policy rates around the world since the gfc these conditions have aided asset class returns source jcb team analysis based on data from bloomberg notes past performance is not an indicator of current or future performance how high grade sovereign bonds perform in times of market stress high grade bonds have historically defended and protected when needed source jcb team analysis based on data from bloomberg morningstar notes past performance is not an indicator of current or future performance where to from here the world continues deeper into a late cycle phase one in which investors are encouraged by policy makers to reach for yield and return in an increasingly uncertain time thoughtful portfolio construction is one of the keys to navigating these difficulties as the japanese experience demonstrates traditional asset classes such as cash endure difficult outcomes under these conditions bonds are the exception they can offer compounding qualities that prove invaluable in a low return environment the japanese investment landscape over time sovereign bonds delivered compounding returns source jcb team analysis based on data from bloomberg investors who have tilted their portfolios towards risky assets such as shares and property have been conditioned since the gfc to believe returns are virtuous and markets are supported by central banks doing whatever it takes to maintain an even economic keel this is understandable when considering the strong performance shares and property have enjoyed in recent years but this environment is unlikely to persist against this backdrop high grade sovereign bonds have an enduring and a nearer term role to play while forward return expectations for all asset classes are somewhat dampened relative to historic trends high grade sovereign bonds offer benefits such as diversification high grade bonds grind out returns and dampen risky asset exposures even in a muted yield environment they also deliver compound income over time and provide constructive returns and while their returns are likely to be moderated relative to trend high grade sovereign bonds offer protection against cyclical downturns and risky assets they also enjoy other advantages such as being backed by highly rated governments including australia which alongside canada and switzerland is one of three aaa rated countries with widescale functioning bond markets as stable and well regulated nations investors are confident governments can make good on their ongoing debt obligations which supports the sovereign bond market given the uncertainty and rising pressures in financial markets proven sources of defensiveness and diversification such as sovereign bonds should help investors mitigate inevitable market pitfalls in fact there s a case for having both domestic and global high grade sovereign bond exposures in portfolios

toronto canada s main stock index inched higher midweek on strong u s corporate earnings and improved risk appetite despite ongoing threats from a new form of coronavirus today investors are largely looking past the coronavirus issues in china and are instead shifting their focus to fundamentals and particularly after some of the bellwether companies in the u s this morning reported stronger than expected earnings results said candice bangsund portfolio manager for fiera capital specifically she pointed to apple inc and general electric whose shares gained 1 9 and 9 8 per cent respectively pessimism and risk aversion is primarily reflected in bond markets with falling yields the strengthened u s dollar and higher gold prices she said the fact that the underlying fundamentals are strengthening has largely outweighed the potential risks stemming from china particularly seeing as these risks up until now any ways seem to be fairly contained to the chinese economy she said in an interview markets were later supported wednesday by the federal reserve which in addition to not altering interest rates conveyed a message of cautious optimism on the state of the economy said bangsund but she said corporate results were more important than the central bank comments which is an encouraging development when the market is moving on fundamentals like that and that s countering some of the geopolitical or uncertainty overseas that helps to reignite confidence in general bangsund said she expects near term market volatility will continue and trade on headlines related to china including sporadic bouts of economic weakness but the longer term outlook is bright when we look a few months out toward april may we think we are going to be hitting some new highs again and markets will regain that momentum and will make new highs just because the economic backdrop is so sound the s p tsx composite index closed up 10 87 points at 17 511 75 after hitting an intraday high of 17 561 87 in new york the dow jones industrial average was up 11 60 points at 28 734 45 the s p 500 index was down 2 84 points at 3 273 40 while the nasdaq composite was up 5 48 points at 9 275 16 the canadian dollar traded for 75 78 cents us compared with an average of 75 88 cents us on tuesday the materials subsector was the largest gainer on the day helped by kinross gold corp and centerra gold inc climbing at least 4 3 per cent they rose along with gold prices as investors continued to seek safety the february gold contract was up 60 cents at us 1 570 40 an ounce and the march copper contract was down 2 55 cents at us 2 55 a pound industrials increased on a 1 4 per cent gain by cp rail after it reported higher fourth quarter profits and air canada enjoyed a partial recovery after losing nearly 12 per cent since the outbreak of the coronavirus energy was up led by cenovus energy inc crude oil prices fell as the u s reported stronger weekly inventory levels the march crude contract was down 15 cents at us 53 33 per barrel and the march natural gas contract was down 4 3 cents at us 1 865 per mmbtu this report by the canadian press was first published jan 29 2020
from richard bernstein advisors every instance of financial speculation today is termed a bubble but true financial bubbles are rarer than most investors believe certainly bubbles include speculation but the difference between bubbles and mere speculative periods is that bubbles go beyond the financial markets and pervade society as we ve highlighted in past insights there are five defining characteristics beyond speculation that are common to historical financial bubbles 1 increased use of leverage increased liquidity democratization of the market record new issues record turnover these characteristics seem to be spreading in several markets these days the technology sector venture capital private equity and distressed debt all show several of these characteristics their performance comparisons to other markets are getting extreme and as in most bubbles investors enthusiasm for the asset classes is growing as those performance disparities get wider bubbles tend to significantly hurt the performance of contrarian investors and this cycle has fit that pattern we thought it worthwhile to highlight some of these significant disparities many observers have pointed out that the us corporate sector s leverage ratios have increased significantly chart 1 shows that public company leverage has indeed increased but does not look dire relative to history individual sectors have increased leverage i e consumer staples health care and technology but public equity leverage ratios in general still look conservative relative to history one should have expected leverage ratios to increase as interest rates fell because companies simply refinanced and expanded debt levels while keeping interest payments at similar levels leverage ratios among public companies have increased but leverage ratios among private companies has ballooned according to empirical research partners debt to ebitda for private companies is more than double that of the s p 500 see chart 2 investors often point to the higher returns associated with private companies but fail to mention those companies tend to be more cyclical and more highly levered than is the overall public market liquidity the days of a stern chair of the federal reserve are long gone the late paul volkers strict monetary policies have been followed by a series of fed chairman who have fostered increasingly expansive monetary policies and haven t understood or cared that loose monetary policy causes inflation if not in real assets then in financial assets since the early 1990s real asset inflation has been largely constrained by globalization so the fed s ongoing free flowing liquidity created a series of financial asset bubbles the fed has a dual mandate of low unemployment and stable prices the fed cut interest rates three times during 2019 and began to once again expand its balance sheet despite that the economy was healthy and despite that the unemployment rate was at a 50 year low see chart 3 that implies the fed believed that deflation was a risk and wanted more inflation unfortunately they failed to yet again recognize that loose monetary policy can cause inflation in financial assets the result of the recent lowering of rates and expansion of the fed s balance sheet has been a bubble in the making since the fed cut rates last july just one segment of the technology sector has significantly outperformed the overall market see chart 4 democratization of the market bubbles pervade society therefore perhaps the most defining aspect of a bubble is the democratization of the market i e everyone should get to play the birth of the online day trader during the tech bubble and people flipping condos and leaving good jobs to become real estate agents during the housing bubble are two examples it was especially disconcerting to recently read that major private equity and venture capital firms were heavily lobbying regulators to allow individuals to invest in private markets first this seems to totally ignore the history of individuals unfortunate experiences with private markets and why today they do not have access second it seems to ignore the vast amounts of dry powder or funds that have been raised for private equity and venture investing that have yet to be called over 2 trillion by some reports individuals are being offered entry at a very late stage third it also ignores that recent flows to private equity and venture have eclipsed the historic flows into public equity mutual funds during the technology bubble fourth and perhaps most important it reflects the standard refrain during bubbles that everyone should get to play and denying individual investors access to a market hinders their wealth creation record new issues although the ipo market may have recently fizzled the combination of unbridled creation of new private and venture funds and the overall plentiful availability of speculative capital should warrant caution bubbles divert capital away from productive use and there are many current examples of such ill advised allocations investors long term returns are always higher when capital is scarce and bubbles create scarcities in non bubble industries or sectors our now famous infamous report from march 2000 attention venture capitalists leave silicon valley for west texas reflected how the energy sector was starved for capital and that returns on capital were likely to be higher in the energy sector than in the bubble financed technology sector for example today there are companies with lofty valuations that will take wealthy individuals on outer space vacations will dominate the auto industry without distribution without sufficient cash flow and with competition building are the modern day conglomerates business school case studies often center on stick to your knitting and the failure of the conglomerate model but today s conglomerates are assumed to be immune exist in product markets that are rapidly fragmenting with little competitive advantage to differentiate any company etc etc etc another way to measure new issues is the shares outstanding for etfs when the shares outstanding increase it reflects higher demand for the etf chart 5 shows the shares outstanding of the two largest technology sector etfs both etfs shares outstanding increased during 2019 record turnover admittedly it is virtually impossible to measure turnover or trading volume for private investments largely because they do not trade illiquidity among private investments is often considered a positive factor because the added risk should be compensated with added returns whereas there might have been a significant illiquidity premium in private investments 25 years ago when few investors were interested in private investments we strongly doubt that premium exists today if it quacks like a bubble many if not all of the characteristics of a financial bubble seem evident in some technology or disruptor shares private equity and venture capital one can never predict when a bubble might deflate however it seems relatively clear to us that investors should not be adding

countering the deadly media supported health insurance industry spin ernest a canning byon 1 29 2020 9 35am pt as americans are being hoodwinked by a slick health insurance industry pr campaign the time has come to carefully examine medicare for all by separating myth from reality while morally repugnant the privately owned health insurance industry s deceptions are economically understandable by the time sen bernie sanders i vt introduced the medicare for all act of 2019 in the u s senate two months after rep pramila jayapal d wa co chair of the progressive caucus introduced h r 1384 medicare for all act of 2019 in the house the industry realized that it faced an existential threat medicare for all would create an entirely new single payer healthcare system that with limited exceptions cosmetic surgery home care nursing would eliminate the need for anyone to purchase health insurance while the parasitic health insurance industry has faced off against them in the past single payer advocates are better positioned to prevail in 2020 than at any time in the past 75 years sanders single payer healthcare legislation s 1129 was co sponsored by 14 senate democrats those co sponsors included several presidential candidates elizabeth warren d ma kirsten gillibrand d ny cory booker d nj and kamela harris d ca more than one half of all democrats in the house 112 co sponsored jayapal s version of the bill medicare for all is also supported by 63 national organizations more importantly a poll taken in 2018 prior to a barrage of pro insurance industry propaganda found that medicare for all was immensely popular it was supported by a whopping 70 of all americans including 84 of democrats and a mind boggling 52 of republicans with their very survival at stake the health insurance profiteers along with large hospitals and the pharmaceutical industry created a new pr front group partnership for america s healthcare future pahf to wage their defensive according to wendell potter a former cigna executive and author of deadly spin how pr is killing healthcare and deceiving americans 2011 pahf is the industry s newest propaganda arm in addition to carefully timed commercial advertising pahf acts in concert with industry funded politicians and mainstream media pundits their goal is to erect an industry friendly frame that serves to mask the blatant deficiencies of our inordinately expensive yet woefully inefficient subsidized free market healthcare system this as julie hollar of the media watchdog fair observed has succeeded in turning some of the recent democratic presidential debates into over the top industry friendly spectacle potter the recovering healthcare industry veteran told los angeles times columnist michael hiltzek health insurers have been successful at two things making money and getting the american public to believe they re essential but the truth argues hiltzik is that private health insurers have contributed nothing to the american healthcare system most americans he charges blindly tolerate our inordinately expensive yet dysfunctional private insurance system because the vast majority don t have a complex interaction with the healthcare system within a given year of patients account for more than one fifth of all medical spending and 10 account for two thirds far too many americans fail to appreciate the inadequacies of our private insurance system until those inadequacies are thrust upon them by an unexpected serious illness or injury according to the pulitzer prize winning business columnist hence the need to separate healthcare insurance myth from fact based reality original medicare is not single payer medicare for all should not be confused with the existing medicare system whose coverage limitations opened the door to a lucrative and rapidly growing market for supplemental insurance known as medicare advantage ma after that supplemental market doubled in size over the span of a decade ma allowed the private for profit insurance industry to capture 200 billion in ma premiums in a single year 2017 our existing medicare system does not eliminate all copays and deductibles it can be especially costly for those who fall within the prescription medication coverage gap aka the donut hole under sanders proposed medicare for all annual out of pocket prescription drug expenses for each individual would be capped at 200 per year sen elizabeth warren d ma proposes a more modest 250 month prescription drug cap unlike the current medicare system the new single payer system set forth in the legislation now pending before congress would fully cover vision hearing dental and long term care medicare for all provides comprehensive coverage for everyone no one would have to pay premiums copays or deductibles why medicare for all the u s maintains an extraordinarily expensive yet strikingly inefficient healthcare system that fails to measure up to systems offered by its single payer counterparts we spend nearly twice as much per capita for healthcare than the average per capita healthcare expenditures amongst the 34 single payer nation members of the organization for economic cooperation and development oced according to a 2014 commonwealth fund study however the u s healthcare delivery system ranked dead last amongst eleven industrial nations in terms of quality efficiency access to care and healthy lives the u s ranked last on infant mortality and on deaths that were potentially preventable it also ranked last on every measure of cost related access because access to healthcare in the u s is related to one s ability to pay the inefficiencies of the system have a disparate impact upon people of color infant mortality amongst african americans for example is 2 3 times greater than it is amongst non hispanic whites inefficiencies remained a central problem even after key provisions of barack obama s affordable care act aca went into effect citing its own healthcare efficiency index bloomberg reported in 2016 that the u s healthcare system is one of the world s least efficient ranking 50th out of the 55 countries our current subsidized free market system is not just inefficient it s deadly where no one dies in single payer countries due to lack of coverage the death toll extracted by our free market system is nothing short of ghastly nearly 45 000 deaths per year according to a 2009 harvard medical study that pre aca study was issued at a time when 46 3 million americans were uninsured with 58 9 million uninsured for at least part of the year according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc by 2019 with the advent of the aca there were still 30 1 million americans uninsured according to the cdc the decline in the number of uninsured suggests there has likely been a proportionate reduction in the current number of americans who die each year for lack of insurance the 2009 harvard medical study figure did not include the number of americans who die every year because of insurance industry schemes to delay or deny authorizations for life sustaining treatment those schemes are by no means limited to pre existing conditions which the aca eliminated although the subsidized free market system ushered in by the aca reduced the number of uninsured americans there are now 41 million underinsured adults ages 19 64 in the u s more than half 52 of underinsured adults face medically induced financial debt in 2018 even after years of aca implementation more than 530 000 americans filed for bankruptcy as a result of unpaid medical bills according to a study published by the american public health association that figure includes many individuals who have insurance but can t afford exorbitant co pays and deductibles no one goes bankrupt by reason of unpaid medical bills in single payer countries in states that have legalized physician assisted suicides patients faced with insurance industry refusals to fully cover life sustaining treatment have chosen death in order to avoid saddling their loved ones with unpaid medical bills according to a 2017 medical study why eliminate insurers together with an out of control pharmaceutical industry for profit insurers are a principal source of both exorbitant healthcare costs and inefficiencies in the united states in just one year 2017 americans spent 812 billion or 34 of our total healthcare expenditures simply to cover administrative costs of its inefficient multi payer healthcare system according to a newly released study published by the annals of internal medicine aim that s nearly 200 billion more than the u s spent on its global war machine during fy 2017 that 812 billion administrative cost expenditure does not include the profits the insurance industry extracted from the system in 2018 for example the ceos of the eight largest publicly traded health insurance companies received a combined 145 million in total compensation those same companies reported 21 9 billion in profits the amount that the u s spends per capita on administrative costs 2 497 is more than 4 ½ times greater than per capita administrative costs 551 in canada a single payer nation by replacing our inefficient multi payer system with a single payer system americans could save 600 billion per year in administrative costs alone according to the authors of the aim study inefficiency and waste are the principal reasons why single payer advocates like wendell potter reject efforts to reform our existing multi payer system via a public option during the 2009 healthcare debate in congress potter supported calls to reform the existing free market system via the creation of a public option but only because it was the best that could be achieved at that time given the political realities as we reported back then both president obama who had met privately with health insurance executives and the leadership of the then democratically controlled house essentially shut single payer advocates out of the debate the aca which was drafted by a former wellpoint vp working in the office of sen max baucus d mt would as then predicted by rep dennis kucinich d oh eventually move forward without the originally promised public option although it would have had a favorable impact with respect to coverage the core problem with a public option potter asserts is that it allows the private insurance industry to maintain its status as the principal gatekeeper of our dysfunctional and inefficient profit driven system costs the questions posed by cnn moderator abby phillip to sanders and former vp joe biden during the jan 20 2020 debate provide a paradigm example of how the corporate owned mainstream media helps to control the public s perception of medicare for all by filtering it through an insurance industry frame abby phillip sen sanders you have consistently refused to say exactly how much your medicare for all plan is going to cost don t voters deserve to see the price tag before you send them a bill that could cost tens of trillions of dollars whether deliberate or the result of failing to do her homework the first part of that question was flat out wrong in a senate paper entitled financing medicare for all the vermont senator laid out in detail multiple options to pay for medicare for all without raising the deficit these include but are not limited to the elimination of existing health tax expenditures restoring a more progressive income tax imposing a 70 top marginal rate for incomes over 10 million imposing a 77 top inheritance tax rate on transfers of extreme wealth and repealing the accounting gimmicks that have permitted the nation s largest corporations not to mention multi national corporations to earn billions of dollars yet not pay so much as one dime in federal income taxes sanders also mentions savings with respect to significant cuts in the military budget and by ending our forever 6 trillion global war on terror sanders provided a direct and accurate answer to philip s argumentative question medicare for all will cost substantially less than the status quo according the the bi partisan committee for a responsible budget the ten year estimated cost for a single payer medicare for all system is approximately 28 32 trillion an enormous sum that would no doubt cause many americans to mistakenly believe that medicare for all is an unattainable pipe dream according to sander s senate paper filed in support of his medicare for all act of 2019 however that ten year 28 32 trillion cost estimate to maintain a single payer medicare for all system would be 18 68 trillion less than the 47 trillion the center for medicare medicaid services cms estimated cost to maintain the aca status quo during the period 2018 2027 according to a 11 30 18 study released by the umass amherst political economy research institute peri medicare for all would save a more modest 5 1 trillion over ten years a separate study performed by the ultra conservative koch funded mercatus center estimated that medicare for all would save 2 trillion over ten years both the mercatus and peri studies were cited by sanders in his senate paper both studies confirm sanders assertion that medicare for all will cost substantially less than the status quo phillip s line of questioning was a disservice to voters immediately after sanders s reply she failed to ask biden whether it was indeed true that medicare for all will cost substantially less than the status quo instead phillip asked biden does sen sanders owe voters a price tag on his healthcare plan the cnn moderator was not alone in her disservice research fails to disclose a single instance over the course of seven presidential debates to date in which a moderator asked any of the candidates who advocate for the expansion of the aca with a public option whether our current healthcare system costs more than the projected costs for medicare for all the how much will it cost question has been reserved only for those candidates like sanders and warren who champion medicare for all taxes the insurance industry s framing is also reflected by the degree to which sanders and warren have been hammered on the issue of the taxes what debate moderators overlook is the enormous sums in taxes that americans are already paying not for healthcare but as subsidies to the for profit insurance industry citing cms national health data sanders senate paper noted that 55 of the 47 trillion ten year cost to maintain the aca status quo 26 trillion will be funded by the government in fairness not all of that 26 trillion is paid as subsidies to the insurance industry under the aca major portions of it currently fund medicare and medicaid nevertheless it is troubling that debate moderators fail to press defenders of the aca status quo on what sanders described in financing medicare for all as the existing healthcare tax that he plans to eliminate according to princeton university economics professors anne case and angus deaton on average americans pay 8 000 more each year for healthcare than the citizens of any other nation like sanders and warren they consider premiums copays and deductibles a form of taxation albeit payable to the profitable private health insurance industry rather than to the government the princeton professors likened the combination of the existing healthcare tax premiums copays and deductibles to a tribute to a foreign power though we re doing it to ourselves sanders proposes a modest increase in taxes paid to the federal government he contends it would be more than offset by the elimination of premiums copays and deductibles after exempting the first 29 000 in income he would impose a 4 individual income tax in place of the monies employers now pay for group insurance coverage sanders who exempts the first 2 million in payroll would impose a 7 5 payroll tax on employers during one of the debates warren argued that medicare for all could be fully funded without a middle class increase in taxes paid to the government she may well be right currently the top marginal tax rate for incomes over 510 301 is 37 both sanders and rep alexandria ocasio cortez d ny propose a 70 top marginal rate for incomes over 10 million curiously when it comes to the top marginal rate these two self described democratic socialists are significantly more conservative than the former republican president dwight d eisenhower during ike s administration the top marginal tax rate was 91 given the degree of extreme income and wealth inequality where one individual jeff bezos earns 215 million per day a 91 top marginal tax rate seems reasonable i doubt anyone would shed a tear if bezos take home pay was reduced to just 2 million per day a 91 top marginal rate ought to be imposed on incomes over 5 million per year as opposed to 70 on incomes over 10 million as proposed by sanders and ocasio cortez that and sharp cuts to our war budget should significantly reduce if not eliminate the need for even a modest increase in taxes the middle class pays to the federal government indeed after treating premiums copays and deductibles as taxes economics professors emanuel saez and gabriel zuchman concluded that the adoption of the medicare for all act of 2019 would not only reduce middle class taxes but would also lead to the biggest increase in take home pay in a decade veterans for bernie cann4ing
old and new yemeni banknotes are pictured at a money exchange office in the southern port city of aden on thursday afp photo dubai a flare up of a currency war between yemen s foes has sent the riyal crashing aggravating a humanitarian crisis that has already driven millions to the brink of famine after five years of conflict the confrontation was sparked when the iran aligned houthi rebels who control the capital sanaa and most of the north banned the use of new banknotes printed by the central bank in aden which is run by the internationally recognised government the ban on the notes which were first issued three years ago came into effect on january 19 when residents and money changers stopped dealing with them under the threat of a 10 year jail term according to sources close to the rebels the houthis insist they are safeguarding the people against high inflation but the move has slashed purchasing power and effectively created two exchange rates around 682 to the dollar in aden and 600 in sanaa and the north the currency s value has dropped some 15 per cent in the south in the past five weeks and about 7 per cent in the north in a slide that shows no sign of slowing in the marketplaces of yemen stalls are piled high with tomatoes onions and bananas while nearby shopkeepers offer racks of clothes and consumer goods but ordinary people are increasingly distressed at the loss in value of their cash which has inflicted more misery in a long war that pits the houthis against the government which is backed by a saudi led coalition prices are extremely expensive we are not receiving our salaries and the situation is going from bad to worse said abdo a resident of the port city of aden in sanaa which has been under rebel control since 2014 residents also hit out at the measure the ban has resulted in massive harm to citizens many of us own quantities of the new banknotes but from now on we will not be able to use them to buy our day s food abdulaziz ali told afp a senior un official warned earlier this month that certain factors that threatened to trigger famine last year in yemen including a plunge in the value of the national currency were once again looming large with a rapidly depreciating riyal and disrupted salary payments we are again seeing some of the key conditions that brought yemen to the brink of famine a year ago ramesh rajasingham who coordinates humanitarian aid in the country told the un security council we must not let that happen again he said adding that even if it escapes famine yemen will remain the world s worst humanitarian crisis in 2020 the yemeni government moved the central bank from sanaa to aden in 2016 in order to have effective control on monetary policy currency and payment of wages but the central bank s historic home in sanaa is still operating under the houthis who have stewardship over the country s major consumer markets the sana a centre for strategic studies said in a recent report that the tussle threatened to collapse the riyal based system and had driven the country towards the use of hard currencies mostly saudi riyals and united states dollars a population in which millions already verge on starvation is set to bear increasing costs further eroded purchasing power and a deterioration in the humanitarian situation resulting from the escalating currency war it said anthony biswell an economic analyst from the sana a centre said that the north was suffering from a shortage in supply of the old riyals and that ordinary citizens were turning to the black market to convert their new notes for the south there will be an excess of the newly printed banknotes in circulation the expectation is it will lead to inflation he told afp the goods are coming in the major issue is purchasing power and people s ability to go buy commodities that are available in the market he said the government of president abed rabbo mansour hadi said the rebels measure was oppressive and will devastate the economy accusing the houthis of blackmailing the people the prime minister met with ambassadors of the european union and we called on them to apply pressure on the houthis to scrap the ban yemen s planning and international cooperation minister najeeb al ouj told afp a majority of yemen s population of 29 million are living in dire circumstances after five years of war with at least 11 million struggling to find enough food according to the un world food programme

urbanization as a path to prosperity chris wellisz washington dc jan 29 2020 ips growing up in new york city in the 1970s edward glaeser saw a great metropolis in decline crime was soaring garbage piled up on sidewalks as striking sanitation workers walked off the job the city teetered on the edge of bankruptcy by the mid 1980s it was clear that new york would bounce back but it could still be a scary place there was a triple homicide across the street from his school on the upper west side of manhattan glaeser was nevertheless captivated by new york s bustling street life and spent hours roaming its neighborhoods it was both wonderful and terrifying and it was hard not to be obsessed by it glaeser recalls in an interview at his office at harvard university today that sense of wonder still permeates glaeser s work as an urban economist he deploys the economist s theoretical tool kit to explore questions inspired by his youth in new york why do some cities fail while others flourish what accounts for sky high housing costs in san francisco how does the growth of cities differ in rich and poor countries i have always thought of myself as fundamentally a curious child glaeser 52 says rather than pushing well established literature forward he seeks to comprehend something that i really don t understand when i start out while still a graduate student at the university of chicago glaeser made his mark as a theorist of the benefits of agglomeration the idea that dense and diverse cities are hothouses of innovation energy and creativity that fuel economic growth in the years since his work has ranged across a breathtaking variety of subjects from rent control and real estate bubbles to property rights civil disobedience and carbon emissions for a couple decades now ed has been the leading thinker about the economics of place says lawrence summers a harvard professor who served as director of the national economic council under us president barack obama and the economics of urban areas are increasingly being seen as central to broad economic concerns glaeser and summers are collaborating on a study of the hardening divide between well educated affluent coastal regions of the united states and islands of economic stagnation in what they call the eastern heartland the interior states east of the mississippi river there in cities like flint michigan the proportion of prime age men who aren t working has been rising along with rates of opioid addiction disability and mortality how can policy help traditionally economists have been skeptical of the value of place based policies like enterprise zones that offer tax breaks to investors saying it is better to help people not places people they assumed would move to where the jobs were but labor mobility has declined in recent decades partly because of high housing costs partly because demand for relatively unskilled factory work has diminished breaking with economic orthodoxy glaeser and summers say that the federal government should tailor pro employment measures such as reducing the payroll tax or increasing tax credits to low earners to fit the needs of economically distressed areas such as west virginia they also make the case for boosting investment in education as a chicago trained economist glaeser is a strong believer in the magic of free markets and opposes measures that distort incentives i have always been against spatial redistribution taking from rich areas and giving to poor areas he says that doesn t mean that you want the same policies everywhere urban economics seemed like a natural pursuit for glaeser his german born father ludwig was an architect who taught him how the built environment shapes people s lives his mother elizabeth was an asset manager who introduced him to economics glaeser recalls how she used the example of competing cobblers to explain marginal cost pricing i remember thinking what an amazing and fascinating thing it is to think about the impact of competition he says he was 10 years old in high school glaeser excelled at history and mathematics as a princeton university undergraduate he considered majoring in political science before choosing economics seeing it as a path to wall street but dreams of a career in finance ended with the stock market crash of 1987 just as he started job interviews so he opted for graduate school because it didn t seem like i was cutting off many options he says then i got to chicago and that was when i really fell in love with economics glaeser keeps a framed photograph of himself with gary becker the chicago economist and nobel prize laureate becker taught him that the discipline s conceptual tools could be used to explore topics that had once been the domain of fields like sociology or anthropology topics like racial discrimination fertility and the family it was that sense of the creative side of economics that could work on a virtually unlimited canvas and try to make sense of any problem that you thought was important that was the part that was so exciting to me glaeser says at the time chicago economists robert lucas and paul romer were developing the so called endogenous growth theory which focused on the role of innovation and the exchange of ideas in economic development as glaeser recalls it lucas pointed to cities as places where knowledge spillovers occur meaning people can benefit from other people s ideas without paying for them think of a city like detroit early last century where henry ford used his experience as chief engineer at the edison illuminating company to start his automobile business that concept inspired a groundbreaking 1992 paper growth in cities glaeser and three co authors set out to use cities as a laboratory in which to test the new growth theories using 30 years of data covering 170 us cities they found that local competition and diversity rather than specialization are the prime motors of urban growth the paper instantly made glaeser a star and earned him a job offer from harvard glaeser showed that urban variety not specialization in one particular thing was a big driver of employment growth says joseph gyourko a professor at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school and a longtime collaborator it was ed s first really well cited article so it did start him on his path gyourko and glaeser started working together in the early 2000s when glaeser took a year s sabbatical at penn they wondered why some cities such as detroit declined so slowly and why so many people stayed instead of moving elsewhere they hit upon a simple answer housing is durable and as cities slump it becomes cheaper to live there that insight prompted a related question why is housing so much more expensive than the cost of construction in cities like new york and boston the answer land use restrictions limit density curbing the supply of housing and driving up prices it was basic economics yet until then urban economists hadn t focused on the role of regulation glaeser argues that excessive regulation is destructive of the very essence of urban life density cities thrive on the creativity that occurs when people living cheek by jowl exchange ideas and know how sunbelt cities like houston have grown because an easy regulatory environment keeps housing inexpensive to economists like glaeser building and zoning regulations are a tax on development some level of tax makes economic sense because construction imposes costs on residents in the form of noise congestion and pollution but overly stringent regulation often pushed by residents who want to keep out newcomers and protect their property values can make housing unaffordable for most people glaeser is similarly skeptical of historic preservation rules to the dismay of followers of jane jacobs the legendary critic of urban renewal projects who celebrated the lively street life of new york s old ethnic neighborhoods glaeser is a big jacobs fan he owns an autographed copy of her 1961 classic the death and life of great american cities but argues that her efforts to oppose development in greenwich village were at odds with her support for low income housing i believe that many of our oldest buildings are treasures he says but don t simultaneously pretend that that s a route toward affordability affordability is created by mass produced cheap housing or mass produced cheap commercial space and you might not like it aesthetically but that is the affordable route in 2000 glaeser published consumer city a paper he wrote with jed kolko and albert saiz in it he took the concept of agglomeration a step further arguing that people are drawn not only to the opportunities that cities offer but also to amenities such as theaters museums and restaurants we know that cities can attract the disproportionately young and innovative says richard florida a professor of urban studies at the university of toronto ed was identifying the factors driving that this whole idea that cities are not only places of production but places of consumption glaeser laments policies such as the mortgage interest deduction which encourages people to buy homes rather than rent apartments highway subsidies which make it easier to drive to the suburbs and a school system that disadvantages inner city students such policies he argues not only are antiurban but also contribute to climate change because city dwellers who live in smaller homes and use mass transit consume less electricity and gasoline than their suburban counterparts surprisingly he and his wife nancy who have three children decided to move to the suburbs of boston several years ago to glaeser it was a perfectly rational decision the suburbs offer more living space better schools and a reasonably fast commute already well known in academia glaeser started to reach a broader audience with the publication in 2011 of his bestselling book triumph of the city a lively study of urbanization from ancient baghdad to modern bangalore his eloquence and enthusiasm make him a sought after speaker at academic forums and ted talks invariably he is impeccably attired in well pressed suits and preaches the gospel of urbanization in crisp rapid fire sentences despite his celebrity he takes teaching seriously rebecca diamond who attended his advising sessions as a graduate student said he was generous with his time he taught me perspective and not to get too stuck in the weeds says diamond who now teaches at stanford university and stays in touch with glaeser developing world cities are his latest passion true to form he sees them as relatively uncharted territory neglected both by urban economists who focus on advanced economy cities and development economists who concentrate on rural areas they are also growing fast and their physical and institutional infrastructure are works in progress so economists policy advice can have an impact the ability of economists to make a difference by getting engaged is just very large he says so i think it is the new frontier it also takes him to interesting places his latest research project with nava ashraf and alexia delfino of the london school of economics took him to the markets of lusaka zambia to study barriers to female entrepreneurship they found women are more likely to go into business if the rule of law is strong enough to help overcome inherently unequal relations with men like jane jacobs glaeser is big believer in observing what he sees around him you don t really understand a city until you ve actually walked in the streets glaeser says that s what makes ed a first rate applied theorist says gyourko you ve got to get your hands messy in the data sometimes data is just walking around while researching triumph of the city glaeser explored places like mumbai s dharavi quarter which was a completely magical experience among the world s most densely populated places dharavi hums with entrepreneurial energy with potters tailors and other craftsmen working side by side in cramped ill lit quarters at the same time unpaved streets polluted air and open sewers are reminders of the downsides of density but glaeser doesn t bemoan the poverty of such places on the contrary he says cities attract the poor precisely because they offer opportunity for the developing world urbanization is the best path to prosperity for all of their problems amazing things are happening in india and sub saharan africa and latin america glaeser says and things obviously don t always go the right direction but cities have been working miracles of collaboration for thousands of years and whenever i go to a developing world city it is obvious to me that the age of miracles is not over opinions expressed in articles and other materials are those of the authors they do not necessarily reflect imf policy

countering the deadly media supported health insurance industry spin ernest a canning byon 1 29 2020 9 35am pt as americans are being hoodwinked by a slick health insurance industry pr campaign the time has come to carefully examine medicare for all by separating myth from reality while morally repugnant the privately owned health insurance industry s deceptions are economically understandable by the time sen bernie sanders i vt introduced the medicare for all act of 2019 in the u s senate two months after rep pramila jayapal d wa co chair of the progressive caucus introduced h r 1384 medicare for all act of 2019 in the house the industry realized that it faced an existential threat medicare for all would create an entirely new single payer healthcare system that with limited exceptions cosmetic surgery home care nursing would eliminate the need for anyone to purchase health insurance while the parasitic health insurance industry has faced off against them in the past single payer advocates are better positioned to prevail in 2020 than at any time in the past 75 years sanders single payer healthcare legislation s 1129 was co sponsored by 14 senate democrats those co sponsors included several presidential candidates elizabeth warren d ma kirsten gillibrand d ny cory booker d nj and kamela harris d ca more than one half of all democrats in the house 112 co sponsored jayapal s version of the bill medicare for all is also supported by 63 national organizations more importantly a poll taken in 2018 prior to a barrage of pro insurance industry propaganda found that medicare for all was immensely popular it was supported by a whopping 70 of all americans including 84 of democrats and a mind boggling 52 of republicans with their very survival at stake the health insurance profiteers along with large hospitals and the pharmaceutical industry created a new pr front group partnership for america s healthcare future pahf to wage their defensive according to wendell potter a former cigna executive and author of deadly spin how pr is killing healthcare and deceiving americans 2011 pahf is the industry s newest propaganda arm in addition to carefully timed commercial advertising pahf acts in concert with industry funded politicians and mainstream media pundits their goal is to erect an industry friendly frame that serves to mask the blatant deficiencies of our inordinately expensive yet woefully inefficient subsidized free market healthcare system this as julie hollar of the media watchdog fair observed has succeeded in turning some of the recent democratic presidential debates into over the top industry friendly spectacle potter the recovering healthcare industry veteran told los angeles times columnist michael hiltzek health insurers have been successful at two things making money and getting the american public to believe they re essential but the truth argues hiltzik is that private health insurers have contributed nothing to the american healthcare system most americans he charges blindly tolerate our inordinately expensive yet dysfunctional private insurance system because the vast majority don t have a complex interaction with the healthcare system within a given year of patients account for more than one fifth of all medical spending and 10 account for two thirds far too many americans fail to appreciate the inadequacies of our private insurance system until those inadequacies are thrust upon them by an unexpected serious illness or injury according to the pulitzer prize winning business columnist hence the need to separate healthcare insurance myth from fact based reality original medicare is not single payer medicare for all should not be confused with the existing medicare system whose coverage limitations opened the door to a lucrative and rapidly growing market for supplemental insurance known as medicare advantage ma after that supplemental market doubled in size over the span of a decade ma allowed the private for profit insurance industry to capture 200 billion in ma premiums in a single year 2017 our existing medicare system does not eliminate all copays and deductibles it can be especially costly for those who fall within the prescription medication coverage gap aka the donut hole under sanders proposed medicare for all annual out of pocket prescription drug expenses for each individual would be capped at 200 per year sen elizabeth warren d ma proposes a more modest 250 month prescription drug cap unlike the current medicare system the new single payer system set forth in the legislation now pending before congress would fully cover vision hearing dental and long term care medicare for all provides comprehensive coverage for everyone no one would have to pay premiums copays or deductibles why medicare for all the u s maintains an extraordinarily expensive yet strikingly inefficient healthcare system that fails to measure up to systems offered by its single payer counterparts we spend nearly twice as much per capita for healthcare than the average per capita healthcare expenditures amongst the 34 single payer nation members of the organization for economic cooperation and development oced according to a 2014 commonwealth fund study however the u s healthcare delivery system ranked dead last amongst eleven industrial nations in terms of quality efficiency access to care and healthy lives the u s ranked last on infant mortality and on deaths that were potentially preventable it also ranked last on every measure of cost related access because access to healthcare in the u s is related to one s ability to pay the inefficiencies of the system have a disparate impact upon people of color infant mortality amongst african americans for example is 2 3 times greater than it is amongst non hispanic whites inefficiencies remained a central problem even after key provisions of barack obama s affordable care act aca went into effect citing its own healthcare efficiency index bloomberg reported in 2016 that the u s healthcare system is one of the world s least efficient ranking 50th out of the 55 countries our current subsidized free market system is not just inefficient it s deadly where no one dies in single payer countries due to lack of coverage the death toll extracted by our free market system is nothing short of ghastly nearly 45 000 deaths per year according to a 2009 harvard medical study that pre aca study was issued at a time when 46 3 million americans were uninsured with 58 9 million uninsured for at least part of the year according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc by 2019 with the advent of the aca there were still 30 1 million americans uninsured according to the cdc the decline in the number of uninsured suggests there has likely been a proportionate reduction in the current number of americans who die each year for lack of insurance the 2009 harvard medical study figure did not include the number of americans who die every year because of insurance industry schemes to delay or deny authorizations for life sustaining treatment those schemes are by no means limited to pre existing conditions which the aca eliminated although the subsidized free market system ushered in by the aca reduced the number of uninsured americans there are now 41 million underinsured adults ages 19 64 in the u s more than half 52 of underinsured adults face medically induced financial debt in 2018 even after years of aca implementation more than 530 000 americans filed for bankruptcy as a result of unpaid medical bills according to a study published by the american public health association that figure includes many individuals who have insurance but can t afford exorbitant co pays and deductibles no one goes bankrupt by reason of unpaid medical bills in single payer countries in states that have legalized physician assisted suicides patients faced with insurance industry refusals to fully cover life sustaining treatment have chosen death in order to avoid saddling their loved ones with unpaid medical bills according to a 2017 medical study why eliminate insurers together with an out of control pharmaceutical industry for profit insurers are a principal source of both exorbitant healthcare costs and inefficiencies in the united states in just one year 2017 americans spent 812 billion or 34 of our total healthcare expenditures simply to cover administrative costs of its inefficient multi payer healthcare system according to a newly released study published by the annals of internal medicine aim that s nearly 200 billion more than the u s spent on its global war machine during fy 2017 that 812 billion administrative cost expenditure does not include the profits the insurance industry extracted from the system in 2018 for example the ceos of the eight largest publicly traded health insurance companies received a combined 145 million in total compensation those same companies reported 21 9 billion in profits the amount that the u s spends per capita on administrative costs 2 497 is more than 4 ½ times greater than per capita administrative costs 551 in canada a single payer nation by replacing our inefficient multi payer system with a single payer system americans could save 600 billion per year in administrative costs alone according to the authors of the aim study inefficiency and waste are the principal reasons why single payer advocates like wendell potter reject efforts to reform our existing multi payer system via a public option during the 2009 healthcare debate in congress potter supported calls to reform the existing free market system via the creation of a public option but only because it was the best that could be achieved at that time given the political realities as we reported back then both president obama who had met privately with health insurance executives and the leadership of the then democratically controlled house essentially shut single payer advocates out of the debate the aca which was drafted by a former wellpoint vp working in the office of sen max baucus d mt would as then predicted by rep dennis kucinich d oh eventually move forward without the originally promised public option although it would have had a favorable impact with respect to coverage the core problem with a public option potter asserts is that it allows the private insurance industry to maintain its status as the principal gatekeeper of our dysfunctional and inefficient profit driven system costs the questions posed by cnn moderator abby phillip to sanders and former vp joe biden during the jan 20 2020 debate provide a paradigm example of how the corporate owned mainstream media helps to control the public s perception of medicare for all by filtering it through an insurance industry frame abby phillip sen sanders you have consistently refused to say exactly how much your medicare for all plan is going to cost don t voters deserve to see the price tag before you send them a bill that could cost tens of trillions of dollars whether deliberate or the result of failing to do her homework the first part of that question was flat out wrong in a senate paper entitled financing medicare for all the vermont senator laid out in detail multiple options to pay for medicare for all without raising the deficit these include but are not limited to the elimination of existing health tax expenditures restoring a more progressive income tax imposing a 70 top marginal rate for incomes over 10 million imposing a 77 top inheritance tax rate on transfers of extreme wealth and repealing the accounting gimmicks that have permitted the nation s largest corporations not to mention multi national corporations to earn billions of dollars yet not pay so much as one dime in federal income taxes sanders also mentions savings with respect to significant cuts in the military budget and by ending our forever 6 trillion global war on terror sanders provided a direct and accurate answer to philip s argumentative question medicare for all will cost substantially less than the status quo according the the bi partisan committee for a responsible budget the ten year estimated cost for a single payer medicare for all system is approximately 28 32 trillion an enormous sum that would no doubt cause many americans to mistakenly believe that medicare for all is an unattainable pipe dream according to sander s senate paper filed in support of his medicare for all act of 2019 however that ten year 28 32 trillion cost estimate to maintain a single payer medicare for all system would be 18 68 trillion less than the 47 trillion the center for medicare medicaid services cms estimated cost to maintain the aca status quo during the period 2018 2027 according to a 11 30 18 study released by the umass amherst political economy research institute peri medicare for all would save a more modest 5 1 trillion over ten years a separate study performed by the ultra conservative koch funded mercatus center estimated that medicare for all would save 2 trillion over ten years both the mercatus and peri studies were cited by sanders in his senate paper both studies confirm sanders assertion that medicare for all will cost substantially less than the status quo phillip s line of questioning was a disservice to voters immediately after sanders s reply she failed to ask biden whether it was indeed true that medicare for all will cost substantially less than the status quo instead phillip asked biden does sen sanders owe voters a price tag on his healthcare plan the cnn moderator was not alone in her disservice research fails to disclose a single instance over the course of seven presidential debates to date in which a moderator asked any of the candidates who advocate for the expansion of the aca with a public option whether our current healthcare system costs more than the projected costs for medicare for all the how much will it cost question has been reserved only for those candidates like sanders and warren who champion medicare for all taxes the insurance industry s framing is also reflected by the degree to which sanders and warren have been hammered on the issue of the taxes what debate moderators overlook is the enormous sums in taxes that americans are already paying not for healthcare but as subsidies to the for profit insurance industry citing cms national health data sanders senate paper noted that 55 of the 47 trillion ten year cost to maintain the aca status quo 26 trillion will be funded by the government in fairness not all of that 26 trillion is paid as subsidies to the insurance industry under the aca major portions of it currently fund medicare and medicaid nevertheless it is troubling that debate moderators fail to press defenders of the aca status quo on what sanders described in financing medicare for all as the existing healthcare tax that he plans to eliminate according to princeton university economics professors anne case and angus deaton on average americans pay 8 000 more each year for healthcare than the citizens of any other nation like sanders and warren they consider premiums copays and deductibles a form of taxation albeit payable to the profitable private health insurance industry rather than to the government the princeton professors likened the combination of the existing healthcare tax premiums copays and deductibles to a tribute to a foreign power though we re doing it to ourselves sanders proposes a modest increase in taxes paid to the federal government he contends it would be more than offset by the elimination of premiums copays and deductibles after exempting the first 29 000 in income he would impose a 4 individual income tax in place of the monies employers now pay for group insurance coverage sanders who exempts the first 2 million in payroll would impose a 7 5 payroll tax on employers during one of the debates warren argued that medicare for all could be fully funded without a middle class increase in taxes paid to the government she may well be right currently the top marginal tax rate for incomes over 510 301 is 37 both sanders and rep alexandria ocasio cortez d ny propose a 70 top marginal rate for incomes over 10 million curiously when it comes to the top marginal rate these two self described democratic socialists are significantly more conservative than the former republican president dwight d eisenhower during ike s administration the top marginal tax rate was 91 given the degree of extreme income and wealth inequality where one individual jeff bezos earns 215 million per day a 91 top marginal tax rate seems reasonable i doubt anyone would shed a tear if bezos take home pay was reduced to just 2 million per day a 91 top marginal rate ought to be imposed on incomes over 5 million

indianapolis jan 29 2020 globe newswire duke realty corporation nyse dre the largest domestic only logistics reit today reported results for the fourth quarter and full year 2019 jim connor chairman and chief executive officer said we had a great fourth quarter which was a strong finish to a year of superb operational performance fourth quarter lease up of speculative projects set the stage for further growth and a great start to 2020 during the quarter we executed 2 3 million square feet of first generation leasing of speculative development properties stabilizing four in service properties and leasing a one million square foot property that we began last march and is still under development this leasing activity outperformed our original underwriting in both time to lease up and rental rates and reduces our speculative exposure total leasing volume for the quarter including build to suit and second generation leases was 8 3 million square feet and is the first time that we ve executed more than 7 million square feet of leases in three consecutive quarters as the result of this leasing activity we increased both in service occupancy and total occupancy by 40 basis points from september 30 2019 same property net operating income for the fourth quarter increased from the fourth quarter of 2018 by 3 7 percent same property growth for the quarter was driven by continued strong rent growth which offset a 40 basis point decline in average commencement occupancy within our same property portfolio from the fourth quarter of 2018 we anticipate net operating income from non same store properties which was 18 5 percent of total net operating income for the quarter will continue to be a source of growth as we lease up recently developed properties and keep up a robust pace of new development starts rental rate growth on second generation leases continued at a strong pace at 32 1 percent on a net effective basis and 11 9 percent on a cash basis we renewed 69 percent of our expiring leases during the fourth quarter and when considering lease expirations with an immediate backfill our effective re leasing percentage was 85 percent our renewal percentage for the

year 2018 net income per share increased from 2018 as the result of continued growth in the company s asset base operational performance and gains on property sales which were partially offset by the

quarter of 2019 compared to 0 36 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2018 ffo per diluted share as defined by nareit decreased from the fourth quarter of 2018 due to a loss on debt

the full year 2018 the increase from 2018 in ffo as defined by nareit was due to continued growth in the company s asset base and improved operational performance which was partially offset by the

for the fourth quarter of 2018 core ffo was 1 44 per diluted share for the full year 2019 compared to 1 33 per diluted share for the full year 2018 the increase to core ffo was due to continued growth

on february 14 2020 2020 earnings guidance a reconciliation of the company s guidance for diluted net income per common share to ffo as defined by nareit and to core ffo is included in the financial tables to this release the company issued guidance for net income of 0 92 to 1 14 per diluted share the company issued guidance for ffo as defined by nareit of 1 42 to 1 52 per diluted share we are introducing 2020 guidance for core ffo of 1 48 to 1 54 per diluted share as well as guidance for an increase in affo of between 3 1 percent and 7 7 percent on a share adjusted basis our operating focus in 2020 will be to drive rent growth and minimize capital expenditures possibly risking some occupancy as we continue to push for deal quality due to speculative projects coming on line and pending lease expirations we expect occupancy to trend down slightly as the year progresses although our range of guidance for average in service occupancy in 2020 is between 95 1 percent and 97 1 percent which is consistent with 2019 our range of guidance for average percent leased of our stabilized portfolio is between 96 0 percent and 98 0 percent the expected slight decrease in stabilized occupancy will be a drag on same property noi growth we will continue to focus on rental rate growth and asset management however and expect rent growth to drive overall growth in same property net operating income to an expected range of between 3 6 percent and 4 4 percent we will also continue to focus on development opportunities which will include speculative projects in certain markets and a good prospect list for build to suit developments our overall development starts for 2020 will depend on maintaining our development pipeline near 50 percent leased and our guidance for 2020 development starts is between 675 million and 875 million ranges for the other key assumptions underlying this guidance are as follows dispositions of properties mostly in the midwest and other targeted submarkets in a range of 300 million to 500 million with the proceeds used to fund development and acquisitions acquisitions of properties in a range of 100 million to 300 million general and administrative expenses ranging from 55 million to 59 million more specific assumptions and components of the company s 2020 guidance will be available by 6 00 p m eastern time today through the investor relations section of the company s website ffo and affo reporting definitions ffo ffo is a non gaap performance measure computed in accordance with standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit funds from operations white paper 2018 restatement it is calculated as net income attributable to common shareholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate gains and losses on sales of real estate assets including real estate assets incidental to our business and related taxes gains and losses from change in control impairment charges related to real estate assets including real estate assets incidental to our business and similar adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures and partially owned consolidated entities we believe ffo to be most directly comparable to net income attributable to common shareholders as defined by gaap ffo does not represent a measure of liquidity nor is it indicative of funds available for our cash needs including our ability to make cash distributions to shareholders core ffo core ffo is computed as ffo adjusted for certain items that are generally non cash in nature and that can create significant earnings volatility and do not directly relate to our core business operations the adjustments include tax expenses or benefits related to i changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances ii changes in tax exposure accruals that were established as the result of the previous adoption of new accounting principles or iii taxable income loss related to other items excluded from ffo or core ffo collectively referred to as other income tax items gains or losses on debt transactions gains or losses from involuntary conversion from weather events or natural disasters promote income severance and other charges related to major overhead restructuring activities and the expense impact of costs attributable to successful leasing activities although our calculation of core ffo differs from nareit s definition of ffo and may not be comparable to that of other reits and real estate companies we believe it provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance affo affo is defined by the company as the core ffo as defined above less recurring building improvements and total second generation capital expenditures the leasing of vacant space that had previously been under lease by the company is referred to as second generation lease activity related

if you refer to the bank of mauritius s monthly statistical bulletin for december 2019 you will find in table 58 for example figures that should raise alarm bells about what has been happening and about what is coming there is no need to couch what follows into elaborate convoluted language we have been living beyond our means and as a result the rupee has been sliding against all currencies during 2019 including against the kenyan shilling the south african rand and the indian rupee if you could buy a united states dollar for rs 34 861 on average in december 2018 it took rs 36 978 to get one a year later 6 1 the same trend hit to varying degrees the british sterling 9 9 the euro 3 6 the indian rupee 5 5 even the south african rand 4 8 that is wonderful news no doubt for exporters who were looking for some solace in the wake of fresh labour laws a minimum wage hike and the portable pension scheme which will all add to operating costs as is usual this will make a difference to the survival prospects of exporters who are borderline financially and globally help mauritius look more competitive on foreign markets however as usual there will be a cost to it in the form of imported inflation you can bet your bottom that a 5 deterioration of exchange rates say will eventually work its way into retail prices this should worry officialdom at least a bit because it will unravel one of the shining achievements of 2019 i e low inflation of 0 5 and at least in part erode the salary and pension hikes so generously consented to in the run up to november elections the beneficiaries of those generosities cannot fail to notice the price hikes they shop themselves and their purses are neither bottomless nor elastic on the other hand this might help slow down consumption and reduce the trade imbalance rs 124 billion or nearly 25 of gdp it is interesting to note that this rupee weakening actually built up the bom reserves from which the government retrieved rs 18 billion to repay debt but that it did not help government since the foreign debt being repaid by anticipation also got beefed up in the same proportion only what was left behind in the bom balance sheet was perked up i suppose what needs to be repeated here is that there are definite limits to easy economic solutions depreciating the rupee has never been anything else but a palliative to mask the issue of an overpriced national currency that favours and sucks in imports at the expense of exports why overpriced because our economy is not doing all that well and has low productivity and exchange rates should reflect that understand this we do have efficient innovative world competitive companies in this country but the problem is that we do not have enough of them and that as a result the country as a whole shows up as not very productive burdened by the sloths overpricing the currency to favour consumption or depreciating it to save the forex earners is easy working hard moulding our schools to perform much better having a supportive bureaucracy improving national productivity levels cutting out waste and small mindedness favouring meritocracy rather than sycophancy being transparent telling the truth to instead of mollycoddling the population is hard can we at least make a start by being a little more battle hardened in the face of cyclones and tropical downpours

quarter of 2018 fourth quarter 2019 tax equivalent net interest margin of 3 34 increased by 19 basis points compared to the linked quarter our fourth quarter results provided a nice performance rebound and reflect an ongoing strategic focus on managing our funding costs controlling non interest expense integrating and fully leveraging recently acquired locations and staff and our efforts to resolve a pair of commercial credits that affected our asset quality metrics said patrick l ryan president and chief executive officer we realized a solid increase in core profitability for the fourth quarter even with increased tax expense related to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets we believe that we re well positioned to drive improved earnings performance during 2020 while total deposits for the full year were up almost 18 we allowed some price sensitive time deposits to run off during the fourth quarter which is reflected in a 14 basis point drop in the average rate for interest bearing deposits from the linked third quarter our average balance for non interest bearing deposits was up by nearly 40 million from third quarter 2019 positively impacted by the grand bank acquisition and favorable results related to our commercial deposit gathering efforts growth in this area remains our focus these efforts are closely aligned with a primary operating strategy for 2020 of stabilizing our net interest margin non interest expense for the fourth quarter was up by just 1 3 year over year which we consider a solid accomplishment when you factor in a full quarter of expenses related to the staff and facilities acquired in our grand bank transaction linked quarter expenses excluding merger related costs in the third quarter were up 9 4 primarily a result of the grand bank acquisition continued effective management of our expenses will help our efforts to drive more to our bottom line we completed the successful system integration of the grand bank locations and staff in december we re pleased by the reaction of the grand bank customers as they get to know our expanded menu of products and services while being served by familiar staff while not a large transaction it has made us the second largest community bank by deposit share for mercer county and enhanced our market presence going into 2020 our loan growth of 261 million for 2019 was very strong and reflected an active organic pipeline and the addition of the grand bank portfolio at the end of the third quarter during the fourth quarter we experienced some early paydowns of commercial real estate loans which had the effect of lowering our period end loan balance in relation to the end of third quarter however we did benefit from elevated levels of prepayment penalty income in the quarter our commercial real estate pipeline remains strong and active and we plan to remain a fully engaged participant in this market during 2020 we do plan to moderate the pace at which we grow our loan book to be more selective and to provide more flexibility in how we fund this growth recently our nonperforming loans to total loans ratio has increased mainly as a result of two larger commercial relationships we believe that these credits are adequately collateralized the largest of these relationships is an 8 2 million commercial and industrial relationship that was added to nonperforming loans in the third quarter of 2019 the primary collateral for this relationship is under contract to be sold and we anticipate the loan being paid off during the first quarter of 2020 income statement net interest income for fourth quarter 2019 was 16 2 million an increase of 2 0 million or 14 4 compared to 14 2 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 this increase was driven by a 3 5 million or 18 1 increase in interest and dividend income to 23 0 million this increase was primarily a result of a 291 4 million increase in average loan balances with growth across all loan portfolios except consumer lending interest income for the fourth quarter 2019 included approximately 361 000 in loan prepayment penalty income compared to approximately 73 000 in the fourth quarter of 2018 the increase in interest income was partially offset by increased interest expense of 1 5 million for the comparable quarter increased interest expense was primarily a result of higher average balances and interest rates paid for time deposits and money market deposits loan and deposit balances for the fourth quarter reflect acquired and organic growth activity net interest income of 58 4 million for 2019 increased by 3 4 million or 6 2 compared to 54 9 million for 2018 interest and dividend income for 2019 was 84 2 million an increase of 11 4 million or 15 7 compared to 72 7 million for 2018 partially offset by interest expense of 25 8 million which increased 8 0 million or 45 0 from 2018 the increase in interest and dividend income for 2019 was also primarily driven by significant growth in average loans which increased by 211 8 million along with a 2 basis point increase in the average interest rate on loans compared to the prior year increased interest and dividend income was partially offset by higher interest expense on interest bearing deposits reflecting higher average balances and rates paid the fourth quarter 2019 tax equivalent net interest margin was 3 34 a decrease of 10 basis points compared to 3 44 for the prior year quarter and an increase of 19 basis points from the linked third quarter 2019 the decrease in the fourth quarter margin compared to 2018 was primarily the result of higher average balances and rates paid for interest bearing liabilities primarily money market and time deposits the increase in interest bearing liability costs was partially offset by a volume related increase in interest income on interest earning assets the improvement from the linked third quarter was driven by increased loan volume and a higher average rate for interest earning assets along with a 14 basis point decrease in the average rate for interest bearing liabilities the net interest margin for 2019 was 3 32 a decrease of 25 basis points compared to 3 57 for the prior year was primarily driven by increased average balances for money market and time deposits as well as a 40 basis point increase in the average rate on

million compared to 1 6 million in the linked third quarter 2019 the 2019 provision for loan losses was 4 0 million compared to 3 4 million for the prior year period the increase in the provision amount for the full year was primarily a result of continued organic growth in the bank s commercial loan portfolio and elevated levels of charge offs in 2019 compared to the prior year fourth quarter 2019 non interest income increased 509 000 to 1 5 million from 1 0 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 the increase was primarily a result of loan swap referral fees an increase in service fees on deposit accounts and increased income from bank owned life insurance non interest income for 2019 totaled 4 0 million an increase of 543 000 compared to 3 5 million for 2018 the annual increase was primarily a result of the same factors as the quarter over quarter increase non interest expense for fourth quarter 2019 totaled 9 3 million an increase of 119 000 or 1 3 compared to 9 2 million for the prior year quarter and an increase of 799 000 compared to the third quarter of 2019 after excluding 984 000 in merger related expenses from the third quarter the higher non interest expense compared to fourth quarter 2018 was primarily a result of increased salaries and employee benefits as well as data processing expense as a result of the grand bank acquisition on september 30 2019 partially offset by lower other professional and regulatory fees excluding merger related costs in the third quarter of 2019 the increase in the fourth quarter compared to the linked third quarter was mainly the result of increased salaries and employee benefits higher occupancy and equipment cost and an increase in other expense non interest expense for 2019 totaled 36 9 million an increase of 3 6 million or 10 9 compared to 33 3 million for 2018 the 2019 increase in non interest expense over the prior year was also primarily a result of increased salaries and employee benefits expense an

in the linked third quarter 2019 the effective tax rate for the full year was 29 0 compared to 18 7 for 2018 in december 2019 the state of new jersey issued a clarifying technical bulletin related to the impact of the new tax legislation enacted in july 2018 specifically related to the combined income tax reporting for certain members of a commonly controlled unitary business group this technical

000 during the fourth quarter of 2019 balance sheet total assets at december 31 2019 were 2 01 billion an increase of 302 2 million or 17 7 compared to 1 71 billion at december 31 2018 due primarily

and acquired balances stockholders equity increased to 228 2 million at december 31 2019 up 33 4 million or 17 1 compared to 194 8 million at december 31 2018 the increase was primarily the result of the bank s issuance of additional common shares for the acquisition of grand bank which added 18 4 million to stockholders equity the increase was also due to a 12 9 million increase in retained earnings which was a result of the bank s net income offset somewhat by cash dividends asset quality net charge offs for the fourth quarter 2019 were 325 000 compared to 7 000 for fourth quarter 2018 and 1 1 million for the linked third quarter of 2019 net charge offs as an annualized percentage of average loans were 0 07 in fourth quarter 2019 compared to 0 00 for fourth quarter 2018 and 0 28 for

chris wellisz credit porter gifford washington dc jan 29 ips growing up in new york city in the 1970s edward glaeser saw a great metropolis in decline crime was soaring garbage piled up on sidewalks as striking sanitation workers walked off the job the city teetered on the edge of bankruptcy by the mid 1980s it was clear that new york would bounce back but it could still be a scary place there was a triple homicide across the street from his school on the upper west side of manhattan glaeser was nevertheless captivated by new york s bustling street life and spent hours roaming its neighborhoods it was both wonderful and terrifying and it was hard not to be obsessed by it glaeser recalls in an interview at his office at harvard university today that sense of wonder still permeates glaeser s work as an urban economist he deploys the economist s theoretical tool kit to explore questions inspired by his youth in new york why do some cities fail while others flourish what accounts for sky high housing costs in san francisco how does the growth of cities differ in rich and poor countries i have always thought of myself as fundamentally a curious child glaeser 52 says rather than pushing well established literature forward he seeks to comprehend something that i really don t understand when i start out while still a graduate student at the university of chicago glaeser made his mark as a theorist of the benefits of agglomeration the idea that dense and diverse cities are hothouses of innovation energy and creativity that fuel economic growth in the years since his work has ranged across a breathtaking variety of subjects from rent control and real estate bubbles to property rights civil disobedience and carbon emissions for a couple decades now ed has been the leading thinker about the economics of place says lawrence summers a harvard professor who served as director of the national economic council under us president barack obama and the economics of urban areas are increasingly being seen as central to broad economic concerns glaeser and summers are collaborating on a study of the hardening divide between well educated affluent coastal regions of the united states and islands of economic stagnation in what they call the eastern heartland the interior states east of the mississippi river there in cities like flint michigan the proportion of prime age men who aren t working has been rising along with rates of opioid addiction disability and mortality how can policy help traditionally economists have been skeptical of the value of place based policies like enterprise zones that offer tax breaks to investors saying it is better to help people not places people they assumed would move to where the jobs were but labor mobility has declined in recent decades partly because of high housing costs partly because demand for relatively unskilled factory work has diminished breaking with economic orthodoxy glaeser and summers say that the federal government should tailor pro employment measures such as reducing the payroll tax or increasing tax credits to low earners to fit the needs of economically distressed areas such as west virginia they also make the case for boosting investment in education as a chicago trained economist glaeser is a strong believer in the magic of free markets and opposes measures that distort incentives i have always been against spatial redistribution taking from rich areas and giving to poor areas he says that doesn t mean that you want the same policies everywhere urban economics seemed like a natural pursuit for glaeser his german born father ludwig was an architect who taught him how the built environment shapes people s lives his mother elizabeth was an asset manager who introduced him to economics glaeser recalls how she used the example of competing cobblers to explain marginal cost pricing i remember thinking what an amazing and fascinating thing it is to think about the impact of competition he says he was 10 years old in high school glaeser excelled at history and mathematics as a princeton university undergraduate he considered majoring in political science before choosing economics seeing it as a path to wall street but dreams of a career in finance ended with the stock market crash of 1987 just as he started job interviews so he opted for graduate school because it didn t seem like i was cutting off many options he says then i got to chicago and that was when i really fell in love with economics glaeser keeps a framed photograph of himself with gary becker the chicago economist and nobel prize laureate becker taught him that the discipline s conceptual tools could be used to explore topics that had once been the domain of fields like sociology or anthropology topics like racial discrimination fertility and the family it was that sense of the creative side of economics that could work on a virtually unlimited canvas and try to make sense of any problem that you thought was important that was the part that was so exciting to me glaeser says at the time chicago economists robert lucas and paul romer were developing the so called endogenous growth theory which focused on the role of innovation and the exchange of ideas in economic development as glaeser recalls it lucas pointed to cities as places where knowledge spillovers occur meaning people can benefit from other people s ideas without paying for them think of a city like detroit early last century where henry ford used his experience as chief engineer at the edison illuminating company to start his automobile business that concept inspired a groundbreaking 1992 paper growth in cities glaeser and three co authors set out to use cities as a laboratory in which to test the new growth theories using 30 years of data covering 170 us cities they found that local competition and diversity rather than specialization are the prime motors of urban growth the paper instantly made glaeser a star and earned him a job offer from harvard glaeser showed that urban variety not specialization in one particular thing was a big driver of employment growth says joseph gyourko a professor at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school and a longtime collaborator it was ed s first really well cited article so it did start him on his path gyourko and glaeser started working together in the early 2000s when glaeser took a year s sabbatical at penn they wondered why some cities such as detroit declined so slowly and why so many people stayed instead of moving elsewhere they hit upon a simple answer housing is durable and as cities slump it becomes cheaper to live there that insight prompted a related question why is housing so much more expensive than the cost of construction in cities like new york and boston the answer land use restrictions limit density curbing the supply of housing and driving up prices it was basic economics yet until then urban economists hadn t focused on the role of regulation glaeser argues that excessive regulation is destructive of the very essence of urban life density cities thrive on the creativity that occurs when people living cheek by jowl exchange ideas and know how sunbelt cities like houston have grown because an easy regulatory environment keeps housing inexpensive to economists like glaeser building and zoning regulations are a tax on development some level of tax makes economic sense because construction imposes costs on residents in the form of noise congestion and pollution but overly stringent regulation often pushed by residents who want to keep out newcomers and protect their property values can make housing unaffordable for most people glaeser is similarly skeptical of historic preservation rules to the dismay of followers of jane jacobs the legendary critic of urban renewal projects who celebrated the lively street life of new york s old ethnic neighborhoods glaeser is a big jacobs fan he owns an autographed copy of her 1961 classic the death and life of great american cities but argues that her efforts to oppose development in greenwich village were at odds with her support for low income housing i believe that many of our oldest buildings are treasures he says but don t simultaneously pretend that that s a route toward affordability affordability is created by mass produced cheap housing or mass produced cheap commercial space and you might not like it aesthetically but that is the affordable route in 2000 glaeser published consumer city a paper he wrote with jed kolko and albert saiz in it he took the concept of agglomeration a step further arguing that people are drawn not only to the opportunities that cities offer but also to amenities such as theaters museums and restaurants we know that cities can attract the disproportionately young and innovative says richard florida a professor of urban studies at the university of toronto ed was identifying the factors driving that this whole idea that cities are not only places of production but places of consumption glaeser laments policies such as the mortgage interest deduction which encourages people to buy homes rather than rent apartments highway subsidies which make it easier to drive to the suburbs and a school system that disadvantages inner city students such policies he argues not only are antiurban but also contribute to climate change because city dwellers who live in smaller homes and use mass transit consume less electricity and gasoline than their suburban counterparts surprisingly he and his wife nancy who have three children decided to move to the suburbs of boston several years ago to glaeser it was a perfectly rational decision the suburbs offer more living space better schools and a reasonably fast commute already well known in academia glaeser started to reach a broader audience with the publication in 2011 of his bestselling book triumph of the city a lively study of urbanization from ancient baghdad to modern bangalore his eloquence and enthusiasm make him a sought after speaker at academic forums and ted talks invariably he is impeccably attired in well pressed suits and preaches the gospel of urbanization in crisp rapid fire sentences despite his celebrity he takes teaching seriously rebecca diamond who attended his advising sessions as a graduate student said he was generous with his time he taught me perspective and not to get too stuck in the weeds says diamond who now teaches at stanford university and stays in touch with glaeser developing world cities are his latest passion true to form he sees them as relatively uncharted territory neglected both by urban economists who focus on advanced economy cities and development economists who concentrate on rural areas they are also growing fast and their physical and institutional infrastructure are works in progress so economists policy advice can have an impact the ability of economists to make a difference by getting engaged is just very large he says so i think it is the new frontier it also takes him to interesting places his latest research project with nava ashraf and alexia delfino of the london school of economics took him to the markets of lusaka zambia to study barriers to female entrepreneurship they found women are more likely to go into business if the rule of law is strong enough to help overcome inherently unequal relations with men like jane jacobs glaeser is big believer in observing what he sees around him you don t really understand a city until you ve actually walked in the streets glaeser says that s what makes ed a first rate applied theorist says gyourko you ve got to get your hands messy in the data sometimes data is just walking around while researching triumph of the city glaeser explored places like mumbai s dharavi quarter which was a completely magical experience among the world s most densely populated places dharavi hums with entrepreneurial energy with potters tailors and other craftsmen working side by side in cramped ill lit quarters at the same time unpaved streets polluted air and open sewers are reminders of the downsides of density but glaeser doesn t bemoan the poverty of such places on the contrary he says cities attract the poor precisely because they offer opportunity for the developing world urbanization is the best path to prosperity for all of their problems amazing things are happening in india and sub saharan africa and latin america glaeser says

and adjusted ebitda which are not measures of financial performance under international financial reporting standards ifrs management defines ebitda as the net loss adjusted by removing interest tax amortization and depreciation management believes ebitda is a useful financial metric to assess its operating performance management defines adjusted ebitda as ebitda adjusted by removing other non recurring or non cash items including share based compensation transaction costs non cash consulting fees accretion expenses foreign exchange the non cash effects of accounting for biological assets changes in the fair value of contingent consideration payable write downs to inventory and losses on the disposal of property plant and equipment these metrics and measures are not recognized measures under ifrs do not have meanings prescribed under ifrs and are as a result unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies management believes adjusted ebitda enhance an investor s understanding of the company s financial and operating performance from period to period because they exclude certain material non cash items and certain other adjustments management believes are not reflective of the company s ongoing operations and performance as such these measures should not be considered in isolation or in lieu of review of our financial information reported

reported net income of 3 4 million or 0 49 per diluted common share for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to net income of 3 7 million or 0 54 per diluted common share for the third quarter of 2019 and net income of 3 8 million or 0 55 per diluted common share for the fourth quarter of 2018 the decrease in net income when comparing the three months ended september 30 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in net interest income of approximately 353 thousand and a reduction of loan fees collected of approximately 295 thousand partially offset by a 325 thousand reduction in non interest expenses the decrease in net income when comparing the three months ended december 31 2018 was attributed to an increase in non interest operating expenses resulting from the acquisition of 5 branches from beneficial bank which closed in may 2019 and the recording of a 125 thousand provision for loan losses in the fourth quarter of 2019 partially offset by an increase in service charges collected on deposits of 173 thousand for the twelve month period ended december 31 2019 the bank recorded net income of 10 1 million or 1 47 per diluted common share compared to 14 7 million or 2 14 per diluted common share for the same period in 2018 the decline in earnings was primarily due to an increase in the bank s provision for loan losses of 4 1 million of which 3 9 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2019 highlights for the quarter ended december 31 2019 are as follows net loans increased 109 3 million excluding 4 5 million in charge offs from the 1 07 billion at december 31 2018 this

32 1 over the same period in 2018 we are pleased with the strong earnings recorded this quarter supporting our investment in branch expansion we had strong growth in loans and deposits in the 4th quarter finishing the year with a 10 growth rate stated edward dietzler president ceo chairman richard gillespie noted that the bank continues to execute on its branch expansion program to strategically build a franchise by increasing our footprint along the i95 corridor we have 3 more branches planned for the first half of 2020 balance sheet review total assets were 1 45 billion at december 31 2019 an increase of 203 3 million or 16 2 when compared to 1 25 billion at the end of 2018 the primary reason for the increase in total assets was a result of the bank s branch acquisition from beneficial bank and wsfs bank in which the bank received 159 9 million in cash and recorded 15 7 in intangible and other assets the bank also recorded a 14 5 million right of use asset resulting from the adoption of fasb update no 2016 02 leases net loans also increased 104 8 million from the 1 07 billion at december 31 2018 cash and cash equivalents increased 46 2 million or 175 2 to 72 6 million as december 31 2019 investment securities classified available for sale increased 20 6 million from the 91 7 million as of december 31 2018 total deposits at december 31 2019 increased by 230 6 million or 22 9 when compared to december 31 2018 primarily due to acquiring 177 9 million in deposits in the beneficial bank branch acquisition partially offset by not renewing 58 2 million of brokered deposits which carry a higher cost when comparing december 31 2019 to balances at december 31 2018 interest checking increased 61 5 million savings accounts increased 60 0 million time deposits increased 62 0 million and non interest earning deposits increased 38 7 million in addition at the end of the quarter the bank did not have any outstanding balance in fhlb short term advances down from the 55 4 million level at december 31 2018 total stockholders equity increased 11 6 million or 6 3 when compared to the end of 2018 this increase was primarily due to earnings recorded during the twelve months of 2019 exercises of stock options from the bank s equity incentive plans and an increase of 1 1 million in the fair value of the available for sale investment portfolio the ratio of equity to total assets was 13 5 compared to 14 7 at december 31 2018 asset quality at december 31 2019 non performing assets were 2 4 million a decrease of 3 3 million or 57 1 when compared to 5 7 million at december 31 2018 this decrease at december 31 2019 from december 31 2018 was primarily due to 2 6 million in charge offs recorded in the first quarter consisting of a 1 9 million commercial and industrial loan and a 750 thousand partial charge off of a commercial real estate loan total troubled debt restructurings tdr totaled 9 3 million at december 31 2019 an increase of 8 0 million from year end 2018 resulting from the restructure of three commercial real estate loans to two separate borrowers all tdr s are performing to their agreed upon terms review of quarterly financial results net interest income was 10 4 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 10 8 million for the third quarter of 2019 and 10 3 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 the decrease from the previous quarter was a result of an increase in interest paid on deposits of 294 thousand or 6 6 and a decrease in interest income of 58 thousand the net interest margin for the fourth quarter 2019 was 3 10 decreasing 27 basis points when compared to the third quarter of 2019 this decrease was primarily associated with a decrease of 25 basis points of yield on earning assets resulting from the two 25 basis points rate reductions that occurred in september 2019 and october 2019 as well as the positive impact during the 3rd quarter related to large loan payoffs with deferred fees recorded to income when comparing the three month periods ended december 31 2019 and 2018 net interest income increased 106 thousand which was primarily due to a higher volume of average earnings assets of approximately 152 6 million interest and dividend income increased by 1 0 million offset by an increase in interest expense of 900 thousand the total rate on interest bearing liabilities which includes non interest bearing deposits for the three month period ended december 31 2019 and 2018 was 1 57 and 1 44 respectively for the twelve month period ended december 31 2019 net interest income was 41 5 million an increase of 442 thousand or 1 1 over the same period in 2018 this slight increase was primarily due to a higher volume of average earning assets of approximately 100 5 million partially offset by a 25 basis points reduction in net interest margin the provision for credit losses was 125 thousand and 4 8 million for the three and twelve months ended december 31 2019 respectively compared to no provision recorded and 665 thousand for the same periods in 2018 respectively when compared to the three months ended september 30 2019 the provision for credit losses was 125 thousand for both periods the bank was required to record a provision in both the fourth and third quarters of 2019 resulting from the overall growth in the loan portfolio the ratio of allowance for credit losses to period end loans was 1 06 at december 31 2019 and 1 10 at december 31 2018 which reflects management s assessment of the credit quality in the loan portfolio total non interest income for the fourth quarter of 2019 increased 193 thousand to 794 thousand or 32 1 when compared to the same period in 2018 this increase was primarily due to an increase in service charges on deposits of 173 thousand and a 27 thousand gain recorded on available for sale securities total non interest income comparing the three month periods ended december 31 2019 and september 30 2019 reflected a decrease of 283 thousand or 26 3 primarily due to a lower level of fees generated on loans recorded between the two periods for the twelve month period ended december 31 2019 non interest income increased 723 thousand or 27 2 primarily due to increases in service charges on deposits and loan fees collected total non interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2019 increased 557 thousand or 8 8 when compared to the same period in 2018 this increase was primarily due to an increase in occupancy and equipment expenses data processing communications expenses office expense and core deposit intangible expense all related to the beneficial bank branch acquisition partially offset by a reduction in professional fees and federal deposit insurance corporation premium expense resulting from the deposit insurance fund exceeding the reserve ratio of 1 38 the fdic issued a small bank assessment credit which allowed the bank to reverse any expenses that were recorded during the period covered which included the second third and fourth quarter of 2019 for the twelve month period ended december 31 2019 non interest expense was 27 7 million compared to 25 3 million for the same period in 2018 the 2 4 million increase was attributed to expenses recorded relating to the beneficial bank branch acquisition and its impact on other operating expenses along with expenses associated with new branch expansion for the three month period ended december 31 2019 the bank recorded income tax expense of 817 thousand resulting in an effective tax rate of 19 4 compared to 801 thousand income tax expense resulting in an effective tax rate of 17 7 for the three month period ended september 30 2019 and compared to an income tax expense of 801 thousand resulting in an effective tax rate of 17 5 for the three month period ended december 31 2018 the current effective tax yields for the three and twelve months ended december 31 2019 were

fed to stay on hold today but adopt a slightly more cautious tone yen retreats stocks rebound as risk sentiment recovers however bond and stock markets are not on the same page today barrage of corporate earnings coming up microsoft facebook tesla boeing no action from fed but perhaps a more dovish take investors may finally divert their attention away from the deadly coronavirus today when the federal reserve concludes its policy meeting at 19 00 gmt there s virtually no chance of a rate cut and since this is one of the smaller gatherings without updated economic forecasts the market reaction may depend entirely on chairman powell s remarks during the subsequent press conference at 19 30 gmt the american economy remains in good shape overall with growth running at a healthy clip around 2 supported by strong consumption and a revitalized housing market moreover trade concerns have dropped off the financial radar for the time being following the phase one us china deal yet there have also been some worrisome spots lately real wage growth has cooled and the broader labor market is exhibiting signs of stress too with job openings trending lower an early indication that employment growth may be about to slow the manufacturing sector continues to contract while inflation as measured by the core pce index remains muted and while trade worries have faded for now virus worries may have taken their place as the potential impact on the global economy is still a mystery all this suggests that if there is any change in tone from the fed today it might be towards a more cautious narrative where policymakers highlight the slowing data pulse and the mounting global risks if so the dollar might drop as investors price in a higher probability for a near term rate cut having said that the broader outlook for the world s reserve currency still seems positive there s no real alternative to the dollar right now which offers a unique combination of safety alongside high er interest rates compared to its major peers like the euro or yen for that to change either the fed needs to start cutting rates aggressively or the eurozone has to launch a meaningful fiscal spending package to boost growth risk sentiment recovers but investors still undecided riskier assets and safe havens continue to trade like a rollercoaster with american stocks recovering a good chunk of their virus related losses on tuesday while defensive currencies like the yen and swiss franc surrendered ground it seems no news is good news on the virus front with traders brushing aside the ever increasing number of confirmed cases taking heart from the measures taken in china and by other countries to prevent further spread of the virus the recovery also drew strength from solid us data the conference board consumer confidence index rose by more than expected in january allaying concerns about the outlook for consumption since this index is considered an early recessionary signal its unexpected strength likely pushed back the day of reckoning lifting stocks on wednesday though risk sentiment is caught in no man s land futures point to a modestly higher open on wall street but treasury yields are lower so the stock and bond markets are signaling very different things about what the day ahead holds as such a single headline could tip the scales moreover the bond stock market divergence highlights that risk sentiment is not out of the woods yet and that investors are still on the defensive even if equities are behaving otherwise thanks to an abundance of liquidity expectations about corporate earnings could also be a factor affecting this puzzle parade of earnings hits wall street today besides the fed traders will keep a close eye on quarterly earnings results by several heavyweight corporate players today notable names in the spotlight include microsoft facebook tesla and boeing
abc outrage solar in australia no longer a licence to steal money abc writers see only the cruel obstacles in the way of a wealth transfer who knew that the whole point of financial winds is to kill off dumb investments in the first place not the socialist abc if the abc weren t an advertising agency for big gov dependents the headline could have read artificial solar bubble busts in australia green investors burnt what big government giveth solar no longer a licence to print money investment has has fallen off a cliff and there is more of that coming queensland and south australia have been at the forefront of depressed solar prices but mr edis argues news south wales and victoria will not be far behind by business reporter stephen letts are they kidding business independent wholesale energy market consultant allan o neil has waded through the 660 pages of the generator statistical digest gsd 2019 and found one of the key themes was the struggle new solar farms were having with the messy reality of the electricity market back then nem wholesale prices were averaging close to 100 mwh megawatt hour and which poor suckers paid those bonanza prices oh wait the same ones who pay for the abc stephen letts doesn t ask it s all about corporate capitalistic projects and the renewable generators other key source source of income large scale generation certificates lgcs were roughly similar around 80 90 mwh per certificate an indication of the paucity of renewable energy in the system at the time the profits looked so good but they were all fake from subsidies and forced payments solar panel investors were investing in big government whims not in energy generation almost all the research and info in this came from allan o neill at wattclarity in a nutshell solar isn t profitable even in queesland because the lines are long transmission loses are large the electricity comes when customers don t need it and the government keeps insisting the solar farms pay for grid stability fcas because the grid needs it and solar doesn t supply it as i said last year random energy is the gift you don t need wind and solar power are the intermittent freeloaders on the electricity grid they are treated as if they re generators adding power to the grid but instead they provide something the grid doesn t need power that can t be guaranteed random gigawatts has the illusion of looking useful but it s the gift of a spare holiday house you don t know if you can use til the day before it s the spare fridge in the garage that overheats in hot weather the extra turkey for thanksgiving that might not arrive til the day after the bills the storage the clutter the chaos post note it s what they don t tell you as usual the lies by omission change the whole story stephen letts writes about the cost of solar power mr o neil said falling construction costs also helped spur the investment boom with some projects then reportedly being economic at all up revenues in the 60 80 mwh range but he doesn t mention that brown coal was not just economic but profitable at 30 mwh post note 2 it s a carbon tax by default brian brian the 80 90 mwh price for large scale generation certificates lgcs had nothing to do with a paucity of renewable energy in the system the price reflected the penalty for a power retailer who failed to buy sufficient certificates which was a non tax deductible fine of 65 per mwh indexed for inflation the non tax deductible provision meant that the cost to the retailer was around 87 of course renewables generators set their price close to that in order to temporarily bring retail prices down the regulator has authorised retailers to defer purchase of certificates for three years at which time they had to procure them demand for certificates dropped and the non cost effective renewables industry needing the subsidies represented by the certificates offered low cost deals to retailers when the three year hiatus ends and retailers have to purchase outstanding certificates as well as the certificates for that year prices will return to previous levels the large and small scale certificate subsidies are nothing more or less than a price on carbon dioxide by stealth

reported net income of 3 4 million or 0 49 per diluted common share for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to net income of 3 7 million or 0 54 per diluted common share for the third quarter of 2019 and net income of 3 8 million or 0 55 per diluted common share for the fourth quarter of 2018 the decrease in net income when comparing the three months ended september 30 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in net interest income of approximately 353 thousand and a reduction of loan fees collected of approximately 295 thousand partially offset by a 325 thousand reduction in non interest expenses the decrease in net income when comparing the three months ended december 31 2018 was attributed to an increase in non interest operating expenses resulting from the acquisition of 5 branches from beneficial bank which closed in may 2019 and the recording of a 125 thousand provision for loan losses in the fourth quarter of 2019 partially offset by an increase in service charges collected on deposits of 173 thousand for the twelve month period ended december 31 2019 the bank recorded net income of 10 1 million or 1 47 per diluted common share compared to 14 7 million or 2 14 per diluted common share for the same period in 2018 the decline in earnings was primarily due to an increase in the bank s provision for loan losses of 4 1 million of which 3 9 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2019 highlights for the quarter ended december 31 2019 are as follows net loans increased 109 3 million excluding 4 5 million in charge offs from the 1 07 billion at december 31 2018 this reflects an annual increase of 10 2 excluding in charge offs from the at this reflects an annual increase of 10 2 total deposits increased 230 6 million or 22 9 from the 1 01 billion at december 31

32 1 over the same period in 2018 we are pleased with the strong earnings recorded this quarter supporting our investment in branch expansion we had strong growth in loans and deposits in the 4th quarter finishing the year with a 10 growth rate stated edward dietzler president ceo chairman richard gillespie noted that the bank continues to execute on its branch expansion program to strategically build a franchise by increasing our footprint along the i95 corridor we have 3 more branches planned for the first half of 2020 balance sheet review total assets were 1 45 billion at december 31 2019 an increase of 203 3 million or 16 2 when compared to 1 25 billion at the end of 2018 the primary reason for the increase in total assets was a result of the bank s branch acquisition from beneficial bank and wsfs bank in which the bank received 159 9 million in cash and recorded 15 7 in intangible and other assets the bank also recorded a 14 5 million right of use asset resulting from the adoption of fasb update no 2016 02 leases net loans also increased 104 8 million from the 1 07 billion at december 31 2018 cash and cash equivalents increased 46 2 million or 175 2 to 72 6 million as december 31 2019 investment securities classified available for sale increased 20 6 million from the 91 7 million as of december 31 2018 total deposits at december 31 2019 increased by 230 6 million or 22 9 when compared to december 31 2018 primarily due to acquiring 177 9 million in deposits in the beneficial bank branch acquisition partially offset by not renewing 58 2 million of brokered deposits which carry a higher cost when comparing december 31 2019 to balances at december 31 2018 interest checking increased 61 5 million savings accounts increased 60 0 million time deposits increased 62 0 million and non interest earning deposits increased 38 7 million in addition at the end of the quarter the bank did not have any outstanding balance in fhlb short term advances down from the 55 4 million level at december 31 2018 total stockholders equity increased 11 6 million or 6 3 when compared to the end of 2018 this increase was primarily due to earnings recorded during the twelve months of 2019 exercises of stock options from the bank s equity incentive plans and an increase of 1 1 million in the fair value of the available for sale investment portfolio the ratio of equity to total assets was 13 5 compared to 14 7 at december 31 2018 asset quality at december 31 2019 non performing assets were 2 4 million a decrease of 3 3 million or 57 1 when compared to 5 7 million at december 31 2018 this decrease at december 31 2019 from december 31 2018 was primarily due to 2 6 million in charge offs recorded in the first quarter consisting of a 1 9 million commercial and industrial loan and a 750 thousand partial charge off of a commercial real estate loan total troubled debt restructurings tdr totaled 9 3 million at december 31 2019 an increase of 8 0 million from year end 2018 resulting from the restructure of three commercial real estate loans to two separate borrowers all tdr s are performing to their agreed upon terms review of quarterly financial results net interest income was 10 4 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 10 8 million for the third quarter of 2019 and 10 3 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 the decrease from the previous quarter was a result of an increase in interest paid on deposits of 294 thousand or 6 6 and a decrease in interest income of 58 thousand the net interest margin for the fourth quarter 2019 was 3 10 decreasing 27 basis points when compared to the third quarter of 2019 this decrease was primarily associated with a decrease of 25 basis points of yield on earning assets resulting from the two 25 basis points rate reductions that occurred in september 2019 and october 2019 as well as the positive impact during the 3rd quarter related to large loan payoffs with deferred fees recorded to income when comparing the three month periods ended december 31 2019 and 2018 net interest income increased 106 thousand which was primarily due to a higher volume of average earnings assets of approximately 152 6 million interest and dividend income increased by 1 0 million offset by an increase in interest expense of 900 thousand the total rate on interest bearing liabilities which includes non interest bearing deposits for the three month period ended december 31 2019 and 2018 was 1 57 and 1 44 respectively for the twelve month period ended december 31 2019 net interest income was 41 5 million an increase of 442 thousand or 1 1 over the same period in 2018 this slight increase was primarily due to a higher volume of average earning assets of approximately 100 5 million partially offset by a 25 basis points reduction in net interest margin the provision for credit losses was 125 thousand and 4 8 million for the three and twelve months ended december 31 2019 respectively compared to no provision recorded and 665 thousand for the same periods in 2018 respectively when compared to the three months ended september 30 2019 the provision for credit losses was 125 thousand for both periods the bank was required to record a provision in both the fourth and third quarters of 2019 resulting from the overall growth in the loan portfolio the ratio of allowance for credit losses to period end loans was 1 06 at december 31 2019 and 1 10 at december 31 2018 which reflects management s assessment of the credit quality in the loan portfolio total non interest income for the fourth quarter of 2019 increased 193 thousand to 794 thousand or 32 1 when compared to the same period in 2018 this increase was primarily due to an increase in service charges on deposits of 173 thousand and a 27 thousand gain recorded on available for sale securities total non interest income comparing the three month periods ended december 31 2019 and september 30 2019 reflected a decrease of 283 thousand or 26 3 primarily due to a lower level of fees generated on loans recorded between the two periods for the twelve month period ended december 31 2019 non interest income increased 723 thousand or 27 2 primarily due to increases in service charges on deposits and loan fees collected total non interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2019 increased 557 thousand or 8 8 when compared to the same period in 2018 this increase was primarily due to an increase in occupancy and equipment expenses data processing communications expenses office expense and core deposit intangible expense all related to the beneficial bank branch acquisition partially offset by a reduction in professional fees and federal deposit insurance corporation premium expense resulting from the deposit insurance fund exceeding the reserve ratio of 1 38 the fdic issued a small bank assessment credit which allowed the bank to reverse any expenses that were recorded during the period covered which included the second third and fourth quarter of 2019 for the twelve month period ended december 31 2019 non interest expense was 27 7 million compared to 25 3 million for the same period in 2018 the 2 4 million increase was attributed to expenses recorded relating to the beneficial bank branch acquisition and its impact on other operating expenses along with expenses associated with new branch expansion for the three month period ended december 31 2019 the bank recorded income tax expense of 817 thousand resulting in an effective tax rate of 19 4 compared to 801 thousand income tax expense resulting in an effective tax rate of 17 7 for the three month period ended september 30 2019 and compared to an income tax expense of 801 thousand resulting in an effective tax rate of 17 5 for the three month period ended december 31 2018 the current effective tax yields for the three and twelve months ended december 31 2019 were

español português economic activity in latin america and the caribbean stagnated in 2019 continuing with the weak growth momentum of the previous five years and adding more urgency and new challenges to reignite growth indeed real gdp per capita in the region has declined by 0 6 percent per year on average during 2014 2019 a sharp contrast from the commodity boom s average increase of two percent per year during 2000 2013 this weak momentum reflects structural and cyclical factors on the structural side potential growth remains constrained by low investment slow productivity growth a weak business climate and the low quality of infrastructure and education on the cyclical side growth has been held back by low global growth and commodity prices elevated economic policy uncertainty economic rebalancing in some economies and social unrest in others regional challenges elevated policy uncertainty in several large latin american countries continues to weigh on growth for example uncertainty about the course of economic policy and reforms in brazil and mexico likely contributed to the slowdown in real gdp and investment growth in 2019 continued economic rebalancing in stressed economies that experienced sudden stops in capital flows in 2018 19 argentina ecuador while helping restore internal and external balances have also acted as a drag on economic growth more recently a few countries in the region experienced social unrest bolivia colombia chile and ecuador which in some cases disrupted economic activity economic policy uncertainty has also risen in these countries as governments consider alternative policies and reforms to make growth more inclusive and address social demands outlook and risks as noted in the recent world economic outlook update growth in the region is projected to rebound to 1 6 percent in 2020 and 2 3 percent in 2021 supported by a gradual pick up in global growth and commodity prices continued monetary support reduced economic policy uncertainty and a gradual recovery in stressed economies however there are also prominent downside risks while previous external downside risks have moderated following globally synchronized monetary policy easing and the signing of the u s china phase one trade deal some new risks have appeared including the potential global spread of the coronavirus which could significantly disrupt global economic activity trade and travel domestic and regional downside risks have also intensified social unrest could spike throughout the region while economic policy uncertainty could rise further due to both heightened social tensions and policy slippages policy priorities economic policies will need to strike a balance between rebuilding policy space and maintaining economic stability on the one hand and supporting economic activity and strengthening the social safety net on the other hand although the causes and triggers of social unrest have varied across countries they generally reflect discontent with some aspects of the economic and political systems a key priority going forward is to reignite growth while making it more inclusive promoting competition will be important to avoid monopolistic practices that may hurt the poor disproportionally tackling corruption and weak governance will help make political systems more representative although deeper political reforms may be needed fiscal policy will need to support to growth expand the social safety net and improve the quality of public goods and services however in many countries spending room in the budget remains constrained by high deficits and public debt these countries will need to improve spending efficiency reallocate spending from nonpriority areas to public investment and social transfers and increase revenues over the medium term to finance additional increases in these areas monetary policy can remain accommodative to support growth given the stable inflation outlook well anchored inflation expectations and declining neutral rates worldwide south america in brazil growth remained subdued at 1 2 percent in 2019 but is projected to accelerate to 2 2 percent in 2020 due to improving confidence following the approval of the pension reform and lower monetary policy interest rates in the context of low inflation steady implementation of the government s broad fiscal and structural reform agenda will be essential to safeguard public debt sustainability and boost potential growth in chile the outlook is subject to uncertainty resulting from social unrest and the evolving policy responses to the social demands following a sharp decline in late 2019 economic activity is expected to recover gradually supported by a significant fiscal expansion and looser monetary policy with growth reaching about 1 percent in 2020 in colombia strong domestic demand led to a pickup in growth to 3 3 percent in 2019 and a widening of the current account deficit to 4½ percent of gdp growth is projected to accelerate to around 3½ percent in 2020 due to continued monetary support migration from venezuela remittances civil works and higher investment due to recent tax policy changes in peru growth is estimated to have slowed to 2 4 percent in 2019 hampered by lower global trade and under execution of government spending with these factors dissipating in the coming years growth is projected to recover to 3 2 percent in 2020 and 3 7 percent in 2021 with inflation remaining well anchored within the central bank s target range venezuela remains immersed in a deep economic and humanitarian crisis since the end of 2013 real gdp has contracted by 65 percent driven by declining oil production hyperinflation collapsing public services and plummeting purchasing power a continuation of these trends is projected for 2020 although at a slower pace the acute humanitarian crisis has led to one of the largest migratory crises in history with migration to neighboring countries expected to surpass 6 million 20 percent of the population by 2020 mexico central america and the caribbean in mexico economic activity stagnated in 2019 due to policy uncertainty and slower global and u s manufacturing production growth is expected to recover to 1 percent in 2020 as conditions normalize including with the ratification of the trade agreement between the united states mexico and canada usmca and the recent easing of monetary policy which should continue as along as inflation expectations are well anchored fiscal policy should be geared at putting the public debt to gdp ratio on a downward trajectory with priority on increasing revenues improving the efficiency of spending and enhancing the fiscal framework in central america panama and the dominican republic growth is projected to rebound to 3 9 percent in 2020 from 3 2 percent in 2019 supported by the beginning of operations of a large copper mine inpanama and accommodative monetary policy incosta rica and the dominican republic in costa rica continued implementation of all measures in the fiscal reform bill will be key to rebuild market confidence and fiscal space in honduras the economic plan includes important efforts to improve institutional governance and anti corruption frameworks supporting business confidence while guatemala is expected to continue benefitting from a fiscal impulse and economic reform plans of the new administration el salvador is already reaping the effects of the pro growth agenda of the new administration inaugurated in june while unfavorable political tensions in nicaragua are creating a significant headwind to economic recovery in the caribbean economic prospects are improving but with substantial variation across countries growth in tourism dependent economies is expected to strengthen in 2020 with commodity prices remaining broadly stable commodity exporters are expected to see modest recovery in growth while large oil discoveries and the start of their production in 2020 is expected to boost growth in guyana the region s exposure to climate risks continues to require strong policies potential growth continues to be impeded by lingering structural problems including high public debt weaker financial systems high unemployment and vulnerability to commodity and climate related shocks some countries have started to strengthen their fiscal positions but further tightening is needed in others to ensure debt sustainability
it is a great detriment to civil discourse that the divide between left and right in the united states is often depicted as being purely cultural as if one s politics were solely mediated by aesthetics such as whether one prefers shooting guns or drinking lattes this fabulist understanding of politics is harmful inasmuch as it masks the real social effects of the policy agendas pushed by left versus right seeing politics as aesthetic transforms what should be a quantitative debate with statistics and numbers about taxation and public policy questions of who benefits more or less from policy changes and devolves it into a rhetorical debate over values this is especially bad for liberals because there is a lot of quantitative evidence that the right s economic agenda is a dismal failure in terms of providing any real gains to the vast majority of the population as most salon readers are aware economist professor and new york times columnist paul krugman has spent much of his career doing precisely this debunking the asserted merits of right wing fiscal and economic policy through unemotional facts and statistics as krugman s quantitative analyses attest the economic policies hawked by conservatives are a dismal failure by any measure in any era so why do right wing policy ideas like lowering taxes on the rich or keeping health care privatized continue to be celebrated by conservatives krugman winner of the 2008 nobel memorial prize in economics has penned a new essay collection on that very theme titled arguing with zombies economics politics and the fight for a better america the book features over 400 pages of snappy essays that deflate just about every right wing and neoliberal economic talking point zombies that should have died long ago as he says while there is a philosophical case for a low tax minimal government society modern conservatism relies less on philosophical persuasion than on the fact there are people who would gain a lot personally if we were to retrace our steps toward the gilded age krugman writes in the book s introduction moreover he says the malign influence of these few super rich people is propping up zombie ideas ideas that should have been killed by contrary evidence but instead keep shambling along eating people s brains in interviewing krugman about his book i opted to go broad as throughout the years there are few subject areas untouched by his pen hence our interview touched on economic trends global politics and the relative popularity of an especially nerdy theory of economics as always this interview has been condensed and edited for print you were one of a few mainstream pundits who correctly foresaw the great recession as early as 2005 what do you make of the current economic situation why hasn t a recession come yet and are we overdue i don t see any misalignment as obvious as the housing bubble inequality and homelessness are bad things but macroeconomics isn t a morality play and injustice doesn t necessarily lead to recession the real secret of the current economy as i see it is deficit spending the 2019 federal deficit was 300 billion higher than cbo projected in 2017 before the trump tax cuts that s a lot of stimulus after years of austerity imposed by the gop on obama it s badly designed stimulus but it s still a lot of money sooner or later something will go wrong and the idea of steve mnuchin in charge of the response is pretty terrifying but i can t point to an immediate source of danger you write about social security and that being a policy debate the left ultimately won and yet one zombie idea which i still see bandied about is the idea that social security is bankrupt or will run out of money by the time millennials like me retire to me the normalization of this notion has always seemed like a ploy by the rich to make it so that my generation doesn t fight back when congress slashes social security what do you make of this sly rhetorical turn of phrase that is the notion that social security will run out of money it s not all a conspiracy right now social security is funded by a dedicated tax plus a trust fund accumulated out of past taxes at some point probably around 2035 the trust fund will be exhausted and revenues won t be enough to pay full benefits so that s a real thing but there are various ways to deal with this we could easily find new revenue sources to maintain and even expand benefits so will face an action forcing event but that doesn t mean it has to be slashed and i ve never understood the logic of claims that to avoid the possibility of future benefit cuts we need to move immediately to cut future benefits that s where the ideology comes in claiming that social security faces a crisis demanding immediate action is very convenient for conservatives and centrists who want to sound tough minded but it s nonsense you ve been trying to debunk myths about debt spending being evil for decades by my count though i know you identify as a keynesian i have watched with some curiosity the rise of modern monetary theory mmt as a trend for instance when i lived in oakland there was a meeting of mmt enthusiasts that happened outside of any university which i find remarkable for economics not that it s boring just that it s not generally a hobbyist pursuit i am wondering if you feel enthused perhaps that so many young and probably old people have seen the light on government debt spending actually i m not sure that really is different from keynesian economics most of the time its devotees seem to be inventing new terminology to make arguments mainstream keynesians already understood perfectly well a lot of it i suspect involves imperfect understanding of what we already knew and personal self promotion look at me i m a radical unorthodox thinker pay no attention to the fact that i m substantively saying the same thing as larry summers i am however gratified to see the debt obsession wane although it probably matters more that people like summers or olivier blanchard are telling us not to worry than what alternative macro people argue this leads me to a follow up question about debt i m curious if you re familiar with david graeber s book debt which is sort of both a cultural history and an economic book about debt graeber writes of the historical idea of a debt jubilee something that happens periodically often in times of political uprisings in the case of something like say student debt or medical debt do you see as productive a discussion of a jubilee or mass forgiveness would anyone truly suffer if say the world were to forgive the debt of many of the third world countries exploited by the imf debt has been on my mind lately given both sanders and warren s plans to forgive a lot of student debt i haven t read graeber i am however all in favor of debt forgiveness when debt is a real ball and chain for the economy hey we have chapter 11 bankruptcies for corporations when they re needed to avoid destructive liquidation so why not for countries too but it s usually something you want to do on a case by case basis argentina repudiated 70 percent of its debt in 2001 and the results were actually very good for a while greece eventually got a lot of debt forgiveness and the misery there would have been much less if it had happened sooner i really don t know enough about sub saharan africa to know which countries are good candidates for debt relief but i m sure there are many the thing about student debt is that there was such widespread scamming that a case by case approach would be administratively overwhelming so some kind of broad debt relief sounds good i noticed that your writing about different left leaning states tend to vary in your proscription you write very positively about denmark a social democracy whereas you don t have as many kind things to say about venezuela which you call a corrupt petrostate yet venezuela s political situation like bolivia s and cuba s is largely the result of operating under the constraints imposed by imperial powers like the u s that punish these countries for refusing to cede u s capital on the other hand denmark s high functioning social welfare state is only possible due to its status as an imperial power in its own right within its situation in the eu do you think these subtleties and these country s relationship to imperialism are worth explicating deeper for what they say about both capitalism s ability to create or destroy leftist states or perhaps disagree with this assessment i suspect the danes would find it pretty funny to be described as an imperial state what they are is a rich democracy that respects market forces without worshipping them they operate a sort of tamed bounded form of capitalism and the result is a pretty decent society venezuela isn t anything like that it wasn t always that poor but the wealth was based on oil which had a corrupting effect before chavez they were ruled by a corrupt oligarchy chavez came to power for a reason and the poor did at least get some of the spoils but the new regime never evolved a sustainable economic model it combined cronyism with a different set of cronies with an attempt to run a command and control economy it didn t have remotely enough competence to operate now even poorer countries can do a lot to improve social justice costa rica isn t utopia but it s a lot more inclusive than most of latin america taiwan has single payer health care the trouble is that social democratic experiments in developing countries are all too often cut off by coups led by the old oligarchy and yes the u s has a lot to answer for in its role in backing these coups and when a reformist government does come into power like the kirchners in argentina it often finds it hard to get the balance right heterodox economics is sometimes exactly what you need but you have to know when to stop so i don t see this as a blanket problem with capitalism denmark looks capitalist to me but it s a kinder gentler form rather than railing against the inherent evil of capitalism we should be asking how to support countries that try to get the balance right like most salon readers and like you i am no fan of trump but also i don t see trump policy wise as particularly different than george w bush policy wise they both did the bidding of the prominent right wing think tanks both in foreign policy and economic policy sure trump is more of a narcissist and openly corrupt but the results of their rule seem the same and like most presidents they are merely steering an imperialist ship that goes from country to country extracting resources and ousting redistributive political regimes in favor of any centrist or dictator who will kowtow to american interests do you truly see trump as an aberration as you ve written i thought i made it clear that i don t think of trump as an aberration so much as a culmination the gop has achieved something impressive each successive republican president makes the preceding one look good by comparison but yes the bush administration was rife with cronyism tried to dismantle the social safety net and lied us into war the thing about trump is that we ve now reached the point where our chances of ever exiting the nightmare are shrinking there was a lot of vote rigging etc under bush but we re now within striking range of becoming a de facto one party autocracy someplace we ve been heading at least since newt gingrich we may actually be lucky that trump is so addled and undisciplined if he had more self control the republic might be gone already the title and theme of the book as you write is this idea of zombies intellectual or policy ideas that stick around not because they work but because belief in them and their being enacted in policy benefits the very wealthy people who promote them directly and indirectly i was wondering if this might be a sort of a smaller example of a larger idea one that has existed for thousands of years in human history specifically what the italian marxist philosopher antonio gramsci called hegemony in his writing hegemony was the set of ruling class beliefs and principles that had been normalized such that anyone who thought otherwise was met with ridicule i bring this up only because i found myself wondering during the course of the book if perhaps the zombie wasn t merely this sort of libertarian free market view on capitalism could it be that capitalism itself is a zombie indeed the majority of my generation millennials prefer socialism to capitalism as polls repeatedly bear out do you think that it may be a zombie too i guess the question is what we mean by capitalism if we mean an economy where most but not all decisions about production and investment are made by profit seeking firms well we haven t really found an alternative that works but the idea that government can never do anything good is a zombie as i write in the book there s a range of things the government clearly does better than the private sector like guaranteeing retirement and health care oh and the post office is actually awesome what i take from the polling on socialism is that it s a reaction to right wing demonizing of every proposal to improve how we live if you spend 40 years denouncing social security medicaid food stamps antitrust policy etc as socialism if you say that denmark is socialist well eventually you get a lot of people who say they want socialism i suspect that if you asked about what we used to mean by socialism government control of manufacturing government run retailing and so on you d get a much less favorable response paul krugman s latest book arguing with zombies

earnings release from last night and hopefully you ve also seen the release we issued monday regarding our enhanced capital allocation strategy we ve got a lot to cover so i ll just get right to it our overall third quarter results were broadly in line with our expectations and continuation of the trends we saw across our first half modest core growth inclusive of our product line simplification actions coupled with solid margin expansion that reflects our high level of operational execution our core growth was up 1 and is net of a roughly 150 basis point impact on our sales growth from our 80 20 simplification initiatives despite what i would call a generally stagnant growth environment we delivered year over year growth in our adjusted ebitda and another quarter of more than 20 growth in our free cash flow which brings our year to date increase in free cash flow to more than 25 please turn to slide 3 and i ll quickly review our third quarter results our net sales finished at 492 million up 1 from last year net of the impact of a stronger us dollar and our product simplification actions our adjusted ebitda increased year over year to 107 million and margin expanded 50 basis points our incremental drop through exceeded 50 and was higher yet on a core basis and we continue to track to another record year of free cash flow turning quickly to our operating platforms core growth in our pmc platform was flat and up almost 2 after adjusting for our product simplification actions oe applications across most end markets in north america and asia were broadly in line with what we had anticipated and europe continue to be relatively weak but modestly better than our expectations our growth in the quarter through the north american distribution channel improved slightly sequentially from the september quarter and we expect a little more improvement in demand from the channel in our upcoming fourth quarter our north american channel inventories are bumping around at all time lows and inventory turns with our channel partners continue to be at all time highs so we d expect any fundamental improvement in mro demand to be almost immediately reflected in our order rates pmc adjusted ebitda margin was 22 7 and we continue to benefit from the broad based growth in our aerospace business and the structural cost reductions that are being delivered by the second wave of our scope for initiatives that we completed last year core growth in our water management platform came in at a solid 3 in the third quarter as zurn continued to benefit from steady demand in commercial and institutional plumbing end markets as well as success with our strategies to grow our share of the adjacent fire protection site works markets zurn s core growth was slightly below our target for the quarter as we saw an unusually quiet last two weeks of december and channel partners managed their inventories a little more aggressively into the year end we think that impacted zurn s sales in the quarter by about 2 million to 3 million zurn delivered 40 basis points of margin expansion in its adjusted ebitda margin over the record established in last year s third quarter as we continue to manage the ongoing tariff structures and price cost equation while sustaining our investments in innovation and market adjacencies turning to our financial outlook with nine months behind us and three months to go in our fiscal 20 we are nearing our prior end our prior range of adjusted ebitda to primarily reflect the estimated impact of boeing s suspension of 737 max production while we will be able to mitigate a portion of the near term impact the reality is that the upper end of our guidance is now less likely to be achieved and we are moving our revised adjusted ebitda range for the year to 460 million to 464 million we re also affirming low single digit core growth for the year this is inclusive of more than 1 5 point impact of our simplification initiatives and finally we expect another record year of free cash flow that exceeds our net income on monday of this week we announced that our board has approved an enhanced capital allocation strategy that includes our first ever quarterly common dividend starting at 0 08 a share which equates to 0 32 annually and a yield of approximately 1 our expectation is to grow the dividend rate on an annual basis and by a double digit rate for at least the first few years our board also authorized expanding our share repurchase authorization to 300 million and we intend to allocate between 75 million and 150 million annually for regular share repurchases we believe that our equity offers a compelling value that does not yet reflect the full impact of the changes we ve made and continue to make in our growth profile the resilience of our earnings and our improving free cash flow profile all things that i ll come back to in a couple of minutes while we will continue to invest both internally and externally on a disciplined basis to drive growth and shareholder returns and we intend to execute our strategy while maintaining a relatively conservative balance sheet in keeping our net debt to ebitda ratio within the target range of 2 times to 3 times that we established three years ago please turn to slide 4 and we ll talk more about our enhanced capital allocation strategy and why now is the right time to execute this strategy i d like to start by helping everyone understand that when we buy rexnord shares in the open market we re capturing an underlying 17 return on our investment for shareholders this isn t readily apparent to investors that may not realize that our capital structure is distorted by our unique private equity tariffs when one private equity investor namely apollo purchased rexnord in 2006 from another pe firm that being carlyle there was a substantial portion of the purchase price 1 7 billion to be specific that represented a change of control premium that was unrelated to investing in productive assets and took the form of goodwill and intangible assets the incremental debt that was required to fund that premium became an element of our capitalization and the pressures are conventionally calculated roic when we adjust our capital structure to eliminate that distortion to our total invested capital you can see that this is a measure that this measure actually yields 17 1 not the 10 5 that calculates based on our unusual back to back pe acquisition phenomena two points to make about this first i think many investors have understood this issue and understand this level of return is obviously more consistent with our overall financial profile including our high margins our history of disciplined investing both internally and externally and our increasingly asset light operating model second these calculations have been made using our unadjusted gaap operating results and a normalized tax rate that reflects statutory rates across our geographic footprint and which exceeds our periodic effective tax rate in other words we believe 17 1 is in fact a conservative estimate of our normalized underlying return on invested capital please turn to slide 5 over the last four years we ve worked hard at executing a change in the composition of our portfolio to produce higher financial returns with reduced cyclicality in prior calls i ve detailed a shift in our portfolio toward more stable consumer facing end markets by exiting relatively project dependent businesses and investing in the expansion of our food and beverage footprint the product innovation and our acquisition of cambridge a leading supplier to the food processing industry last quarter i provided an update on our dirxn digital strategy and shared our excitement about the progress with our introduction of digital customer interfaces and families of digitally enabled and iot connected product solutions we re compounding the impact of these improvements with our 80 20 work and associated product line simplification that increases our focus on high potential products and customers on this slide we re illustrating the current state of our transformation in another way by highlighting the progress we ve made in repositioning our overall product portfolio to drive above market growth in both operating platforms the green bars represent discrete and absolute product line revenue that we believe is positioned to deliver above market growth as we go forward and as you can see these specific product lines represent almost three quarters of our revenue today as compared to less than half of our revenue just four years ago turning to slide 6 i d like to quickly review the progress we ve made with critical levers of fundamental value creation moving clockwise from the top left as you re likely aware our platform margins are well above those of most of our competitors and the discipline of the rexnord business system is helping us convert our improved operating profile into a stronger and more sustainable free cash flow profile starting with this year we expect the cumulative cash free cash flow over the three years through our fiscal 2022 will be approximately 40 higher than the preceding three years contributing to our success to date and our confidence going forward is the progress we re driving through our supply chain optimization and footprint repositioning initiatives which are on track to deliver a cumulative 60 million of permanent structural cost reduction as we exit our fiscal 21 next year while also structurally reducing the capital reinvestment required in our business as we stated since the outset and once we complete our scofr initiatives we expect to operate with annual capital expenditures below 2 of the annual revenue we ve executed the structural changes freed up the internal resources to fund our digital transformation and continue to execute our disciplined and strategic approach to acquisitions while expanding our margins bringing our net leverage down to less than 2 times our ebitda and driving our roic to above 17 moving to slide 7 here we re simply profiling our growth over the last three years against several industrial companies that garner premium valuations based on their growth and return profiles as you can probably guess by looking at this chart and with the conviction we have around our future cash flows we believe the intrinsic value of rexnord is considerably higher than what it s being valued at today while this has been a phenomenon that we believe makes a ton of sense we re more than happy to invest an appropriate portion of our free cash flow to buy back rexnord shares with the certainty of earning a 17 plus return on invested capital that we believe will grow to 20 plus in the coming years if you turn to slide 8 we re simply illustrating one of the more obvious competitive advantages that we think is relevant to shareholders and that is the difference in the operating performance and profitability of our water management platform relative to that of some of relative to that of some leading pure play water businesses that also command premium valuations the bar graph simply compares zurn s adjusted ebitda margins with the comparable margin profile of these companies what s also important is the fact that when coupled with our aerospace operations over half of the profit of the company comes from these two parts of our business where we believe we have created particularly significant competitive advantages additionally with all of the portfolio work we ve done over the last three to four years almost half of power transmission s earnings are generated in consumer facing end markets together the five slides i ve just taken you through are intended to support our view that our equity represent an excellent value and that our enhanced capital allocation strategy represents a balanced and sustainable approach to delivering shareholder returns please turn to slide 9 and i ll summarize and close we believe our free cash flow profile supports a moderately leveraged balance sheet and that we can drive attractive shareholder returns with modest volatility if we maintain our leverage in the 2 times to 3 times range we are initiating a common dividend that we intend to grow annually we expect to allocate between 75 million and 150 million of annual free cash flow to share repurchases which leaves room to be more aggressive and capture an enhanced return if the stock price suffers a major dislocation or if we don t invest as much as we d like in acquisitions in a given year we will continue invest internally and externally to drive innovation productivity and core growth and we plan to continue our disciplined and focused approach to m a that requires a double digit return on our investment in a reasonable period of time generally three years or less so while we re committing a return to shareholders so while we re committing to return a substantial portion of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and repurchases we retain ample financial capability and capacity to execute acquisitions that can enhance our competitive advantages our core growth in free cash flow and total shareholder returns our objective is straightforward deliver top quartile shareholder returns among us industrials and continue to make progress toward earning an enterprise value that is better reflection of rexnord s intrinsic value with that i ll turn the call over to mark mark peterson senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks todd please turn to slide number 10 on a consolidated basis our third quarter of fiscal 20 financial results were broadly in line with our expectations on a year over year basis our total and core sales growth were both up 1 net of the impact from our product line simplification actions currency and acquisition contributions to growth were offsetting our adjusted ebitda increased by 4 to 107 million and our adjusted ebitda margin expanded by 50 basis points year over year to 21 8 please turn to slide 11 our outlook for fiscal year 2020 continues to incorporate low single digit core growth which is net from an approximately 150 basis point impact from our product line simplification initiatives we expect our adjusted ebitda to be in a range of 460 million to 464 million representing 4 growth at the midpoint and for our free cash flow to exceed our net income our revised outlook for our fiscal 20 adjusted ebitda incorporates the expected impact of boeing s decision to suspend assembly of its 737 max aircraft in mid january on slide 12 we summarize our consolidated results for the quarter let s turn to slide 13 to discuss the first of our two operating platforms process motion control total sales were essentially flat year over year in pmc with core sales growth also flat and a 1 acquisition contribution offset by a roughly 1 adverse impact from currency translation pmc s top line growth was reduced by approximately 200 basis point impact of our product line simplification or pls actions breaking pmc down by major end markets we continue to see good growth from our aerospace operations and we believe we continue to outperform the broader industry in our global food and beverage end markets in terms of both oe and overall demand generation demand in our process industry end market was generally stable with demand trends we experienced in our second quarter in our north american distribution channels we saw overall sell through generally stable sequentially and more in line with our sales to distributors as we expected all in and with one quarter to go in our fiscal 20 our broader end market growth assumptions as seen on the slide are unchanged turning to profitability ongoing strong operating execution combined with the benefits of our scofr actions delivered a 40 basis point expansion of pmc s ebitda margin despite the flattish top line we continue to expect pmc margins to increase year over year in our fiscal 2020 and the structural savings we are realizing from our pls and scofr initiatives ongoing growth in our aerospace operations and operational execution through the rexnord business system are expected to more than offset our ongoing investment spending one driver of a relatively stronger growth in our food and beverage end markets has been the development and introduction of our premium services offerings premium services builds on our dirxn architecture and leverages our smart tag technology the qr codes that we attach to all of our products provides immediate shop floor access to valuable resources like product identification technical literature and how to videos covering installation maintenance and replacement the service starts with a complete line survey performed by one of our technical experts and covers the overall line condition for our products as well as competitor products we analyze and channelize configuration and speed to enable a complete line condition optimization report with opportunities to improve the timely product notification and operating performance that will ultimately avoid costly unscheduled downtime because of the enhanced capabilities we provide with our smart condition monitoring smart tag technologies please turn to slide 14 to discuss our water management platform during our third quarter our water management platform delivered a 4 increase in net sales growth with 3 core growth and a roughly 1 contribution from stainlessdrains com which we acquired in our first quarter our pls initiatives impacted water management s core growth by just under 100 basis points in the quarter our underlying north american non residential construction markets remains part of our core growth as illustrated by our unchanged end market outlook that is summarized on the slide growth in overall us non residential building construction spending improved in our third quarter although new starts growth has moderated somewhat against more difficult year over year comps based on our relatively greater exposure to institutional verticals like public education and healthcare and our strategic investments on adjacent market growth and the growing momentum we re seeing in our sales funnel for digitally enabled products we believe we are well positioned to continue to outperform overall construction sector growth earlier this week we closed a large strategic bolt on acquisition in our water management platform with the acquisition of just manufacturing a leading manufacturer of stainless steel sinks that represents a natural addition to the zurn finish plumbing product line adding just sinks to our zurn business strengthens our position in several key institutional construction verticals notably including education and healthcare and it expands our ability to run more complete solutions in conventional markets like foodservice and hospitality just is expected to be accretive to zurn margins and was acquired for about 8 times trailing ebitda after factoring in certain tax benefits just will add over 20 million of annual revenue to our water management platform looking at profitability water management s adjusted ebitda increased by 5 year over year in the third quarter with a solid 37 incremental margin as a result zurn will earn 40 basis points of year over year margin expansion as we continue to leverage our core growth while funding our market expansion connected product development and cost reduction initiatives moving onto slide 15 and starting with the chart in the far left our free cash flow continued to grow by more than 20 year over year in our third quarter and has increased by more than 25 on a year to date basis we remain confident in our expectations for a record level of free cash flows in fiscal 2020 moving to the chart in the center you can see that our financial leverage as measured by our net debt leverage ratio declined to 1 9 times and finished the quarter just on the low end of our long term targeted range of 2 times to 3 times during our third quarter we allocated 20 million to share repurchases under our existing authorization earlier this week our board authorized expanding our existing share repurchase authorization of 300 million of available capacity the board also authorized initiation of an 0 08 quarterly common dividend which translates to about 39 million of annual dividends based on the roughly 122 million shares outstanding at the end of our fiscal third quarter during our third quarter our mandatory convertible preferred shares converted into approximately 16 million new share of common and eliminated the associated 23 million of annual preferred dividends separately we also repaid 100 million of the outstanding term debt under our credit facility which we refinanced during the quarter and secured a 25 basis point reduction in the effective interest rates the combination of the debt pay down and lower interest rate will reduce our annual interest expense by approximately 5 million so august 2024 maturity is unchanged before we open the call for questions i ll touch briefly on restructuring expenses and our effective tax rate first and in terms of our cost reduction initiatives including our scope of three initiatives we expect total restructuring expenses of 12 million to 14 million in our fiscal 20 these costs are primarily made up of severance costs and are excluded from our adjusted operating results next our effective tax rate will fluctuate by quarter given the varying levels of pre tax income as well as the timing of other planning initiatives we anticipate our fiscal 2020 adjusted net income will incorporate an effective tax rate of approximately 25 in our fourth quarter we anticipate the rate will be approximately 27 turning to the slides of appendix we ve included certain other assumptions incorporated into our financial guidance for our fiscal 2020 on a separate slide i remind you that our guidance excludes the impact of potential acquisitions potential accounting gains or losses and future nonrecurring items such as restructuring costs one last note after further analysis it has been determined that the if converted test is still required when calculating our eps in our third quarter and for our full fiscal year even though the mandatory convertible preferred has converted to common shares as you ll recall this requires a calculation that assumes the convertible preferred has converted at the beginning of the period and that no preferred dividends would have been paid this method was used in our third quarter and it was 0 01 diluted to our eps as it was in the first two quarters of the year the same method will be necessary for our full fiscal year when the if converted test will be performed with all preferred dividends and other income and using a share count that s expected to be approximately 124 million shares with that we ll open the call up for questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session and our first question today comes from the line of jeff hammond from keybanc capital markets your line is open jeffrey d hammond keybanc capital markets inc analyst hey good morning gentlemen todd a adams president and chief executive officer good morning jeff jeffrey d hammond keybanc capital markets inc analyst very good presentation that was very helpful at the front of the deck just on slide 5 you showed the shift from kind of non growth to growth and just want to get a sense in that other remaining 26 how much do you think of that can kind of shift into the green or if there is any other pairing that you would see in the portfolio in markets maybe where there isn t a growth profile todd a adams president and chief executive officer yeah jeff i think it s a great question there i think there is room to move it i think we ve focused on the things that we could do both organically and inorganically that we felt had the biggest opportunity and so there are always going to be elements of the portfolio that aren t positioned to grow above market maybe just grow with the market but i do think there is some room that we can to wiggle that percentage a little bit higher i think we d love to see it at 80 plus primarily through a combination of things that we re doing strategically as opposed to just sort of selling something or divesting something so i think we re targeting to move it a little bit forward but i think the lion s share of the lifting over the last four years has put us in a pretty nice place jeffrey d hammond keybanc capital markets inc analyst yeah absolutely and then todd you mentioned zurn kind of having acquired end of the year and channel de stocking can you just kind of talk about trends into january if that s normalized where you think inventory levels are and then just kind of a comment on i think there is some increasing worry that the non res cycle is maturing and just what you re seeing there from a quoting and project activity thanks todd a adams president and chief executive officer sure you know i think the end of the year phenomenon had a lot to do with the holidays falling in the middle of the week so people took the opportunity to really have things back the other thing to point out is that january is not a great parameter because it s cold across most of north america and so i would tell you that i don t see anything abnormal in the way we re starting the fourth quarter relative to maybe what we expected but as you get through february and march and things warm up in parts of the country that s when we see things accelerate so nothing unusual from the way we re starting the quarter and february march are always where the majority of our fourth quarter comes when it relates to zurn back to your second question on what we re seeing in terms of demand i would tell you we feel pretty good about where starts are particularly in some of the institutional verticals as we start our fiscal 21 and i think we would sort of point to albeit slower growth market growth over the course of the next 12 months still positive and i think when you couple that with some of the things that we re doing around 80 20 we re seeing outsized market growth in those areas as well as fire protection and site works which are both growing substantially above the market the other thing that mark mentioned was this acquisition and if you think about what we ve been doing in a pretty methodical way is adding to the size of our available markets and so it just opens up another 100 million 150 million market opportunity where we have a chance to really grow the business through what we have in place you know tremendous spec share our third party reps and the ability to bundle and package this product with all the other water and labor savings products that we already have so i think we re pretty excited about where zurn sits and again i think that the market itself is absolutely in the process of slowing but i think the resilience of the business through all the things we ve done and also this retrofit business that we ve built and are building we think put us in a great spot even if the market slows so that s sort of a long winded answer to your question jeff but i think that s the way we would hope people would think about it jeffrey d hammond keybanc capital markets inc analyst great thanks a lot operator and our next question comes from the line of joe o dea from vertical research your line is open joseph o dea vertical research partners analyst yeah hi good morning everyone first question just on the cash flow i think year to date you are up 30 million year over year the prior framework was thinking about free cash flow growth kind of mirroring what we might see in ebitda growth you re ahead of that pace so just what you re thinking for the fourth quarter whether that s a little bit of a give back on the year to date gains or whether we should just be thinking that free cash flow might come in a little stronger mark peterson senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah joe this is mark i think if you look at the fourth quarter obviously it s always our strongest quarter i think if you look at kind of levels that we did last year will be in that similar to that growth of the free cash that we did last quarter you know obviously plus or minus 3 million to 4 million to 5 million but q4 will be strong we ll finish with record year this year with momentum going into our fiscal 21 when it comes to free cash joseph o dea vertical research partners analyst great and then there were a couple of comments in the press release about progress on the connected products dirxn side of things both within pmc and water management and i was looking for any additional context in terms of what you see as a revenue run rate or what you see as a revenue growth opportunity over the next 12 months or so todd a adams president and chief executive officer joe we just wrapped up our strategic planning cycle and as we went through we see a three year goal of in excess of 100 million and so the revenue run rate i think has probably been a little bit slower than we would have liked out of the gate and i think our fiscal 21 will be a sort of a catalyst year as we have modified i would say some of the offerings we ve had we ve built the go to market we ve established the solutions that our customers are really wanting and so we think the run rate beginning in our fiscal 21 ramps pretty considerably over the course of the next three years and it s really opening up incredible conversations in both parts of our business that we weren t able to access without this solution and so things like connected retail stores that provide perfect visibility into the water safety quality flow control things touching water inside of the building these are solutions that customers are really excited about and i think the traction we ve gotten and the learning cycles that we ve been through across the entire portfolio and i think that s the important thing to keep in mind when you look at our connected product solutions as it covers the broadest portfolio of products that serve the markets that we go after which is very very difficult and it s also a solution that works with whatever customers have chosen to use whether it s a building control system a factory automation system we re having us look at it through our cloud it s a very flexible scalable solution that covers the broadest gamut of products so we re excited about it look for the inflection in 21 and think about it as 100 million plus opportunity over the next three years joseph o dea vertical research partners analyst and just a clarification is that an incremental 100 million and what would the base be in fiscal 20 roughly todd a adams president and chief executive officer we do think it s an incremental 100 million and the base is probably close to 20 million joseph o dea vertical research partners analyst okay thanks very much operator our next question comes from the line of bryan blair from oppenheimer your line is open bryan blair oppenheimer analyst good morning everyone solid quarter good morning thanks bryan mark peterson senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning bryan bryan blair oppenheimer analyst question on portfolio composition over time i mean you signalled and started to act on zurn weighted m a is the ideal to have relatively balanced revenue and ebitda contribution from the platforms over time or is that too rigid a construct todd a adams president and chief executive officer bryan i think that we haven t set that as a sort of discrete goal but i think our view is that adding more heft to the water platform certainly can t hurt us in terms of the way the company is valued or thought of and so if you were to look at the priorities that we laid out on one of those pages water related m a is our number one priority with a second to consumer facing end market related applications in pmc so i don t think we are looking at expanding through m a in things like process industries because we ve got such a terrific share already and so without question i think we re going to target those areas but without a mandate to do it in this period of time we re going to continue to stay disciplined and if you look at the acquisitions that we have done over time and frankly one we just talked about in just we re retaining the discipline of financial profile that creates a great return while adding significant runway to these businesses that we can bolt on and run with quickly bryan blair oppenheimer analyst all makes sense and just a clarification point on just did you say that s margin accretive to zurn todd a adams president and chief executive officer yes that s correct bryan blair oppenheimer analyst yeah that s impressive one last one if i could on scofr 3 0 any update you can offer on how that s progressing and if there is further line of sight on the timing of cost savings how much of that we should expect to hit in fiscal 21 todd a adams president and chief executive officer so we ve started to make some internal announcements you will see some cost in our fourth quarter related to that you will see some incremental cost to implement as we start our fiscal 21 we ll outline what those are but it s sort of in the 5 million to 7 million range of cost to implement in our fiscal 21 maybe just a little bit in our fourth quarter and we should start to see some level of benefit from those efforts toward the end of fiscal 21 so think about it as a little bit of upfront spending just like we did in scofr 1 0 just like we did in scofr 2 0 but then that spending goes away and we begin to accrete all the fixed cost and cash flow benefits from the actions and so a little bit in fourth quarter little bit in the first part of the year 5 million to 7 million a little bit of benefit in the fourth quarter of our fiscal 21 with the run rate really starting in our fiscal 22 bryan blair oppenheimer analyst okay appreciate the color todd a adams president and chief executive officer sure operator our next question comes from the line of andrew obin from bank of america your line is open emily shu bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey good morning this is emily shu on for andrew obin todd a adams president and chief executive officer good morning emily mark peterson senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning emily emily shu bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning so my first question so i noticed the outlook for commercial aerospace in pmc has a green light has that changed given you know there is some risk from boeing 737 max production halt in the first half of 2020 and also the coronavirus outbreak reducing basically air traffic todd a adams president and chief executive officer yes we are aware of both the 737 max production changes and the coronavirus i think what the green light is intended to do is sort of maybe look through that a little bit i think we like many people think there will be a resolution to the max and it s very difficult to assess the impact certainly the long term impact of the virus situation and so look we have a record backlog in our aerospace business right now we anticipate that there will be some near term headwinds as the production rate for the 737 max slows i think we re optimistic that there will be some resolution to the virus in china and we ve got a good couple of years left at least in the aerospace cycle so that s why it s green i don t think we re trying to ignore the two things that you spoke about but i do think we re trying to be a little bit realistic that everything is likely to get resolved in a pretty short window and there s a lot of runway left emily shu bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay great and then just a follow up question is there any january data that you could provide on your industrial distribution businesses are there any early signs of green shoots or anything you re hearing in the channel that would give you confidence of a short cycle recovery in fiscal 21 todd a adams president and chief executive officer well again i think we re not looking out into fiscal 21 we re not guiding to that yet i think the data that we have so far in january supports kind of the thesis that i spoke about and mark laid out which is you know the fourth quarter is sort of tracking to what we had anticipated to deliver at low single digit core gross number ebitda it will end up being a record and record free cash flow so i think we ll get to fiscal 21 in a couple of months but so far everything seems to be tracking in line with the way we ve guided and really no surprises emily shu bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay great thank you so much operator our next question comes from the line of mig dobre from baird your line is open mig dobre robert w baird analyst thank you good morning guys todd a adams president and chief executive officer good morning mig mark peterson senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning mig mig dobre robert w baird analyst yes just wanted to follow up on this 737 question can you maybe help us understand better understand the impact in the fourth quarter on the top line for pmc and i think it s pretty clear on ebitda given that you said that that accounts for your change in guidance but yeah i m curious on the top line and how you sort of think this will play out over the next couple of quarters based on what you ve heard from your customers todd a adams president and chief executive officer sure so the run rate mig of our max exposure is in that sort of 22 million to 25 million range so you can look at what that is per quarter in our fourth quarter that gets impacted by 3 million to 4 million and the related profitability on that is sort of the majority of the change to the top end of our prior ebitda guidance if we were to look ahead we re assuming that the run rate in our fiscal 21 is substantially lower at least through the first half if not the full year based on what we ve been told so we ve been told to modify the production rates down to that 20 million to 30 million range over the course of the year if you were just to look at it on a digital basis it would impact next year by 7 million to 10 million now we think there s opportunities for us to go win some additional business with the capacity that we have and so i wouldn t flag really an issue at this point other than to say production rates at least for the next six months maybe nine months are going to be a little bit less than what they were running at the first nine months of the year those aircraft we believe still get delivered so maybe it just pushes a little bit in the meantime i think we ve highlighted the fact that we ve got an amazing center of excellence that is a competitive weapon that we can win business with and we re using that to try to fill some of that divot in the near term and frankly we re doing our best to fill some of that divot in the fourth quarter with that capacity and so that s what we think happens but as you can see the relative impact is pretty low for us relative to the size of our aerospace business and the size of rexnord it s just a little bit of an acute issue in the fourth quarter as we dial that back very quickly and deal with sort of the incremental profitability challenges when you do that but it s it hurts but it s not it s certainly not something that we re overly concerned with at this point mig dobre robert w baird analyst okay great thanks for clarifying that then the next question i had was on product line simplification and i m wondering really what you re doing here i mean i understand the concept but i m wondering what you ve done through the year and can you maybe help us understand if this is a continued drag going forward was there something special about fiscal 20 just the puts and takes todd a adams president and chief executive officer well i think when we started the process leads you to taking sort of your 20s customers your 20s products and making some tough decisions around either exiting or raising price and i would say the majority of that work is somewhat behind us by the time we get to our fiscal the end of our fiscal 20 there ll be some incremental drag going forward as you rerun all the way if you look at it there ll be some obviously some more pruning that gets done but i would say that it will be less in our fiscal 21 than it has been in our fiscal 20 where we re at now is really pivoting toward growth so with the resources that we have freed up by thinking more about our most important customers or opportunities with our best and maybe most profitable products pointing our resources toward that and so it is logical conclusion 80 20 certainly takes cost out but its intent is to free up the resources and capability to drive above market growth and i think that s what you re seeing as we talk about what s happening in sort of pockets of zurn what s happening in pockets of consumer facing end markets inside of pmc and frankly that s what that chart is intended to do in the deck where you look at all the product line revenue and what we ve done to it and where we believe we are positioned today relative to just three years ago and so we ve given you sort of the outline of what the drag is this year hopefully you start to see that the market out growth is really starting to happen in pockets i think we ve got tons of illustrations of where it s happening i mean inside of our beverage business a metal product line where we cut 60 to 70 of the skus we re experiencing 12 to 14 growth this year at great margins so we ve got a lot of these things happening and i think as you get into our 21 you ll see that contribute to the incremental out growth that we expect from these initiatives mig dobre robert w baird analyst great lastly a question on pricing is there any updated thoughts there in terms of trends and i know you re not talking about 21 but i m going to ask it anyway as you think about pricing into 21 is there anything different versus 20 at the segment level that you d call out mark peterson senior vice president and chief financial officer mig this is mark i d say as our year progressed obviously the price impact has moderated year over year so you re in the quarter under just under 1 point in pmc a couple of points to 1 5 point in water so that overall as we cycle against the price increase we put in place last year assuming a tariff environment that s stable from where we sit today i think pricing next year is very moderate for us it won t be overweight ever since as it has been in the past 1 5 years todd a adams president and chief executive officer yeah i think maybe to put a fine point on it mig the incremental margins in the third quarter were above 50 and that s what s probably very little priced so as we transitioned into the fourth quarter and into the next year most of the incremental profitability comes from the operating leverage from rbs and the things we re doing there 80 20 and then obviously the net impact of all the scofr initiatives that we ve done and are implementing and so we expect that to sort of keep the incremental margins in that 35 range as we ve been communicating mark peterson senior vice president and chief financial officer absent the scofr investment todd a adams president and chief executive officer absent the scofr investment so i think mark laid it out pretty well and i think we re optimistic that the incremental margin stay at a very high level as we make the turn to a more normalized input cost environment mig dobre robert w baird analyst very helpful thank you operator our next question comes from the line of julian mitchell from barclays your line is open trish gorman barclays investment bank analyst hey good morning this is trish on for julian and so just kind of looking at pmc exiting the second quarter it seems like you guys had kind of a more cautious tone there and that core growth in the quarter was better than we were expecting were there any end markets that were kind of positive surprises in the quarter and then if you could provide a little bit more color on what you saw from your end markets kind of by geography for food and beverage north america versus europe and process and any trends in those through january mark peterson senior vice president and chief financial officer all right i ll try to walk through that todd a adams president and chief executive officer there s a lot to unpack there mark peterson senior vice president and chief financial officer if i miss something let me know trish gorman barclays investment bank analyst okay mark peterson senior vice president and chief financial officer for us in our third quarter i d say pmc s sales dollars core growth put out just as we had expected in the quarter so there wasn t anything that was unusual in the quarter that impacted the core growth number again i think they re in line with what we had expected if we look into our fourth quarter and again as we talked about from an end market standpoint generally stable muted market conditions but generally stable from what we saw in our second quarter you play it forward in the fourth quarter and that s obviously unique we covered here is some of the impact from boeing in our fourth quarter and we cycle against basically a tougher comp and with a couple of projects that shifted last quarter in our processes that don t repeat this year so in our fourth quarter we do expect our core growth to be down a couple of points for those reasons if you take the end markets and look at it by geography again it s not really different from what we talked about last quarter food and bev for us has been a good end market for us not only just the market but things that we ve been doing as todd touched on from simplification strat accounts some of the some new product in that space we ve seen good growth out of our european based business which obviously serves the goal in north america as well in our process industries i d say generally north america is stable europe has remained weak for us both oe and mro in that space and asia for us albeit a smaller piece has been in growth mode while we are doing some things to capture some share in those regions but again small dollars for us so i think that hits your questions if i missed anything let me know trish gorman barclays investment bank analyst yeah no that s all of it thank you that s very helpful and then just maybe one on just manufacturing is there any significant seasonality within that business that we should be aware of and then maybe just from a higher level perspective if you could elaborate a little bit more on kind of how that fits within zurn s current distribution mark peterson senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah i would say it should follow the traditional cycle we see in zurn so there will be nothing different from the seasonal pattern so it will follow zurn s seasonal patterns that we traditionally see in north america it s a great addition to our portfolio it s a product category that fits really well into our sweet spot of education and healthcare in our institutional verticals so again it s one of those it s kind of a down the middle of the fairway type acquisition approach where we have a product category that fits our strongest verticals broadens our overall product portfolio so it allows us to zurn to be just more relevant than it has been it was the day before we acquired and it allows us to grow that product category much faster given our established commercial front end so again a great acquisition for us right down the middle of the fairway and we re really excited about what we can do with that product category with the zurn brand behind it trish gorman barclays investment bank analyst great

it is a great detriment to civil discourse that the divide between left and right in the united states is often depicted as being purely cultural as if one s politics were solely mediated by aesthetics such as whether one prefers shooting guns or drinking lattes this fabulist understanding of politics is harmful inasmuch as it masks the real social effects of the policy agendas pushed by left versus right seeing politics as aesthetic transforms what should be a quantitative debate with statistics and numbers about taxation and public policy questions of who benefits more or less from policy changes and devolves it into a rhetorical debate over values this is especially bad for liberals because there is a lot of quantitative evidence that the right s economic agenda is a dismal failure in terms of providing any real gains to the vast majority of the population as most salon readers are aware economist professor and new york times columnist paul krugman has spent much of his career doing precisely this debunking the asserted merits of right wing fiscal and economic policy through unemotional facts and statistics as krugman s quantitative analyses attest the economic policies hawked by conservatives are a dismal failure by any measure in any era so why do right wing policy ideas like lowering taxes on the rich or keeping health care privatized continue to be celebrated by conservatives krugman winner of the 2008 nobel memorial prize in economics has penned a new essay collection on that very theme titled arguing with zombies economics politics and the fight for a better america the book features over 400 pages of snappy essays that deflate just about every right wing and neoliberal economic talking point zombies that should have died long ago as he says while there is a philosophical case for a low tax minimal government society modern conservatism relies less on philosophical persuasion than on the fact there are people who would gain a lot personally if we were to retrace our steps toward the gilded age krugman writes in the book s introduction moreover he says the malign influence of these few super rich people is propping up zombie ideas ideas that should have been killed by contrary evidence but instead keep shambling along eating people s brains in interviewing krugman about his book i opted to go broad as throughout the years there are few subject areas untouched by his pen hence our interview touched on economic trends global politics and the relative popularity of an especially nerdy theory of economics as always this interview has been condensed and edited for print you were one of a few mainstream pundits who correctly foresaw the great recession as early as 2005 what do you make of the current economic situation why hasn t a recession come yet and are we overdue i don t see any misalignment as obvious as the housing bubble inequality and homelessness are bad things but macroeconomics isn t a morality play and injustice doesn t necessarily lead to recession the real secret of the current economy as i see it is deficit spending the 2019 federal deficit was 300 billion higher than cbo projected in 2017 before the trump tax cuts that s a lot of stimulus after years of austerity imposed by the gop on obama it s badly designed stimulus but it s still a lot of money sooner or later something will go wrong and the idea of steve mnuchin in charge of the response is pretty terrifying but i can t point to an immediate source of danger you write about social security and that being a policy debate the left ultimately won and yet one zombie idea which i still see bandied about is the idea that social security is bankrupt or will run out of money by the time millennials like me retire to me the normalization of this notion has always seemed like a ploy by the rich to make it so that my generation doesn t fight back when congress slashes social security what do you make of this sly rhetorical turn of phrase that is the notion that social security will run out of money it s not all a conspiracy right now social security is funded by a dedicated tax plus a trust fund accumulated out of past taxes at some point probably around 2035 the trust fund will be exhausted and revenues won t be enough to pay full benefits so that s a real thing but there are various ways to deal with this we could easily find new revenue sources to maintain and even expand benefits so will face an action forcing event but that doesn t mean it has to be slashed and i ve never understood the logic of claims that to avoid the possibility of future benefit cuts we need to move immediately to cut future benefits that s where the ideology comes in claiming that social security faces a crisis demanding immediate action is very convenient for conservatives and centrists who want to sound tough minded but it s nonsense you ve been trying to debunk myths about debt spending being evil for decades by my count though i know you identify as a keynesian i have watched with some curiosity the rise of modern monetary theory mmt as a trend for instance when i lived in oakland there was a meeting of mmt enthusiasts that happened outside of any university which i find remarkable for economics not that it s boring just that it s not generally a hobbyist pursuit i am wondering if you feel enthused perhaps that so many young and probably old people have seen the light on government debt spending actually i m not sure that really is different from keynesian economics most of the time its devotees seem to be inventing new terminology to make arguments mainstream keynesians already understood perfectly well a lot of it i suspect involves imperfect understanding of what we already knew and personal self promotion look at me i m a radical unorthodox thinker pay no attention to the fact that i m substantively saying the same thing as larry summers i am however gratified to see the debt obsession wane although it probably matters more that people like summers or olivier blanchard are telling us not to worry than what alternative macro people argue this leads me to a follow up question about debt i m curious if you re familiar with david graeber s book debt which is sort of both a cultural history and an economic book about debt graeber writes of the historical idea of a debt jubilee something that happens periodically often in times of political uprisings in the case of something like say student debt or medical debt do you see as productive a discussion of a jubilee or mass forgiveness would anyone truly suffer if say the world were to forgive the debt of many of the third world countries exploited by the imf debt has been on my mind lately given both sanders and warren s plans to forgive a lot of student debt i haven t read graeber i am however all in favor of debt forgiveness when debt is a real ball and chain for the economy hey we have chapter 11 bankruptcies for corporations when they re needed to avoid destructive liquidation so why not for countries too but it s usually something you want to do on a case by case basis argentina repudiated 70 percent of its debt in 2001 and the results were actually very good for a while greece eventually got a lot of debt forgiveness and the misery there would have been much less if it had happened sooner i really don t know enough about sub saharan africa to know which countries are good candidates for debt relief but i m sure there are many the thing about student debt is that there was such widespread scamming that a case by case approach would be administratively overwhelming so some kind of broad debt relief sounds good i noticed that your writing about different left leaning states tend to vary in your proscription you write very positively about denmark a social democracy whereas you don t have as many kind things to say about venezuela which you call a corrupt petrostate yet venezuela s political situation like bolivia s and cuba s is largely the result of operating under the constraints imposed by imperial powers like the u s that punish these countries for refusing to cede u s capital on the other hand denmark s high functioning social welfare state is only possible due to its status as an imperial power in its own right within its situation in the eu do you think these subtleties and these country s relationship to imperialism are worth explicating deeper for what they say about both capitalism s ability to create or destroy leftist states or perhaps disagree with this assessment i suspect the danes would find it pretty funny to be described as an imperial state what they are is a rich democracy that respects market forces without worshipping them they operate a sort of tamed bounded form of capitalism and the result is a pretty decent society venezuela isn t anything like that it wasn t always that poor but the wealth was based on oil which had a corrupting effect before chavez they were ruled by a corrupt oligarchy chavez came to power for a reason and the poor did at least get some of the spoils but the new regime never evolved a sustainable economic model it combined cronyism with a different set of cronies with an attempt to run a command and control economy it didn t have remotely enough competence to operate now even poorer countries can do a lot to improve social justice costa rica isn t utopia but it s a lot more inclusive than most of latin america taiwan has single payer health care the trouble is that social democratic experiments in developing countries are all too often cut off by coups led by the old oligarchy and yes the u s has a lot to answer for in its role in backing these coups and when a reformist government does come into power like the kirchners in argentina it often finds it hard to get the balance right heterodox economics is sometimes exactly what you need but you have to know when to stop so i don t see this as a blanket problem with capitalism denmark looks capitalist to me but it s a kinder gentler form rather than railing against the inherent evil of capitalism we should be asking how to support countries that try to get the balance right like most salon readers and like you i am no fan of trump but also i don t see trump policy wise as particularly different than george w bush policy wise they both did the bidding of the prominent right wing think tanks both in foreign policy and economic policy sure trump is more of a narcissist and openly corrupt but the results of their rule seem the same and like most presidents they are merely steering an imperialist ship that goes from country to country extracting resources and ousting redistributive political regimes in favor of any centrist or dictator who will kowtow to american interests do you truly see trump as an aberration as you ve written i thought i made it clear that i don t think of trump as an aberration so much as a culmination the gop has achieved something impressive each successive republican president makes the preceding one look good by comparison but yes the bush administration was rife with cronyism tried to dismantle the social safety net and lied us into war the thing about trump is that we ve now reached the point where our chances of ever exiting the nightmare are shrinking there was a lot of vote rigging etc under bush but we re now within striking range of becoming a de facto one party autocracy someplace we ve been heading at least since newt gingrich we may actually be lucky that trump is so addled and undisciplined if he had more self control the republic might be gone already the title and theme of the book as you write is this idea of zombies intellectual or policy ideas that stick around not because they work but because belief in them and their being enacted in policy benefits the very wealthy people who promote them directly and indirectly i was wondering if this might be a sort of a smaller example of a larger idea one that has existed for thousands of years in human history specifically what the italian marxist philosopher antonio gramsci called hegemony in his writing hegemony was the set of ruling class beliefs and principles that had been normalized such that anyone who thought otherwise was met with ridicule i bring this up only because i found myself wondering during the course of the book if perhaps the zombie wasn t merely this sort of libertarian free market view on capitalism could it be that capitalism itself is a zombie indeed the majority of my generation millennials prefer socialism to capitalism as polls repeatedly bear out do you think that it may be a zombie too i guess the question is what we mean by capitalism if we mean an economy where most but not all decisions about production and investment are made by profit seeking firms well we haven t really found an alternative that works but the idea that government can never do anything good is a zombie as i write in the book there s a range of things the government clearly does better than the private sector like guaranteeing retirement and health care oh and the post office is actually awesome what i take from the polling on socialism is that it s a reaction to right wing demonizing of every proposal to improve how we live if you spend 40 years denouncing social security medicaid food stamps antitrust policy etc as socialism if you say that denmark is socialist well eventually you get a lot of people who say they want socialism i suspect that if you asked about what we used to mean by socialism government control of manufacturing government run retailing and so on you d get a much less favorable response paul krugman s latest book arguing with zombies

book value per share and tangible stockholders equity to tangible assets ratio are all non gaap measures spirit believes that for adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share the adjustments made to net income allow investors and analysts to better assess its basic and diluted earnings per common share by removing the volatility that is associated with merger related expenses and gain on sale of investment securities that are unrelated to its core business in spirit s judgment regarding tax equivalent net interest margin the fully tax equivalent basis is the preferred industry measurement basis for net interest margin and that it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax exempt sources regarding tangible book value per share and tangible stockholders equity to tangible assets spirit believes that that these measures are important to many investors in the marketplace who are interested in changes from period to period in book value per share exclusive of changes in intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets have the effect of increasing total book value while not increasing its tangible book value the non gaap financial

beyond the human toll fears will stop people from heading to shops eating out travelling and cause other consumer costs the interpreter is published by the lowy institute an independent nonpartisan think tank based in sydney it publishes daily commentary and analysis on international events by roland rajah for a second the global economy was off to a slightly better start for 2020 the united states and china finally inked an initial phase one trade deal that at least promised to pause hostilities for a while that provided some much needed respite for a world economy which last year reached its weakest point since the global financial crisis shortly after the international monetary fund was quick to provide a more upbeat global growth outlook suggesting that slowing economic activity might be bottoming out enter the wuhan coronavirus we can only speculate what ultimate impact both human and economic the virus will have depending on how far it ends up spreading the most important channel of economic impact will likely be the hit to chinese consumer spending that s less a function of the inherent danger of the virus which is still unknown and more about the precautionary response of the government and chinese consumers leading people to stay home instead of heading to the shops eating out traveling or doing leisure activities other government containment efforts will also add to this including lost output as businesses stay shut for longer following the lunar new year how big of an impact for the chinese economy might this prove comparing it to the 2002 03 sars outbreak suggests the shock could be substantial while china s economy continued to grow briskly through that episode the underlying story suggests today s experience could be quite different in 2003 chinese consumption growth suffered a sharp slowdown the economy was only able to escape a drop in headline growth because investment and exports were booming at the time with china having entered its hyper export led growth phase following its 2001 accession to the world trade organisation the government was also able to help with stimulus measures this time around things are very different consumption is now an even more important driver of the economy while investment and exports have been weakening reflecting china s efforts to reduce its reliance on debt fueled investment and pressure on the external front from the trade war with america there is also much less scope for sizable stimulus today with chinese policymakers aiming to stabilize macro leverage in the economy in order to contain systemic financial risks china might also be reluctant to let a weaker yuan serve as a natural exhaust valve for fear of encouraging capital outflows but also potentially reigniting economic tensions with the trump administration over the exchange rate having said that if things worsen china s top leadership may eventually judge that more support is needed to buttress things if the wuhan coronavirus crisis proves around the same scale as the sars episode then china s economy could conceivably be looking at economic growth dipping from the current 6 1 percent rate to the 4 5 percent range this year even on the government s rosy numbers this is of course simply a guess a lot of variables could influence that a wider epidemic would spell bigger problems conversely even successful government and public precautions might still impose a significant cost on the economy if that is what it takes to halt the spread of the virus what might the impact be on the global economy china accounts for about a fifth of world output on a purchasing power parity basis the imf s preferred measure meaning a chinese slowdown to say 4 5 percent would directly knock off 0 3 percentage points from the fund s latest global forecast of 3 3 percent for 2020 made only last week that alone would effectively wipe out the 2020 uptick in global growth that the imf was hoping for and instead keep the world economy growing at a similar pace to last year already the slowest pace of global growth since the 2008 09 crisis knock on effects for other economies could however make things worse it is not clear how far the virus itself might spread in other countries but the indirect effect of a sharply slowing chinese economy would be felt by others and could be a major difference compared to the sars experience not only are the risks of a sharp chinese slowdown greater this time around but china is also now a far more important source of demand for the rest of the world particularly in asia what about for australia australia s tourism and education exports to china would appear most in the firing line china has announced a halt to overseas tour groups however australia s tourism exports to china only amount to about 0 2 percent of gdp education exports amount to a more sizable 0 6 percent but the experience during the sars epidemic was that education exports remained resilient suggesting less cause for concern meanwhile the fact that the overall slowdown in china s economy will be consumption led should help insulate australia s more important commodity exports from major damage if china were to resort to renewed stimulus it could even provide some boost australia s much less significant agricultural exports could however take a hit from weaker chinese consumption a weaker aussie dollar in response to increased global risk aversion and slower chinese growth should however provide at least a partial offset giving a boost to australia s international competitiveness including tourism education and agricultural exports to other countries the economic risks for australia therefore look less severe than some might fear all of this however depends on how far the virus ultimately spreads read next china tries to stop spread of virus but no vaccine in sight this article originally appeared in the lowy interpreter the news

this article originally appeared on salon it is a great detriment to civil discourse that the divide between left and right in the united states is often depicted as being purely cultural as if one s politics were solely mediated by aesthetics such as whether one prefers shooting guns or drinking lattes this fabulist understanding of politics is harmful inasmuch as it masks the real social effects of the policy agendas pushed by left versus right seeing politics as aesthetic transforms what should be a quantitative debate with statistics and numbers about taxation and public policy questions of who benefits more or less from policy changes and devolves it into a rhetorical debate over values this is especially bad for liberals because there is a lot of quantitative evidence that the right s economic agenda is a dismal failure in terms of providing any real gains to the vast majority of the population as most salon readers are aware economist professor and new york times columnist paul krugman has spent much of his career doing precisely this debunking the asserted merits of right wing fiscal and economic policy through unemotional facts and statistics as krugman s quantitative analyses attest the economic policies hawked by conservatives are a dismal failure by any measure in any era so why do right wing policy ideas like lowering taxes on the rich or keeping health care privatized continue to be celebrated by conservatives krugman winner of the 2008 nobel memorial prize in economics has penned a new essay collection on that very theme titled arguing with zombies economics politics and the fight for a better america the book features over 400 pages of snappy essays that deflate just about every right wing and neoliberal economic talking point zombies that should have died long ago as he says while there is a philosophical case for a low tax minimal government society modern conservatism relies less on philosophical persuasion than on the fact there are people who would gain a lot personally if we were to retrace our steps toward the gilded age krugman writes in the book s introduction moreover he says the malign influence of these few super rich people is propping up zombie ideas ideas that should have been killed by contrary evidence but instead keep shambling along eating people s brains in interviewing krugman about his book i opted to go broad as throughout the years there are few subject areas untouched by his pen hence our interview touched on economic trends global politics and the relative popularity of an especially nerdy theory of economics as always this interview has been condensed and edited for print you were one of a few mainstream pundits who correctly foresaw the great recession as early as 2005 what do you make of the current economic situation why hasn t a recession come yet and are we overdue i don t see any misalignment as obvious as the housing bubble inequality and homelessness are bad things but macroeconomics isn t a morality play and injustice doesn t necessarily lead to recession the real secret of the current economy as i see it is deficit spending the 2019 federal deficit was 300 billion higher than cbo projected in 2017 before the trump tax cuts that s a lot of stimulus after years of austerity imposed by the gop on obama it s badly designed stimulus but it s still a lot of money sooner or later something will go wrong and the idea of steve mnuchin in charge of the response is pretty terrifying but i can t point to an immediate source of danger you write about social security and that being a policy debate the left ultimately won and yet one zombie idea which i still see bandied about is the idea that social security is bankrupt or will run out of money by the time millennials like me retire to me the normalization of this notion has always seemed like a ploy by the rich to make it so that my generation doesn t fight back when congress slashes social security what do you make of this sly rhetorical turn of phrase that is the notion that social security will run out of money it s not all a conspiracy right now social security is funded by a dedicated tax plus a trust fund accumulated out of past taxes at some point probably around 2035 the trust fund will be exhausted and revenues won t be enough to pay full benefits so that s a real thing but there are various ways to deal with this we could easily find new revenue sources to maintain and even expand benefits so will face an action forcing event but that doesn t mean it has to be slashed and i ve never understood the logic of claims that to avoid the possibility of future benefit cuts we need to move immediately to cut future benefits that s where the ideology comes in claiming that social security faces a crisis demanding immediate action is very convenient for conservatives and centrists who want to sound tough minded but it s nonsense you ve been trying to debunk myths about debt spending being evil for decades by my count though i know you identify as a keynesian i have watched with some curiosity the rise of modern monetary theory mmt as a trend for instance when i lived in oakland there was a meeting of mmt enthusiasts that happened outside of any university which i find remarkable for economics not that it s boring just that it s not generally a hobbyist pursuit i am wondering if you feel enthused perhaps that so many young and probably old people have seen the light on government debt spending actually i m not sure that really is different from keynesian economics most of the time its devotees seem to be inventing new terminology to make arguments mainstream keynesians already understood perfectly well a lot of it i suspect involves imperfect understanding of what we already knew and personal self promotion look at me i m a radical unorthodox thinker pay no attention to the fact that i m substantively saying the same thing as larry summers i am however gratified to see the debt obsession wane although it probably matters more that people like summers or olivier blanchard are telling us not to worry than what alternative macro people argue this leads me to a follow up question about debt i m curious if you re familiar with david graeber s book debt which is sort of both a cultural history and an economic book about debt graeber writes of the historical idea of a debt jubilee something that happens periodically often in times of political uprisings in the case of something like say student debt or medical debt do you see as productive a discussion of a jubilee or mass forgiveness would anyone truly suffer if say the world were to forgive the debt of many of the third world countries exploited by the imf debt has been on my mind lately given both sanders and warren s plans to forgive a lot of student debt i haven t read graeber i am however all in favor of debt forgiveness when debt is a real ball and chain for the economy hey we have chapter 11 bankruptcies for corporations when they re needed to avoid destructive liquidation so why not for countries too but it s usually something you want to do on a case by case basis argentina repudiated 70 percent of its debt in 2001 and the results were actually very good for a while greece eventually got a lot of debt forgiveness and the misery there would have been much less if it had happened sooner i really don t know enough about sub saharan africa to know which countries are good candidates for debt relief but i m sure there are many the thing about student debt is that there was such widespread scamming that a case by case approach would be administratively overwhelming so some kind of broad debt relief sounds good i noticed that your writing about different left leaning states tend to vary in your proscription you write very positively about denmark a social democracy whereas you don t have as many kind things to say about venezuela which you call a corrupt petrostate yet venezuela s political situation like bolivia s and cuba s is largely the result of operating under the constraints imposed by imperial powers like the u s that punish these countries for refusing to cede u s capital on the other hand denmark s high functioning social welfare state is only possible due to its status as an imperial power in its own right within its situation in the eu do you think these subtleties and these country s relationship to imperialism are worth explicating deeper for what they say about both capitalism s ability to create or destroy leftist states or perhaps disagree with this assessment i suspect the danes would find it pretty funny to be described as an imperial state what they are is a rich democracy that respects market forces without worshipping them they operate a sort of tamed bounded form of capitalism and the result is a pretty decent society venezuela isn t anything like that it wasn t always that poor but the wealth was based on oil which had a corrupting effect before chavez they were ruled by a corrupt oligarchy chavez came to power for a reason and the poor did at least get some of the spoils but the new regime never evolved a sustainable economic model it combined cronyism with a different set of cronies with an attempt to run a command and control economy it didn t have remotely enough competence to operate now even poorer countries can do a lot to improve social justice costa rica isn t utopia but it s a lot more inclusive than most of latin america taiwan has single payer health care the trouble is that social democratic experiments in developing countries are all too often cut off by coups led by the old oligarchy and yes the u s has a lot to answer for in its role in backing these coups and when a reformist government does come into power like the kirchners in argentina it often finds it hard to get the balance right heterodox economics is sometimes exactly what you need but you have to know when to stop so i don t see this as a blanket problem with capitalism denmark looks capitalist to me but it s a kinder gentler form rather than railing against the inherent evil of capitalism we should be asking how to support countries that try to get the balance right like most salon readers and like you i am no fan of trump but also i don t see trump policy wise as particularly different than george w bush policy wise they both did the bidding of the prominent right wing think tanks both in foreign policy and economic policy sure trump is more of a narcissist and openly corrupt but the results of their rule seem the same and like most presidents they are merely steering an imperialist ship that goes from country to country extracting resources and ousting redistributive political regimes in favor of any centrist or dictator who will kowtow to american interests do you truly see trump as an aberration as you ve written i thought i made it clear that i don t think of trump as an aberration so much as a culmination the gop has achieved something impressive each successive republican president makes the preceding one look good by comparison but yes the bush administration was rife with cronyism tried to dismantle the social safety net and lied us into war the thing about trump is that we ve now reached the point where our chances of ever exiting the nightmare are shrinking there was a lot of vote rigging etc under bush but we re now within striking range of becoming a de facto one party autocracy someplace we ve been heading at least since newt gingrich we may actually be lucky that trump is so addled and undisciplined if he had more self control the republic might be gone already the title and theme of the book as you write is this idea of zombies intellectual or policy ideas that stick around not because they work but because belief in them and their being enacted in policy benefits the very wealthy people who promote them directly and indirectly i was wondering if this might be a sort of a smaller example of a larger idea one that has existed for thousands of years in human history specifically what the italian marxist philosopher antonio gramsci called hegemony in his writing hegemony was the set of ruling class beliefs and principles that had been normalized such that anyone who thought otherwise was met with ridicule i bring this up only because i found myself wondering during the course of the book if perhaps the zombie wasn t merely this sort of libertarian free market view on capitalism could it be that capitalism itself is a zombie indeed the majority of my generation millennials prefer socialism to capitalism as polls repeatedly bear out do you think that it may be a zombie too i guess the question is what we mean by capitalism if we mean an economy where most but not all decisions about production and investment are made by profit seeking firms well we haven t really found an alternative that works but the idea that government can never do anything good is a zombie as i write in the book there s a range of things the government clearly does better than the private sector like guaranteeing retirement and health care oh and the post office is actually awesome what i take from the polling on socialism is that it s a reaction to right wing demonizing of every proposal to improve how we live if you spend 40 years denouncing social security medicaid food stamps antitrust policy etc as socialism if you say that denmark is socialist well eventually you get a lot of people who say they want socialism i suspect that if you asked about what we used to mean by socialism government control of manufacturing government run retailing and so on you d get a much less favorable response

net income allow investors and analysts to better assess its basic and diluted earnings per common share by removing the volatility that is associated with merger related expenses and gain on sale of investment securities that are unrelated to its core business in spirit s judgment regarding tax equivalent net interest margin the fully tax equivalent basis is the preferred industry measurement basis for net interest margin and that it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax exempt sources regarding tangible book value per share and tangible stockholders equity to tangible assets spirit believes that that these measures are important to many investors in the marketplace who are interested in changes from period to period in book value per share exclusive of changes in intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets have the effect of increasing total book value while not increasing its tangible book value the non gaap financial
