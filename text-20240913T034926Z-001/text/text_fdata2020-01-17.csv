ignorance or denial by the u s poses grave dangers the recent china international import expo ciie in shanghai attracted little attention in the western press but it is one more reminder that china is an economic and trading powerhouse that has surpassed the us that is right the word is surpassed the ciie also serves to remind us that china s economic power now stands on four mighty pillars americans must understand this clearly for ultimately all power grows out of economic power including military power a confrontational approach to china is therefore extremely dangerous in many ways and it is being urged on us by almost all of the ruling elite the consequences of such confrontation are far different from aggression against venezuela or bolivia or syria or iraq or afghanistan or even russia failure to comprehend china s strength could lead to a mortal disaster for the u s and for china and indeed the world as henry kissinger has recently warned us this brief essay is written as one small contribution to forestall such a disaster it provides a thumbnail sketch a primer of china s economic tetrad that is four pillars which provide a measure of china s power and how it interacts with the world based on that power these four are 1 the gdp in ppp terms 2 exports 3 imports and 4 internal retail market in each case we shall compare them to the u s there have been plenty of forecasts predicting the imminent disintegration of china s economy over the decades and none has come to pass so let us have done with forecasts and concentrate mainly on what we observe before us in that spirit this essay is for the most part a review of cold hard facts as they presently exist it is written by a non economist and that is one reason it hews to the world as it is not as it might or might not be given a host of assumptions models and mostly wishful thinking i hope it does not insult your intelligence dear reader it is only an introduction that hopefully also serves as a wake up call to the reality of our world china has the world s largest gdp in ppp terms and this has been true since november 2014 of the four economic pillars we wish to consider the first and most fundamental is the sheer size of its economy as seen in its gross domestic product gdp here the conventional wisdom views china s as the number two gdp but the surprise to most people is that in fact it is number one china now has the largest gdp in the world in purchasing power parity ppp terms a metric used by the imf world bank and even the cia for comparing gdps of different countries so it is a measure not to be dismissed lightly or dismissed at all the imf which provides the most recent data provided in october 2019 gives the ppp gdp for china and the us thus china 27 3 trillion u s 21 4 trillion the number for china does not include hong kong a chinese city with a ppp gdp of 0 491 trillion or macau with 0 078 trillion those two bring china s total to 27 9 tn let s now consider what the ppp metric is in order to see why it is the most meaningful way to compare national gdps briefly the ppp calculation corrects the nominal gdp the gdp of any country in dollars the nominal gdp is calculated simply by using the present currency exchange rate to express a country s gdp in dollars rather than the native currency for example the chinese yuan the ppp correction of the nominal gdp gives a measure of the actual purchasing ability or purchasing power of the total gdp in a given country let s take a hypothetical example to understand this suppose china produced 127 trillion yuan s worth of goods and services in some year past hypothetically in 2017 using an exchange rate of 6 37 yuan per dollar that amounts to us 11 97 trillion that is china s nominal gdp let us say that the united states gdp that year was 19 36 trillion these values 11 97 trillion and 19 46 trillion are designated as the nominal gdps for the two countries and these nominal values are the ones we see for the most part in the monopoly media but now let us assume that the only good or service produced in the two countries were a big mac in 2017 let us say again hypothetically that a big mac costs about 3 17 in china but 5 28 in the u s using the standard exchange rate for chinese yuan to u s dollars values not too wide of the actual ones thus big macs are cheaper in china for all sorts of reasons including different costs of ingredients labor transport etc so the big mac ppp ratio for us china in this example is 5 28 3 17 or 1 67 now we can calculate the gdps in ppp terms by applying that ratio to the chinese nominal gdp the new values are 19 36 trillion for the us unchanged and 19 93 trillion that is 11 97 trillion times 1 67 for china now china s gdp in ppp terms is the larger of the two the real ppp ratio used by imf world bank and cia world fact book does not limit itself to big macs of course but uses a basket of goods and services to calculate the ppp ratio in that basket are rockets as well as hamburgers the wages of factory workers and tech workers as well as those of mcdonalds workers factory robots as well as hamburger ovens the ppp gdp tells us how much more purchasing power is available than might be recognized based solely on simple exchange rates i e nominal gdps in fact there is a big mac ppp index originally suggested by the economist some years back as a comic device but it can give some rough qualitative information since the recipe and ingredients for the big mac are precisely the same the world over universality is a big mac characteristic the same quality claimed by many religions and for western values the ppp metric is the relevant one for measuring the power of an economy since it tells us what can actually be purchased currency is meaningless unless and until it actually buys something using the ppp metric china s gdp surpassed that of the u s in november of 2014 according to the imf and today stands at approximately 130 of the u s ppp gdp according to the imf s values for 2019 given above however nominal gdp is used by the us and chinese government routinely in public statements and there the chinese gdp is today about 66 of the us gdp one suspects that this convention satisfies the chinese government s desire not to alarm the us and the us government s desire to appear as number one in all things but barring some unforeseen catastrophe the same story will soon be repeated with the nominal gdp china will surpass the us in nominal gdp in about 15 years time by my rough calculation but that is a prediction and we wish to avoid them as much as possible here we wish to emphasize the ppp gdp as it already exists the monopoly western media also use the nominal gdps of china and the us for comparison rarely ever alluding to ppp gdp so it is no surprise that relatively few people are aware of the latter furthermore even at its present slowed pace of about 6 china s gdp is growing at a much faster rate than that of the us which is about 2 0 there is no sign that china s gdp will fall back to number two and no prediction from a reliable source that it will do so it is this enormous and rapidly growing gdp that is the fundamental pillar of china s economic power finally even though china has the world s largest gross ppp gdp it remains a developing nation it is now both rich and poor with nearly 1 4 billion people its per capita nominal gdp is about one quarter that of the u s china is rich in terms of collective power but relatively poor in terms of individual income so china needs to develop its economy much more if it is to meet its stated goal of bringing most of its people into the middle class by 2049 the centenary of its founding nevertheless national economic power depends on total economic output not per capita output if 1 billion people each contribute a dime or 100 million each contribute a dollar the end result is sufficient to buy for example a 100 million base for satellite launches for national power more often than not it is the total that counts in general the ppp metric is used only for gdp all values in the following sections are based simply on the exchange rate with no further corrections china is the world s number one exporter the second pillar underlying china s economic prowess is its well known status as the world s largest exporter here the surprise is that china is ahead but not by so much as we are often told when china is excoriated for taking advantage of the us in international trade according to the un s most recent numbers those for 2018 the export of goods by the u s and china are as follows in trillions of us dollars export of goods 2018 china 2 5 trillion u s 1 7 trillion this number for china does not include hong kong with an export volume of 0 6 trillion an addition that brings the total to 3 1 trillion but these numbers the ones usually given do not include export of services which provides a much larger addition to the u s s total exports than to china s export of services 2018 china 0 23 trillion us 0 83 trillion in 2018 the u s was far and away the world s largest exporter of services whereas china lagged behind the us uk germany and france to be the fifth largest services exporter and over the period from 2014 to 2018 china s service exports grew by 6 compared to 11 for the u s in the area of service exports china shows definite weakness perhaps due to its greater language and cultural distance from the west india for example though number 6 in service exports saw them grow by 30 in the 2014 2018 period for those curious about which services are exported some of the major ones coming out of china are found here and out of the u s here since the us is primarily a service economy it is not surprising that services should be about one third of its total exports and service exports may provide better jobs than manufacture of products for export for example one category of service export is education when foreigners come to the us and pay to go to school is it better to be producing more professors or more auto workers which provides better income and better quality of life i see china s relatively poor performance in this area as a definite weakness partly due to the level of development of its economy and partly due to its lesser soft power and its linguistic and cultural distance from the west total export of goods and services 2018 china 2 7 trillion us 2 5 trillion nevertheless china is number one in exports and its export growth has proved remarkably resilient according to the financial times of 9 22 2018 after overtaking germany as the world s top exporter of goods in 2009 chinese exports have grown at an average of 5 per cent a year to 2 26tn in 2017 compared with annual global export growth below 2 per cent china s share of manufacturing exports expanded to 18 per cent from 12 per cent during the past decade adding to gains made after china s 2001 entry to the wto which accelerated the decline of manufacturing employment in developed countries in the same very informative piece the ft also notes that although the world s attention has been focused on china s development of high tech products by companies like huawei the rapid increase in china s exports has been for medium level technology such as vehicles and their parts electrical machinery and construction machinery says the ft china is the now dominant producer in medium high tech industries with its global share nearly tripling in the past decade to 32 per cent according to the us national science board surpassing the us in the late 2000s and the eu this decade moreover 48 of china s exports go to countries outside the developed countries of the oecd organization for economic cooperation and development according to the ft this lessens the influence of the u s and its european semi vassal states over china and it provides links of all sorts between china and the developing world china appears to be far from relying solely on the u s market and other western markets to consume its products china is now showing determination to move further up the value chain to high tech and this was formalized in 2015 with the made in china 2025 10 year plan inspired by germany s industry 4 0 it is this not the belt and road initiative that has official washington wringing its hands this program is already well under way as exemplified by huwei s 5g technology and growth to number three among sales in smart phones in this essay however we are trying to speak as much as possible about present realities and china is only at the threshold of high tech production and exports but let us note the following from the nikkei asian review in a story titled china memory chip output zooms from zero to 5 of world total mass production to start in 2020 as beijing guns for technological self sufficiency the opening reads taipei beijing s push for technological self sufficiency is on the verge of a major breakthrough with the country s nascent chip industry on track to produce around 5 of the world s memory chips by the end of 2020 from virtually zero last year sources familiar with the matter told the nikkei asian review the us restrictions on memory chips and other electronic commodities are apparently driving china to become self sufficient and thereby becoming a competitor with the u s and other developed countries on world markets one can ask if the u s is behaving wisely in cutting off china from importing u s electronic products it is hard to see how that helps the u s balance of payments much less the future market share of u s chip makers and manufacturers of other electronic devices are the us concerns over security real or merely another form of protectionism china is the number two importer in the world with the second largest retail market and the largest e retail market the ciie in shanghai china s rapid ascent as importer is not so well known as its role as exporter however in november 2019 the second annual china international import expo ciie in shanghai brought this to the world s attention business people and government officials from all over the world came to shanghai to pitch their wares to chinese importers for the burgeoning internal chinese market recall the first limb of the chinese economic triad is the ever growing chinese economy with growing wages and salaries which generate a huge demand for products perhaps the most noted dignitary was president macron of france who was urging french wines and other goods on chinese importers wine merchants and restauranteurs he even seduced xi jinping into tasting some gallic grape which they jointly toasted of course xi gave a speech touting what else opening up and reminding the visitors that said opening up included a welcome mat for exporters from around the globe to sell to china the import volumes of goods for 2018 the latest year for which values are available are china 2 1 trillion u s 2 6 trillion import of services 2018 china 0 5 trillion u s 0 6 trillion total import of goods and services 2018 china 2 6 trillion u s 3 2 trillion further china s imports are now approaching its exports of goods and services in value 2 7 trillion see above with imports growing at nearly twice the rate of exports if this trend continues as seems extremely likely the chinese positive trade surplus should diminish making its exports and imports more balanced and removing some of the fear of its export prowess in the world more pointedly china s growing imports provide the basis for alleviating the trade imbalance that is driving the trumpian trade war with china if one looks at what the u s exports and what china currently needs the match is pretty good china needs agricultural and very high tech products cut china off from either and it will find other sources as it has for agricultural products or invent and manufacture its own for example chips for electronic devices we might ask if that is a wise strategy for the u s china s retail market is roughly equal to that of the u s and growing faster the growth in imports is one sign of more purchasing power in china another is the extraordinary growth in china s retail market which is now almost the size of the u s s retail sales 2018 china 5 2 trillion us 5 3 trillion the boom in china s retail market is made by possible by the growth of its ever expanding middle class as monica peart senior forecasting director of emarketer puts it in recent years consumers in china have experienced rising incomes catapulting millions into the new middle class the result has been a marked rise in purchasing power and average spending per person china s e retail market is even more remarkable far and away the largest in the world again emarketer china s is by far the largest ecommerce market in the world more than three times the size of the us ecommerce market china has a 54 7 share of the world s ecommerce sales while the us has just 16 6 this is also no surprise because the chinese have become very tech savvy and closely linked to the internet with the links growing closer as the rollout of 5g already well underway in china continues rapidly given the size of the chinese market and its continued growth virtually no large corporation wants to be shut out of the chinese market any more than it wants to be shut out of the u s market not only corporations but the countries in which they reside must take account of this this gives china enormous influence an influence built upon the rising prosperity of its people and no longer on their sacrifice moreover although china has a middle class of about 300 million people approximately the size of the entire u s population it has 1 4 billion people and it plans to bring almost all of them into its middle class by 2049 on time for the centenary of the founding of new china the immensity of such an economy will make china a power without economic peer on the world stage and it seems irreversible barring the prospect of an all out war in the pacific but that is for the future and is beyond the scope of this essay predictions are hazardous even in the case of the simplest of systems china s present state is quite enough to argue that it should be the object of cooperation not conflict china s triad the nuclear one we would be remiss if after discussion of china s economic tetrad that we did not also mention china s nuclear weapons triad one month before the november ciie meeting in shanghai was china s national day parade in beijing on october 1 celebrating the 70th anniversary of new china s founding there on display was china s nuclear deterrent the triad of land based icbms intercontinental ballistic missiles slbms submarine launched ballistic missiles and air launched weapons the new advanced icbms made their first appearance providing evidence that china s nuclear triad is now fully developed in short china like russia and the u s can now destroy any country that attempts to make war on it but several features of china s nuclear deterrent deserve notice as hong kong s south china morning post tells us the current chinese nuclear arsenal is estimated to be around 250 warheads in accordance with its minimal deterrence strategy and the country has adopted a no first use doctrine towards nuclear missiles according to zhou chenming a beijing based military commentator china doesn t need to keep too many nuclear warheads and just lets long range missiles be equipped with the expensive nuclear warheads because that s enough for nuclear deterrence unlike russia or the u s china does not have thousands of nuclear warheads and unlike the us it has taken first use of nuclear weapons off the table china possesses a powerful deterrent but presents no offensive threat conclusion what are we to make of this economic and military power of china in sum china is a mighty economic power that cannot be destroyed and has no offensive posture toward the u s or any other country what is the u s to do is the answer not obvious in fact inescapable given the relative power of the two nations it is time to work out a peaceful arrangement that allows us to live together the u s should do this now while it is possible and before the catastrophe of accidental war nuclear war engulfs us all the clock is ticking
e ver since the dollar cemented its role as the world s dominant currency in the 1950s it has been clear that america s position as the sole financial superpower gives it extraordinary influence over other countries economic destinies but it is only under president donald trump that america has used its powers routinely and to their full extent by engaging in financial warfare the results have been awe inspiring and shocking they have in turn prompted other countries to seek to break free of american financial hegemony listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element in 2018 america s treasury put legal measures in place that prevented rusal a strategically important russian aluminium firm from freely accessing the dollar based financial system with devastating effect overnight it was unable to deal with many counterparties western clearing houses refused to settle its debt securities the price of its bonds collapsed the restrictions were later lifted america now has over 30 active financial and trade sanctions programmes on january 10th it announced measures that the treasury secretary steven mnuchin said would cut off billions of dollars of support to the iranian regime the state department meanwhile said that iraq could lose access to its government account at the federal reserve bank of new york that would restrict iraq s use of oil revenues causing a cash crunch and flattening its economy america is uniquely well positioned to use financial warfare in the service of foreign policy the dollar is used globally as a unit of account store of value and medium of exchange at least half of cross border trade invoices are in dollars that is five times america s share of world goods imports and three times its share of exports the dollar is the preferred currency of central banks and capital markets accounting for close to two thirds of global securities issuance and foreign exchange reserves the world s financial rhythm is american when interest rates move or risk appetite on wall street shifts global markets respond the world s financial plumbing has uncle sam s imprint on it too most international transactions are ultimately cleared in dollars through new york by american correspondent banks america has a tight grip on the main cross border messaging system used by banks swift whose members ping each other 30m times a day another part of the us centric network is chips a clearing house that processes 1 5trn worth of payments daily america uses these systems to monitor activity denied access to this infrastructure an organisation becomes isolated and usually financially crippled individuals and institutions across the planet are thus subject to american jurisdiction and vulnerable to punishment america began to flex its financial muscles after the terrorist attacks of september 11th 2001 it imposed huge fines on foreign banks for money laundering and sanctions busting in 2014 a 9bn penalty against bnp paribas shook the french establishment mr trump has taken the weaponisation of finance to a new level see chart he has used sanctions to throttle iran north korea russia turkey briefly venezuela and others his arsenal also includes tariffs and legal assaults on companies most strikingly huawei which mr trump accuses of spying for china secondary sanctions target other countries companies that trade with blacklisted states after america pulled out of a nuclear deal with iran in 2018 european firms fled iran even as the eu encouraged them to stay swift quickly fell into line when america threatened action if it did not cut off iranian banks after the reimposition of sanctions in 2018 using the dollar to extend the reach of american law and policy fits mr trump s america first credo other countries view it as an abuse of power that includes adversaries such as china and russia russia s president vladimir putin talks of the dollar being used as a political weapon and it includes allies such as britain and france who worry that mr trump risks undermining america s role as guarantor of orderliness in global commerce it may eventually lead to the demise of america s financial hegemony as other countries seek to dethrone its mighty currency the new age of international monetary experimentation features the de dollarisation of assets trade workarounds using local currencies and swaps and new bank to bank payment mechanisms and digital currencies in june the chinese and russian presidents said they would expand settlement of bilateral trade in their own currencies on the sidelines of a recent summit leaders from iran malaysia turkey and qatar proposed using cryptocurrencies national currencies gold and barter for trade such activity marks an inflection point says tom keatinge of rusi a think tank countries that used merely to gripe about america s financial might are now pushing back russia has gone furthest it has designated expendable entities to engage in commerce with countries america considers rogue in order to avoid putting important banks and firms at risk state backed promsvyazbank pjsc is used for trade in arms so as to shield bigger banks like sberbank and vtb from the threat of sanctions russia has also been busy de dollarising parts of its financial system since 2013 its central bank has cut the dollar share of its foreign exchange reserves from over 40 to 24 since 2018 the bank s holdings of american treasury debt have fallen from nearly 100bn to under 10bn russia s finance ministry recently announced plans to lower the dollar share of its 125bn sovereign wealth fund we aren t aiming to ditch the dollar mr putin has said the dollar is ditching us elvira nabiullina russia s central bank governor says the move was partly motivated by american sanctions which were imposed after russia s annexation of crimea in 2014 but also by a desire to diversify currency risk i see a global shift in mood she says we are gradually moving towards a more multi currency international monetary system ms nabiullina echoes mark carney the governor of the bank of england who said in august that the dollar centric system won t hold russia s debt is being de dollarised too new issuance is often in roubles or euros and the government is exploring selling yuan denominated bonds russian companies have shrunk their foreign debts by 260bn since 2014 of that 200bn was dollar denominated conversely russian firms and households retain a fondness for dollars when it comes to holding international assets they have 80bn more than they did in 2014 dmitry dolgin of ing a bank finds this puzzling but suspects it could be that the interest rates on dollar assets higher than on euro equivalents outweigh the perceived risk from sanctions dasvidaniya dollar ing expects 62 of russia s goods and services exports to have been settled in dollars in 2019 down from 80 in 2013 its trade with china was almost all in dollars in 2013 now less than half is trade with india much of it in the sanctions sensitive defence sector shifted from almost all dollars to almost all roubles over that period one reason for this shift say russian officials is that it speeds trade up since dollar payments can be delayed for weeks as financial intermediaries run sanctions checks energy and commodities firms are among russia s most active de dollarisers the greenback is the global benchmark currency for oil trading and escaping its grip is hard the key thing to understand is that risk management the entire derivatives complex is in dollars explains the boss of a global energy firm so if you want to have risk management as an oil trader buyer or producer you have to have contact with the dollar system nonetheless rosneft a state backed producer that accounts for over 40 of russia s crude output has denominated its tender contracts in euros surgutneftegas another producer still prices in dollars but has added a clause to contracts saying they can be switched to euros at its request a back up plan in case trump throws shit at the fan says a trader last march gazprom priced a natural gas shipment to western europe in roubles for the first time the cost of switching out of dollars is modest says an executive at a global oil trading firm an extra person in the finance department and a bit more currency risk will china follow the trail blazed by russia mr trump has exposed china s profound vulnerability to the dollar centric financial system america s ability to blacklist or hobble chinese tech firms such as huawei ultimately rests on punishing suppliers and other counterparties who do business with them through the dollar based banking and payments system an american legal case against a senior huawei executive who is fighting extradition from canada reportedly relies in part on evidence from an american appointed overseer at hsbc an asia centric bank run from london in october america sanctioned eight cutting edge chinese tech firms for alleged human rights abuses in xinjiang province the administration has threatened to block listings by chinese firms in new york and restrict purchases by american investors of chinese shares china s first attempt to bypass the dollar was bungled after the financial crisis in 2007 09 it promoted the international use of the yuan and pressed for it to become part of the imf s special drawing rights in effect receiving the fund s imprimatur as a reserve currency china set up currency swap deals with foreign central banks it has done over 35 there was heady talk of the yuan challenging the dollar for the top spot by 2020 then came a stockmarket panic in 2015 and the government clumsily tightened capital controls the yuan s share of global payment by value has stayed at about 2 for several years zhou xiaochuan a former governor of china s central bank has said that yuan internationalisation which he promoted while in office was a premature baby america s display of financial firepower and new technologies are changing the calculus again china has some of the building blocks to become more autonomous it has its own domestic payments and settlement infrastructure called cips launched in 2015 it has so far complemented swift which it uses for interbank messaging it is tiny processing less in 2018 than swift does each day but it simplifies cross border payments in yuan giving banks lots of nodes for settlements reports suggest that china india and others may be exploring a jointly run swift alternative a will and a huawei parts of the world s consumer finance system are coming under china s sway thanks to its digital platform firms which have globalised faster than its conventional banks payments through alibaba and its affiliate ant financial are accepted by merchants in 56 countries the alipay logo is in some places as common as visa s in capital markets in 2018 china introduced a yuan denominated crude oil futures contract on a shanghai exchange known as the petroyuan it is seen by some as a potential rival to the dollar in pricing oil china has encouraged important firms listed in america to list their shares closer to home as well on november 26th alibaba china s most valuable company which in 2014 floated in new york rather than in hong kong or shanghai completed a 13 4bn additional listing in hong kong the funds were raised in hong kong dollars as a result of the continuous innovation and changes to the hong kong capital market we are able to realise what we regrettably missed out on five years ago said daniel zhang alibaba s chief executive china s central bank is reported to be working on a new digital currency though details are sparse some speculate that it wants to get a head start on america in building whatever international system emerges for managing payments in central bank issued digital currencies it discussed creating a common cryptocurrency with other brics countries brazil russia india and south africa at a recent summit china may end up doing bitcoin with an authoritarian twist instead of anonymity it may want all data to be trackable and centrally stored that america s geopolitical rivals want to escape the dollar s dominance is no surprise perhaps more striking is that its allies are flirting with it too in her manifesto for 2019 24 ursula von der leyen the new president of the european commission said i want to strengthen the international role of the euro jean claude juncker her predecessor has called the dollar s dominance in european energy trade an aberration when just 2 of imports come from america the commission is working on a new action plan part of which involves encouraging eu countries to eliminate undue reference to the dollar in payments and trade invoicing according to a staffer so far the eu s main initiative has involved iran it has tried to create a way for its banks and firms to trade with it while shielding them from america s wrath but instex a clearing house created for this purpose by britain france and germany with the commission s support is crude and limited it is essentially a barter mechanism and does not cover oil sales it is limited to non sanctioned humanitarian trade it was structured to allow firms to engage in commerce without resort to the dollar or swift but they have stayed away for fear of incurring secondary sanctions the stuttering performance of instex reflects the sheer scope of america s reach as adam m smith a sanctions expert at gibson dunn a law firm points out america can claim jurisdiction if a transaction has any american nexus even if it is not denominated in dollars this includes transactions that rely on banks under american jurisdiction or where a foreign counterparty relies on american nationals to approve facilitate or process the transaction or where one party uses a back end payment accounting or email system that is stored on servers in america despite this some european officials remain optimistic on november 29th six more eu states said they planned to join instex it s a ten to twenty year thing and hopefully not only covering iran you can t undo decades of policy in a year says a french official and if europe manages to reform the inner workings of the euro its financial reach will expand we need to complete the project first banking union fiscal integration genuine capital markets union and so on another french official says european powers are likely to play a leading role in central bank efforts to create a global electronic currency last year mr carney floated the idea of a network of central bank digital monies that could serve as a global invoicing currency if it happens america may not be invited a haven above the true test of any reserve currency is a financial crisis eswar prasad of cornell university the author of the dollar trap notes that the greenback benefits during times of turmoil the 2007 09 crisis which originated in america paradoxically strengthened its status as a safe haven when global trade saving borrowing and reserves are largely in one currency these strengths are mutually reinforcing no other capital market comes close to america s for depth and liquidity a key factor when choosing a currency for commerce

by democratic party house representatives have voted by a wide margin to approve version 2 of the north american free trade agreement known as the united states mexico canada agreement even rose delauro of connecticut in the past a strong leader within congress in the fight against so called free trade agreements is on board with this one representative delauro and other congressional democrats claim they forced the trump administration to strengthen the agreement by compelling the insertion of language that allegedly creates effective and meaningful labor standards and protect worker rights supports environmental standards and protect access to affordable medicine can this really be true or have congressional democrats reverted to normal form rolling in the dirt at the feet of republicans yet again although democrats and public pressure forced through some improvements the united states mexico canada agreement usmca or nafta 2 isn t substantially different and remains a document of corporate domination it would appear that appearances not substance drove democrats in the house of representatives to approve the deal that was signaled by house speaker nancy pelosi who said she wanted to show united statesians that her party can get things done and is not simply opposing president donald trump for the sake of opposing him that was understood to be a gesture to buttress the re election chances of democrats who won seats in districts previously held by republicans so democrats went along to get along much as they did in approving the massive 738 billion pentagon budget in other words they once again demonstrated that cringing and cowering is their default position one can imagine the discussion behind closed doors yes that will show donald trump we mean business we ll support his most desired policy initiative unfortunately the mexican and canadian governments have not shown much more resistance mexico president andrés manuel lópez obrador despite being elected on a left wave and promising significant change has so far tended to give in to president trump s demands that tendency was underscored by the almost unanimous approval given the usmca by the mexican senate meanwhile canada prime minister justin trudeau has been a willing participant in bringing nafta 2 to fruition even going so far as to be a voice for retaining the ability of corporations to use unaccountable tribunals to sue governments including his own and despite canada s regulations being the most frequent target what the document says isn t what it means so what is really in the usmca text interpretation is what really matters here as the text like all free trade agreements is written in dry technical language that appears to be neutral at first glance but what the words mean in practice and how they will be interpreted by tribunals is not necessarily the same as what the words might appear to say a key portion of the document is chapter 14 the chapter on investment the chapter s first page article 14 1 defines an investment with the standard broad brush not only is any capital outlay covered but so are all forms of financial speculation including derivatives intellectual property rights and intangible property are explicitly named as well so the expectation of a profit across the spectrum of business activities is well covered here and of course the expectation of a profit in actual practice the demand for the biggest possible profit regardless of cost to others is what the owners of capital expect these agreements to help deliver the secret tribunals used to adjudicate disputes frequently presided over by corporate lawyers who in their day job specialize in representing the corporations who sue in the tribunals consistently interpret the language of free trade agreements to mean corporations are guaranteed maximum profits above all other considerations so is the language of chapter 14 substantially different asking that question is important because article 14 3 states that in the event of any inconsistency between article 14 and any any other chapter article 14 prevails the one exception is financial services covered by chapter 17 to which we will return article 14 4 begins with this passage each party shall accord to investors of another party treatment no less favorable than that it accords in like circumstances to its own investors with respect to the establishment acquisition expansion management conduct operation and sale or other disposition of investments in its territory that dry language may sound neutral but it is the exact language that is standard in free trade agreements this is the language that is invoked by multi national corporations to demand damages anytime any law or regulation that upholds health safety worker or environmental standards prevents them from extracting the biggest possible profit this is the language invoked in the secret tribunals that adjudicate these cases to rule in favor of corporate plunder and against regulations when you hear customary international law be afraid that is followed up by article 14 6 which states each party shall accord to covered investments treatment in accordance with customary international law including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security on the surface that passage seems neutral even innocuous but what is customary international law it is whatever the tribunals that have adjudicated disputes between multi national corporations and governments say it is in practice the many outrageous decisions overturning reasonable health safety worker or environmental standards and making corporate profit paramount establishes precedent and thus constitutes customary law the article goes on to state the concepts of fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by that standard and do not create additional substantive rights again what sounds neutral has to been read in context what need for additional rights would be needed when the profits of multi national corporations are elevated above all other considerations we then come to article 14 8 which states no party shall expropriate or nationalize a covered investment either directly or indirectly through measures equivalent to expropriation or nationalization expropriation the word indirectly is crucial here not a reference to a nationalization which would be a verboten act an indirect expropriation can be any government act that regardless of intention or general applicability has the effect of preventing a multi national corporation from extracting the biggest possible profit an environmental regulation or a regulation imposing standards protecting human health are two examples of indirect expropriation and under the rules established here would mean that the government being sued would be obligated to strike such regulations from its law and pay compensation to the corporation the article explicitly states that compensation shall be paid without delay a party is a government that is a signatory to the agreement and what of requiring corporations to act in a socially responsible manner here s article 14 17 in full the parties reaffirm the importance of each party encouraging enterprises operating within its territory or subject to its jurisdiction to voluntarily incorporate into their internal policies those internationally recognized standards guidelines and principles of corporate social responsibility that have been endorsed or are supported by that party which may include the oecd guidelines for multinational enterprises these standards guidelines and principles may address areas such as labor environment gender equality human rights indigenous and aboriginal peoples rights and corruption emphasis added note the provisional language quite unlike the many articles addressing what governments must do for multi national corporations in the standard language of trade agreements rules benefiting capital and erasing the ability of governments to regulate are implemented in trade agreement texts with words like shall and must while the few rules that purport to protect labor health safety and environmental standards use words like may and can the usmca is no different it s the same sleight of hand regulations on banks and internet giants forget about it chapter 17 covering financial services contains the same standard language requiring treatment no less favorable than that it accords to its own financial institutions with respect to the establishment acquisition expansion management conduct operation and sale or other disposition of financial institutions and investments again what appears to be bland language actually means something stronger in this case a prohibition against restrictions on predatory banks article 17 5 explicitly bans any limitations on the activities of financial institutions and article 17 6 prohibits any restrictions on taking capital out of a country among other rules article 19 11 prohibits any restrictions on cross border transfer of information which effectively means for example that neither canada or mexico can protect personal information from u s internet companies a cohort not known for responsible use of personal information similar language can be found in chapter 15 covering cross border trade in services this section appears to be modeled on the trade in services agreement tisa a notorious free trade agreement negotiated in secret among 50 countries among them all three nafta countries the european union australia new zealand and japan and purporting to liberalize professional services the cover story for why tisa is being negotiated is that it would uphold the right to hire the accountant or engineer of your choice but in reality is intended to enable the financial industry and internet companies to run roughshod over countries around the world the text of tisa expanded the definition of services to encompass manufacturing and could potentially encompass technology companies like google and facebook as providers of communications services the text of usmca s chapter 15 may not necessarily be stretched as far it is in tisa but a reasonable reading is that this chapter will provide another weapon that predatory banks can leverage to take over financial systems and halt attempts at bringing them under meaningful regulatory control citigroup microsoft and google are among the many corporate entities celebrating the usmca another area of concern is chapter 11 covering technical barriers to trade this chapter adopts numerous articles from the world trade organization s agreement on technical barriers to trade and makes wto standards obligatory there is also a clause in article 11 7 that requires equal participation by citizens of other countries when technical regulations or standards are developed might this be an invitation for executives and lobbyists for multi national corporations to demand the ability to shape new regulations what might be ruled an unnecessary technical barrier to trade such barriers are intended to be eliminated as stated in article 11 9 ending secret tribunals appears to be an empty promise in free trade lingo when a corporation sues a government the dispute is to be adjudicated in a mechanism known as an investor state dispute settlement that bland sounding bureaucratic phrase means that a tribunal decides the issue under nafta and many other free trade agreements the tribunal is the international centre for settlement of investment disputes icsid an arm of the world bank one of president trump s empty promises was to put an end to the use of these tribunals surprise it s ain t so ok it s not a surprise that he lied in disputes between the u s and mexico article 14 d 3 states that disputes will be settled in the icsid but the two sides can agree to have it heard in another forum given the one sided rulings icsid hands down suing corporations have little incentive to use another forum more generally chapter 31 sets the rules for settling disputes there we find article 31 3 which states if a dispute regarding a matter arises under this agreement and under another international trade agreement to which the disputing parties are party including the wto agreement the complaining party may select the forum in which to settle the dispute can a corporation suing a government dragoon the government into the icsid or one of the other two similarly one sided secret tribunals the text later in the chapter is ambiguous on that but does not preclude use of those fora later in the chapter the text speaks of panels without specifying a forum and also mandates in article 31 8 that a roster of up to 30 individuals who are willing to serve as panelists be created the panelists are to have expertise or experience in international law international trade other matters covered by this agreement or the resolution of disputes arising under international trade agreements the exact same expertise required under nafta and virtually all other free trade agreements in other words corporate lawyers who specialize in representing corporations in these kinds of disputes are those who have the expertise and experience to sit in judgment the same hat switching will be in force so even if icsid or the other two secret tribunals are not used and instead a new panel specific to the usmca becomes the new forum the same conditions and same cast of characters using the same precedents will be in force there is no reason to expect any effective difference from nafta some better language but that is not necessarily meaningful as to what potential improvements from nafta exist there are three one is that hearings will be conducted in public article 14 d 8 although there does not appear to be a requirement that a public notice be made the second is that a side agreement in force only between mexico and the u s that purports to uphold workers rights by prohibiting denial of free association or the right to collective bargaining to the extent that doing so impacts the other country annex 31 a a panel is supposed to adjudicate this issue should it arise and apply international labor organization standards the u s government can sue to enforce this annex but can anybody imagine the trump or any other republican administration suing to enforce the right of workers for that matter would a democratic administration seek to enforce collective bargaining standards or the right to form a union if a mexican government acting on behalf of its industrialists discourages it from filing democratic supporters of uscma are taking this provision on faith but it remains to be seen if there will be any use of this annex or if it can be meaningfully enforced even if a future administration does seek to apply it the third improvement is that there is language on the environment that is stronger than in past agreements article 24 2 declares that the parties recognize that a healthy environment is an integral element of sustainable development and are encouraged to promote high levels of environmental protection and effective enforcement of environmental laws there are several articles in chapter 24 discussing various specific environmental concerns but seemingly pro environment language has not been absent from existing free trade agreements and that language has proved to be meaningless window dressing further article 24 2 also says the parties further recognize that it is inappropriate to establish or use their environmental laws or other measures in a manner which would constitute a disguised restriction on trade or investment between the parties here we find a potential giant loophole might environmental laws be interpreted to be such a restriction unfortunately there is ample precedent here a series of rulings culminated in the world trade organization ruling that u s dolphin safe labeling is an unfair technical barrier to trade even though the u s had weakened its laws in response to the earlier wto rulings among rulings handed down under nafta rulings that are considered precedents when similar cases are heard canada had to reverse its ban on a gasoline additive known as mmt a chemical long believed to be dangerous to health because the tribunal ruled the ban a violation of the principal of equal treatment even though had a canadian producer of mmt existed it would have had the same standard applied canada was also successfully sued over its ban on the transportation of pcbs that conformed with both a canada united states and a multi lateral environmental treaty the tribunal ruled that when formulating an environmental rule a government is obliged to adopt the alternative that is most consistent with open trade not only are these types of rulings precedents but recall as noted above that article 14 which elevates expectations of profits above any conflicting consideration supersedes all other articles and to repeat a point made earlier wto standards are obligatory technical barriers to trade as the wto defines them won t be exceptions a billionaires club masquerading as a government so what can we really expect if the usmca goes into effect given not only the history of free trade agreements and the mendacity of the trump administration probably the same as experienced under nafta consider the evidence the trump administration has offered its april 2018 national trade estimate report on foreign trade barriers a document laying out its trade goals no less than 137 countries were cited for raising alleged trade barriers to be attacked barriers that include items like laws requiring food imported to be safe in july 2017 the trump administration quietly published its summary of objectives for the nafta renegotiation which features boilerplate language that in some cases appears to be lifted word for word from the trans pacific partnership and not least is the trump gang s infrastructure plan a macabre joke that mostly consists of massive corporate subsidies and intends the creation of public private partnerships which are scams under which services are privatized for guaranteed corporate profit while becoming more expensive and less subject to public accountability we re supposed to trust this government nafta has been a lose lose lose proposition for working people and farmers in canada mexico and the united states that formula won t be changing the council of canadians has issued a strong warning about what can be expected regulatory cooperation in the new nafta takes away our ability to set standards and regulations to protect our health safety and well being egulations cannot be prescribed for ethical or social reasons the emphasis is on the regulator to prove that a regulation is backed by science and not on the corporation to prove that their product does no harm regulators have to vigorously defend proposed regulations and are even required to suggest alternatives that don t involve regulating they have to provide extensive analysis including cost benefits to industry the new nafta encourages the three countries to harmonize or have similar regulations this is not about raising standards but bringing standards down to the lowest common denominator the national family farm coalition representing organizations in more than 40 u s states said the usmca offers little for family farmers coalition president jim goodman a retired wisconsin dairy farmer said climate change is not mentioned and the new treaty does nothing to curb the environmental damage that was part of the original nafta dairy producers do not support dumping excess us milk on the canadian or mexican markets as that will force family dairy farmers out of business in those countries the sierra club league of conservation voters and national resources defense council also recommended against the agreement being approved the deal that the trump administration produced would encourage further outsourcing of pollution and jobs offer handouts to notorious corporate polluters and prolong trump s polluting legacy for years the deal not only fails to mention acknowledge or address the climate crisis but would actually contribute to it the institute for agriculture trade policy similarly gave a thumbs down to the deal locks in a system of agribusiness exploitation of farmers and workers in the three participating nations while worsening the climate crisis nothing in the new nafta addresses urgent issues plaguing our farm economy low prices rising debt and increased bankruptcy measures in new nafta that open canada s dairy market to increased exports from the u s will not significantly reduce the vast oversupply of u s milk or raise prices paid to u s dairy farmers instead the opening will weaken canada s successful supply management program which has achieved market based prosperity for its farmers added regulatory focused sections will delay and impede the development enactment and enforcement of protections for consumers workers and the environment sadly the main union federation in the u s the afl cio has chosen to endorse the usmca despite its fatal flaws the largest canadian federation the canadian labour congress does not seem to have taken a position although it did issue an ambiguous statement in october 2018 saying the deal had some points of progress the congress specifically cited the eliminating of nafta s notorious chapter 11 that elevated investor rights above all other considerations but that optimism proved erroneous as it is now clear that provision remains in less direct language the governments of canada mexico and the united states have once again put a gun to their own heads free trade agreements continue to have little to do with trade and much to do with imposing a corporate dictatorship a lesson once again being imposed

shadow banking and the commercial bank loan loss provisions this article uses 2008 2018 data from china s commercial banks to analyze the impact of shadow banking on banks loan loss provisions the results of this study show that shadow banking is significantly positively correlated with the loan loss provisions for commercial banks in china the research conclusions of this paper have positive significance for preventing the risks brought by shadow banking to chinese commercial banks 1 introduction with the development and deepening of finance in order to meet the demand for financial resources for economic development and improve the efficiency of resource allocation in financial markets shadow banking and institutions have begun to emerge but the bubble like expansion has huge risks especially the shadow banking has eroded the original financial landscape squeezed the market share of traditional finance and affected the commercial banks business behavior and risk control decisions in this context analyzing how shadow banking affects commercial banks is of great significance the outbreak of the subprime mortgage crisis in the united states has aroused attention from all walks of life to shadow banking and people generally attribute the crisis to the excessive development and lack of supervision of shadow banking in october 2012 the global financial stability report issued by the international monetary fund imf reminded that china should pay attention to the shadow banking problem the shadow banking risks in china have also caused widespread concern at home and abroad and their worries have become increasingly heated with the expansion of shadow banking risks have gradually emerged at present chinese scholars research on shadow banking is more focused on the impact of china s shadow banking on the effectiveness of monetary policy and the stability of the financial system these studies have improved our understanding of issues related to china s shadow banking but it is worth pointing out that most of the existing studies have studied the impact of shadow banking on the financial system from a macro level or they have to use theoretical models to analyze the effects of shadow banking and monetary policy it has rarely dealt with important issues such as how traditional commercial banks deal with shadow banking this article focuses on whether banks can deal with the risks brought by shadow banking by making loan loss provisions this article is theoretically innovative in this context this article mainly studies the impact of shadow banking on commercial banks loan loss provisions 2 literature review and hypotheses 2 1 literature review the concept of shadow banking was first proposed by mcculley 2007 executive director of pacific investment management corporation and refers to all types of financial institutions that perform similar banking functions outside the commercial banking system and their various financial activities since then the concept has been widely adopted and there have been many discussions about shadow banking in various circles but still lack a comprehensive and authoritative precise definition the financial stability board fsb 2011 from a broad perspective defines shadow banking as a credit intermediary entity and credit intermediary activity that is outside the traditional banking system and is a credit intermediary system outside the banking supervision system that may cause systemic risks and regulatory arbitrage china currently adopts the concept of fsb the statement on strengthening shadow banking issues issued by the state council in 2013 pointed out that china s shadow banking mainly includes three types 1 credit intermediaries that do not hold financial licenses and are completely unsupervised including new online financial companies and third party financial management institutions etc 2 credit intermediaries that do not hold financial licenses and have insufficient supervision including financing guarantee companies and small loan companies 3 the institution holds financial licenses but has insufficient supervision or evades supervision including money market funds asset securitization and some wealth management services research on the economic consequences of shadow banking has focused more on the risk level zhao wei 2013 found that shadow banking weakened the transmission of monetary policy and brought financial instability xiaoming lu 2014 pointed out that unlike the us shadow banking which has expanded its funding sources and reduced financing costs china s shadow bank has allowed credit funds to repeatedly flow between financial institutions raising corporate financing costs and ultimately leading to a decline in corporate profitability and increased risks wang et al 2015 studied the shadow banking activities of non financial enterprises in china and found that refinancing activities of non financial enterprises are widespread in china and that state owned enterprises are more involved in refinancing activities than private enterprises li and lin 2016 analyzed the capital supervision of shadow banking and believed that the development of shadow banking business can improve the bank s return on capital but at the same time reduce the stability of the bank research by zhan and li 2018 pointed out that the development of shadow banking has strengthened the effect of asset price channels while relatively weakened the effects of credit channels and interest rate channels the essence of shadow banking is regulatory arbitrage although shadow banking has played an active role in promoting resource allocation and improving bank asset liquidity the current empirical papers focus more on its risks to the financial system from a macro perspective shadow banking will weaken the transmission of monetary policy from a micro perspective shadow banks promote commercial banks and non financial enterprises to engage in shadow banking and increase the instability of the financial system as the main asset of a commercial bank the value of loans is affected by multiple impairment risks such as credit risk and interest rate risk in order to confirm these risks timely and form an early warning and capital buffer mechanism banks will make provision for impairment losses on loans based on the possible losses caused by these risks that is loan loss provisions the influencing factors of loan loss provisions are often divided into discretionary factors and non discretionary factors discretion factors include profit smoothing capital management and signal transmission non discretion factors include bank size and tax policies for example curcio and hasan 2015 found that when the bank s equity capital is low the bank will overstate the loan loss provisions to make up for its low capital level and underestimate the loan loss provisions when there is sufficient equity capital reflecting the banks make provision of loans for capital management purposes chen and wu 2014 found that china s commercial banks have a behavior of smoothing profits by making provision for loans but the accounting standards implemented since 2007 have a significant inhibitory effect on this behavior norden and stoian 2014 found that banks using loan loss provisions for profit smoothing can reduce the volatility of their returns but weaken their risk response capabilities dai and zhang s 2016 research shows that loan loss provisions can effectively deal with the risks of commercial banks under the premise that the loan quality of the current period remains unchanged the more loan loss provisions for commercial banks the more individual risks and the lower spillover risks in the future and earnings management behavior weakens the risk response capacity of loan loss provisions ozili and outa 2018 found that the mandatory use of international accounting standards by nigerian banks weakened their incentive to use loan loss provisions for profit smoothing the research on loan loss provisions for the three major motivations of profit smoothing capital management and signal transmission has been comprehensive enough in addition research on taxation accounting systems and auditing has also been involved however loan loss provisions in commercial banks risk management and control role rarely explored this article provides new evidence for the risk response capabilities of loan loss provisions in order to make up for the deficiencies of previous research 2 2 hypotheses the development of shadow banking has enabled families to choose high yield financial products or wealth management products when choosing financial assets for investment while reducing the amount of general bank savings held in order to obtain funds banks must pay higher financing costs in addition shadow banking has caused a huge impact on the lending business of commercial banks shadow banks such as p2p online lending microfinance companies and financial leasing companies compete for borrowers the rapid development of shadow banking has forced commercial banks seeking to maximize profits to increase their risk taking levels in other words shadow banking has triggered the price dividend enjoyed by the traditional financial system forcing commercial banks to change their management strategies radicalize their operations and increase risk taking in order to cover higher financing costs banks need to issue high yield and high risk loans in the fierce banking competition environment banks also have an incentive to relax the credit business access standards enabling some high risk customers to obtain credit expand high risk loans credit scale which affect the credit risk level of commercial banks credit discrimination is a unique phenomenon in china s economic practice some large enterprises and state owned enterprises have lower productivity and profitability but they can still easily obtain funds from commercial banks while some small and medium sized companies cannot obtain bank loans even if they have good investment opportunities they have to pay high interest to get funds such as private loans existing research shows that refinancing activities of non financial companies are widespread in china and state owned enterprises are more involved in refinancing activities than private enterprises non financial companies such as state owned enterprises as financial intermediaries lend funds borrowed cheaply from banks to other companies from the perspective of the asset side of credit type shadow banking their capital flows are mainly small medium and micro enterprises with low credit ratings and lack of collateral to obtain credit support from commercial banks this re lending behavior will increase the degree of information asymmetry between the borrower and the borrower compared with the situation where the information asymmetry is small when the degree of information asymmetry between the borrower and the lender is greater the adverse selection and moral hazard problems induced by the information asymmetry will be more serious thereby aggravating the loan risk in order to cope with fierce competition commercial banks themselves also engage in shadow banking although it is a financial innovation on the surface it is still essentially a bank loan business this kind of homogeneous competition will lead to an increase in the risk of the banking system once a negative impact is encountered the bank risk will have a chain reaction among the banks which will have a serious negative impact on the security of the entire banking system in china s shadow banking system in order to evade supervision funds are repeatedly flowed between financial institutions resulting in high actual loan interest rates for end user companies therefore once operational problems occur in investment projects shadow banking products may generate bad debts commercial banks engaging in shadow banking business will dilute the return on total assets and increase the potential risks of commercial banks some studies have found that the interest rate of shadow banking can reach more than three times the benchmark interest rate of loans and some funds flow to high risk projects such as real estate development resulting in deterioration of the overall asset quality of banks due to the characteristics of shadow banking business with long transaction chains many counterparties and complicated legal relationships commercial banks usually do not directly downgrade risks to non performing assets when credit risk events occur but instead transfer them to the table by issuing loans to undertake risky assets disposal of credit accounts and eventually evolved into an increase in the rate of non performing loans for example in january 2018 the case of spd bank chengdu branch issuing loans illegally was disclosed on the official website of the china banking regulatory commission the credit granted to spd bank chengdu branch to mining enterprises has a large number of shadow banking businesses such as entrusted loans outsourced investments and off balance sheet investments in recent years the steel and coal industry has been in a slump and the quality of shadow banking assets has declined the branch has covered risks by borrowing acquisitions and issuing loans to shell companies after the problem was exposed the above mentioned business of the branch formed a non performing loan of 10 billion yuan which ultimately greatly affected the non performing loan ratio of the branch the loan loss provisions have the function of early warning which can prompt the users of the report with risk information thereby helping commercial banks to cope with the risk loan loss provisions can effectively deal with commercial bank risks facing the risks brought by shadow banking banks will respond by making provision for loans therefore hypothesis 1 h1 shadow banks have significantly increased the provision for loans 3 research method 3 1 sample selection the research sample of this article is the data of chinese commercial banks from 2008 to 2018 among them the relevant data of the commercial bank s data comes from the bankscope database the missing values are collected manually by the bank s annual report the shadow banking data comes from the people s bank of china and the china national bureau of statistics and the gdp data comes from the national bureau of statistics because of the incomplete disclosure of annual reports of early unlisted banks some data were still unavailable the data processing process in this article is as follows 1 delete non bank financial institutions foreign banks and three major policy banks and retain only the data of commercial banks 2 exclude banks lacking data for less than three consecutive years considering that there may be extreme values in the sample data that affect the model estimation results the sample data is processed at the 1 level and the data outside the 1 99 quantile is reduced to 1 or 99 the data processing in this paper uses stata 12 statistical software 3 2 variable selection and measurement according to the definition of the financial stability board fsb shadow banking is a new form of financial innovation that is outside the banking supervision system in china shadow banking in a broad sense includes banking wealth management products entrusted loans trust loans p2p and various private lending since china s public statistics do not have systematic information on the development of shadow banking overall data on the development of shadow banking is difficult to obtain in order to obtain data for the sample period moody s core shadow banking definition is used here to measure the development level of shadow banking in china that is the size of shadow banking trust loans entrusted loans undiscounted bank acceptance bills this article uses the ratio of loan provision to total loan amount llp in this period to measure the loan loss provisions of chinese commercial banks this article adds the following control variables to the model 1 non discretionary factors generally the non performing loan ratio npl and loan size loan are used to measure the expected credit risk of bank loans 2 discretionary factors use core capital adequacy ratio hcap total capital adequacy ratio tcap and profit before taxation ebpt to analyze managers capital management and profit smoothing motivations 3 others because different bank characteristics will have different impacts on the bank s operating decisions and then affect the management s action of loan loss provisions the bank size and net bad debt write off rate nco are also selected loan provisions are also affected by the macroeconomic growth so this article will control the growth rate of gdp the four major banks and 12 national joint stock banks use the national gdp data and other banks use the gdp data of the provinces where the banks are located table 1 presents the variable definitions used in the regression model 3 3 model design based on h1 this paper draws on the research ideas of ng et al 2018 to build a model 1 the dependence variable is loan loss provisions llps scaled by total loans the independent variable is shadow we control for npl loan ebpt hcap tcap nco size gdp according to the theoretical analysis of h1 we predict that the coefficient of shadow should be significantly positive l l p i t α 0 α 1 s h a d o w t α 2 n p l i t α 3 l o a n i t α 3 e b p t i t α 4 h c a p i t α 5 t c a p i t α 6 n c o i t α 7 s i z e i t α 8 g d p i t ε 1 4 empirical results and analysis 4 1 descriptive statistics descriptive statistics of the main variables are shown in table 2 the maximum value of loan loss provisions is 2 92 and the minimum value is 0 11 in june 2012 the former china banking regulatory commission issued the capital management measures for commercial banks trial which stipulated that the core capital adequacy ratio of commercial banks must not be lower than 5 and the total capital adequacy ratio must not be lower than 8 from 2008 to 2018 the minimum capital adequacy ratio of the sample banks was 6 91 and the minimum capital adequacy ratio was 9 69 all meeting the capital requirements in addition the average median of the profit before provision ebtp was 43 146 31 5372 05 and the average median of non performing loans npl was 1 44 1 35 4 2 regression results regression results can be seen from table 3 from the regression results it can be found that the shadow bank coefficient is 0 0102 which is significantly positive at the level of 5 which is consistent with expectations indicating that when the size of the shadow banking increases commercial bank accountants provide more loan loss provisions at the same time it was found that the loan loss provisions llp and the non performing loan ratio npl were significantly negatively correlated at the level of 1 however the relationship between loan provision llp core capital adequacy ratio hcap and capital adequacy ratio tcap is not significant indicating that banks have no motivation for capital management the nco coefficient is significantly positive indicating that the larger the bank s net charge offs the larger the loan loss provisions the coefficient of gdp is not significant indicating that in the data analysis of this article the periodic effect of loan loss provisions has not been reflected therefore the test results of model 1 verify h1 in this paper that is the commercial bank loan provision is significantly positively related to shadow banking 5 conclusions this paper uses the data of china s commercial banks from 2008 to 2018 to robust standard errors in parentheses p 0 01 p 0 05 p 0 1 establish a regression model for empirical research and finds that shadow banking and china s commercial banks loan loss provisions have a significant positive correlation it shows that china s commercial banks respond to the risks brought by shadow banking by making loan loss provisions this article has positive significance for preventing financial risks brought by shadow banking loan loss provisions are both a line of defense for commercial banks in responding to non performing loans and a tool for coping with risks commercial banks need to make reasonable provision for loans to deal with the financial risks caused by shadow banking at the same time the government should further improve its regulatory policies

impact we have in the first half of 2020 and probably all the way through 2020 and then we will see where we are he also noted that 2019 was a year where we really came to grips with the idea that we were not going to go to 1990s or 2000 level interest rates in the united states not only did we quit trying but we turned around and went the other way for 2020 bullard believes there could be

oil and petroleum products carolyn kissane academic director and clinical professor at the center for global affairs at new york university leads the conversation on the geopolitics of oil faskianos thank you welcome to the final session of the winter spring 2023 cfr academic webinar series i m irina faskianos vice president of the national program and outreach here at cfr today s discussion is on the record and the video and transcript will be available on our website cfr org academic if you would like to share these materials with your colleagues or classmates as always cfr takes no institutional positions on matters of policy we are delighted to have carolyn kissane with us to discuss the geopolitics of oil dr kissane is the academic director of both the graduate program in global affairs and the graduate program in global security conflict and cybercrime at nyu s center for global affairs where she is also a clinical professor she also serves as director of the energy climate justice and sustainability lab in the school of professional studies at nyu she was named in 2013 by breaking energy as one of the top ten new york women in energy and top ten energy communicator she s a member of the council on foreign relations and the national committee on u s china relations and serves on several boards so carolyn thanks very much for doing this we really appreciate it i thought we could begin by talking about how has the geopolitics of oil changed especially vis à vis russia s war in ukraine and opec s recent announcement to cut oil production kissane well first of all i d just like to say thank you so very much for having me i m really delighted i am a big fan of cfr s academic webinars so to have the opportunity to participate in this in this way is very meaningful to me so thank you so wow there is so much happening in this space the geopolitics of oil this has been a tremendous fourteen months russia s reinvasion of ukraine very much upended the geopolitics of oil because russia is a significant producer one of the top three in the world and it s you know it s caused a kind of a reshaping a kind of a remapping of the of oil geopolitics and we ve seen some you know shifts in how countries think about oil security in light of larger questions about broader energy security questions and also on top of that is the ongoing energy transition coupled with you know climate change and the need to decarbonize so there s just it s been quite a you know a year and a half that has really sort of put energy security and oil security very much at the forefront of people s minds faskianos fantastic i thought maybe you had some really interesting data to show us and if you could walk us through those the trends you are seeing and really bring it to life that would be fantastic kissane sure so before i do i have a couple of slides and before i share my slides i think it s really important that sort of we understand how interconnected sort of the global energy system is and how interconnected we are when it comes to the flows of oil you know some countries are very well resourced endowed so they have oil and other countries do not so they need to import oil there s really no country in the world that doesn t need oil for larger national security issues and i think one of things that many people sort of are not necessarily aware of or think about is the amount of oil that gets produced every day so every day the world consumes over 100 million barrels a day and every day that 100 million barrels has to be has to be moved it has to be you know as part of getting it into the system getting it to its respective destinations and what we re not seeing which maybe some people may have thought that we would see at this point is we re not seeing a reduction in demand but we re seeing an expansion in demand and much of that global demand is coming out of asia and we re also of course seeing the with the reopening of china lots of really interesting questions as to what oil demand will be in china for the 2023 2024 years whether or not they will they will sort of put extra pressure on global demand and you know irina just also you know it s i m going to share this in my slides but you know last week s decision from opec to reduce production of course had an impact on the price of oil so when the decision was announced on sunday by monday morning we saw an uptick in the price it s stabilized but we are sort of looking at 80 plus a barrel oil and again lots of uncertainty as to what that s going to mean across economies that are in recessions experiencing sort of the beginnings of a recession and sort of what does it mean for the global economy where we may see sort of more energy inflation so one of the things that i really like to do when i teach the geopolitics of oil is sort of show some visuals because i think again sort of really reinforcing the interconnected nature of our global energy system but also sort of seeing where in the world is oil produced and where in the world are the are the importers and also just a couple of sort of fun pieces on what we have seen just this you know in the last week of course some of this you ll be familiar with those in the audience but this decision on the part of opec to reduce production by 1 2 million barrels a day again happening at a time not when we have an excess supply but when we re seeing a tight supply across the oil market so it came as a bit of a surprise to you know to even the most you know longstanding analysts and opec observers and again part of this is directed probably toward self interests on the part of saudi arabia and the oil producers that are really going to make the cuts but of course it also has an impact here for those of you that are sitting in the united states what does it mean then for prices that americans pay at the gas pump so the biden administration sort of came out after this decision was made in sort of being disappointed surprised that opec would make this decision now it s also important to sort of recognize that this is not just a singular opec decision this is part of now a larger opec and opec does also include russia as well as other countries like kazakhstan and mexico so the opec that we have historically known is now different because you have other countries that are not official members but nonetheless are part of what we now refer to as opec and these are the countries that are part of opec and really the country that s considered to be sort of in the driver s seat of opec is that of saudi arabia because saudi arabia is the largest producer within the opec organization producing anywhere from 10 to 11 million barrels a day venezuela has the largest reserves but it is far from being at capacity in terms of what it can what it can produce so just to kind of put that into perspective these are opec countries and their respective reserves and then non opec the united states being a non opec country but again this sort of this chart to the right shows you know again the world is consuming a little over 100 million barrels a day expected to increase over 2023 and into 2024 question marks as to when we may see peak oil demand but again to sort of link this to energy security energy security especially when it s in the context of oil security is making sure that we have adequate supply at affordable prices so when we see a reduction in supply at a time of tight markets that suggests that we re also going to see higher prices that s going to directly hit vulnerable economies and so again just to sort of point out sort of where in the world sort of are the top three oil producers the united states saudi arabia and russia russia remains in the top three canada as well our you know neighbor to the north and china is also a producer of oil the united states figure here also includes gas liquefied so liquid petroleum which the united states is endowed with a lot of both oil and natural gas and then the top oil consuming countries you have u s china and india now the united states is not the largest importer that position is now held by china but as far as consumption goes we consume over 20 million barrels a day again big question mark about china in terms of whether or not we will see higher demand coming out of china over the next year two years with china s reopening and what is being you know discussed as revenge tourism and more chinese who have accumulated a lot of savings 2 1 trillion how are they going to use that savings and whether or not after three years of being under lockdown restrictions whether or not we ll see impacts to demand and i think russia is there s lots of questions about russia and this is now we re fourteen months into you know russia s reinvasion of ukraine and i emphasize reinvasion because oftentimes we forget that you know russia invaded ukraine in 2014 but russia is still moving its oil and up until you know a few months ago its overall production and exports were as high at some points even higher than pre invasion now you have new countries that are takers of russian oil and they re buying it at discounted prices we see turkey singapore china has been a big buyer as well as india that they have been buying discounted russian oil lots of interesting questions that we could discuss about the oil price cap and seaborne embargo to europe but i think the takeaway from this slide is that russia continues to produce oil continues to sell it selling at a discounted price but there are still many countries in the world that are eager to take russian oil and again i m not going to go into this but i just love this slide to just emphasize the you know the world s pipelines these are the pipelines that help sort of the transit of oil something also that s really unique and interesting to look at is just tanker traffic so the tankers that carry oil around the world but again you know there are a lot of pipelines so twenty three two thousand three hundred and eighty one operational oil and gas pipelines again these are it s moving a lot of the oil that is consumed every day and then finally is this is you know one of the things that we oftentimes we think about the hundred million barrels a day that the world is consuming over 75 percent of the world s oil is controlled managed by state owned oil companies so saudi aramco being one pdvsa of venezuela being another but it s really important to sort of recognize the position that state owned companies have the rest is controlled or managed by international oil companies exxonmobil chevron eni total and a host of other host of other companies but again i think the you know to understand that nocs as they re referred to are very very important for understanding their role in the larger context of the geopolitics of oil and again what we saw last week coming out of opec this decision this is also being driven by state budget concerns this is again it s about the production of oil but it s also about you know governments and their budgets and oftentimes you know there is a desire to add more rather than you know more revenues rather than less so those are the slides that i have and i hope that they sort of provide some sort of context and a little bit of you know that we can discuss in the questions that i really look forward to answering from the audience faskianos thank you carolyn that was great so now we re going to go to all of you for your questions and comments gives queuing instructions all right so i m going to go to the first raised hand in the thing amadine hom go to you first and please accept the unmute yourself pause you are still muted pause ok i don t know are you there oh i think ok let s go to morton holbrook q yes good afternoon dr kissane what a shocking presentation laughs a hundred million barrels a day and it s going up notwithstanding the paris climate agreement of 2015 is that agreement simply a dead letter or is it having any effect on oil on fossil fuel production particularly oil production or what s the best scenario in terms of reducing dependence on fossil fuels considering the oil market thank you kissane well hi morton thank you so much for that excellent question yeah that s kind of why i emphasize that number is because a lot of people sort of just aren t aware of how much oil we continue to consume and again what the demand expectations are moving forward and these demand expectations are you know coming out of forecasts from the international energy agency so i think there s a big question as to when we see peak demand and you know if you look at bp scenarios they expect peak demand to happen you know before 2030 where as you know others kind of contest that they that they think that peak demand won t happen until after 2030 i mean again a lot depends on you know what we are now experiencing in the energy transition and how sort of quickly are we can we transition away from oil i think what s really critical when we re looking at oil is oftentimes we think only about the transportation sector so we re thinking about cars we re thinking about planes you know we re thinking about trucks and tankers and all these things but it s petrochemicals you know there s just a lot of oil that also goes into fertilizer so it really is across our economy and across economies across the global system one of the things that i always tell my students is even during covid where you had many countries right much of the world was experiencing some level of lockdown we did have a reduction in oil demand but it wasn t it wasn t like 20 million barrels it was under ten so the fact that now it s 2023 the world has reopened it s really hard to sort of see or to know with certainty is when we re going to see that see that reduction in demand now i think with the paris agreement what s also important is to note is you know if you re if you re in the oil and gas space and i was just at a conference earlier this morning where this was a point of conversation was you know what are the companies doing to reduce the emissions from production so how are they integrating carbon capture sequestration you know how are they managing the emissions that come from the production of fossil energy in this case that we re talking about oil and i think one of the things that i think if you sort of follow oil markets or a country like saudi arabia they are marketing low emission oil now we could you know we could sort of challenge well what does that you know what does that really mean but you are having you know countries that are now sort of competing to state that they have lower emitting carbon in the production in the production of oil and that s a whole other interesting sort of thing to look at in the context of the geopolitics of oil is to kind of understand the variation across emissions across different countries in the production of oil so we are you know again we are going to be going into cop 28 this fall again we are not seeing you know and we haven t seen a you know reduction in fossil energy demand again lots of people are sort of you know hoping that we ll start to see it sooner rather than later but for the time being and again you know to irina s first question that you know the last fourteen months and with you know with russia s invasion of ukraine it has both shown us that you know europe is sort of seeking to hasten the energy transition by building out more renewable energy and creating more opportunities to buy electric vehicles but there s still big swaths of the world that you know are still and have yet to move towards you know really reducing and that are actually going to see higher demand moving forward as their economies grow faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from jovana vujanic who is a graduate student at lewis university how big of an of an impact will the decision of the saudi energy minister to cut oil production have on the relationship between the united states and saudi arabia kissane love the question thank you so much yeah no it s a great one so my take is that of course this decision came as a bit of a surprise and it wasn t something that the united states you know wanted but i would say that the u s saudi relationship has been very tense for the last ten years and as part of that there are lots of different reasons for that but this is yet kind of another thing that saudi has done and again i think it s also saudi has taken a non alignment policy with relation to its position on russia and ukraine so it continues to you know it continues to have a relationship with russia it also has the relationship with ukraine as we saw you know china just brokered a very significant deal between saudi arabia and iran you know again saudi arabia and iran are two are two important producers for china so china is a large importer of oil so if you go back to world war the end of world war ii that s when the united states established the oil for security relationship with saudi arabia and as we have grown sort of more i wouldn t say independent but our as our own oil production has increased especially through the shale revolution our dependence on the middle east and saudi arabia more specifically has shifted so i think we re seeing a very different saudi arabia today which i think is going to be a challenge for the united states i think it s going to be very interesting to see what the summer holds last summer the biden administration did tap into the u s strategic petroleum reserves the largest the largest take in the history of the reserves which started in 1975 you know taking 180 million barrels out you know not because there was massive supply disruptions but because you know as the administration said it was you know it was it was it was a war it was a war specific decision because the you know russia s invasion of ukraine was causing energy prices to skyrocket and to cushion the american consumer and to better cushion the sort of the global economy the united states withdrew from the spr so i think the summer is going to be very interesting but i think we re going to see definitely much more attention in the years to come between the united states and saudi arabia it s not the relationship of the past this is a kind of a very new relationship that s a great question faskianos thank you thank you let s go curran flynn who has a raised hand q hello faskianos we can hear you but we re getting feedback so you might have two devices open q can you hear me now faskianos yes q that s better ok faskianos that s better thank you thank you so much q so i m here at king fahd university in saudi arabia right next to aramco here with my class from international relations and one of my students has a question nasser al nasir ph here he is q so thank you mrs carolyn my question is how could russia s use of alternative transportation methods such as the east siberian pipeline to china impact the u s market the domestic market and the role of the spr given potential insurance workarounds from russia s side such as ensuring russian tankers through their rdif fund and thank you to mrs irina kissane thank you and dr flynn thank you so much for having your students join this webinar so i m a little so the question is about the east siberian pipeline just could you would you mind repeating it i just want to make sure i have it i m clear on the question q so how could russia s use of alternative transportation methods such as the east siberian pipeline to china impact the u s energy markets i mean domestically and the spr given potential insurance workarounds from russia s side such as ensuring russian tankers to the rdif fund kissane yeah and that s a great question you know i think that you know begs a lot of things that we could be looking at right in terms of you know russia s kind of ability or capacity to sort of work around or find workarounds to the sanctions that were imposed and i think we ve seen sort of new markets so this kind of reshaping of the energy map with oil we see that as kind of in technicolor right whereas you know a lot of russian oil would go west is now going east you know china india being takers and of course you know other countries as well you know what will be its impact on the on the u s market i think that s you know again i do think the sanctions were sort of carefully put into place so that there wouldn t be massive disruptions so we again you know russia produces over 10 million barrels a day and about 7 million of those barrels are exported so you know if we lost all of that that would be a you know that would cause some very significant economic disruption globally we already saw you know impacts to sort of grains grain exports and food security in many different parts of the world so you know russia is finding different ways you have shadow tankers that russia is using to move to move its oil as you pointed out the east siberian pipeline you know i think there s only so much the united states can do or and european countries that are part of the sanctions regime can do to curtail russian exports of oil but i think that you know i think russia again has a has a desire and also you know revenue needs they re funding a very expensive war that they re finding ways to get their to get their oil out i think an interesting question is you know what does this mean in the years ahead the lack of investment for example that s going into russian energy infrastructure a lack of sort of any kind of western investment that is that is going in and what that is going to mean but again you know i think to your question i think we will see some you know we are seeing some impacts right there s a big question as to what you know what the next six months to a year will look like with regards to the reduction from opec and if we were to see a deeper curtailment on russian oil and you know would the united states then tap more into the spr we re now at you know we re down to seven hundred thousand barrels which of course is not insignificant but we also sort of have to be you know judicious about how we use the spr but thank you for the question faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from michael let s see trevett a ph d candidate at the university of southern mississippi china and other countries claim there are petroleum reserves under the south china sea what are your estimates of the potential amount there and has china begun to extract any of this oil kissane michael thank you so much that s a great question so china already is an oil producing country so you do have oil production in china in the south china sea i can t i can t say exactly i know that there have been geological tests that have shown the reserves again you do have you know you do have territorial concerns about sort of where is this you know can china can china tap those or seek to explore and tap those reserves again if there are if there is contention over the territory in which these reserves are located so you know china again one of the things that s very interesting about china is that china is an oil producer but china has seen over the last you know the last decade they have seen that they have experienced peak demand so i mean sorry peak supply so they are not producing as much as they used to and so you re seeing a year on year reduction in the producing capacity you know if you go back maybe five or six years ago there was lots of questions about if china could kind of replicate what happened in the united states around the shale oil revolution i think one of the big challenges for china is that of the you know where the shale reserves are located it s not near water lots of questions as to and some of it basically some of the tests have shown that it s it definitely is proving harder that you know they cannot sort of model the same level of development that we have seen in the united states so yeah no i think in the south china sea again i think we it s potentially possible that we might see it i wouldn t i wouldn t i wouldn t say it s soon faskianos thank you i m taking the next question from rob warren at the anglo american university of prague this question also got an upvote how do you foresee venezuela s role in the global oil market changing moving forward and can it be reintegrated into the global economy kissane oh these are all fantastic questions thank you all so much yeah venezuela is again you know venezuela has they have the largest reserves in the world as part of this webinar right you cfr had a kind of a primer on venezuelan and kind of you know you look at sort of where venezuela is and one of the biggest challenges confronting venezuela is both its politics but it s also it basically you know you don t have you don t have international oil service providers in the country i think the only the only one now that the u s the u s has sort of given a sanctions exemption to is that of chevron but i think yeah i mean if you were to see you know kind of shifts in the political regime and you were to see more openness then i think you could imagine you know venezuela having an opportunity or a pathway forward to be more integrated into the global energy system and the global oil system you know i think one of the big problems that venezuela faces is that most of its infrastructure is really old at this point and it would need a significant amount of reinvestment to get it up to a place that it could sort of meet its potential so you know venezuela is one of these countries that s not producing as much as it could right it has the potential to be producing 2 million plus more barrels per day but you know we ve seen that they really have just they went into freefall so i think that s a big issue and another big issue which god it goes back to an earlier question is that of emissions so the oil that comes out of venezuela is a very very heavy oil so it s it has very large carbon emissions associated with the production of that oil so that i think is again as we you know think about the emissions from oil production in countries that are sort of seeking to kind of market themselves as low emission producers you know venezuela definitely will have a very hard time recouping its where its oil sector was again it has the capacity it has the reserves but getting that getting that oil out of the ground right now you have a lot of significant above ground risks faskianos thank you i m going to go next to clemente abrokwaa raised hand so please unmute yourself q can you hear me please faskianos yes we can q thank you thank you so much for your for your talk i was also very shocked about the amount of barrels that we consume every day laughs i didn t know that but anyway i m from penn state university and my question is you just mentioned about the above ground you know effects and so the movement towards like electric vehicles and so on how do you think it is going to affect the african continent kissane thank you q i am i m thinking you know the economies and then infrastructure it will be very difficult for them to laughs move with the rest of the world in terms of electric vehicles and so on i just wanted your take on that kissane thank you clemente it s an excellent question yeah i mean you have countries across the african continent that not only have oil reserves but are already producing right nigeria is a is an oil producing country also has more capacity but again you have some above ground risks you also have the need for investment of new infrastructure i think one of the things that has been very interesting and i think it s getting it s getting more attention as it deserves is how western governments are some of i think a challenge across africa is that a lot of western governments have sort of said listen we re not going to invest in fossil fuels or also financial institutions western financial institutions we re not going to invest in fossil fuels or new projects that are fossil based and that you know that s problematic when you look across the african continent where you still don t have you know 100 percent energy access you know the idea of the transition to electric vehicles which is taking a very very long time even here across the across developed economies so the need for the infusion of more capital to go into you know across the continent of africa for oil and gas that s for their economies and for their own economic growth i think is really really pivotal and i think this is something that you know is being discussed across multilateral financial institutions and also you know is it hypocrisy right for western banks that have you know kind of funded the oil and gas industry or helped to fund the oil and gas industry in the united states and many different parts of the world and that are now sort of not allowing those funds to flow to africa and they have the again they have the they have the resources so you know is it you know the equity of some of these decisions that are being made i think is one that s is one that s really important and again i you know i said earlier in this talk is that you know all most of the demand for oil is not coming from north america and from europe all of the demand that we re seeing and new demand that we re going to see is coming from asia and is going to come from africa so again you know how are we going to make sure that that demand is met again going back to that idea of energy security so there is there is accessibility so there is reliable sources of energy at affordable prices you know without sort of thinking about kind of a whole of energy approach so i think it s very it s a very complex issue and i think you know western banks who have sort of taken very sharp positions on what they will and will not fund when it comes to new oil and gas projects are getting sort of challenged as to you know what does that mean then for you know countries across africa that are still very much in need of more energy not less and again recognizing that you know evs that again are still are you know we re seeing adoption here in the united states and across europe but it s a big big big adoption in china but it s very uneven so how do we ensure greater energy security for the continent of africa i think is a really critical question faskianos thank you i ll take the next question from kyle bales who is a senior at lewis university in romeoville illinois how is the war between russia and ukraine having an effect on the progress of the european green deal maybe you can tell us what the european define the european green deal for us carolyn give us the context for that kissane yes so again this is another fantastic question yeah the european green deal it s this is this is great yeah i mean a lot of people would say that the european green deal now is that the russia s invasion of ukraine has sort of said hey this is why the green deal is so important this is why we really need to more quickly transition to renewable energy because look what look what happened when we were dependent on russia for over 30 percent of our natural gas and look when russia you know illegally invades ukraine and suddenly weaponizes gas we are left very energy insecure it affects it affects consumers it affects industry across the continent so i think we re seeing not just through the green deal but we re also seeing through sort of european green industrial policy so in some ways akin to what you know we put into effect in this past summer is the inflation reduction act and we re seeing almost kind of this industrial competition around clean energy technologies and so europe is investing you know i think it s about 250 billion the united states it s about 370 billion towards the kind of the energy transition and helping to support domestic industries and companies to you know to be able to you know develop the technologies and to have the you know the opportunity to contribute to the energy transition so i think one thing though whenever i talk about europe it s really important is to sort of recognize that you know when you look across europe you have very different policies and kind of approaches to sort of thinking about energy and how quickly some countries want to transition and can transition whereas others you know are probably going to experience a slower transition so just really interesting example as you talked about the green deal is the eu taxonomy the green taxonomy that went into effect in the january of 2022 and there you had like really a lot of contention between france and germany because france wanted to make sure that nuclear was part of the green taxonomy germany was opposed right but germany wanted to make sure natural gas was part of the green taxonomy so ultimately in the end both natural gas and nuclear and again this was this predated russia s invasion of ukraine but in the eu green taxonomy you have you know you have both nuclear and natural gas in addition to other renewable energies that can make up this taxonomy that includes specific measures towards adaptation and mitigation for climate change so you know i think you re seeing this kind of some people call it a race a competition you know ideally it s you know we re kind of working together to because we re all sort of going in the same direction to you know support the transition and to reduce to reduce carbon emissions and to bring in more sort of cleaner energy technologies into our system faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from dr laeed zaghlami q yes good afternoon this is laeed good afternoon irina good afternoon carolyn i m very pleased to be part of your program just to want to be back to africa and particularly to nigeria how practical the two projects that nigeria is advocating for pipelines one from through algeria and the other one to morocco through western african countries how practical are these pipelines to supply gas to europe and parts of some african countries faskianos and dr zaghlami you are at algiers university correct q indeed irina yes i am professor at university of algiers faculty of information and communication faskianos thank you kissane dr laeed can i can i keep you on for just one second can i ask you what is the what is the status right now is it it s planned under construction where is what is the status of those two pipelines my understanding is that it s they re proposed but q yes well actually in practically the pipeline between algeria and abuja which means through niger and so forth is already in progress whereas the other project through thirteen western african countries they are supposed to be implemented by 2047 but is it is there any political game or something of strategic inaudible how practical how logical how efficiently will be for nigeria to have two similar project s kissane yeah no it s again thank you for the question you know pipelines again that s why i wanted to show the laughs kind of the map of pipelines is because you know a lot of pipelines transverse you know multiple countries right and this is this requires not just you know a lot of cooperation but it requires technically it also can be very complex to build to build pipelines and when you re talking about something like as you as you point out these are you know crossing many countries you know i think one of the again one of the issues is whether or not since you know what already is under construction i think you can you know with confidence that one will be completed anything that s not yet under construction and again the timeline 2047 is way out there a lot of a lot of uncertainty as to what the status of those projects will be moving forward for various reasons in terms of making sure that the investments are there someone i know that studies pipelines he says you know until the steel is in the ground you don t have the pipeline and so until you know that you ve got that you know you ve got all the oks and you feel that kind of security of being able to build it and being able to provide the resources to supply it and to move it i think algeria has been a really interesting case that hasn t gotten enough attention in terms of algerian gas that has that has helped support europe over the last years we ve seen an increase in algerian gas going into europe again a lot of attention on u s lng and the increase of liquefied natural gas exports into europe but also algeria has been you know very important for helping to support european energy security and make up for some of the losses of the of the russian gas and i think we ll see more attention on algeria and algeria s role as a you know as an important source of energy especially you know gas going into going into europe moving forward faskianos so i ll take the next written question from vincent brooks who is at harvard and diamondback energy board of directors how do you view the purchasing of discounted russian oil by india in particular relative to the purchasing by china how are they using the oil purchased and are you seeing more internal usage or external profit making sales in places like africa and what are the implications of all of this kissane right great great question so all of the above laughs in some ways right there is definitely sort of profits that are being made you know i was i was talking about this last week with someone and you know if you sort of put your shoe put yourself in the shoes of india right so india is a is a rapidly growing economy 1 4 billion you know if you had if you have very high energy inflation and high oil prices that s going to have ripples effects across the indian economy and so you know when you have a kind of opportunity to buy you know pretty steep discounted oil which you know they had been able to buy from russia you know for purposes of national security they ve been buying the oil and one of the things that s very interesting about india is that actually india has been building out its refining capacity so a lot of that oil is both for domestic and some of it is being sort of re exported but i think what we ve seen is that they re using that oil to also sort of enhance their capacity and capabilities as a rapidly emerging refining power in asia and we see that in some ways in china too so china even though oil demand was down in 2022 much of the oil that they were buying from russia went into its strategic supplies which you know they now have access to and again i think you know a big question is what we re going to see moving forward around oil demand in china wood mackenzie just published a really interesting piece kind of very bullish on the expectations for oil demand in china so whether or not they re going to continue to buy you know russian oil and again sort of taking advantage of these lower prices you know and i think i think one of the things that it s kind of an inconvenient truth whereas a lot of this oil trading used to happen in europe so european trading houses were kind of the main the main points of russian oil trade a lot of that has been moved out so you know russia has found ways to kind of bypass some of the sanctions and have set up in some cases they ve set up trading houses and some of those trading houses have been sort of set up in places that you know that they can sort of again bypass the compliance to the sanctions and you have some you have some russian oil traders that are making a lot of money laughs selling discounted oil and then reselling it a really interesting case a couple of months ago was out of malaysia malaysia announced or in the you know that they were that 1 5 million barrels were produced and sold but only malaysia doesn t produce that much so those were russian barrels that were sort of being sold under sort of the malaysian under the malaysian barrel so again i think china and india have you know have taken advantage some of this has again as i said has been re exported and some of it you know has been re exported through petroleum products because china and india you know both are building and have refining capacity faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from bhakti mirchandani at columbia university what global trajectory do you see for nuclear the russia ukraine crisis has taken some of the refining capacity offline and nuclear has the potential to change the geopolitics of energy and so what steps can be taken to foster nuclear energy kissane bhakti thank you and i was just at columbia earlier today for the center for global energy policy s conference yeah nuclear is very interesting right so when we re thinking about you know decarbonizing our energy systems you know nuclear plays a very important role because it s zero emitting so in certain parts of the world china being one saudi arabia you know you have a lot of new nuclear build you know in other parts of the world you have a lot of contention about nuclear we saw that even in germany which have you know three remaining nuclear power plants and even in the midst of massive energy crisis over the last year there was still sort of pushback about no those nuclear power plants need to be shut down whereas you would think ok in light of energy insecurity let s keep them open so you know france is an interesting country france had planned to reduce its nuclear capacity by 50 percent but this past year they pivoted and they ve said no we re actually going to build out more nuclear and we re sort of we re totally scrapping that idea of reducing nuclear energy and nuclear is very important for france s electricity system sweden has also announced that they are going to build new nuclear and they re going to increase by i think almost 50 percent again part of this is their to meet their targets of net zero we also see japan japan you know the fukushima disaster really turned japanese the japanese public off of nuclear very very deep opposition to restarting the nuclear power plants but this past year even though there s still safety concerns on the part of the public the public is also very concerned about energy insecurity and higher prices so nuclear being a domestic source of energy so i think when you look at you know net zero pathways i have not seen a net zero pathway that does not include nuclear so here in the united states the net zero america project out of princeton very important place for nuclear we just have a really hard time laughs building nuclear at cost so it s very expensive usually it s significant cost overruns and of course there is the i think they have a really significant pr problem people there s still a lot of concern about the safety of nuclear so i think to your point it s very very important for decarbonizing energy systems but you re going to see i think very disjointed approaches some countries are going are embracing nuclear and other countries are sort of doubling down on their opposition and are not going to allow nuclear to be part of the energy system faskianos we have so many questions and we are just not going to get to them all so i m going to take the next question from christian bonfili who s at torcuato di tella university in argentina so do you think carolyn that the landscape resulting from the ukraine invasion by russia vis à vis securitization of gas and energy between europe and russia could accelerate energy transition toward greener energy kissane great question i think in europe it is and i think you know many analysts would agree that the iea for example you know you had the you know how does europe continue you know to enhance and achieve energy security without the dependence on russia gas and a lot of that is through renewable energy you also have a lot of new attention on hydrogen and the role that hydrogen will play i think i think europe is being cautious and so they are not saying that they are going to completely move away from gas so as earlier questions are they getting gas from algeria or are they getting gas from norway are they getting more gas from the united states in the form of liquefied natural gas and then also an uncomfortable truth is they continue to get liquefied natural gas from russia so we ve seen an increase in lng from russia going into europe that said i think all in you are seeing that you know countries across europe are saying ok you know how can we enhance our energy security how do we build more sort of domestic energy sources solar wind we re seeing you know more rapid deployment you ve got a lot of questions about supply chains and things like that but i think overall i think the answer would be that it s quickening the energy transition faskianos so i will take the moderator prerogative to just ask the final question for you to close on and just to give us your top three what are the major challenges for the geopolitics of oil as you look out over the next five to ten year horizon that you would leave us with to be looking for kissane ok you know so i think what we saw right tensions between saudi arabia and the united states we also have a you know a hot war cold war depending on you know the term you want to use between the united states and china and lots of sort of questions as to what that s going to look like i think there s you know i think there s concern that you know we re not reducing demands but we re seeing tightening supply and so that s going to have you know very significant impacts for economies especially economies that are already very fragile economically fragile politically fragile so that concerns me a lot in terms of you know what happens when you know economies don t have adequate access to energy to make sure that their industries that their that consumers you know are able that the lights can stay on and you can get you know if you re dependent on cars you re depending on trucks like all these kinds of things are really really critical so i think we have to be very cautious moving forward that we don t take more out of the system before we have adequately set up the system to be resilient and to be able to sort of meet the energy security demands that are not are not they re not decreasing i think they are increasing and becoming even more complex so i think there s a lot of concerns and a lot of uncertainty and you know this definitely is going to be an area to watch in the years ahead faskianos carolyn kissane kissane excuse me thank you very much for shaping and sharing this discussion for sharing your terrific insights with us and to all of you for your questions and comments i m really sorry that we could not get to them all

indeed plans and actions regarding the creation and usage of blockchain based systems and central bank digital currencies cbdcs have been highly publicized in a number of nations around the globe and the rest of the world is taking note too for example a blog post by the international monetary fund imf written more than a year ago recommended that in addition to creating regulations for crypto assets not issued by governments banks should explore issuing digital currencies as a way to make their money attractive for use as a settlement vehicle in a financial landscape increasingly populated by cryptocurrencies cryptocurrencies by using cryptography virtual currencies known as cryptocurrencies are nearly counterfeit proof digital currencies that are built on blockchain technology

peer to peer in a decentralized manner much as crypto assets are keep reading binance faces legal showdown as judge questions sec lawsuit dismissal request another blog post by the imf said that one way or another innovation will transform the landscape of banking and money many analysts and economists agree that blockchain will play a role in this innovation why blockchain which country is the most advanced in its blockchain exploration and as national and international financial systems take steps toward blockchain how will they ensure the systems they create will enable them to continue to work with each other just as or better than before a clear need for change daniel popa chief executive officer of stablecoin issuer anchor told finance magnates that regardless of whether blockchain is going to be a part of the future of the global banking landscape countries are realizing that much of the current financial systems used for exchanging and storing value is obsolete especially in the context of today s fast moving technology driven modern economy similarly eric benz chief executive officer of cryptocurrency exchange changelly noted in an email to finance magnates that the global financial ecosystem is as antiquated as one could imagine daniel popa chief executive officer of stablecoin issuer anchor according to benz the public pays the price for this antiquated system the most the number of inefficiencies that exist is growing daily and the overhead costs are at an all time high thus creating more fees and charges for the end customer you and me according to both benz and popa blockchain and crypto based systems could certainly be used to address some of these problems blockchain technology can be leveraged to create more efficient transparent and secure ways to exchange value popa said countries and companies are hesitant to go all in on a technology if their partners can use a slightly different version and thus cannot work with each other at the same time the need for a global currency that is borderless and resistant to market impacts caused by inflation or shifting international relations is becoming indisputable but will blockchain ultimately be the vehicle for this global currency and for other major innovations in global finance benz who explained that he has been involved in government blockchain projects in the past said that blockchain technology has not always been an easy sell especially when looking at government bodies within different countries although in the early years of blockchain it was certainly a lot more difficult than it is today of course there s also the issue of interoperability christian casazza associate at nyc based corporate innovation and growth strategy group deercreek told finance magnates that countries and companies are hesitant to go all in on a technology if their partners can use a slightly different version and thus cannot work with each other christian casazza associate at nyc based corporate innovation and growth strategy group deercreek therefore while there have been some promising developments casazza said that there is no clear leading technology to help blockchains communicate with one another internal motivations could lead to the creation of a fragmented blockchain world indeed the lack of a clear leading technology has contributed to the development of a somewhat fragmented fabric of national blockchain and cryptocurrency related initiatives developed either internally by governments themselves or through collaborative efforts with blockchain and crypto firms as such while some countries may be close to issuing their own digital currencies for internal usage there is not a clear global vision regarding how or indeed if countries will be able to use nationally issued digital currencies to transact with another for international trade for example therefore the incentives to create nationally issued digital currencies in addition to concerns about an external digital currency such as bitcoin taking an uncomfortably large market share seem to be primarily internally motivated christian casazza explained that for example the use of central bank digital currency by all stakeholders in the economy could be potentially massive for a central bank s role in a economy as a data miner currently the central bank must rely on traditional economic indicators such as the consumer price index and nonfarm payroll employment he explained these indicators rely on past information compiled by the department of labor and so it forces the federal government to a reactionary role on the other hand if transactions were to begin to be used with central bank digital currency the fed would gain access to a previously unprecedented amount of financial information about the economy they would be able to get data on the flow of capital throughout the country and understand the areas of the economy in the greatest need of help with greater precision than previously possible this would have massive implications on how the fed sets its monetary policy could allow the fed to attempt new methods of monetary policy casazza said for example if the fed wishes to raise the money supply it could theoretically be able to bypass traditional financial institutions and pass money directly to businesses and even potentially citizens progress is still being made despite the arguably fragmented nature of the international blockchain and crypto fabric the technology continues to improve and the rate of adoption is increasing eric benz told finance magnates as a result more departments are wanting to take advantage of blockchain s many use cases benz continued which can completely transform not only finance but other areas like regulation auditing and supply chain finance eric benz ceo of cryptocurrency exchange changelly indeed few countries have charged ahead in their exploration of blockchain christian casazza told finance magnates that in general asia and australia are the furthest along on blockchain technology specifically casazza pointed to china as a global leader in the field in addition to the fact that china is actively preparing to release a digital yuan casazza explained that the government has also fostered an environment of innovation that has allowed for thousands of blockchain startups to be created casazza added japan and australia have modernized their laws to adopt blockchain technology far more than any other major economy the countries efforts will likely lead to faster adoption of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies by its citizens australia is also currently exploring the issuance of a cbdc australia joins the cbdc movement and although rbainfo understand there are risks associated with central bank digital currencies if they prove to be wildly successful it would lead to a fundamental change in the structure of the financial system solidus labs solidus_labs january 16 2020 japan has been a major pioneer in blockchain regulation additionally japan has been a major pioneer in blockchain regulation for example japan was the first country to recognize bitcoin as a legitimate payment option casazza said its progressive laws have allowed for over 19 exchanges to be created major companies such as sony are actively engaging in blockchain investments casazza also pointed to several european nations switzerland has fostered itself as a hub of innovation for technology companies are able to explore new business practices due to switzerland s laws encouraging testing as opposed to hindering it out of fear at the same time estonia has long been ahead of the curve in digitizing their country the country has been using dlt for government purposes for several years also brazil has created its own blockchain platform pier for interbank communications casazza said additionally brazillian banks are using hyperledger digital identities for citizens to transfer money and there are others russia iran venezuela malta and many more that have made an effort to explore the use of blockchain and cryptocurrency in their national systems however while some nations are charging ahead others have notably seemed to have fallen behind specifically the united states in the us advocates are looking for regulation that will allow for these technologies to be used in daily life casazza blames this apparent lag in national blockchain and crypto related innovation in the united states on extremely slow regulation at the federal level the u s s focus on blockchain technology thus far has been compliance and taxes cryptocurrencies cannot reasonably be used for everyday transactions since they are still treated as property and are thus subject to capital gains taxes indeed the regulatory situation in the united states seems to be hampering the adoption of crypto in a serious way michael wasyl who serves as a managing partner at deercreek said to finance magnates in a report last week that the pieces of crypto related legislation that are currently moving through congress do not address the regulation that advocates had been asking for in a significant way michael wasyl managing partner at deercreek advocates are looking for regulation that will allow for these technologies to be used in daily life he explained however the proposed legislation would likely limit exploration instead of providing harmony and a nuanced approach the us must be at the forefront of financial innovation and fear driven legislation will not help us get there it will likely take several years before any type of federal program for national identity on blockchain comes to fruition therefore in the short term it is unlikely that the us government adopts any national policies using blockchain casazza said still the us government hasn t completely avoided experimentation with blockchain currently the us government is only attempting small pilot programs using permissioned chains all the same however casazza believes that it will likely take several years before any type of federal program for national identity on blockchain comes to fruition however there are certainly some extra government initiatives to build a united states cbdc just yesterday the formation of the digital dollar foundation was announced by former commodity futures trading commission cftc chairman j christopher giancarlo former labcftc director daniel gorfine and investor charles giancarlo according to coindesk the not for profit organization has a multi part plan to first create potential designs and proposals convene economists lawyers academics technologists and others to evaluate these designs and create a framework for testing the new system all with the goal of making dollar transactions as seamless as a text message congratulations to giancarlomkts and dgorfine on forming the digital dollar foundation this is the kind of vision and innovative thinking that will define 2020 as the decade of crypto and help modernize the u s financial system cameron winklevoss winklevoss january 16 2020 acceleration in innovation the more countries that adopt blockchain the more countries will adopt blockchain however the rate of innovation in national blockchain and crypto initiatives could continue to accelerate as time marches on eric benz said that as we have seen in previous years there is no cycle different from one another this particular technology cycle for blockchain and crypto is exactly in line with others over the years the technology itself is only ten years old and we have yet to see true enterprise adoption which will happen very soon he continued why does he believe this with all the uncertainty in today s world people are looking for not only innovative but transformative technology to make what they do more efficient and to cut down on costs blockchain and crypto will become an integral part of our daily lives in the coming decade indeed the drive for efficiency safety and lowering costs has caused an unprecedented increase in the pace of innovation our world has advanced so much over the past century and this won t be changing for the next century to come benz said we are a direct result of innovation and transformative technologies and this will merely continue the economy for every nation is an important one and as the years have passed nations all over the world have stepped up and adopted what they could and this will not change

including the 48th year of annual per share dividend increases we continue to invest about 3 of sales in research and development and progress the commercialization of new products and technologies allowing us to deliver above market growth in several of our businesses we will continue to communicate our progress on these initiatives and any new key products for 2020 more technically we begin 2020 continuing to benefit our aggressive and decisive operational management including achievement of our self help commitments from our cost saving program as we delivered about 85 million for the full year higher than previously committed target in addition we delivered record cash from operations in 2019 of about 2 1 billion including further reductions in working capital our strong 2019 performance was possible due to our broad business portfolio supply in both the oem and aftermarket along with individual consumers and individual industrial customers in all major regions also want to thank the dedicated ppg team that remains focused on delivering value added services and technologies for these customers all around the world and let me summarize the financial details we released earlier today for the fourth quarter our net sales were nearly 3 7 billion up about 1 in constant currencies our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were 1 31 which represents a 14 increase versus last year s fourth quarter this is our second consecutive quarter of adjusted earnings per share growth of more than 10 with eps up 14 this quarter and 15 in the prior quarter for the quarter our segment margins improved about 160 basis points versus last year and are up 120 basis points for the full year despite broad contraction and the global manufacturing activity that worsened as the year progressed as one data point actual global industry automotive builds in 2019 were about 10 lower than projected at the beginning of 2019 our segment results benefited from continued selling price realization and strong cost management last we continued our unwavering support of our customers all over the world and continued to advance our sustainability initiatives i m very proud that ppg earned the ecovadis gold rating for corporate social responsibility progress our team will continue to prioritize these programs and we ll provide a full update when we issue our 2020 sustainability report in the spring now let me ask vince to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter and full year results and the guidance we communicated earlier today vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you michael again just in the view of the fourth quarter results our net sales as michael mentioned were about 3 7 billion up about 1 year over year that consisted of sales volumes which were down 3 reflecting the weekend global industrial production environment as michael mentioned this included global automotive oem production and many of our general industrial end use markets which declined in the quarter and they were most pronounced the declines were most pronounced in the us and european regions our aggregate selling prices were up nearly 2 marking the seventh consecutive quarter with selling prices of about 2 we have announced additional selling price increases in several of our businesses heading into 2020 and we will continue to work with our customers to ensure we are receiving fair value for the products and services we supply summarizing some business trends for the fourth quarter in our performance coatings reporting segment aerospace coatings continued to deliver very strong volume growth outpacing industry performance in both the us and asia regions this caps off what has been a truly excellent year for this business which well outperformed the strong industry gains this reflected increased customer demand for our specific technologies automotive refinish organic sales were higher with solid growth in the us offset partially by weaker volumes in europe where customers continued to closely manage inventory levels our sem acquisition has delivered strong financial performance in its first year and we are now commercializing various key sem products in certain international markets providing us with further growth opportunities the soft trading conditions in europe impacted our architectural coatings emea business as we experienced lower sales volumes partially offset by higher selling prices despite this very challenging economic environment in europe during this past year the business was able to grow organic sales for the full year in latin america our ppg comex business increased organic sales aided by improved selling prices sales volumes improved sequentially versus the prior quarter but remained generally soft year over year as consumer demand reflected overall lower mexican economic activity for the year ppg comex delivered another strong financial performance growing both sales and earnings in this reduced economic climate we also added 160 new stores in 2019 bringing our regional total to about 4 800 concessionaire locations organic sales volumes in architectural coatings us and canada increased modestly with positive sales in most channels during the quarter including our us same store sales this is traditionally a slower quarter seasonally led by continued strong growth in the asia region our protective and marine coatings business delivered above industry sales volume growth of a mid single digit percentage during the quarter we expect sales to remain at elevated levels in the first quarter although growth rates will be moderated given the strong prior year comparisons in our industrial coatings segment overall sales volumes were down about 6 in the quarter reflecting a weak industrial demand in china automotive sales fell in december marking 18th consecutive monthly declines and in europe manufacturing activity contracted for the 11th consecutive month we have implemented aggressive cost actions in reflection of this lower demand and despite the lower volumes year over year our segment earnings were higher for the quarter and for the full year as we look at individual business units ppg s automotive oem sales volumes were lower by a mid single digit percentage consistent with the industry rate our automotive oem business continued to realize higher selling prices in the quarter and for the year weak global industrial production activity impacted most of our general industrial coatings business sub segments and our packaging coatings sales volumes decreased as higher beverage can demand was more than offset by continued weakness in food can demand from an overall ppg perspective our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was 1 31 our adjusted effective tax rate was about 24 for the quarter similar to our adjusted tax rate for the year our results were supported by broad increases in selling prices improved manufacturing performance and cost and excellent progress on cost savings programs as we delivered more than 20 million against these cost savings programs during the quarter slightly ahead of our targets the acquisitions we made over the past 12 months also contributed positively to earnings in the quarter we recently had the acquisition of texstars a manufacturing of high performance transparencies and wingtip lenses for aerospace and defense vehicles we also recently announced the acquisition of icr a manufacturer of automotive refinish products now i ll quickly comment on our full year results from continuing operations our full year sales were 15 1 billion our full year 2019 adjusted earnings per share were 6 22 which was up 5 versus 2018 excluding foreign currency translation our adjusted earnings per share were up about 8 firmly within 2019 earnings guidance we provided last january most of the growth in earnings was driven by our strong operating discipline that generated higher segment operating margins each quarter this year specifically our industrial coatings segment achieved 5 earnings growth despite sales being off 175 million for the year additionally each of our major regions improved operating margins as michael mentioned we continue to focus on cash deployment in 2019 and are pleased to announce or completed various acquisitions over the past 12 months these acquisitions have had aggregate annualized revenue of about 500 million of which 100 million is in asia pacific we realized just over 300 million of acquisition sales in 2019 and expect the remainder occur in 2020 in addition to acquisitions we repurchased 325 million of ppg stock during the year of which 150 million was completed in the fourth quarter before i turn it over to michael i m going to review some of our 2020 financial guidance let me briefly cover some of our current economic expectations regionally we anticipate overall positive economic growth to continue in the us and canada at levels generally similar to 2019 this is being aided by commutative interest rates that remain supportive of the construction markets and also stability in the regional market in latin america we anticipate modestly improved economic expansion in mexico versus a lackluster 2019 and in south america we also expect modest economic improvement in china are expected to fall more than 10 in the first quarter and industrial production demand conditions in india are forecasted to be challenging earlier in 2020 however we do anticipate growth improving overall in asia as the year progresses and demand trends in the region in the latter half of the first quarter following chinese new year will be an important measurement of the region s prospects economic growth in europe is expected to remain subdued overall and varied by country we expect the potential for greater volatility in automotive builds throughout the year due to the onset of new emission standards as the year progresses we have included in today s presentation materials available on our website a summary of specific financial assumptions these are included on slide 11 and 12 as we included in our earnings press release issued earlier today we expect full year 2020 sales growth in local currencies of 1 to 3 this includes the acquisitions i discussed earlier we also expect full year 2020 eps growth afford a 9 excluding the impact of foreign currency translation we fully acknowledge the earnings guidance range is wide and this is primarily due to the current high level of uncertainty as the year begins embedded in our guidance are the following key elements we expect continued soft industrial demand in europe and the us in the early portion of the year automotive production globally is expected to remain challenging including weak q1 china production forecast which were revised further down as early as this week additionally we don t have visibility on overall china demand trends this early in the year with forecasting increasingly difficult given the early chinese new year which is about a week away our guidance also includes updated first half 2020 aerospace oem production forecasts which have tilted lower additionally despite the lethargic economic backdrop our raw material costs have remained stubbornly high relative to overall supply and demand and reflecting recent crude oil volatility also included in our guidance are any favorable impacts from the recently approved us china trade agreement the pending us mca trade agreement for the benefit of reduced uncertainty regarding brexit and it s simply too early for us to assess what impact if any these noteworthy regional items will have also given all the self help actions the past 18 months any increase in volume ppg realizes we expect to translate into strong earnings contributions giving our strong operating leverage in addition to general items i just mentioned following are ppg specific assumptions first is the carryover impact from acquisitions that we completed during 2019 and the full year impact our recent the recently announced icr acquisition we expect about 170 million in sales from these acquisitions in year 2020 these acquisitions will typically deliver at or below segment margins as we work to fully integrate their operations in the ppg we are forecasting continued general inflation including higher wages medical and logistics cost we are closely monitoring the cost environment for our raw materials with the recent spikes in crude oil prices we are working with our customers for targeted additional selling prices in 2020 as referenced earlier we are still completing our 2018 and 2019 restructuring programs we anticipate these programs will deliver an incremental 75 million in combined savings in 2020 we expect our annual corporate cost increase including general inflation and we expect the increase due to the general inflation and higher management incentive comp as we accrue at targeted earnings levels next we anticipate the company s 2020 tax rate on ongoing earnings from continuing operations to be 22 to 24 the comparable rate for 2019 was 24 as the year progresses we will work to tighten the tax rate basis current information including geographic earnings forecast we also provided eps guidance specific to the first quarter this guidance was 1 32 to 1 42 and this does include a modest unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation this also includes a modest impact from a large aerospace customers announced production curtailment we continue to manage our capital expenditures based on the current economic climate and have budgeted for spending to be between 2 5 to 3 of sales consistent with our 2019 range as i mentioned some of these and other financial assumptions are contained in the presentation materials for today s call and now i will turn the call back over to michael for some final comments michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer thank you vince as we look at the current year while there continues to be geopolitical concerns and some lingering uncertainty over trade activity we are optimistic that the global economy will grow in 2020 however given the heightened uncertainty we will continue to aggressively manage all elements within our control and we continue to target eps and cash flow growth supported by achieving aggregate segment margins that we maintain prior to the recent inflationary cycle which we believe this is achievable in the back half of 2020 we are expecting to have better visibility on demand trend by the end of the first quarter and we will adjust our guidance as necessary 1 strategically we will continue to pursue organic and inorganic growth opportunities we have a strong track record of creating shareholder value with acquisitions and we intend to remain active but methodical we have an excellent balance sheet and we remain consistent with what we said in 2019 that we don t intend to let excess cash growing our balance sheet but we will remain disciplined in deploying this resource finally while our guidance is reflective uncertainty of when the industrial demand will improve i am confident and our 2019 results solidified that ppg remains well positioned strategically and financially to deliver increased value to our shareholders and worldwide customers supported by our outstanding team differentiated industry expertise broad footprint and product innovation engine in conclusion i want to recognize our employees around the world for their outstanding contributions we have a strong engaged and dedicated global team everyday our employees are focused on delivering results the ppg way by partnering with customers to create mutual value they make it happen and work hard to do better today than yesterday every day this concludes our prepared remarks once again we appreciate your interest in ppg and now chad would you please open the line for questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session the first question will be from christopher parkinson with credit suisse please go ahead christopher parkinson credit suisse analyst thank you just real quick on the price cost can you comment on your just any broad expectations for the resin basket and anything on tio2 just and on the former and on any puts and takes regarding chinese supply including when it operates any changes in your views on environmental and safety and just trends in the new year just anything you could add to your expectation would be greatly appreciated thank you michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer okay christopher i ll try to get all those questions let s start with tio2 i don t expect this to be a topic will talk about this year obviously there is one supplier out there that s cutting rates the rest of the guys are out there supplying at this point in the cycle you need to expect to see lower prices it s been still kind of hanging flat but i think the underlying fundamentals of supply and demand would echo reduction in that over time but i would just say that that should be a non event this year i would say that propylene and ethylene the things that go into resins continue to be well supplied i would tell you that i m cautiously optimistic that there ll be some moderation but it s a little bit too early to tell the crude oil prices are as you know under a lot of fluctuation volatility right now with the world so it s hard to pin that number down right now china is moderating production rates and varied by province and so it s not always easy to predict when they will have a blue sky day but they do periodically do ask for people to moderate their production in order to help facilitate the environment over there christopher parkinson credit suisse analyst great and just a quick follow up on aero just given the customer production disruption and noise in the growth rate can you just break down just commercial any private exposure versus military in particular and then also just anything to add on recent acquisition performance and services thank you michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer so we have a very broad aerospace business we re into the transparencies adhesives and sealants and coatings and now with the acquisition of dexmet lightning protection so we don t have any one customer that dominates our sales but the recent customer announcement is impactful and that you ll see our aerospace growth rate still being very positive and still being embedded the industry but not quite at the high single digits i said it was earlier in the year but i would tell you that we re really pleased with aerospace business they had a record year and i anticipate them have another record year in 2020 christopher parkinson credit suisse analyst thank you operator the next question will come from bob koort with goldman i m sorry it s ghansham panjabi with robert w baird please go ahead ghansham panjabi robert w baird analyst yes thank you hi everyone i guess first off the comment that industrial activity in china began to stabilize in your fourth quarter can you just give us more context on that which specific end market stabilized and do you think the stability reflected any pull forward from the timing of the chinese new year in 2020 michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer so i would say it was pretty broad we saw some benefits in the appliances of course it was less negative in automotive it s potentially a possibility that there was a pull forward for chinese new year given it s much earlier this year and it s really too early to tell that right now we did see november was better than october and december was better than november so that s a good question to come back to us in march after we return from the chinese new year and have a little more visibility into it ghansham panjabi robert w baird analyst okay and then michael your comments on margins for 2020 approaching levels prior to the current the recent inflation cycle i guess in context of the uncertainty still obviously demand in 4q and your early quarter expectations for 1q anyway i guess what gives you confidence in being able to approach those levels as the year unfolds with this current macroeconomic backdrop thanks michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer we were in this past quarter our volumes were down 3 and our margins improved by more than 150 basis points so if you start to put any volume on the bottom line you should expect to see the industrial segment margins significantly improve so you ve already seen us close the gap on the performance coating side and i think you should expect to see us continue to close that gap on the industrial segment side vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer yes this is vince two other elements there one we are doing targeted pricing across the portfolio in the regions and in addition as i mentioned in my opening comments we do have additional cost savings projected for 2000 2020 that we re comfortable we will realize ghansham panjabi robert w baird analyst yes thanks so much michael and vince vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer thanks operator the next question will be from bob koort with goldman sachs please go ahead bob koort goldman sachs analyst thank you i was wondering you guys talked about 6 volume erosion in industrial in the fourth quarter is there any element of that can be destocking or is there any hope that maybe if you go through 2020 you could get a little restocking or is that not really an element of your product lines michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer yes bob we do know similar to ppg people who are working down their inventory levels as we ended the year really reflection of the tepid environment out there we do believe our customers are holding low and stock of their products so if there is if there is a pickup or recovery we do feel there ll be at least a modest inventory rebuild but those will be the two elements that we re aware of bob koort goldman sachs analyst and vince you guys gave some specific quantitative guidance for next year which is which is helpful i guess when i triangulate when you talked about acquisitions and then the carry through the price efforts you made in 19 it suggest no real volume growth i think michael you asserted that you ve got confidence that the economy will grow so can you help me understand that disconnect michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer i think the big disconnect right now bob is two segments that are important for us are automotive so you just saw the downgrade on where they re anticipating china being down more than 10 you have europe that s going through the transmission or the emission change on the engines so that s a big uncertainty but right now it s too early to call heavy duty equipment i think the recent signatures in washington yesterday will help the farmers but i don t think they ll immediately start buying equipment but i do think that will come over time and then you certainly have aerospace there is a significant demand for new planes they re not being met right now so hopefully over time that will get back on track and we do know that the military side of aerospace is going to continue to be pretty strong bob koort goldman sachs analyst got it thanks for the help michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer thanks bob vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks bob operator the next question comes from david begleiter with deutsche bank please go ahead david begleiter deutsche bank analyst thank you michael looking at the m a pipeline does the fact we bought back shares in q4 signal any change in the m a pipeline or your expectations in that area michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer david no change we have a very strong pipeline of acquisitions we re looking at but we also generated a lot of cash we know that we always generate a lot of cash in the fourth quarter we ve committed that we re not going to let that cash sit on the balance sheet so we took some of that cash off the sidelines and bought back stock we can continue to do both right now as you know we still prefer acquisitions but it just seemed like a prudent thing to do given the amount of cash that we knew was coming into the fourth quarter david begleiter deutsche bank analyst very good and just on packaging coatings in slide 5 you highlighted it was below market in all four regions in q4 did you lose share in that business in q4 michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer i would say marginally it s more of a matter of the mix we are much bigger in what i would call food and mat which is monobloc aerosol vent and tubes so think about deodorants and various other odd ball sides cans so we re bigger in that segment than beverage we did have positive growth in beverage but beverage is growing at a much faster rate then the other segments so it was more of a mix but that s the fact david begleiter deutsche bank analyst thank you very much operator the next question will be from matthew skowronski with ubs please go ahead matthew skowronski ubs analyst thanks for taking the question in your 2020 guidance what would be the major businesses expected to be most up and what would be the most down if you could break that down between the performance and industrial that would be appreciated michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer so the most up obviously would be aerospace and pmc those businesses will have another fantastic year in 2020 probably the one that will be a little more challenged will be automotive and then industrial vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer and if i could add we do expect comex to be up as well in 2020 matthew skowronski ubs analyst thank you operator and our next question will come from michael sison with wells fargo michael sison wells fargo analyst hey guys you had good earnings growth in the fourth quarter and it sounds like the sales levels or sales sort of weakness will persist in the first quarter but just curious is there anything going on in the first quarter that your earnings growth is going to be better driven it sounds like the sales levels will be about the same fourth quarter than in the first michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer yeah part of the difference is just comparisons as you know we have strong pricing throughout 2019 on a year over year basis we re still going to get some price in q1 but not the same year over year level as we did in the fourth quarter or prior quarters in 2019 q4 for comex is their largest quarter typically seasonally but we re not going to see that same effect in q1 we talked about aerospace already we had strong volumes in q4 in aerospace we know that s going to be tempered in asia q4 is the automotive market peak in china even though the volumes were down overall production is up sequentially q3 and q4 that drops back down as we will have as much fixed cost coverage in q1 so if you re trying to compare the quarters i would pull forward of those big elements michael sison wells fargo analyst got it and then you should have good leverage to better demand obviously but is there a way to think about if the trade deal is a positive and then going forward what the upside or where we would see maybe stronger results in ppg if things get better this year vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer i ll start with it and mike will finish i think broadly we ll see it in our global industrial segment that s the one that we think has been most impacted by the delays in the agreements there again as i mentioned just a few minutes ago inventory levels we think and end product inventory levels for our customers in those segments are very low so you could see a production pick up in a halo of inventory build michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer yeah and the other thing i d say is that incrementally not just europe where we say 40 of any incremental dollar drops to the bottom line but we re seeing that same kind of incremental benefit in the us and latin america now so that s another positive so i would say we see any pickup 0 30 on the dollar is going to befall into bottom line michael sison wells fargo analyst great thank you operator the next question will be from p j juvekar of citi please go ahead p j juvekar citi analyst yes hi good afternoon michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer hey p j p j juvekar citi analyst i am a little confused about china automotive comment you mentioned that auto production was up in 4q year over year but should be down 10 in 1q so can you just flush that out and talk about things like what are the dealer inventories in china or what are pricing discounts on autos in china thank you vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah p j as we mentioned auto production was up in q4 that was a mistake on our behalf i think we intended to say auto production was down but not as much as it was in prior quarters so it s still down in q4 we expect it to be down again low double digits in q1 we do feel that inventory is generally are in check in china so they ve been matching inventory with lower sales so sales do pick up that should be a straight translation through to production p j juvekar citi analyst okay thank you and just secondly as interest rates moved down last year do you see a pickup in housing activity this year in particular your architectural business and in your experience in terms of past cycles when the rates go down how long before you begin to see some positive impact on your business thank you michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer yeah p j i would say that right now rates are down but they ve been down for a while and we re expecting another 2 to 3 kind of growth year for architectural us i don t expect to see anything significant our trade customers have a significant backlog i still expect to see trade to be better than diy the do it for me trend is going to continue p j juvekar citi analyst great thank you operator and the next question will be from frank mitsch with fermium research please go ahead frank mitsch fermium research analyst thank you and good afternoon michael i appreciate the comments regarding the active pipeline on m a and the fact that you didn t want to let cash build up on the balance sheet which is why you reentered into the buyback markets the prior few years certainly you have been doing more on the buyback front this past year 2019 you did double on the m a front is that is your expectation as we look at 2020 that that ppg will be kind of in that same order of magnitude where m a will be double of what buybacks are or how should we think about the interplay between those two uses of cash michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer well frank i think if you look back the last three or four years we ve consistently done about four or five acquisitions a year i would be disappointed if we don t do four or five this year we ve already announced icr we have a very active acquisition review committee in the company it is a matter of timing we are working generally with the private owners they can be temperamental sometimes to get to the finish line but i m still optimistic that we ll do more acquisitions in 2020 than we ll do share buybacks vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah frank and that s really and if you look at our history we ve done a variety of acquisitions we ve delivered really good returns on those which is why it remains a priority for us we typically were able to capture synergies and easily cover our cost of capital but if those acquisitions don t materialize as michael mentioned we fully intend not to let cash grow in the balance sheet frank mitsch fermium research analyst that s a very fair point the whitford deal was a very good deal in hindsight as well and just turning back to the interplay between price and raws and the fact that you ve got a cost cut program that you re continuing to execute on you were able to deliver better margins through each quarter in 2019 with some acceleration at the end of the year how should we think about the progression on improvement in margins in 2020 michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer yeah the first part of the year we re going to continue to be volume challenge as we denoted earlier that will certainly affect our ability to grow margins in our industrial segment we do expect performance to continue to perform well on a relative basis frank frank mitsch fermium research analyst thank you operator and our next question will come from kevin hocevar with northcoast research please go ahead kevin hocevar northcoast research analyst hey good afternoon everybody wanted to dig into the guidance a little bit so sales growth of 1 to 3 i think that 1 of that is acquisitions so kind of flat flattish 2 volume price and again of which i think most is price so wanted to dig into the whatever pricing is baked into that how much would you say is based on carry forward pricing from 2019 i know you have some other actions out there now so how much is from those and how much is from any future price increases you might do throughout the year michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer yeah kevin i ll remind you that we gathered most of our price gains in 2019 at the beginning of 2019 in the first quarter both in industrial and performance so all price gains in 2020 will be primarily based on actions that we re executing from the beginning of this year so very little carryover pricing in every business and we do have again in the back half of the year some volume growth layered into the guidance kevin hocevar northcoast research analyst okay got you and can you comment too sticking with pricing how the competitive response has been to the pricing action you have out there competitors followed suit or are you flying solo on any of those actions michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer well the answer to that question really varies by sub segment so i would tell you in the performance coatings side there is more there is more support than maybe there is in the industrial segment kevin hocevar northcoast research analyst okay got you thank you very much operator next question will be from arun viswanathan with rbc capital markets please go ahead arun perhaps your line is muted on your end arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst all right sorry about that good afternoon sorry about that yeah so i was just curious couple of years ago there was a chance to or it s or a statement that you ll be focusing on low single digit volume growth and cost reductions at the same time when michael took over now i know volume growth has been disappointed disappointing just given the macro backdrop but maybe you can just catch us up on the cost reduction side what do you see in the future i guess as far as cadence and what can we kind of model through our estimates for cost reductions from here thanks michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer well we achieved 85 million in lower costs in 2019 and i think john mentioned that we were going to do 80 million in 2020 and i would say that we re always looking to be better year over year there is no additional program we re out there thinking about right now but we do want to be in a continuous improvement mode so you should expect us to continue to push our cost lower especially in such a weak demand environment arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst great thanks and then just on that weak demand environment could you characterize kind of the price discussions with your customers i m just curious if there has been any kind of push back just given that raw materials are likely potentially a little bit deflationary in q4 and then maybe even the next couple of quarters how are you fighting those conversations with the customers thanks michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer our customers are very sophisticated generally they look at it over a cycle not over a single point in time and they can tell by looking at our margins that we have not returned yet to our margins that we had in 2016 so they also know we have continued inflation in wages and logistics things like that so that s also something that we factor in so the discussions are constructive arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst and just lastly just talking about the m a pipeline could you discuss maybe some of the verticals that you re looking at you have done eurocoat in the past in some areas ancillary to core coatings is that still an area of interest for you maybe in adhesives is there anything like that or what are your areas of focus for m a thanks michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer well we always say that we re looking at all acquisitions in our space so we are big in adhesives and sealants but we won t do a commodity one in that space we only do specialty ones if you look at aerospace we do want to continue to grow our presence in that segment and then the traditional core coatings segments we re going to continue to look in so we re not going to go out and create some new third leg though so we ll stick to the businesses that we know arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst okay thanks operator the next question will come from don carson with susquehanna financial please go ahead don carson susquehanna financial analyst just a couple of questions on us architectural michael you had another quarter of growth in your dealer network which certainly versus a long trend of declines is this your new strategy helping out with your premium dealer network or is it just because you had some easy comps and then on your company stores what do you think you can get further price increases in 2020 michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer i will take the latter one first so we did announce an increase in our company owned stores and we do anticipate being successful in that in regards to the dealers we are making a significant push for our premier authorized dealer network and it s way too early to talk about success in that name but we do think the program makes a lot of sense where we work jointly together with our dealers to better service our customers so i m glad to see the growth in the dealer network and we ll continue to push forward don carson susquehanna financial analyst thank you operator our next question is from jeff zekauskas with jp morgan please go ahead jeff zekauskas jp morgan analyst thanks very much i think your consolidated prices were up 2 6 in the third quarter and 2 in the fourth quarter so is it fair to say that maybe they ll be up 1 4 or 1 5 in the first quarter is that the progression vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah jeff this is vince a little more precision than we typically guide to again i would say 2019 was on the heels of very modest pricing in 2018 we did have very strong pricing if you recall in the first quarter of 2019 so the comparable is much more difficult but i wouldn t give specific guidance we do expect a positive number but again nothing specific jeff zekauskas jp morgan analyst okay and your tax rate expectation for the year is between 22 and 24 but i think for the first quarter it s between 22 and 23 does that mean that your base case is 22 to 23 or is there something unusual about the first quarter tax rate michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer we are expecting a true up of one of our major geographies in the first quarter which is why we signaled that to be lower that s a ongoing number but it s a true up of a discrete item that will occur during the quarter jeff zekauskas jp morgan analyst okay great thank you so much michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator the next question is from vincent andrews of morgan stanley please go ahead vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst thanks so much vince on the cash flow conversion this year you did a nice job in generating more cash should we expect further improvement in cash flow conversion off of ebitda in 2020 vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah you must be listening to our internal management meetings we target every year half to a full turn on our working capital we ve been improving that for the last several years but we still have more room to go specifically on inventories we do have a very good receivable conversion rate but there is still more room there so our intention is to lower our working capital full year working capital another half turn to full turn in 2020 vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst okay and if i could just ask as quickly on the the refinish inventory levels in the eu are we at the point where you ve kind of lapped that issue and we shouldn t see it as much in 2020 or is there another quarter or so left of that michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer that s always hard to tell because it s two step distribution vincent and we don t always have perfect line of sight into that so i would hope the answer is yes but i have no real positive knowledge of that vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst okay thank you very much appreciate it michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator the next question comes from john mcnulty with bmo capital markets john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst yeah thanks for taking my question so when we look back at 2019 oil prices were down 10 a barrel 14 to 15 and yet to your comments earlier the raws remain sticky i guess is crude the right barometer for us to be looking at going forward in terms of how your raw material is moving if so then when should we start to see any relief because it still looks like other than the pricing that you ve been able to put through you really haven t seen anything on the actual raw material relief side michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer well crude does impact a large chunk of our basket but it doesn t impact things like tio2 probably doesn t always impact things like packaging and so there are some other things like let s call it pigments that doesn t impact it so there are some other facets of our raw material basket that are not impacted by crude but it is the larger driver vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer but just echoing on what michael said earlier we feel are our suppliers our supply demand is well supplied and it s just been stubborn in terms of passing down the food chain here john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst okay fair enough and then vince just a housekeeping question it looks like your interest expense guide for 2020 is up 10 to as much as 25 i guess what s driving that vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah a couple of things one we did have good cash in the back half of this year so we were able to retire some debt in the fourth quarter we will typically be borrowing money in the first quarter as we build inventory for the season so there is nothing significant about that other than interest rates in some of our key regions like latam are coming down where we had interest income in prior years john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst got it okay thanks very much operator the next question is from sean gilmartin with barclays duffy fischer barclays analyst hey this is duffy for sean can you walk through what your market so 2019 architectural what do you think the markets grew in europe north america and mexico vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer okay the us we think it grew between 2 and 3 in europe we think it declined in the 1 kind of range and in mexico the volume was probably down 1 net organic growth positive because of price increases and the same thing in europe we had price increases that offset the negative volume so net net i would say marginally positive from an organic growth side in both markets duffy fischer barclays analyst okay and then can you help size the the issue in aerospace so if the slowdown continues all this year how should we think about the size of that impacting your business and then when does the the maximum pain happen i mean obviously there s probably a lead lag as you go through and it s slowly kind of working its way through when does the brunt of that issue start impacting your p l michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer so duffy maybe i ll tell you what it is not some people have said it s 1 that s not even remotely close so if you want to factor up and down off a 0 5 somewhere in that area code but it is a really complicated question because as you know we supply transparencies sealants and adhesives as well as coatings and some of those things we are a tier 1 suppliers some of them we re a tier 2 supplier and some of the suppliers were running faster than the customer stated line rate and some were matching it so we re trying to figure out what the inventory in the chain is and then it will be more complicated by the fact that the airlines are going to be running their planes a little harder so that will lead to some additional mro opportunities for us but then they have to find the time to do the mro so it s not a straightforward answer and so that s why it s we ve given a larger than normal for our guidance duffy fischer barclays analyst great thank you guys the next question is from kevin mccarthy with vertical research partners kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst good afternoon michael i recognize the ink is still drying on the phase 1 trade deal but i d be curious to hear your initial thoughts as to what effect it might have in losing up some of the supply chains where you had encountered a fair amount of friction over the past year or two any thoughts on end use markets product lines that could benefit michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer so the one that i am optimistic on is mexico i think the government is going to start to turn loose some money they wanted to know what environment they were dealing with now they have a little more certainty so i anticipate the government spending more money that s going to be a positive for us for our ppg comex business and then obviously we re looking forward to the farmers having more money in their pockets as a positive but that i think that s a long term putt kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst okay and then vince for 2020 do you have a strong feeling today as to whether the capital budget could be up flat or down and maybe you can talk about some of the swing factors or chunkier projects that you are considering for this year vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah first of all for 2019 our cap spending matched almost exactly our 2018 number we did start some larger projects in 2019 and given the economy we kept those projects running but we feel back off of some smaller projects we re still expecting kevin for 2020 in 2 5 to 3 of sales as our capex bogey we re going to obviously topple that based on the economic environment kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst okay so it sounds pretty similar then thank you very much operator the next question comes from steve byrne with bank of america merrill lynch steve byrne bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi you have these online apps they are meant to help homeowners and property managers identify contractors and mostly to buy paint from you how much traction are you getting with this initiative how are you raising awareness level on these apps and has it affected the driving volume to your dealerships relationships even in areas where you don t have stores michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer yeah so steve i would say this is still in its infancy digitization of the retail and trade paint network i would say is slow going not for a lack of effort but traditionally i would say these are small business people a little bit slow to change but they all recognize the need to do that and so we re working with them on trying to help them understand how they can improve their own businesses by moving to more digital apps but i would say it s still in the first couple of innings steve byrne bank of america merrill lynch analyst all right and maybe this one is also in the first couple of innings or do you have this this this retail refinish pardon me mixing technology that you acquired in europe can you provide an update on how that s rolling out whether you can bring that across the pond and whether you could drive market share gains with that michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer yeah so steve that was something we developed ourselves it s a trademark moonwalk it s a automated mixing system for the refinish market that allows the painter basically to scan the paint of the car stick the chip basically into a machine and it premixes the paint so that way the painter can be way more productive we ve already sold 100 of these machines in europe the interest level is very high we ve got a tremendous amount of recognition obviously we re starting with our own paint shops first and then we ll be pushing it out into a competitive environment so that we can start to gain share we do have people outside of europe that are also asking about it because of the significant press we received but i would say right now we re focused on europe and then we ll look at how we re going to expand that over time steve byrne bank of america merrill lynch analyst thank you operator the next question will come from jim sheehan with suntrust jim sheehan suntrust analyst thank you on the emission standards in europe that you referenced how would you compare the disruption this year to what happened in the last go around for euro vi is there a single date in which that occurs or is it or is it going to be phased in michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer i d say it s way too early to call there is so much challenge in europe with the emissions that we ll just sit back and wait so no real insight jim sheehan suntrust analyst okay and then on your pricing versus raw materials i think maybe your general industrial business is the business that s furthest behind in terms of inflation is that correct and if so when would you expect that business to fully catch up to raw materials if there is no macro acceleration michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer well we said it would be in the back half of the year we obviously need a little volume to help drive that but i would tell you that we ve made significant progress in all three of those businesses whether it s packaging industrial automotive they ve all made significant improvement so far vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer and that s jim an addition that s really we re focusing a lot of our self help activities as well that s helping us march back to those prior margin levels jim sheehan suntrust analyst thank you very much michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer jim just for your information the forecast for europe is minus 2 on cars so that s the external forecast on how the emission packages were impacted jim sheehan suntrust analyst much obliged operator the next question will come from kevin estok with jefferies please go ahead dan russo jefferies analyst this is dan russo actually on for laurence could you just tell me could you hit the lower end of your guidance if there is no volume reacceleration in the second half of the year michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer yeah we have a guidance range for a reason we do we don t see any pickup in activity basis our internal expectations we will be more discerning on costs so i would certainly expect us to hit our guidance either through our own self help or through economic activity dan russo jefferies analyst okay thank you very much operator thanks dan and the next question will come from mike harrison with seaport global securities mike harrison seaport global securities analyst hi good afternoon wanted to ask you about sg a costs looks like they were up more than 100 basis points year over year as a percentage of sales can you walk us through some of the dynamics on the sg a front is there a reason that we re not seeing better fall through from restructuring actions at the sg a line was there a change in incentive comp or what s going on there vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer two main items mike one as we brought these acquisitions in they re typically coming in at a much higher sg a baseload and we ll work that down over time as part of our synergy capture that we do the second is we did have higher a higher stock price this year which resulted in a higher tsr from a management and incentive perspective those were the two main factors mike harrison seaport global securities analyst all right thanks and then my other question is on the architectural market in china you noted that as an area of strength and said you re growing above market can you talk about what you re doing in china to drive growth while some of your other competitors struggled to gain traction in that market vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer i ll start i ll let michael finish i think we referred to mike in china was our protective and marine market not necessarily architectural we do see even though china is down in terms of industrial activity we do see a tremendous amount of infrastructure under way there we re participating in that we think we re winning more than our fair share of the business marine is also up slightly in china so those were the two items i think we earmarked not necessarily architectural michael if you want to add michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer yeah the only thing i would add is our marine business is winning in the shipyards that are winning business in china and china is winning more business than korea and we re better positioned in china than we are in korea so we re in the places that are growing mike harrison seaport global securities analyst yeah i guess i m looking at slide 5 in the john bruno director investor relations mike mike i m sorry mike this is john yeah i see what you re looking at so just as a reminder everybody we do have architectural business in china it s a small business and it s in part of china as a regional business within china and it s performed well so i just would remind people that it is on the smaller side michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer it s regional it s mostly in the shanghai and southern china piece so that s where the incentive is heading of us mike harrison seaport global securities analyst all right thanks very much michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer thanks mike operator ladies and gentlemen this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks john bruno director investor relations i would like to thank everyone for their time and interest in ppg if you have any further questions please contact me this concludes our

i ve completed more promises than i ve made president trump during a campaign rally in toledo jan 9 2020 when the fact checker unveiled our trump promise tracker in december 2016 we received a phone call from an anxious incoming white house official who demanded where did you get this list we got it from the president with trump nearing the end of his third year as president it s time for an update and a reality check contrary to what he tells his fans trump has broken more key promises than he has kept with our latest update trump has broken about 43 percent of 60 key promises and kept about 35 percent he settled for a compromise on 12 percent during the 2016 campaign trump made more than 280 promises though many were contradictory or just uttered in a single campaign event so that posed a conundrum what would be a good list of promises to track that trump was really serious about we did not think it would be fair to rate a promise that might have been tossed out without much serious discussion by the candidate and his staff advertisement but trump did issue a specific plan what he called the contract with the american voter he even signed it with his distinctive signature and invited supporters to sign their own copies that plan listed 60 promises some of which he said he would fulfill on the day he took the oath of office others he said would be implemented or launched in his first 100 days of course no one really expected him to meet those timelines but this list seemed so specific and official that we decided it represented the ideal platform to measure trump s promises even though it was perhaps a bit light on foreign policy since the fact checker was relaunched in 2011 we had missed the start of president barack obama s term and so it was too late to track his 2008 promises by reference politifact s obameter tracked 533 campaign promises and found that he kept 48 percent broke 24 percent and compromised on 27 percent advertisement here s a quick assessment of some of trump s most significant promises the full list can be seen on the trump promise tracker landing page kept announce the u s withdrawal from the trans pacific partnership trump did this on his third day in office announce the u s intention to renegotiate the north american free trade agreement or withdraw from the deal a few months after taking office trump tweeted that he had spoken to the presidents of mexico and canada about renegotiating nafta i agreed subject to the fact that if we do not reach a fair deal for all we will then terminate nafta he wrote this appears to fulfill his promise to announce this threat eventually the administration negotiated an updated version of the trade pact relabeled the u s mexico canada agreement usmca advertisement provide veterans with the ability to receive public department of veterans affairs treatment or attend the private doctor of their choice in 2018 trump signed the bipartisan va mission act which expanded access for veterans to va funded care in the private sector this built on a law passed under obama rules established under the law took effect in 2019 with va paying veterans to see non va doctors if they have to wait longer than 20 days or drive more than 30 minutes for primary or mental health care at a va facility for specialty care they can see private doctors at va expense if they have to wait longer than 28 days or drive more than an hour to see a va provider direct the treasury secretary to label china a currency manipulator this was a promise broken at first and then suddenly kept on april 12 2017 trump announced he would not label china a currency manipulator something he had pledged to do on his first day in office trump told the wall street journal that he had changed his mind because china was not currently manipulating its currency though that was already apparent during the election season but then on aug 5 2019 he tweeted that china was manipulating its currency after the yuan fell below seven to the dollar following trump s announcement of additional tariffs the treasury department applied the largely symbolic label a few hours later this week trump dropped the designation ahead of a trade deal signing but we will note this as a promise kept require that for every new federal regulation two existing regulations must be eliminated there are various ways one could try to count whether this promise has been achieved not all of which would support the administration but there is little doubt that the president has attacked regulations to achieve this ratio the administration does not tally only economically significant items but includes minor deregulatory actions such as allowing the importation of fresh pomelo fruit from thailand and deregulation of the pine shoot beetle advertisement change visa rules to enhance penalties for overstaying trump in a 2019 presidential memo declared visa overstay rates unacceptably high and called them a widespread problem on the basis of a department of homeland security report he instructed federal agencies to consider action against countries that have business and tourism travelers using the popular b1 and b2 visas who overstay in the united states at a rate higher than 10 percent twenty countries have overstay rates higher than 10 percent according to the dhs report except for syria and nigeria these countries accounted for fewer than 1 000 overstayers each broken make mexico reimburse the united states for the full cost of the border wall in a phone conversation with mexico s president on jan 27 2017 a transcript of which was provided to the washington post and published aug 3 trump indicated that he would not fulfill this promise but would not say so publicly because it would hurt him politically he pressed his mexican counterpart to not raise the issue or suggest that he would not pursue his promise you cannot say that to the press trump said according to the transcript the press is going to go with that and i cannot live with that since that conversation trump has rarely raised the issue and made no move to force compliance by mexico instead he has seized billions of dollars from previously approved military construction projects and redirected the money to fund his border barrier at a campaign rally on tuesday trump asserted that mexico s paying for the wall you know that you will see that but this remains one of his biggest broken promises advertisement expand the economy 4 percent a year in 2017 the gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 2 3 percent well short of trump s promised target in 2018 the gdp grew at an annual rate of 2 9 percent still far short of trump s 4 percent goal for 2019 analysts estimate the gdp grew about 2 2 or 2 3 percent unless something dramatic happens in 2020 the consensus is that annual growth will be 1 9 percent trump will never meet his goal and so this is a promise broken he never even achieved this goal on a quarterly basis fully repeal and replace obamacare trump s promise to repeal and replace the affordable care act backfired spectacularly in his first year in office and the backlash over repeal votes taken by republicans helped democrats retake control of the house in the midterm elections trump had made other promises on health care including letting states manage medicaid funds and allowing for the purchase of health insurance across state lines that also failed to be realized reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three and likewise greatly simplify tax forms the tax bill signed into law by trump left the number of tax brackets at seven and introduced new complexity trump regularly touts the tax cut bill but it also failed to meet several other specific pledges such as insuring the largest tax reductions were for the middle class and allowing americans to deduct child care and elder care from their taxes advertisement make sure the 1 trillion infrastructure plan will be revenue neutral trump has made no progress on advancing an infrastructure bill let alone one that is revenue neutral end common core in trump s first three years no serious action has been taken on this promise he ordered only a review of the federal government s education related regulations to assess whether they unlawfully interfere with state and local decision making as of dec 30 39 states are implementing common core or a revised version of it according to the national conference of state legislatures compromises cancel visas to countries that won t take back criminal immigrants in the united states illegally trump was slow to act on this pledge in september 2017 the trump administration announced visa restrictions against four relatively small countries cambodia eritrea guinea and sierra leone followed by myanmar and laos in 2018 and ghana and pakistan in 2019 he has not targeted china one of the biggest offenders but eight of the 10 countries that have faced such sanctions have been named during the trump administration given that trump suggested during the campaign that he would target all countries this will be considered a compromise advertisement lower the business tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent on april 26 2017 trump unveiled a plan that would cut corporate taxes from 35 percent to 15 percent but the conference report on the tax bill approved by house and senate negotiators made the rate 21 percent that s still a big cut but less than what trump had promised send us facts to check by filling out

a year ago many economic experts predicted that the u s economy would slow in 2019 there is little doubt in my mind that real economic growth will slow down in 2019 michael knetter the president and chief executive officer of the university of wisconsin foundation and a former staff economist for presidents george h w bush a year ago many economic experts predicted that the u s economy would slow in 2019 there is little doubt in my mind that real economic growth will slow down in 2019 michael knetter the president and chief executive officer of the university of wisconsin foundation and a former staff economist for presidents george h w bush and bill clinton said a year ago the economy did slow down in 2019 but not much after u s gross domestic product grew 2 9 in 2018 the best since 2015 it grew 3 1 in the first quarter 2 0 in the second quarter and 2 1 in the third quarter of 2019 gdp growth for the fourth quarter is projected at 2 3 by the federal reserve bank of atlanta that adds up to only a slight dip in u s gdp growth in 2019 what happened consumers whose confidence has been buoyed by an unemployment rate at or near 50 year lows have spent enough to keep the u s economy s record setting growth streak alive even as many businesses became more cautious largely due to uncertainty from tariffs and trade wars instigated by president donald trump trump has been aggressively cutting taxes and regulations to help grow the economy and has criticized the federal reserve for not doing more to help out even though the fed cut interest rates three times in 2019 the trade wars have hurt some industries including the agricultural and manufacturing backbone of wisconsin s economy but trump says they will pay off in the long run with better deals for the united states recently congress finally moved to adopt the united states mexico canada agreement and trump recently signed a first phase trade deal with china the new trade deals could boost the u s economy in 2020 many economists are predicting continued but still slow growth for the u s economy in 2020 how the economy performs could have a major impact on the presidential election this year for more insight on what to expect in 2020 biztimes milwaukee editor andrew weiland recently conducted his annual interview with knetter who will once again provide a macroeconomic outlook at biztimes media s

state of the economy heading into 2020 knetter knetter the economy indeed remains stronger than most observers and prognosticators would have imagined as we entered 2019 having been through a deep correction in equities and declining consumer confidence in its wake i believe that the main reason the economy has continued to forge ahead is the major reversal in monetary policy that has occurred over the year the fed had been steadily tightening up through the end of 2018 and then sharply reversed course with several rate cuts during 2019 and a suspension of the planned unwinding of the quantitative easing policy that was used to help the economy out of the depths of the great recession the combination of lower rates and greater liquidity was constructive for the equity market the dollar consumer and business confidence expectations and ultimately spending it is important to note that president trump has put an unusually high degree of focus on economic performance relative to most previous presidents as evidenced by relaxation of regulatory actions from many agencies that oversee business jawboning of the fed to loosen policy relatively expansive fiscal posture tax cuts and pressure on trading partners it was clear coming into the year that his odds of reelection would hinge heavily on whether the economy could maintain its momentum far enough into 2020 that he could run against a backdrop of continued growth and low unemployment he has seemingly used every lever available to him to achieve that objective including perhaps holding back on resolving the china trade tensions as long as practical to ensure an additional boost as we enter 2020 while it is not possible to parse out attribution for the performance of the economy to the trump administration the fed who may have cut with or without the president s pressure the congress or most importantly all the firms and households whose decisions shape our outcomes we have simply never seen a president as active sometimes chaotically in promoting his desired economic policies and those desired policies put a premium on growth now they may or may not be ideal for the longer term performance of the economy we don t talk much about the federal deficit but we surely will in the next recession and that will be unpleasant or the environment on both accounts trump seems to understand the tendency of many americans toward materialism in the present versus sacrificing today for a potentially better future he is doing his best to throw shade on conservation practices that many americans find inconvenient and i suspect this is part of his electoral calculus so we have a strong and seemingly stable economy entering 2020 it is the longest economic expansion in u s history and it has been marked by uncannily stable growth rates year on year this likely reflects the continued progress in managing supply chains avoiding big swings in inventories that previously added volatility and the continued growth in the service sector as a share of gdp it is much less volatile than manufacturing and construction while we are always only one big shock away from growth getting derailed those shocks are by definition unpredictable and it is hard to see how this expansion dies a policy induced death anytime soon with no inflation pressure it is hard to say we are overheating even at historically low rates of unemployment that may be due to the looming threat of technology change and innovation that can displace labor biztimes confident consumers are powering the u s economy right now as businesses have been more cautious why is that can consumers continue to carry the economy on their backs knetter consumers have indeed shown great confidence in their spending behavior and it looks like the holidays put an exclamation point on that trend consumers are working and earning and the markets are making us all feel a little wealthier than we probably have a right to feel given they can go down too so i do not see the end of the u s consumer as a driver of growth businesses have been more cautious in sinking fixed investments in some sectors due to all the trade policy chaos if that settles down they might drive the next phase of growth biztimes what do you expect for u s gdp in 2020 knetter one way to think of gdp growth is the growth in hours worked plus the growth in productivity i think we will grow at less than 2 on the year maybe 1 7 simply due to the math of lower growth in employment due to declining growth in new entrants and not many unemployed workers to be absorbed into jobs and the low likelihood of a surge in productivity growth the less certain of these two factors is the productivity growth it is possible that we are riding a wave of labor saving technology that can boost output per worker and temper wage growth biztimes the u s unemployment rate is at a 50 year low job growth is slowing as many businesses say they are struggling to find people to hire this labor market is obviously good for workers but isn t it a problem holding back business growth knetter you are right that the tight labor market is holding back business growth but it is hard to label low unemployment a problem it is a fact of life right now and firms with the best growth opportunities will have to pull workers away from firms that are more marginal in order to grow that may be the key to boosting productivity biztimes with that tight labor market wages finally are rising will we see that accelerate in 2020 knetter i do think we will see that accelerate in 2020 but i thought we would see more of that in 2019 and i was mostly wrong about that here s to better luck in 2020 biztimes tariffs on u s goods in response to president trump s multi front trade war have been a burden for the u s economy and especially for manufacturers and farmers now that congress has approved the united states mexico canada agreement and a preliminary phase one trade deal has been reached with china where do you think things stand for the u s economy and trade what impact will these new deals have on the u s economy in 2020 knetter the resolution of these two fronts of the trade war will be constructive for business confidence and the economy in 2020 i say this without having read all the details of these agreements but knowing that any agreement at this point is likely better than continued uncertainty about the rules i prefer a multilateral rules based trade regime in theory so i am somewhat uncomfortable with all of the bilateral efforts that have been undertaken by the current administration but more clarity on our situation is going to help people make decisions assuming they feel fairly confident the new rules will last for a good while biztimes the federal reserve cut interest rates three times in 2019 president trump complained often that the fed was not being aggressive enough to help the u s economy what do you expect the fed to do in 2020 knetter i think 2020 will be a quieter year for the fed simply because right now we seem to be in the goldilocks economy not too hot not too cold until it moves toward inflation and overheating or a growth slowdown i think the fed will sit back and watch biztimes is inflation something we need to worry about right now what about the growing national debt knetter there is no strong sign of inflation at the moment but we need to be vigilant given the tight labor market i m more concerned about the national debt if inflation did materialize nominal interest rates would likely rise and the cost of financing the existing stock of debt would rise along with them and even if rates stay low for now piling on more and more debt seems unwise to me both monetary and fiscal policy seem to me to be favoring the current generation at the expense of future generations while i am not saying that is totally surprising for a nation as materialistic as we seem to be it does worry me i don t think our generation is leaving a great legacy on economic environmental geopolitical or social dimensions but i m going out to dinner tonight biztimes the u s stock market rebounded in 2019 after a terrible year for the market in 2018 why what do you expect from the stock market in 2020 knetter i believe the fed policy reversal was the main reason for the turnaround i think the market will remain strong into the beginning of 2020 not necessarily going up much more from here but staying on the nice perch we ve reached give or take a little and then will be heavily influenced by the fall election one way or the other it is still not clear what the matchup will be for the presidential election and how that might shape market sentiment one thing that does concern me regardless of the matchup is that the election year rhetoric could be very divisive this fall and that might darken sentiment biztimes in the middle of 2019 some were worried that a recession was around the corner those fears seem to have passed for the most part are we out of the woods as far as having to worry about a recession in the near term knetter i felt a year ago that the looming election meant that the president would do everything possible to hold off a recession in 2019 and that those actions would be enough to carry the economy through the year whether that was the reason or not we are still growing as we enter 2020 and at this point i expect we will be growing as we enter 2021 but much more slowly we can certainly avoid recession in 2020 given how we will enter the year but slowing growth can dent confidence of businesses and consumers which can cause a downward spiral i just don t see that in 2020 right now unless there are some unexpected dynamics related to the election

car companies are warning dealers they can no longer absorb the cost of unfavourable exchange rates they have been told prices of popular models could rise by between 500 and 1000 and discounts will be not as generous as they have been in the recent past over the past two years the value of the australian dollar has dropped by more than 18 per cent compared to the thai baht and by more than 15 per cent versus the japanese yen australia s two largest sources of new motor vehicles are japan 31 4 per cent of all sales last year and thailand 25 5 per cent ahead of south korea 14 1 per cent and europe 12 3 per cent although they wear japanese and us badges most utes sold in australia including the toyota hilux and ford ranger the nation s two top selling vehicles outright for the past three years in a row are made in thailand the next most popular categories of vehicles small cars and suvs that include popular models such as the toyota corolla and mazda 3 hatchbacks and mazda cx 5 mitsubishi asx subaru forester honda cr v and toyota rav4 soft roaders are predominantly made in japan or thailand meaning they too are likely to be hit with price rises at some point this year most car companies buy foreign currency up to 12 months in advance to avoid exchange rate fluctuations but they are now reaching the end of their access to hedged funds which locks in exchange rates over a set period it means the cost of cars made in japan or thailand will likely be cheapest from january to march before prices start to climb as 2020 built models begin to arrive dealers from multiple mainstream brands have been told prices will likely rise after the end of the japanese financial year march which is historically the second biggest month of the year for new car sales behind june our dealers are being told by several car companies to expect price rises this year especially as 2020 built cars start to arrive said james voortman the ceo of the australian automotive dealer association which represents more than 3000 showrooms nationally the car companies and dealers have until now largely been absorbing currency pressures with slimmer profit margins hoping the currency would recover rather than changing prices up and down on a monthly basis said mr voortman january and february are historically good months to buy a new car said mr voortman because dealers are trying to clear the previous year s stock but this year could be even greater as prices for certain models may be set to rise from march onwards popular korean brands hyundai and kia are expected to remain largely unaffected given the australian dollar has only dipped by 6 per cent to the south korean won over the past two years the australian dollar has also taken a big dive against the us dollar down by 15 per cent over the past two years however only 3 9 per cent of new cars sold locally last year were sourced from north america the australian dollar has fallen by 8 7 per cent compared to the uk pound over the past two years but britain only represents 2 6 per cent of new cars sold locally european luxury cars are expected to largely avoid currency driven price rises for the time being because the value of the australian dollar to the euro has only dipped by 4 6 per cent over two years and currency changes of this scale are largely absorbed by more generous profit margins the federal chamber of automotive industries fcai says currency is just one of the reasons behind the slowdown in new car sales the 2019 tally was the lowest in eight years following the longest slump since the global financial crisis of a decade ago the fcai has spoken at length about the factors behind sluggish sales in the australian market said fcai chief executive tony weber these include environmental factors such as drought flood and bushfire restricted financial lending practices economic uncertainty and movement of exchange rates all these factors are influencing new vehicle sales in australia commsec chief economist craig james told caradvice in terms of the outlook for the aussie dollar our general expectation is that it will stay at around 68 and 69 cents to the us dollar for some time yet we don t expect it to change too much although of course that may be reassessed once the china and us trade deal goes through why the falling australian dollar could hit new car

jan 16 reuters 1 the oracles speak geopolitics overshadowed monetary policy for the first time in many months in early january but such distractions tend to be short lived nowadays with investors

man now that u s president donald trump has dealt with china on trade for now it is probably a matter of time before his wrath falls on europe on tuesday he gets a platform to express his views speaking at the davos world economic forum while signing the phase 1 deal with china trump already griped at having to pay for our money in a swipe at the euro zone s negative borrowing costs he also blames the too high dollar for the huge u s current account deficit a currency war risk therefore may not be too remote especially in an election year and remember the treasury already lists

be not as generous as they have been in the recent past over the past two years the value of the australian dollar has dropped by more than 18 per cent compared to the thai baht and by more than 15 per cent versus the japanese yen australia s two largest sources of new motor vehicles are japan 31 4 per cent of all sales last year and thailand 25 5 per cent ahead of south korea 14 1 per cent and europe 12 3 per cent although they wear japanese and us badges most utes sold in australia including the toyota hilux and ford ranger the nation s two top selling vehicles outright for the past three years in a row are made in thailand the next most popular categories of vehicles small cars and suvs that include popular models such as the toyota corolla and mazda 3 hatchbacks and mazda cx 5 mitsubishi asx subaru forester honda cr v and toyota rav4 soft roaders are predominantly made in japan or thailand meaning they too are likely to be hit with price rises at some point this year most car companies buy foreign currency up to 12 months in advance to avoid exchange rate fluctuations but they are now reaching the end of their access to hedged funds which locks in exchange rates over a set period it means the cost of cars made in japan or thailand will likely be cheapest from january to march before prices start to climb as 2020 built models begin to arrive dealers from multiple mainstream brands have been told prices will likely rise after the end of the japanese financial year march which is historically the second biggest month of the year for new car sales behind june our dealers are being told by several car companies to expect price rises this year especially as 2020 built cars start to arrive said james voortman the ceo of the australian automotive dealer association which represents more than 3000 showrooms nationally the car companies and dealers have until now largely been absorbing currency pressures with slimmer profit margins hoping the currency would recover rather than changing prices up and down on a monthly basis said mr voortman january and february are historically good months to buy a new car said mr voortman because dealers are trying to clear the previous year s stock but this year could be even greater as prices for certain models may be set to rise from march onwards popular korean brands hyundai and kia are expected to remain largely unaffected given the australian dollar has only dipped by 6 per cent to the south korean won over the past two years the australian dollar has also taken a big dive against the us dollar down by 15 per cent over the past two years however only 3 9 per cent of new cars sold locally last year were sourced from north america the australian dollar has fallen by 8 7 per cent compared to the uk pound over the past two years but britain only represents 2 6 per cent of new cars sold locally european luxury cars are expected to largely avoid currency driven price rises for the time being because the value of the australian dollar to the euro has only dipped by 4 6 per cent over two years and currency changes of this scale are largely absorbed by more generous profit margins the federal chamber of automotive industries fcai says currency is just one of the reasons behind the slowdown in new car sales the 2019 tally was the lowest in eight years following the longest slump since the global financial crisis of a decade ago the fcai has spoken at length about the factors behind sluggish sales in the australian market said fcai chief executive tony weber these include environmental factors such as drought flood and bushfire restricted financial lending practices economic uncertainty and movement of exchange rates all these factors are influencing new vehicle sales in australia commsec chief economist craig james told caradvice in terms of the outlook for the aussie dollar our general expectation is that it will stay at around 68 and 69 cents to the us dollar for some time yet we don t expect it to change too much although of course that may be reassessed once the china and us trade deal goes through why the falling australian dollar could hit new car

the united and china have finally called a truce in their trade war what the trump administration is calling phase one of a hoped for larger agreement reduces tariffs on chinese exports in exchange for china s commitment to addressing intellectual property theft and to purchasing 200 billion in additional american goods and services is that what victory looks like it depends very much on what objective you think the war was being fought for in the first place going all the way back to his primary campaign there have been two ways to understand trump s rhetoric towards china from the perspective with the greatest continuity with prior american policy trump was proposing a more aggressive approach to traditional ends getting tough would force china to change its fundamental approach to trade and its model of economic development china would have to agree to respect american intellectual property open protected sectors like finance to greater competition stop forcing american companies to transfer technology to chinese partners as a condition of doing business in china and scale back or eliminate its extensive subsidies for favored industries such as steel solar

good news newsletter get the best of the week delivered directly to your inbox sign up viewed in the context of those objectives trump s trade deal does make some real progress china has made commitments on intellectual property and technology transfer has removed some regulatory barriers to imports of american agricultural products and may need to allow more competition in finance to meet its aggregate commitments to purchase american services but many of these commitments are ones the chinese have made before and tariffs are being reduced even though the major structural issues that prompted the trade war in the first place have been left largely unaddressed moreover enforcement of the new trade deal will be no easier than past promises in fact since there is no independent authority established to enforce the deal the true enforcement mechanism is ultimately the threat to restore the high tariffs which would take both parties back to the status quo ante the gains then are real but small and it s debatable whether the economic cost particularly to american farmers was worth what has been won more to the point though if these were the objectives critics should be asking why the trump administration pulled out of the trans pacific partnership in the first place and shifted to a strategy of bilateral confrontation that deal would have provided many of the sought after protections for american intellectual property and mechanisms for preventing other countries from using non tariff regulatory barriers and subsidies to keep out american products and services it wouldn t have included china and therefore wouldn t have precluded a get tough approach to trade with china but the objective of the tpp was to create an architecture that china would ultimately want to join for the sake of its own competitiveness and the multilateral structure would arguably have provided greater leverage to push chinese liberalization there was another way to view trump s objectives though one that became more and more plausible as the sheer scope of his trade war expanded from this perspective the objective was less to change china than to decouple from it unwinding the great integration that took place since china joined the world trade organization the opening to china had allowed american companies to rely on chinese components for their supply chain devastating american manufacturing perhaps we had to close that door to reopen shuttered american plants and if there was a cost to american consumers perhaps it was worth paying in order to restrain the rise of china as a peer economic and geopolitical competitor from that perspective the truce looks very much like a retreat albeit a small one one can debate who gains the most in the short term from a truce both america and china have been suffering and both will get some relief and whether it sticks or not is still unknown sticking though would mean that integration will resume on terms somewhat more favorable to american corporations and farmers with little obvious benefit for american workers or the industries devastated by the china shock the best that can be said from this perspective is that no concessions have been made on america s sovereignty but this is precisely what limits the benefit of the deal in terms of business investment investors are unlikely to want to put too much at risk when the trade war could be restarted at any time but the trade war was never a very plausible way on its own to restore america s manufacturing sector nor to move supply chains back on shore while both america and china paid the cost of the tariff war the main beneficiaries were third countries in southeast asia and latin america the former replacing china in global supply chains and the latter replacing america as a supplier of agricultural products to china as chinese investment has increased in all these regions the trade war did not even obviously reduce the scope of chinese influence if trump actually believed that neo mercantilist strategies were the way to make america great again he needed to find ways to direct investment toward america s infrastructure and industrial base and not just pick a fight with one particularly ferocious competitor meanwhile if the trade deficit itself is to be blamed for the declining fortunes in the american heartland neither the trade war nor its resolution had any meaningful effect america s trade with china has come closer to balance as the volume of trade has dropped and it might improve further if china meets its purchasing commitments under the agreement but america s overall trade deficit has expanded even as the bilateral deficit with china has shrunk because it is driven by macroeconomic factors not the nature of agreements between particular countries if america s persistently high trade deficit is a problem we can only address it by increasing the savings rate and quite possibly reconsidering the dollar s role as the global reserve currency which could have other very negative consequences for america as with the renegotiation of nafta the deal with china is likely to have more significance as a political matter than an economic one by attacking nafta and china trump gained enormous credibility with americans who had been hurt by the disruptions of the past 20 years and who had been told by both parties that they simply had to adapt as the price of progress trump went to war for them and now he s bringing home victories that however small may make them forget the casualties they suffered in the war itself want more essential commentary and analysis like this delivered straight to your inbox sign up for the week s today s best articles newsletter here
file photo cranes are seen above piles of steel pipes to be exported at a port in lianyungang reuters china s economy grew 6 0 in the fourth quarter of 2019 from a year earlier official data showed on friday in line with expectations and steadying from the previous quarter s pace the growth rate continued to hover at the weakest in nearly three decades the world s second largest economy grew an annual 6 1 in 2019 the slowest in 29 years but still within the government s target of 6 6 5 analysts had expected it to expand 6 1 in 2019 down from 6 6 in 2018 facing sluggish demand at home and abroad and escalating u s trade pressure chinese policymakers have been rolling out a stream of growth boosting measures over the past two years while trying to contain financial and debt risks market reaction asian stocks rose on friday after china released its gdp data adding to modest early gains the yuan firmed slightly commentary tommy xie china economist at ocbc bank singapore advertisement advertisement although real gdp remained intact at 6 y o y in q4 china s nominal gdp growth reaccelerated to 9 63 on year from 7 57 y o y the small v shape recovery in nominal gdp reinforced our view that the chinese economy may have stabilized in the near term due to trade truce and more supportive policies manufacturing output rose by 7 strongest since march 2019 the removal of uncertainty from trade truce and china s increasing support to high tech manufacturing sectors will continue to support the manufacturing sectors the key disappointment came from infrastructure investment which decelerated further to 3 8 from 4 despite all the supportive measures such as green light for local government special bond as capital for infrastructure projects etc this shows that local governments continued to face funding constraints due to breakdown of implicit guarantee and rising default risks in china masaaki kanno chief economist sony financial holdings tokyo advertisement advertisement china s gdp data was not so surprising and basically in line with our expectations both in terms of quarterly change and annual change we expect china s growth rate will come further down to below 6 next year the chinese economy is unlikely to fall abruptly because of government policies but at the same time the trend of a further slowdown of the chinese economy will remain unchanged story continues daniel gerard senior multi asset strategist at state street global markets this is all good news and positive for the china story all the data coming out from industrial production fixed asset to retail sales they are all showing signs of bottoming out as the trade cycle bottoms out we are not going to see an acceleration of growth at this point in 2020 managing that slowdown is what they policymakers worry about the lower rates provided to banks have not been filtering through to the consumer and that s something china has to get a handle on the tricky part is that the government s hands are a bit tied in lowering rrr much further if they want to protect against the risk to banks leverage ratios advertisement advertisement woei chen ho economist uob singapore the annual numbers are what we were expecting secondary industries seem to be stabilising but there is a bit more concern with tertiary industries it is worrying because that was actually driving the growth for much of 2019 and will be a key growth driver ahead we haven t changed our growth forecasts for a slowdown next year to 5 9 that s very much in line with structural reforms in china and diversification of companies away from china the stabilisation in u s china relations is positive but will not be able to catalyse a strong growth recovery in china as most of the tariffs are still in place advertisement advertisement the central bank is looking at lowering costs for businesses and that might continue this year at a gradual pace rather than being stepped up gradually rajiv biswas asia pacific chief economist ihs markit singapore this is a good data outcome it s pretty much close to market expectations that growth in china was over 6 for calendar 2019 and also the fourth quarter data shows that the economy has been quite resilient the strength of domestic expansion in china along with the rebound in manufacturing that we are seeing in the latest data and also the good news on the phase 1 trade deal which will help to boost chinese exports are all positives for the asia pacific manufacturing supply chain to china advertisement advertisement a key risk for the 2020 outlook on the domestic front would be if there was any weakness in private consumption if we were to see signs of some loss of momentum in retail sales that would be a concern because consumption is such a strong growth engine now for the chinese economy shuang ding head of china economic research at standard chartered hong kong the most important story here is that growth did not fall below 6 growth in 2020 is most likely to be stabilised given the lagged impact of the previous policy and forward looking data including credit total social financing data yesterday and the government s emphasis on supporting the economy including local bond issuance to support infrastructure monetary policy will still be supportive of fiscal stimulus in 2020 we expect two more rrr cuts 50 basis points each this year and they will also likely cut mlf moderately by 20 basis points in the first half of the year advertisement advertisement louis kuijs head of asia economics at oxford economics hong kong i think it stabilisation of growth is sustainable we have seen efforts from policymakers to make sure economy continues to grow the risks to china are still largely on the external side we cannot rule out things happening in washington we also cannot rule out bumps in the road for the global economy we still think china is in for slowdown later on it s in the midst of a structural slowdown we have stabilisation 2020 but after 2020 we do think there will be more structural slowdown background china s economic growth has been slowing amid weak domestic and export demand with pressure compounded by an escalating trade war with the united states a government crackdown on debt and riskier types of financing in recent years has also led to a softening in investment advertisement advertisement authorities have rolled out a stream of stimulus measures including tax cuts higher infrastructure spending and liquidity injections by the central bank but domestic demand has been slow to respond washington and beijing signed a phase 1 trade deal on jan 15 declaring a ceasefire in the trade row but the united states will maintain most of the tariffs on chinese imports which it imposed during the dispute economic growth is expected to slow further to 5 9 in 2020 a reuters poll showed reinforcing views that beijing will need to roll out more policy support measures the central bank is

president trump and chinese officials took a crucial step toward resolving the nearly two year trade war between the world s largest economies by signing a long sought preliminary trade deal on wednesday the so called phase one trade deal covers almost every corner of the u s and china s complicated trading relationship from agricultural imports and dairy quality standards to financial market access and intellectual property trump and his gop allies have billed the agreement as a massive victory for the president and vindication for the damaging tariffs he imposed on chinese goods trump s critics and trade experts counter that the deal sets potentially unattainable targets and could easily be skirted by china china has a track record of shirking international trade commitments and trump has not hesitated to retaliate against beijing when he feels slighted if both sides can uphold the phase one agreement here s what you can expect to see china commits to buy more u s crops products trump has long been obsessed with the vast gulf between the value of goods the u s imports from china and the value of u s products imported by beijing that difference known as the trade deficit represents the u s reliance on cheap consumer goods from china while economists say trade deficits are not necessarily bad trump equates the u s deficit with china to beijing ripping off americans to narrow that gap china agreed to increase purchases of u s goods and services by 200 billion over the next two years including 77 7 billion for manufactured goods and 32 billion for agricultural products the farmers are really happy with the new china trade deal and the soon to be signed deal with mexico and canada trump tweeted thursday but i hope the thing they will most remember is the fact that i was able to take massive incoming tariff money and use it to help them get through the tough times china to crack down on patent theft forced technology transfers china s alleged record of stealing intellectual property ip and pinching crucial technology from u s companies was one of the few major structural issues addressed in phase one beijing has agreed to expand its laws and increase penalties for ip theft and to participate in a conflict resolution process to settle allegations levied by u s firms china also agreed to bar domestic companies from forcing u s firms to transfer valuable or sensitive technology to chinese business partners in order to operate within the country both areas were prime concerns for u s businesses and trade groups representing corporations and technology companies u s china declare truce on exchange rate interest rate battles trump has long accused china of suppressing the value of its currency and flooding its economy with stimulus to make u s products relatively more expensive in foreign markets the president has tried to bully the federal reserve into slashing interest rates further to weaken the dollar but the independent central bank has refused to yield trump followed through on his campaign promise to label china a currency manipulator in august after china had allowed its yuan to drop below a seven to one exchange rate with the dollar tensions eased after china boosted the value of the yuan and trump revoked the label shortly before signing the new deal with china the phase one agreement bars both the u s and china from targeting foreign exchange rates or manipulating interest rates to devalue their own currencies and orders each country to follow international monetary fund rules on macroeconomic policy china opens financial markets to u s firms the preliminary trade deal sets in writing several commitments china has made to ease foreign access to financial markets and domestic commerce under the agreement china has committed to allow investment firms asset management companies and insurance companies owned wholly by foreign countries to operate in the country by april 1 beijing also agreed to remove discriminatory regulations and reviews for u s firms that limit bond rating and investment services offerings in the country

we need to spend more money on innovation and we are making more efforts to explore other markets like russia and latin america he tells afr weekend i don t think the phase one deal means the end of the trade war but he says this war has taught chinese manufacturers they need to improve the quality of their products to give them the chips to negotiate with the us huang s response to the crisis is typical of how entrepreneurs are adapting their plans all over the us china and beyond even as world financial markets cheer trump s formal signing of the deal in the white house this week even though the threat of further tariff escalation has eased for now smart business owners and shareholders won t allow themselves to forget in a hurry the trade deal as it currently stands still leaves the bulk of tariffs that were imposed during the trade war firmly in place including on some us370 billion 537 billion of chinese imports advertisement in addition australian farmers coal and energy exporters are being forced to confront the threat of market displacements because of trump s mercantilist insistence china buy at least 200 billion in us goods over the next two years and while many analysts as well as the australian government downplay those dangers arguably the bigger story of this week s trade deal is that it marks a major milestone in what could turn into an epoch defining dismantling of a global trading system that has for decades underpinned growth and prosperity firstly the phase one deal sets a powerful example to other populist leaders on how trade disputes can be settled trade wars as trump famously put it are easy to win why go to the bureaucratic slow and innovation challenged world trade organisation to settle a fight when as trump has just demonstrated a tariff squeeze can bring a seemingly intractable rival to the table furthermore as former australian ambassador to washington and one time secretary of the prime minister s department michael thawley points out the managed trade elements of the us china accord will only accelerate an intensifying global shift towards more interventionist economic policies among advanced nations trump is merely setting out a pathway likely to be followed with gusto by others advertisement my country first intervention when you look around the world there s much more interest in protecting national champions says thawley we see the european union wanting to build up more capacity in it in the uk boris johnson is talking about the development of industry and quite a lot of government intervention the global economic environment is getting much more tightly managed not only on cross border flows but international agreements on restricting anti competitive behaviour he says none of that is good news for australia a middle sized economy heavily reliant on global trade for its capital and income we ought to be worried about the trend toward managed trade and about the trend toward national my country first intervention says thawley while anyone you talk to in beijing and washington and beyond is relieved at the easing of tensions there has been strong criticism of the deal s mandated chinese purchases of american agriculture energy and manufactured goods some us76 7 billion in the first year rising to 123 3 billion the year after advertisement geoff raby former australian ambassador to china says it undermines the rules based trading system and thinks australia should be more forceful in its response it is trashing not only the rules of the wto but the principles that underline an open multilateral trading system he says it is the worst sort of opportunistic trade policy you can possibly imagine and that is going to harm us more than anything else washington based economist matthew goodman who served in the bush white house when the us negotiated its free trade agreement with john howard in the mid 2000s agrees it s managed trade plain and simple he tells afr weekend advertisement aussies have every right to be unhappy about that on several levels says goodman now at the centre for strategic and international studies you ll lose business if this is carried through it violates the principles of free trade and the wto in which you have a great interest i also think it doesn t solve the problems we share in common with respect to china so that s another reason to be unhappy he adds in reference to beijing s aggressive industry policies brave face little fight for now scott morrison s government has displayed no appetite for that kind of fight either publicly or via more private diplomatic channels australian trade minister simon birmingham who has repeatedly urged china and the us to put down their cudgels has sought to put on a brave face advertisement he argues the hiatus in tit for tat tariff hikes will boost the global economy overall by calming markets and offering firms and investors certainty birmingham insists beijing s agreement to buy an additional us200 billion of goods will lock in a large share of china s future growth for us producers rather than come at the expense of australian suppliers and australia will still have an edge because of zero tariffs on a number of agricultural commodities including beef and wine obviously the us will benefit from the removal of the retaliatory tariffs that china had applied but their move to simply most favoured nation status in a number of areas still leaves us with a clear advantage birmingham tells afr weekend one reason for the lack of criticism may be because of another development this week growing signs the us recognises it will need to work with allies like australia japan and europe to tackle the far more ambitious negotiations for a second phase deal as the us moves to the second phase issues some of these are far better dealt with at the multilateral or wto level like state owned subsidies says thawley advertisement goodman is quick to point out that the trade war hasn t been without its benefits we do have some real problems with china he says the trump administration gets credit for drawing attention and even heat towards those problems but there was a much smarter and principled way to go about this that would have been in a cost benefit sense better for americans and australians that s my beef not that it was wrong to take on this fight or that it hasn t achieved some useful progress on agriculture rules and investment but that they come at a pretty high price all about the us election geoff raby is scathing about the prospects of a second phase deal happening any time soon advertisement trump couldn t give a shit about all the systemic stuff he says what he has got is a package of things that is exclusively targeted to his core constituents in agriculture and the rust belt the reality is he will go to the election saying he has taken on china and won this is all about the us election given as the cynics maintain this deal was all about short term political expediency there will be careful scrutiny about whether it will last the built in dispute resolution system another way of circumventing the wto system could be tested fairly soon particularly if china delays or obfuscates on its mandated purchases the targets announced this week may also be unrealistic in the short term given they represent dramatically sharp increases in shipments of several major commodities from lng to soybeans and beef either way that makes it less likely these changes won t happen without disruption for china s other trade partners something it may be reluctant to do given its desire to diversify sources of trade at all costs advertisement china continues to insist that it s not for others to change its economic and political model while president xi jinping has been willing to make limited concessions in the area of forced technology transfer and intellectual property protection chinese officials this week indicated beijing will never agree to washington s demands to change the way it manages the communist ruled country this includes us proposals to level the playing field for us companies be removing subsidies for china s powerful state owned enterprises and tackling cyber theft which china denies takes place barry naughton an expert on the chinese economy at the university of california believes the phase one deal was an opportunity to defuse tensions the first phase agreement means we have a window of a year or 18 months he told the ubs greater china conference in shanghai this week advertisement things should calm down for a while we can take a step back the phase one deal gives both trump and xi some political breathing space at a time when they need it most trump is preparing for an election and china s economy grew at its lowest annual rate in three decades last year according to official data released friday the deal has little bearing on china s long term ambitions to become a technology superpower in fields such as ai and 5g telecommunications which is at the core of washington s concerns about its increasingly powerful rival in 10 15 20 years from now most of our cars will be chinese most of our electrical goods phones everything will be chinese says ubs asia pacific president edmund koh chinese brands are evolving he says adding the trade war has only encouraged chinese companies to become more innovative and competitive koh reflects on a trip to the 1988 olympics in seoul when he returned home to present his mother with a south korean toaster she said are you trying to electrocute me now everyone has a samsung television in terms of market share will be as strong as the south koreans advertisement technology has enabled countries like china to grow in leaps and bounds over the traditional low cost manufacturing some companies are still struggling with the tariffs for annabelle wang who is in charge of american sales for self electronics co which makes led lighting products from a four story factory in the chinese port city of ningbo there is no relief from the phase one deal a 25 per cent tariff still applies on her goods even if the us change their president i don t think this tariff will be removed we will need to develop better products to keep our market share in the us we will put more effort into developing other foreign markets she said
since the u s killed iranian general qassem soleimani and iraqi militia leader abu mahdi al muhandis earlier this month the official narrative has held that their deaths were necessary to prevent a vague yet allegedly imminent threat of violence towards americans though president trump has since claimed whether or not soleimani or his iraqi allies posed an imminent threat doesn t really matter while the situation between iran iraq and the u s appears to have de escalated substantially at least for now it is worth revisiting the lead up to the recent u s iraq iran tensions up to the trump mandated killing of soleimani and abu mahdi al muhandis in order to understand one of the most overlooked yet relevant drivers behind trump s current policy with respect to iraq preventing china from expanding its foothold in the middle east indeed it has been alleged that even the timing of soleimani s assassination was directly related to his diplomatic role in iraq and his push to help iraq secure its oil independence beginning with the implementation of a new massive oil deal with china while recent rhetoric in the media has dwelled on the extent of iran s influence in iraq china s recent dealings with iraq particularly in its oil sector are to blame for much of what has transpired in iraq in recent months at least according to iraq s prime minister adel abdul mahdi who is currently serving in a caretaker role much of the u s pressure exerted on iraq s government with respect to china has reportedly taken place covertly and behind closed doors keeping the trump administration s concerns over china s growing ties to iraq largely out of public view perhaps over concerns that a public scuffle could exacerbate the u s china trade war and endanger efforts to resolve it yet whatever the reasons may be evidence strongly suggests that the u s is equally concerned about china s presence in iraq as it is with iran s this is because china has the means and the ability to dramatically undermine not only the u s control over iraq s oil sector but the entire petrodollar system on which the u s status as both a financial and military superpower directly depends behind the curtain a different narrative for iraq us tensions iraq s caretaker prime minister adel abdul mahdi gave a series of remarks on january 5 during a parliamentary session that received surprisingly little media attention during the session which also saw iraq s parliament approve the removal of all foreign including american troops from the country abdul mahdi made a series of claims about the lead up to the recent situation that placed iraq at the heart of spiking u s iran tensions during that session only part of abdul mahdi s statements were broadcast on television after the iraqi speaker of the house mohammed al halbousi who has a close relationship with washington requested the video feed be cut al halbousi oddly attended the parliamentary session even though it was boycotted by his allied sunni and kurdish representatives after the feed was cut mps who were present wrote down abdul mahdi s remarks which were then given to the arabic news outlet ida at per that transcript abdul mahdi stated that the americans are the ones who destroyed the country and wreaked havoc on it they have refused to finish building the electrical system and infrastructure projects they have bargained for the reconstruction of iraq in exchange for iraq giving up 50 of oil imports so i refused and decided to go to china and concluded an important and strategic agreement with it today trump is trying to cancel this important agreement abdul mahdi continued his remarks noting that pressure from the trump administration over his negotiations and subsequent dealings with china grew substantially over time even resulting in death threats to himself and his defense minister after my return from china trump called me and asked me to cancel the agreement so i also refused and he threatened massive demonstrations to topple me indeed the demonstrations started and then trump called threatening to escalate in the event of non cooperation and responding to his wishes whereby a third party would target both the demonstrators and security forces and kill them from atop the highest buildings and the us embassy in an attempt to pressure me and submit to his wishes and cancel the china agreement i did not respond and submitted my resignation and the americans still insist to this day on canceling the china agreement when the defense minister said that those killing the demonstrators was a third party trump called me immediately and physically threatened myself and the defense minister in the event that there was more talk about this third party very few english language outlets reported on abdul mahdi s comments tom luongo a florida based independent analyst and publisher of the gold goats n guns newsletter told mintpress that the likely reasons for the surprising media silence over abdul mahdi s claims were because it never really made it out into official channels due to the cutting of the video feed during iraq s parliamentary session and due to the fact that it s very inconvenient and the media since trump is doing what they want him to do be belligerent with iran protected israel s interests there they aren t going to contradict him on that if he s playing ball luongo added before continuing that the media would nonetheless hold onto it for future reference if this comes out for real they ll use it against him later if he tries to leave iraq everything in washington is used as leverage he added given the lack of media coverage and the cutting of the video feed of abdul mahdi s full remarks it is worth pointing out that the narrative he laid out in his censored speech not only fits with the timeline of recent events he discusses but also the tactics known to have been employed behind closed doors by the trump administration particularly after mike pompeo left the cia to become secretary of state for instance abdul mahdi s delegation to china ended on september 24 with the protests against his government that trump reportedly threatened to start on october 1 reports of a third side firing on iraqi protesters were picked up by major media outlets at the time such as in this bbc report which stated reports say the security forces opened fire but another account says unknown gunmen were responsible a source in karbala told the bbc that one of the dead was a guard at a nearby shia shrine who happened to be passing by the source also said the origin of the gunfire was unknown and it had targeted both the protesters and security forces emphasis added u s backed protests in other countries such as in ukraine in 2014 also saw evidence of a third side shooting both protesters and security forces alike after six weeks of intense protests abdul mahdi submitted his resignation on november 29 just a few days after iraq s foreign minister praised the new deals including the oil for reconstruction deal that had been signed with china abdul mahdi has since stayed on as prime minister in a caretaker role until parliament decides on his replacement abdul mahdi s claims of the covert pressure by the trump administration are buttressed by the use of similar tactics against ecuador where in july 2018 a u s delegation at the united nations threatened the nation with punitive trade measures and the withdrawal of military aid if ecuador moved forward with the introduction of a un resolution to protect promote and support breastfeeding the new york times reported at the time that the u s delegation was seeking to promote the interests of infant formula manufacturers if the u s delegation is willing to use such pressure on nations for promoting breastfeeding over infant formula it goes without saying that such behind closed doors pressure would be significantly more intense if a much more lucrative resource e g oil were involved regarding abdul mahdi s claims luongo told mintpress that it is also worth considering that it could have been anyone in the trump administration making threats to abdul mahdi not necessarily trump himself what i won t say directly is that i don t know it was trump at the other end of the phone calls mahdi it is to his best advantage politically to blame everything on trump it could have been mike pompeo or gina haspel talking to abdul mahdi it could have been anyone it most likely would be someone with plausible deniability this sounds credible i firmly believe trump is capable of making these threats but i don t think trump would make those threats directly like that but it would absolutely be consistent with u s policy luongo also argued that the current tensions between u s and iraqi leadership preceded the oil deal between iraq and china by several weeks all of this starts with prime minister mahdi starting the process of opening up the iraq syria border crossing and that was announced in august then the israeli air attacks happened in september to try and stop that from happening attacks on pmu forces on the border crossing along with the ammo dump attacks near baghdad this drew the iraqis ire mahdi then tried to close the air space over iraq but how much of that he can enforce is a big question as to why it would be to mahdi s advantage to blame trump luongo stated that mahdi can make edicts all day long but in reality how much can he actually restrain the u s or the israelis from doing anything except for shame diplomatic shame to me it seems perfectly credible because during all of this trump is probably or someone else is shaking him down for the reconstruction of the oil fields trump has explicitly stated we want the oil as luongo noted trump s interest in the u s obtaining a significant share of iraqi oil revenue is hardly a secret just last march trump asked abdul mahdi how about the oil at the end of a meeting at the white house prompting abdul mahdi to ask what do you mean to which trump responded well we did a lot we did a lot over there we spent trillions over there and a lot of people have been talking about the oil which was widely interpreted as trump asking for part of iraq s oil revenue in exchange for the steep costs of the u s continuing its now unwelcome military presence in iraq with abdul mahdi having rejected trump s oil for reconstruction proposal in favor of china s it seems likely that the trump administration would default to so called gangster diplomacy tactics to pressure iraq s government into accepting trump s deal especially given the fact that china s deal was a much better offer while trump demanded half of iraq s oil revenue in exchange for completing reconstruction projects according to abdul mahdi the deal that was signed between iraq and china would see around 20 percent of iraq s oil revenue go to china in exchange for reconstruction aside from the potential loss in iraq s oil revenue there are many reasons for the trump administration to feel threatened by china s recent dealings in iraq the iraq china oil deal a prelude to something more when abdul mahdi s delegation traveled to beijing last september the oil for reconstruction deal was only one of eight total agreements that were established these agreements cover a range of areas including financial commercial security reconstruction communication culture education and foreign affairs in addition to oil yet the oil deal is by far the most significant per the agreement chinese firms will work on various reconstruction projects in exchange for roughly 20 percent of iraq s oil exports approximately 100 00 barrels per day for a period of 20 years according to al monitor abdul mahdi had the following to say about the deal we agreed to set up a joint investment fund which the oil money will finance adding that the agreement prohibits china from monopolizing projects inside iraq forcing bejing to work in cooperation with international firms the agreement is similar to one negotiated between iraq and china in 2015 when abdul mahdi was serving as iraq s oil minister that year iraq joined china s belt and road initiative in a deal that also involved exchanging oil for investment development and construction projects and saw china awarded several projects as a result in a notable similarity to recent events that deal was put on hold due to political and security tensions caused by unrest and the surge of isis in iraq that is until abdul mahdi saw iraq rejoin the initiative again late last year through the agreements his government signed with china last september notably after recent tensions between the u s and iraq over the assassination of soleimani and the u s subsequent refusal to remove its troops from iraq despite parliament s demands iraq quietly announced that it would dramatically increase its oil exports to china to triple the amount established in the deal signed in september given abdul mahdi s recent claims about the true forces behind iraq s recent protests and trump s threats against him being directly related to his dealings with china the move appears to be a not so veiled signal from abdul mahdi to washington that he plans to deepen iraq s partnership with china at least for as long as he remains in his caretaker role iraq s decision to dramatically increase its oil exports to china came just one day after the u s government threatened to cut off iraq s access to its central bank account currently held at the federal reserve bank of new york an account that currently holds 35 billion in iraqi oil revenue the account was set up after the u s invaded and began occupying iraq in 2003 and iraq currently removes between 1 2 billion per month to cover essential government expenses losing access to its oil revenue stored in that account would lead to the collapse of iraq s government according to iraqi government officials who spoke to afp though trump publicly promised to rebuke iraq for the expulsion of u s troops via sanctions the threat to cut off iraq s access to its account at the ny federal reserve bank was delivered privately and directly to the prime minister adding further credibility to abdul mahdi s claims that trump s most aggressive attempts at pressuring iraq s government are made in private and directed towards the country s prime minister though trump s push this time was about preventing the expulsion of u s troops from iraq his reasons for doing so may also be related to concerns about china s growing foothold in the region indeed while trump has now lost his desired share of iraqi oil revenue 50 percent to china s counteroffer of 20 percent the removal of u s troops from iraq may see american troops replaced with their chinese counterparts as well according to tom luongo all of this is about the u s maintaining the fiction that it needs to stay in iraq so china moving in there is the moment where they get their toe hold for the belt and road luongo argued that helps to strengthen the economic relationship between iraq iran and china and obviating the need for the americans to stay there at some point china will have assets on the ground that they are going to want to defend militarily in the event of any major crisis this brings us to the next thing we know that mahdi and the chinese ambassador discussed that very thing in the wake of the soleimani killing indeed according to news reports zhang yao china s ambassador to iraq conveyed beijing s readiness to provide military assistance should iraq s government request it soon after soleimani s assassination yao made the offer a day after iraq s parliament voted to expel american troops from the country though it is currently unknown how abdul mahdi responded to the offer the timing likely caused no shortage of concern among the trump administration about its rapidly waning influence in iraq you can see what s coming here luongo told mintpress of the recent chinese offer to iraq china russia and iran are trying to cleave iraq away from the united states and the u s is feeling very threatened by this russia is also playing a role in the current scenario as iraq initiated talks with moscow regarding the possible purchase of one of its air defense systems last september the same month that iraq signed eight deals including the oil deal with china then in the wake of soleimani s death russia again offered the air defense systems to iraq to allow them to better defend their air space in the past the u s has threatened allied countries with sanctions and other measures if they purchase russian air defense systems as opposed to those manufactured by u s companies the u s efforts to curb china s growing influence and presence in iraq amid these new strategic partnerships and agreements are limited however as the u s is increasingly relying on china as part of its iran policy specifically in its goal of reducing iranian oil export to zero china remains iran s main crude oil and condensate importer even after it reduced its imports of iranian oil significantly following u s pressure last year yet the u s is now attempting to pressure china to stop buying iranian oil completely or face sanctions while also attempting to privately sabotage the china iraq oil deal it is highly unlikely china will concede to the u s on both if any of those fronts meaning the u s may be forced to choose which policy front iran containment vs iraq s oil dealings with china it values more in the coming weeks and months furthermore the recent signing of the phase one trade deal with china revealed another potential facet of the u s increasingly complicated relationship with iraq s oil sector given that the trade deal involves selling u s oil and gas to china at very low cost suggesting that the trump administration may also see the iraq china oil deal result in iraq emerging as a potential competitor for the u s in selling cheap oil to china the world s top oil importer the petrodollar and the phantom of the petroyuan in his televised statements last week following iran s military response to the u s assassination of general soleimani trump insisted that the u s middle east policy is no longer being directed by america s vast oil requirements he stated specifically that over the last three years under my leadership our economy is stronger than ever before and america has achieved energy independence these historic accomplishments changed our strategic priorities these are accomplishments that nobody thought were possible and options in the middle east became available we are now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world we are independent and we do not need middle east oil emphasis added yet given the centrality of the recent iraq china oil deal in guiding some of the trump administration s recent middle east policy moves this appears not to be the case the distinction may lie in the fact that while the u s may now be less dependent on oil imports from the middle east it still very much needs to continue to dominate how oil is traded and sold on international markets in order to maintain its status as both a global military and financial superpower indeed even if the u s is importing less middle eastern oil the petrodollar system first forged in the 1970s requires that the u s maintains enough control over the global oil trade so that the world s largest oil exporters iraq among them continue to sell their oil in dollars were iraq to sell oil in another currency or trade oil for services as it plans to do with china per the recently inked deal a significant portion of iraqi oil would cease to generate a demand for dollars violating the key tenet of the petrodollar system as kei pritsker and cale holmes noted in an article last year for mintpress the takeaway from the petrodollar phenomenon is that as long as countries need oil they will need the dollar as long as countries demand dollars the u s can continue to go into massive amounts of debt to fund its network of global military bases wall street bailouts nuclear missiles and tax cuts for the rich thus the use of the petrodollar has created a system whereby u s control of oil sales of the largest oil exporters is necessary not just to buttress the dollar but also to support its global military presence therefore it is unsurprising that the issue of the u s troop presence in iraq and the issue of iraq s push for oil independence against u s wishes have become intertwined notably one of the architects of the petrodollar system and the man who infamously described u s soldiers as dumb stupid animals to be used as pawns in foreign policy former secretary of state henry kissinger has been advising trump and informing his china policy since 2016 this take was also expressed by economist michael hudson who recently noted that u s access to oil dollarization and u s military strategy are intricately interwoven and that trump s recent iraq policy is intended to escalate america s presence in iraq to keep control of the region s oil reserves and as hudson says to back saudi arabia s wahabi troops isis al qaeda in iraq al nusra and other divisions of what are actually america s foreign legion to support u s control of near eastern oil as a buttress of the u s dollar hudson further asserts that it was qassem soleimani s efforts to promote iraq s oil independence at the expense of u s imperial ambitions that served one of the key motives behind his assassination america opposed general suleimani above all because he was fighting against isis and other u s backed terrorists in their attempt to break up syria and replace assad s regime with a set of u s compliant local leaders the old british divide and conquer ploy on occasion suleimani had cooperated with u s troops in fighting isis groups that got out of line meaning the u s party line but every indication is that he was in iraq to work with that government seeking to regain control of the oil fields that president trump has bragged so loudly about grabbing emphasis added hudson adds that u s neocons feared suleimani s plan to help iraq assert control of its oil and withstand the terrorist attacks supported by u s and saudi s on iraq that is what made his assassination an immediate drive while other factors such as pressure from u s allies such as israel also played a factor in the decision to kill soleimani the decision to assassinate him on iraqi soil just hours before he was set to meet with abdul mahdi in a diplomatic role suggests that the underlying tensions caused by iraq s push for oil independence and its oil deal with china did play a factor in the timing of his assassination it also served as a threat to abdul mahdi who has claimed that the u s threatened to kill both him and his defense minister just weeks prior over tensions directly related to the push for independence of iraq s oil sector from the u s it appears that the ever present role of the petrodollar in guiding u s policy in the middle east remains unchanged the petrodollar has long been a driving factor behind the u s policy towards iraq specifically as one of the key triggers for the 2003 invasion of iraq was saddam hussein s decision to sell iraqi oil in euros opposed to dollars beginning in the year 2000 just weeks before the invasion began hussein boasted that iraq s euro based oil revenue account was earning a higher interest rate than it would have been if it had continued to sell its oil in dollars an apparent signal to other oil exporters that the petrodollar system was only really benefiting the united states at their own expense beyond current efforts to stave off iraq s oil independence and keep its oil trade aligned with the u s the fact that the u s is now seeking to limit china s ever growing role in iraq s oil sector is also directly related to china s publicly known efforts to create its own direct competitor to the petrodollar the petroyuan since 2017 china has made its plans for the petroyuan a direct competitor to the petrodollar no secret particularly after china eclipsed the u s as the world s largest importer of oil as cnbc noted at the time the new strategy is to enlist the energy markets help beijing may introduce a new way to price oil in coming months but unlike the contracts based on the u s dollar that currently dominate global markets this benchmark would use china s own currency if there s widespread adoption as the chinese hope then that will mark a step toward challenging the greenback s status as the world s most powerful currency the plan is to price oil in yuan using a gold backed futures contract in shanghai but the road will be long and arduous if the u s continues on its current path and pushes iraq further into the arms of china and other u s rival states it goes without saying that iraq now a part of china s belt and road initiative may soon favor a petroyuan system over a petrodollar system particularly as the current u s administration threatens to hold iraq s central bank account hostage for pursuing policies washington finds unfavorable it could also explain why president trump is so concerned about china s growing foothold in iraq since it risks causing not only the end of the u s military hegemony in the country but could also lead to major trouble for the petrodollar system and the u s position as a global financial power trump s policy aimed at stopping china and iraq s growing ties is clearly having the opposite effect showing that this administration s gangster diplomacy only serves to make the alternatives offered by countries like china and russia all the more attractive feature photo graphic by claudio cabrera for mintpress news

blames the too high dollar for the huge u s current account deficit a currency war risk therefore may not be too remote especially in an election year and remember the treasury already lists

foreign trade deficit is on the rise in ukraine having already exceeded the psychological mark of 9 billion future prospects are also disappointing what threats does this economic hole bring and how can it be patched the state statistics service recently published sad news about the deficit of foreign trade in goods over the 11 months of 2019 it appears it has been growing reaching another record high of 9 3 billion which is 6 higher on year the national bank s estimates are even sadder as they say the gap is over 10 billion no matter the difference in assessments the situation is rather unpleasant to put it mildly the thing is that the trade deficit means the withdrawal of capital and foreign currency since it is spent on the purchase of foreign goods and the country s low ability to manufacture competitive products at the same time the government expects that in 2020 the gap in the trade balance will amount to 13 78 billion then 14 92 billion in 2021 and 16 11 billion in 2022 видео дня this is a positive scenario while there s also a negative one suggesting trade deficit growth from 13 96 billion in 2020 to 15 60 billion in 2021 and 17 25 billion in 2022 what s good for giants is a blow to dwarfs according to economic laws trade deficit doesn t mean collapse of the economy often it is adjusted over time in addition an increase in imports of goods from other countries leads to lower prices for consumer goods as foreign competition grows besides lower prices help tame inflation in the local economy import growth also expands the diversity of goods and services but this theory applies exclusively to developed economies import growth there is associated with the ability of the population to consume more than the country can produce consequently trade deficit may indicate economic growth this is clearly seen in the united states and the uk there trade deficit which has already reached billions of dollars is precisely holding back inflation which helps maintain a high standard of living by moving labor intensive industries outside the country this applies to all countries that have capital intensive and high tech sectors of the economy which attracts significant amounts of capital from around the world in the form of portfolio or direct investment however due to the lack of competitiveness of export sectors these countries are forced to cover the bulk of their trade deficit by issuing private and government debt instruments at the same time in the developing economies including ukraine trade deficit in the long run can only bring negative consequences the current indicator shows non competitiveness of export sectors of the economy which often leads to the devaluation of the national currency if a country imports more foreign goods domestic companies cease to produce competitive products industry suffers the most hence fewer jobs and a lower income of employees fewer jobs mean fewer products are produced in the economy and this in turn leads to even greater imports and a larger trade deficit as a result this could entail the fall of the entire economy a paradoxical situation is being observed in ukraine despite a ten year increase in the gap in the trade balance today the government says the economy is growing and the hryvnia is strengthening but what stands behind this raw material appendage or head of the nbu council bohdan danylyshyn believes that today the reason for what is happening is ukraine s clear course away from the status of an exporter of metallurgical and chemical products to that of an exporter of agricultural and mineral raw materials and metallurgical semi finished products dramatic changes are needed to achieve an economic turning point both statuses are not prestigious we just change our specialization remaining in the lower league of world exporters so far the openness of the ukrainian economy is not leading to positive changes in its structure which is clearly seen from the analysis of exports and imports i don t call for becoming closed from the rest of the world yes this is unrealistic a different approach is needed there are examples in history when governments diversified the structure of exports increasing the share of technological exports and in a relatively short period of time of seven to 10 years this was done by slovakia and the czech republic a major role was played by foreign investors their goal was to include local companies in global value chains in order to serve foreign markets and fill domestic ones where imports dominated the expert explained in his opinion in order for ukrainian enterprises to become intermediate and in the ideal case final links in global value chains political stability the rule of law the creation of a high quality logistics infrastructure and effective tariff and customs regulation are necessary i think it s important for parliament and government to focus on issues that allow us to see trends in the growth of high tech exports and lower imports of products that we can very well produce domestically by the end of their cadence danylyshyn emphasized according to vitaliy shapran a financial analyst and member of the nbu council despite poor trade balance ukraine ended the year of 2019 on a major note although this happened mainly due to the influx of funds from naftogaz but the revaluation of the hryvnia which is happening now accelerates import growth and reduces the volume of exports this cannot go on for too long we finance the negative trade balance due to the wages and the influx of foreign funds into the government bonds market the very first change of trends on the international capital market could have a dramatic effect on the hryvnia exchange rate the nbu needs to intensively increase its foreign exchange reserves and not concentrate operations to replenish them at the end of the year but rather try to fill up reserves throughout the year preparing for a possible change in trends shapran is convinced leading analyst ith the institute for socio economic transformation slava cherkashyn assures that while the ministry of finance is pumping internal government loan bonds and ukrainian migrant workers are sending 12 14 billion a year to the country one should not expect any fatal fallout from the growing trade deficit by the way the volume of non residents investments in domestic government loan bonds since the beginning of the year has grown by uah 103 7 billion or by more than 17 times to uah 110 1 billion it is planned to pay them off within two years only another record harvest by farmers in 2020 can rectify the situation but seriously what is needed is a banal cessation of the cannibal tax policy a reduction in government intervention in the economy an active expansion policy in the eu encouraging exporters attracting investment trade shortages are a cause for concern and systemic decisions but not for panic ukraine has lived with such a balance for years but this means non competitiveness of the economy as a whole our products cannot and manufacturers often do not want to explore new foreign markets the situation is almost impossible to fix right away at a minimum an action plan and long term efforts to implement it are required the state may try to stimulate this but it should stop roughly interfering and totally regulating exports he said economic expert oleh pendzin calls what is happening in ukraine s trade policy expected if a country sells raw materials and buys final products it is hard to expect a different trade balance in 2019 our compatriots who work abroad transferred more than 12 billion to ukraine this money is not an investment in job creation they go to the consumer market and for this money they buy cars household appliances everything that we ourselves do not produce but import therefore when our leaders boast that ukraine s gdp grew by 3 2 it would be nice if they could explain what the growth was due to despite the fact that the ukrainian industry for 11 months fell by 7 5 then we would hear that growth was achieved mainly through retail which grew by more than 11 in fairness we need to remember the farmers with their 2 5 growth thanks to the harvest but the main contribution to gdp is retail for the money of our people pendzin said an expert on tax law and financial investigations sviatoslav dubyna draws attention to the fact that the negative export import balance has been observed for 13 consecutive years and judging by the dynamics 2019 has not become a turning point moreover last year the gap exceeded the psychological mark of 10 billion and this indicates that not a single ukrainian government comprehensively approached this problem each government when it comes to government offices begins by extinguishing fires and tactical actions of interested people who have delegated them to these offices as a result we got a constantly stagnating economy with small surges in the case of an increase in raw material prices which makes up 60 of ukraine s exported products the situation is temporarily held by expats who officially transfer over 11 billion annually and in fact are the main investors in ukraine with such a structure of the economy where 40 is agribusiness about 25 is the product of primary processing of natural resources and only 15 is industrial production and 15 are high margin products and services it is impossible to talk about the prospects for economic development and we must also take into account that this all makes up 0 13 of the global economy if we look at the most powerful economy in the world almost a quarter of the world economy which is the united states then there is 1 5 of agribusiness 25 of production and 70 of services in the structure that is the structure of successful countries is services not the export of raw materials or even industrial production we are slipping into becoming an agrarian state which will a priori sink into debt and lose its international role which we have been observing for the last decade the expert noted to change such a disappointing picture for ukraine deep structural changes are needed in all areas now they have accelerated somewhat but globally do not solve the problem too much time has been lost we need a full fledged and aggressive state development strategy but unfortunately it is lacking the main task for the future is maximum processing of raw materials and the release of the final competitive product with its active promotion on foreign markets to this end we need a large scale strategic plan the marshall plan so to speak in all sectors of the country s life ukraine needs to determine its role and place in the global economy and society must answer the question of whether we are ready to change the picture and achieve the right to exist as a state in the future the window of opportunity is not yet closed nana chornaya
markets with significant downside risks to the global economy turned aside and worries over a possible recession diminishing there is a sprouting belief supported by evidentiary proof in the data that global growth could gain momentum over the coming months at the heart of this view is the agreement of a phase one deal between the us and china which has avoided a further escalation in tariffs between the two sides and led to a partial rollback of some existing trade taxes also monetary stimulus from global central banks and an easing of financial conditions have helped to support growth globally economic surprises are turning higher after peaking in 2017 the massive levels of stimulus offered up by global central banks should have long tailed effects and since monetary policy typically has a lag the easing may not be fully in the system yet so onwards and upwards still it s not total blue skies on the horizon as there are still many risks that could veer this bullish view off course especially around trade meaningful p 2 trade negotiations will continue to hog the limelight in 2020 trade discussions between the us and the eu remain open ended while the commencement of bilateral eu and the uk trade discussions could get thorny but perhaps the real elephant in the room the us election in november will also increasingly pre occupy investors as we move through the year overnight us markets raced to yet another record high following the senate endorsement of a new trade deal between the us mexico and canada on thursday so with the us administration and the republican dominated us senate in a let s make a deal mood hopefully an olive branch gets extended to europe so that we can put yet another tail risk in the rear view mirror but supporting the overall good vibe feel us retail sales for december came in better than expected with the control group coming in at 0 5 compared to estimates for a 0 4 gain while the key philly fed number was much stronger than expected at 17 well ahead of expectations for 3 8 it s challenging to be bearish in this environment not only have investors embraced with open arms the signing of the us china trade deal but with the who s who from corporate america headlining the weekly earnings winner list it s genuinely remarkable suggesting there could be more earnings surprises to the upside oil markets traders are riding on the effervescent wave of risk optimism while reveling in the afterglow of the p1 trade deal oil markets advance supported by much stronger than expected us economic data after all at the end of the day its data that counts not opinions but the big mover for oil was the double whammy of positivity from the us china trade deal and the senate passing the usmca which should provide a significant lift to the us economy and give a boost to oil prices since the us is the largest consumer of oil also the iea provided yet another bullish fillip in a report forecast the agency suggested that china s the world s second largest consumer of oil demand for oil would remain unflinching and could average 14 1 million barrels a day this year compared to 13 6 million last year while economic data in china is basing suggesting at the minimum that oil demand would likewise base but the iea is bullish to consensus outlook bolstered the positive price action momentum which is crucial for sentiment to stick when you simultaneously get bullish impulses from the two largest buyers of oil on the planet it does provide an impressive backdrop for oil prices gold markets the gold markets like gold much more than the risk correlation matrixes do that for sure indeed demand for all thing s gold as evidenced in the sturdy bid around 1550 oz so when it comes to the gold theory of correlation relativity it could the year of out with the old and in with the new as investors continue to view global risk in absolute terms rather than its current relative state what i mean by that is gold gains have been made in the face of record setting equity markets which is absorbing and hangs a sign on gold underlying strength which could be an indicator of broader systemic risk to the financial market this is creating a higher level of unease among gold s hardcore investors and some queasiness is at rubbing off on non traditional buyers those risks i m referring to revolve around multiple levels of global trade geopolitical risk us economic risk current standard of tariffs haven t filtered through yet financial market risk the repo market impeachment risk and the us election risk so even if the gold market does capitulate there will likely be good buying down to 1530oz and that support line could prove to be an impenetrable force one of my clients asked me yesterday how i can be both constructive and yet short gold i have two trading positions the first account is a core long gold position that i have been buying and selling in and out of since 2002 the other trade account is to over hedge my current long position too lazy to obtain options which offsets my long gold position market risk when the stars are entirely misaligned on gold like they are right now typically record setting equity markets and higher gold prices seldom if ever can co exist in the same space not to mention neither can much better than expected us economic data and yes i m still over hedged short in the fools gold trade from yesterday with a pivot on a clean break of 1575 oz so i hope that clears things up currency markets the buck recovered overnight after sending the dollar bears back into a temporary state of hibernation after repelling an absolute onslaught of usd selling leading up to last night s us data dump australian dollar the long aussie global growth and catch up to the yuan trade has all but petered out china data look exceptional and dr copper is at the highs but the audusd trade lower suggesting the idea has run its course but when the bullish correlation is not firing on all cylinders it s wise to listen to the story the market price action is telling you the british pound the pound is doing a mighty excellent job of ignoring the considerable move lower in uk rates as traders see the light of day meaning if the boe does cut it will be a one and done insurance move before mark carney punches out japanese yen the usdjpy is trading bid supported by higher us yields on the back of better than expected us data risk markets remain hugely supported so there is little reason to fight the trend but there remains a window of opportunity for the usdjpy to soar possibly not only does us policy support turn positive during an election year but the gpif is also to conclude its five year asset mix review in february or march the giant pension fund is expected to announce a higher benchmark allocation for foreign bonds if other funds follow suit which is typical for japanese funds to pursue the gpif lead that could add up to more than usd 100 billion of outflows with a good chunk earmarked for the us treasury the malaysia ringgit asia traders were a bit more cautious yesterday about the trade deal than their global peers as foreign investors continued to pile in the ringgit overnight the ringgit remains the bullish sleeper for h1 2020 the signing of the trade deal will boost asean exporter and equity bond inflow sensitive currencies like the ringgit keeping in mind the ringgit was undervalued relative to regional peers so we are starting to see the catch up unfold even more so as the yuan veers on a bullish tack post p deal signing with asia key bellwether usdcnh is trading favorably it bodes well for asean currencies in general to start 2020 but even more so for the highly correlated malaysian ringgit
eurasia review by ryan mcmaken when the us places financial sanctions on one country it de facto sanctions many other countries as well including many of its allies this is because not all countries and firms are interested in participating in the us sanctions based foreign policy sanctions after all have become a favorite go to strategy for american policymakers who seek to isolate or punish foreign states that don t cooperate with us international policy goals in recent years the us has been most active in imposing new sanctions on russia and iran with many consequences for us allies who are still open to doing business with both of those countries the us can retaliate against organizations that violate us sanctions in a variety of ways in the past the us has sued firms such as the netherlands s ing groep and switzerland s credit suisse both firms have paid hundreds of millions of dollars in fines in the past the us has been known to go after individuals us bureaucrats like to remind firms that penalties await them should they not buckle under the us sanctions plan in november 2018 for example us secretary of state michael pompeo announced i promise you that doing business in iran in defiance of our sanctions will ultimately be a much more painful business decision than pulling out of iran fear of sanctions has caused some firms to stop work mid project such as when swiss pipe laying company allseas group abandoned a 10 billion pipeline that was nearing completion not surprisingly these firms who employ people pay taxes and contribute to economic growth have put pressure on their governments to protest the mounting interference from the us in private trade as a result some european politicians are increasingly looking for ways to get around us sanctions in a tweet last week germany s deputy foreign minister niels annen wrote europe needs new instruments to be able to defend itself from licentious extraterritorial sanctions another senior german government official concluded washington is treating the eu as an adversary it is dealing the same way with mexico canada and with allies in asia this policy will provoke counter reactions across the world but how is the us so easily able to sanction so much of the world including companies in huge and influential countries like germany the answer lies in the fact that the us dollar and the us economy remain at the center of the international trade system swift how the us sanctions the world by the waning days of the cold war the us dollar had become the dominant currency in the noncommunist world thanks to the bretton woods agreement the petrodollar and the sheer size of the us economy once the communist bloc collapsed the dollar was poised to grow even more in importance and the world s financial institutions searched for a way to make global trade and investing even faster and easier henry farrell at the national interest describes what came next financial institutions wanted to communicate with other financial institutions so that they could send and receive money this led them to abandon inefficient institution to institution communications and to converge on a common solution the financial messaging system maintained by the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication swift consortium based in belgium similarly banks wanted to make transactions in the globally dominant currency the u s dollar in practice the physical infrastructure for a variety of efficiency reasons tended to channel global flows through a small number of central data cables and switch points at the time europe was still years away from creating the euro and it only seemed natural that a centralized dollar transfer system be developed for all the world swift personnel have always maintained that their organization is apolitical neutral and only interested in providing a service but geopolitical realities have long intervened farrell continues the centralizing tendencies meant that the new infrastructure of global networks was asymmetric some nodes and connections were far more important than others what this meant was that a few states most prominently the united states had the latent ability to transform the global economic infrastructures into an architecture of global power and information gathering by 2001 the power of this centralized system had become apparent and in the wake of 9 11 the us used the war on terror as an opportunity to turn swift into an enormous international tool for surveillance and financial power in his book treasury s war the unleashing of a new era of financial warfare juan zarate shows how the us treasury officials pressured swift and its personnel to provide the us government with the means to use this international financial plumbing to deprive the us s enemies of access to markets this started out slow and swift officials were concerned it would become widely known that swift was becoming politicized and largely a tool of the us and us allies nevertheless the american regime pressed its advantage and by 2012 for the first time ever swift unplugged designated iranian banks from its system in accordance with a european directive and under the threat of possible us legislation this only strengthened worries among both world regimes and the world s financial institutions that the basic technical infrastructure of the international financial system was really a political tool the world searches for alternatives naturally russia and china have been highly motivated to find alternatives to swift but even perennial us allies have grown far more wary of leaving the financial system in a place where it can be so easily dominated by the us regime if iranian banks can be unplugged so easily from the global system what s to stop the us from taking similar steps against german banks french banks or italian banks this of course is an implied threat behind us demands that european companies not try to work around us sanctions or face punishment from the us perspective if germans refuse to kowtow to us policy then there s an easy solution simply cut the germans off from the international banking system consequently german foreign minister heiko maas announced in 2008 we must increase europe s autonomy and sovereignty in trade economic and financial policies it will not be easy but we have already begun to do it by late 2019 the uk france and germany had put together a workaround called instex designed to facilitate continued trade with iran without using the dollar and the swift system built upon it belgium denmark finland the netherlands norway and sweden have joined the system as well as of january 2020 the cumbersome system remains unused however we remain in the very early stages of european efforts to get a divorce from the dollar dominated financial system the instex system has been devised for now for a limited purpose but there is no reason that it cannot be expanded in the future the short term prospects for a functional system are low longer term however things are different the motivation for a long term workaround is growing the trump administration has embraced showmanship that looks good in a short term news cycle but which encourages us allies to pull away farrell continues unlike obama donald trump did not use careful diplomacy to build international support for against iran instead he imposed them by fiat to the consternation of european allies who remained committed to the the united states now threatened to impose draconian penalties on its allies firms if they continued to work inside the terms of an international agreement that the united states itself had negotiated the eu invoked a blocking statute which effectively made it illegal for european firms to comply with u s sanctions but without any significant consequences swift for example avoided the statute by never formally stating that it was complying with u s sanctions instead explaining that it was regrettably suspending relations with iranian banks in the interest of the stability and integrity of the wider global financial system all of this is viewed with alarm by not only europe but china and russia as well the near constant stream of threats by the us administration to impose ever harsher limits and sanctions on both china and europe has pushed the rest of the world to accelerate plans to get around us sanctions after all as of mid 2019 the us had nearly eight thousand sanctions in place against various states and organizations and individuals the term now being used in reference to american sanctions is overuse it was one thing when the us imposed sanctions in some extreme cases but now the us appears increasingly fond of using and threatening sanctions regularly without consulting allies this makes continued us dominance in this regard less likely as allies the world over pour more and more resources into ending the us swift control of the system in a 2018 report towards a stronger international role of the euro the european commission described us sanctions as a wake up call regarding europe s economic and monetary sovereignty the effort still has a long way to go but perhaps not as far as many think the dollar remains far ahead of the euro in terms of the dollar s use as a reserve currency but the dollar and the euro are more evenly matched when it comes to international payment transactions if the rest of the world remains sufficiently motivated more can certainly be done to rein in dollar based sanctions indeed in 2019 former us treasury secretary jacob lew admitted the plumbing is being built and tested to work around the united states over time as those tools are perfected if the united states stays on a path where it is seen as going it alone there will increasingly be alternatives that will chip away at the centrality of the united states if the us finds itself no longer at the center of the global financial system this will bring significant disadvantages for the us regime and us residents a decline in demand for the dollar would also lead to less demand for us debt this would put upward pressure on interest rates and thus bring higher debt payment obligations for the us regime this would constrain defense spending and the ability of the us to project its power to every corner of the globe at the same time central bank efforts to drive interest rates back down would bring a greater need to monetize the debt the resulting price inflation in either consumer goods or assets would be significant the fact none of this will become obvious next week or next month doesn t mean it will never happen but the us s enthusiasm for sanctions means the world is already learning the price of doing business with the united states and with the dollar about the author ryan mcmaken ryanmcmaken is a senior editor at the mises institute send him your

jeff carr and tom kavet presented their consensus revenue report to the emergency board thursday at the governor s ceremonial office in the state house vbm photo by timothy mcquiston vermont business magazine the governor and key legislators received as expected good tax revenue news today economists jeff carr for the administration and tom kavet for the legislature issued their consensus projections showing that general fund revenues should be 18 4 million ahead of the current year expectations and 15 5 million ahead for next year while carr economic policy resources of williston and kavet kavet rockler associates llc of williamstown acknowledged that a recession will come at some point they noted that unlike the scare of just one year ago there is no downturn likely in the near term nor one apparently lurking on the horizon recoveries just don t die of old age kavet told the emergency board the e board is chaired by governor phil scott and is comprised of the chairs of the legislative money committees representatives janet ancel ways means and kitty toll appropriations and senators jane kitchel appropriations and ann cummings finance while the general fund with a resurgent personal income tax continues to show strength the education fund also is expected to beat previous expectations by 4 7 million this year fy20 and by 5 7 million next year fy21 this performance is largely based on the sales use tax which bounced back in 2019 after several years of sluggish performance however the transportation fund continues to slog along compared to the other two major funds it s projected to be off by 100 000 this year and next from expectations carr and kavet calculated last july while this is just a hair off from their previous report the tf has had low expectations in recent years as the gasoline tax has been down and new car sales have been off kavet report after rising recessionary concerns throughout most of 2019 the year ended on a positive note with a worst case trade war with china seemingly averted house approval of the slightly revised nafta agreement now called usmca the stock market soaring to record heights bipartisan agreement on funding the federal government no matter how big the deficits and stabilizing global economic conditions accordingly year ahead recession risks as measured by a wall street journal survey of economists has fallen from 34 8 in september to 25 8 in december vermont revenues in the first half of fy20 have been slightly above expectations in all major funds with the g fund excluding healthcare about 1 4 above targets the t fund 0 5 the e fund 0 8 and healthcare 5 2 as a result of both technical and economic factors total revenues from the funds analyzed herein will be about 23m higher in fy20 and 21m above fy21 levels estimated in july a minor midcourse correction of about 1 labor markets remain relatively tight in both the u s and vermont with each posting sustained unemployment rates in recent months close to their lowest levels ever vermont s unemployment rate at 2 3 in november the latest available was again the best in the nation while the u s rate in both november and december at 3 5 was the lowest in more than 50 years even more broadly measured unemployment rates such as u4 which includes discouraged workers u5 which adds marginally attached workers and u6 which adds those employed part time for economic reasons all reached record u s lows since their construct in 1994 in december u s payroll jobs set another record in december registering the 111th consecutive monthly increase the longest stretch in 80 years of data also of note in the latest month for only the second time ever women held more jobs than men a reflection of the faster relative growth in sectors such as healthcare and education which women dominate service sector employment in 2019 grew 1 5 while goods producing job growth was only 0 8 hobbled by tariffs and trade uncertainty as strong as labor markets appear u s job growth in 2019 was the weakest since 2011 and nominal wage growth actually decelerated through most of the year dropping from a peak of 3 4 in february to 2 9 in december underscoring the stark relative weakness of workers vs employers even in labor markets experiencing record unemployment real wage growth in 2019 never reached 2 and in december slowed to a mere 0 6 as the expansion ages growth rates are expected to slow 2019 u s gdp growth is forecast to be about 2 3 while 2020 and 2021 are likely to be at or slightly below 2 the unemployment rate will move up a few ticks but remain historically low at 3 8 in 2020 and 4 1 in 2021 real estate and housing markets benefitted in 2019 from a swing away from federal reserve monetary tightening that had choked this sector in late 2018 and slowed transactions and price appreciation in most regions with three interest rate cuts in 2019 real estate markets have revived and price appreciation is currently well above inflation in the latest quarter 2019 q3 vermont posted 4 3 year over year home price growth trailing maine 5 9 new hampshire 5 2 new york 4 5 and rhode island 4 4 in the region idaho is currently the hottest housing market in the nation with eight consecutive quarters of double digit price growth such unsustainable runs can only end in one way for the 22nd consecutive quarter housing prices increased on a year over year basis in virtually every u s state as of the third quarter of 2019 the most recent available 43 states equaled or exceeded their pre recession peak levels only 7 states were still below their pre recession peak prices nv ri de il nj md and ct notably connecticut has the worst housing market in the nation with prices still almost 12 below pre recession levels rhode island 1 5 is close to pre recession levels with vermont at 9 3 nh at 7 8 ny at 12 6 maine at 13 5 and ma at 15 3 after more than 10 years vermont real estate prices outside the burlington msa finally exceeded their pre recession peaks 2 2 meanwhile the burlington msa like many urban areas has had price increases that are nearly 20 above prior peaks through 2018 the latest available data the vermont counties with the worst housing markets have been in the southern part of the state where second home ownership is more heavily weighted to ct residents until the ct market returns to at least its pre recession level there will be very limited wealth effects from primary home equity and even more important there will be a searing memory that property ownership can be a losing financial proposition both of these effects may dampen second home ownership in southern vermont in the near term despite the record longevity of the current economic cycle and the certainty that there will be another downturn at some point business cycles don t die of old age they usually die from either internal imbalances that are unsustainable and result in correction and rebalancing or external shocks so how long could the current expansion keep going if we look beyond our own borders there are three economies that are currently experiencing economic expansions that have lasted longer than ours with two of them more than twice as long australia has seen sustained growth for 112 quarters since 1991 south korea for 85 quarters since 1998 and poland for 73 quarters

us china sign phase one trade deal how to read the agreement by dorcas wong melissa cyrill and zoey zhang on january 15 2020 the us and china signed the much anticipated phase one trade deal us china economic and trade agreement in washington dc the office of the united states trade representative ustr and the ministry of commerce of china mofcom later released the full text of the deal in english and chinese this initial trade deal is perceived as the first sign of de escalation in the protracted us china trade war now going over 18 months it has witnessed the world s two biggest economies battle crises followed by back and forth negotiations week on week not to mention a tit for tat tariff war introduction of foreign technology restrictions and cases being fought at the wto while hailed as historic by those signing it hyperbolic for its modest aims what the deal hopes to be is enforceable its provisions puts into immediate effect tariff rollbacks expansion of trade purchases and renewed commitments on intellectual property ip rights technology transfer and currency practices among others during the signing ceremony at the white house us president donald trump touted the deal as a momentous step one that has never been taken before with china toward a future of fair and reciprocal trade with china chinese vice president liu he in turn delivered a message from the chinese president xi jinping who praised the trade deal as a sign that the two countries could resolve their differences with dialogue the mood as a result has been a mixture of relief after subsequent rounds of talks and consultations left all sides weary and businesses unsettled or facing losses the most important aspect of getting some sort of deal signed has therefore been a sense of deliverance from further stalemate or prolonged uncertainty and a sense of moving forward towards more constructive changes in the ways both countries do business including with each other not surprisingly then the agreement leaves many deeply rooted issues unresolved prominent among them is china s position on industrial subsidies further while the december 15 tariffs have been suspended the previous tariffs remain despite some rollback these grievances will be taken up in time determined by whether the trump administration considers it to be in its best interests in an election year china knows this and will want to slow down any future talks lest it expose itself to more visible compromise the two sides have sold the deal in their own language the us turning up the volume on chinese monetary commitments to purchase us 200 billion worth of us imports while china has stated that these will conform to market requirements and wto conditions the dual interpretation leaves ample space for future disputes nevertheless last week the two countries announced they would be resuming their twice yearly talks on trade and economic issues which were a convention under previous us presidents while the trump white house opted for a more confrontational and punitive approach that led to the trade war a return to old consultative ways might be necessary to rebuild the damaged bilateral relationship and shore up on much depleted trust reserves parallel to the noise generated by this phase one deal trade envoys from us japan and the european union met on january 14 and announced a proposal to strengthen the wto s provisions on industrial subsidies which they found to be insufficient to tackle market and trade distorting subsidization existing in certain jurisdictions a barely veiled reference to china how this impacts future trade discussions with china remains to be seen but one can expect that the new status quo is here to stay one that will likely see china face some tough situations with old trade partners this might drive beijing to invest more diligently on expanding new trade relationships including those along the belt and road and with the eurasian economic union but narrative and projections aside let s get into what the us china economic and trade agreement actually says webinar august 26 2020 we discuss the hong kong national security law and its impact on us businesses register today what s in the phase one trade deal the 96 page agreement consists of eight chapters on intellectual property rights technology transfer food and agricultural products financial services foreign exchange regulation trade expansion dispute resolution and final provisions it covers the main subjects of the section 301 investigation launched by the ustr against china in 2017 below we provide a reading of key provisions in the agreement tariff rollback the deal cancels the tariffs originally set to take effect on december 15 2019 that would have affected mass consumed chinese made imports like cellphones toys and laptops among others in addition it reaffirms trump s commitment to halve the september 1 2019 tariff from 15 percent to 7 5 percent on us 120 billion worth of chinese products including flat panel televisions bluetooth headphones and footwear however other tariffs will remain these include the 25 percent us tariffs slapped on us 250 billion worth of chinese products and china s retaliatory tariffs on us 110 billion of us goods according to us treasury secretary steven mnuchin more tariffs will be rolled back in the phase two trade deal which was brought up at the close of the phase one deal a summary of the tariffs implemented by both countries can be found in the table below expanding trade and services chapter 6 a centerpiece of the deal is china s pledge to purchase a minimum of us 200 billion worth of additional us goods and services over the next two years the additional us 200 billion in purchases include us 77 7 billion of manufactured goods us 32 billion of agricultural goods us 52 4 billion of energy goods and us 37 9 billion of services the table below provides a summary of china s schedule of increased purchases from 2020 to 2021 special focus appears to be placed on agricultural and financial service imports both of which formed their own chapters within the agreement the agricultural provisions support the expansion of us agricultural exports particularly seafood products poultry rice dairy infant formula horticultural products animal feed and additives pet food and agricultural biotechnology overall combining a baseline of us 186 billion purchases in 2017 with the increased us 200 billion purchases us exports to china should in theory climb to us 263 billion in 2020 and to us 309 billion in 2021 while washington is calling it a big win and american businesses and farmers may be appeased by these commitments analysts think it will be challenging for china to meet this trade goal such a significant jump in its us imports will mean china reducing imports from elsewhere to balance the country s total trade balance the shopping list also leaves unanswered questions what will happen to china s existing contracts with other countries for products like soybeans what will happen after two years when china s promises expire will the increased purchases distort the commodities markets intellectual property chapter 1 the 18 page long chapter accounting for a fifth of the full agreement demands various commitments on the areas of trade secrets pharmaceutical related ip geographical indications trademarks patents e commerce infringement and enforcement against pirated and counterfeit goods the theft of ip and trade secrets have been long time concerns of american companies and was one of the main triggers for the trump administration s tariff escalation the agreement contains provisions to protect confidential information considered to be trade secrets us companies believe this has not been sufficiently protected under chinese law significant progress is also made on the protection of pharmaceutical related ip the agreement also calls for china to submit an action plan to strengthen intellectual property protection within 30 days of the agreement taking effect technology transfer chapter 2 the deal says companies should be able to operate without any force or pressure from the other party to transfer their technology to persons of the other party any transfer of technology or licenses between people of each country must be voluntary according to the agreement the two countries also agreed to a provision that would prevent either government from directing or supporting domestic companies to acquire foreign technology that could create distortion in sectors and industries financial services chapter 4 the deal includes provisions to boost chinese market access to financial services firms the financial services chapter sees china promising improved access to its financial services namely banking insurance asset management and payment and fund management addressing common complaints made by us businesses about investment barriers to china s financial sector under the deal china has agreed to move forward the deadline for removing foreign ownership caps on securities firms which includes investment banking underwriting and brokerage operations by nine months to april 1 2020 currency chapter 5 the deal prohibits both the us and china from manipulation of exchange rates or interest rates to devalue their respective currency china also agreed to publicly disclose its foreign exchange reserves and quarterly imports of goods and services last year the trump administration labeled china a currency manipulator arguing that china was deliberately suppressing the value of its currency to give its exports a competitive advantage this label was dropped just ahead of the signing of the phase one trade deal dispute resolution chapter 7 the us and china will work through their differences over how to implement the agreement through bilateral consultations starting at the working level and then including levels with senior officials if these negotiations fail to resolve the ongoing dispute there will be procedures for imposing tariffs or other punitive measures what businesses can take away from this deal while the deal is being touted as a win win situation for both countries the private sector may not yet rest easy businesses on both sides have had two years of instability to push them to expand their areas of operations find new suppliers and sell to more diverse markets or focus on the chinese market itself the phase one deal will definitely ease tensions between china and the us in the short term and might even boost american exporters in select industries yet the unintended consequences of how china manages its new commitments how other trade partners approach china going forward and international efforts to rewrite wto provisions on trade relationships market competition and state subsidies will decide if the trade deal was worth it meanwhile much of the tariffs remain leaving less room to be upbeat for firms exposed to the trade war s costs several multinational firms have already moved partial operations to third countries in asean chinese firms on their part especially those in the technology sector have suffered enough punitive consequences to trust they will have unfettered access to american markets or will be able to source from the us uninterrupted the trade war has therefore already shaken existing global trade relationships into forging new partnerships and a renewed focus on finding alternative markets and suppliers in emerging economies this article was originally published on january 17 2020 and was last updated on march 2 2020

china reports slowest annual growth in 29 years but signs of rebound at year end stocks climb to new records amid ongoing trade optimism and positive earnings string of upbeat data out of the us also boosts risk appetite china s growth slows in 2019 but recovery could be underway economic growth in the world s second largest economy reached the slowest in 29 years according to gdp numbers out of china this morning gdp expanded by 6 1 for the full year in 2019 and fourth quarter growth stood at 6 0 year on year unchanged from the prior quarter as the long drawn out trade dispute with the united states took its toll on the economy the data was in line with expectations but there were positive surprises from the monthly indicators with both industrial output and retail sales beating the forecasts in december and pointing to a possible quickening in growth momentum towards the end of 2019 at the very least the data should support the view that china s economy is stabilizing and a pledge for more stimulus measures by a chinese government official today further underscored the improving outlook for the year ahead the chinese yuan extended its bullish run on the back of the encouraging data to hit a 6 month high against the us dollar having gained 1 5 in the year to date no end in sight for wall street s record streak there seems to be no stopping to wall street s rally lately as all three main indices closed at a record high for yet another day on thursday as there was nothing to dampen the risk on mood that s been driving the markets since early december when the phase one deal was announced the s p 500 burst through the 3 300 level for the first time as tech stocks surged while strong earnings from morgan stanley also boosted the share indices however friday is expected to be a quieter day in terms of earnings releases and us equity futures are pointing to more modest gains going forward the concern for the us and global equities rally is whether there will be any significant new catalysts to sustain the impressive uptrend for now there appears to be plenty of positive developments to feed the risk appetite the revised north american trade pact usmca cleared its final hurdle yesterday after us senators approved the deal meanwhile markets completely brushed off the official start of trump s impeachment trial in the senate yesterday suggesting investors see no risk of the president being removed from office dollar and treasury yields lifted by upbeat us data further boosting sentiment on thursday was a hat trick of data beats in the us retail sales figures the philly fed manufacturing index and weekly jobless claims all topped expectations indicating that us economic growth likely accelerated slightly in q4 and 2020 got off to a solid start us treasury yields spiked higher on the back of the strong data lifting the us dollar the greenback climbed to a near 8 month peak of 110 28 versus the yen today but it was a much more muted affair elsewhere in the currency markets the australian and new zealand dollars failed to capitalize on the positive sentiment and were only marginally higher while the euro was flat the pound continued to edge higher despite growing expectations that the bank of england will cut interest rates in the coming months looking at the rest of the day the us dollar is likely to stay in the spotlight as industrial output figures are due as well as a number of speeches by fed officials including the philadelphia fed s harker and fed governor quarles

greater pressure than in 2019 more recent data along with optimism over a phase 1 u s china trade deal signed on wednesday have raised hopes that the economy may be bottoming out fourth quarter gdp

about the business outlook analysts said though many of the tit for tat tariffs both sides imposed during the trade war remain in place despite the recent uptick in activity we think it is premature to call the bottom of the current economic cycle julian evans pritchard and martin rasmussen at capital economics said in a note external headwinds should ease further in the coming quarters thanks to the phase one trade deal and a recovery in global growth but we think this will be offset by a renewed slowdown in domestic demand triggering further monetary easing by the people s bank among other key risks this year infrastructure a key part of beijing s stabilization strategy has remained stubbornly weak infrastructure investment grew just 3 8 in 2019 decelerating from 4 in january november

strong by global standards and within the government s target range it was the weakest expansion since 1990 this year is crucial for the ruling communist party to fulfill its goal of doubling gross domestic product gdp and incomes in the decade to 2020 and turning china into a moderately prosperous nation analysts reckon that long term target would need growth this year to remain around 6pc though top officials have warned the economy may face even greater pressure than in 2019 more recent data along with optimism over a phase 1 us china trade deal signed on wednesday have raised hopes that the economy may be bottoming out fourth quarter gdp rose 6 0pc from a year earlier steadying from the third quarter though still the weakest in nearly three decades and december industrial output investment and retail sales all rose more than expected after an improved showing in november policy sources have told reuters that beijing plans to set a lower growth target of around 6pc this year from last year s 6 6 5pc relying on increased infrastructure spending to ward off a sharper slowdown key targets are due to be announced in march on a quarterly basis the economy grew 1 5pc in october december also the same pace as the previous three months we expect china s growth rate will come further down to below 6pc in the coming year said masaaki kanno chief economist at sony financial holdings in tokyo the chinese economy is unlikely to fall abruptly because of government policies but at the same time the trend of a further slowdown of the economy will remain unchanged signs of improvement but will it last december data released along with gdp showed a surprising acceleration in industrial output and a more modest pick up in investment growth while retail sales were solid industrial output grew 6 9pc from a year earlier the strongest pace in nine months while retail sales rose 8 0pc fixed asset investment rose 5 4pc for the full year but growth had plumbed record lows in autumn easing trade tensions have made manufacturers more optimistic about the business outlook analysts said though many of the tit for tat tariffs both sides imposed during the trade war remain in place despite the recent uptick in activity we think it is premature to call the bottom of the current economic cycle julian evans pritchard and martin rasmussen at capital economics said in a note external headwinds should ease further in the coming quarters thanks to the phase one trade deal and a recovery in global growth but we think this will be offset by a renewed slowdown in domestic demand triggering further monetary easing by the people s bank among other key risks this year infrastructure a key part of beijing s stabilisation strategy has remained stubbornly weak infrastructure investment grew just 3 8pc in 2019 decelerating from 4pc in january november despite sharply higher local government bond issuance and other policy measures this shows that local governments continued to face funding constraints said tommy xie china economist at ocbc bank in singapore some analysts are also worried about signs of cooling in the housing market a key economic driver property investment growth hit a two year low in december even as it grew at a solid 9 9pc pace in 2019 property sales fell 0 1pc the first annual decline in five years beijing has worked for years to keep speculation and home price rises in check and officials vowed last year they would not use the property market as a form of short term stimulus more support measures china will roll out more support measures this year as the economy faces further pressure ning jizhe head of the statistical bureau told a news conference ning noted that per capital gdp in china had surpassed 10 000 for the first time last year but analysts believe more painful reforms are needed to generate additional growth beijing has been relying on a mix of fiscal and monetary steps to weather the current downturn cutting taxes and allowing local governments to sell huge amounts of bonds to fund infrastructure projects banks also have been encouraged to lend more especially to small firms with new yuan loans hitting a record 2 44 trillion in 2019 the central bank has cut banks reserve requirement ratios rrr the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves eight times since early 2018 most recently this month china has also seen modest cuts in some lending rates analysts polled by reuters expect further cuts in both rrr and key interest rates this year but chinese leaders have repeatedly pledged they will not embark on massive stimulus like that during the 2008 09 global crisis which quickly juiced growth rates but left a mountain of debt containing financial system risks will remain a high priority for policymakers this year corporate bond defaults hit a new record last year while state linked firms had to step in to rescue several troubled smaller banks even with additional stimulus and assuming the trade truce holds economists polled by reuters expect china s growth will cool this year to 5 9pc
yunyong thaicharoen the centre s chief economist said on friday january 17 the expansion would be driven by an anticipated gradual recovery of merchandise exports following signs of restored health in global trade which is due in part to the phase 1 trade agreement between the united states and china also supporting growth are more accommodative monetary and fiscal stimulus measures being enacted by many countries nevertheless the baht which has appreciated by more than 24 per cent against other currencies in the past six years and is expected to maintain its strength will continue to cut into exporter earnings and render thai exports less competitive tourism income is due for a decline with foreigners tending to spend less individually the number of visitors is expected to rise but yunyong sees the rate of growth likely moderating private domestic demand is projected to expand more slowly than last year even with exports expected to recover private consumption and investment are forecast to cool further due to several adverse factors a decline in employment especially in manufacturing deterioration of consumer confidence a contraction in non farm income a reduction in farm income due to drought and the high level of household debt will together choke household spending particularly on durable goods he said private investment is expected to slow in line with subdued domestic purchasing power low capital utilisation and high inventory in the manufacturing sector will contribute to a deceleration in private investment in coming quarters in addition the persistent contraction in consumer and commercial vehicle sales as well as a decline in real estate construction due to ltv loan to value requirements from the previous period will likely further weigh on domestic demand however the government is expected to play a larger role in supporting growth in 2020 through the use of stimulus packages short term support for vulnerable groups and infrastructure investments it will also enable the private sector to take part in supporting growth such as auctioning off 5g spectrum licences which should set in motion additional investments in telecommunications and related sectors with regard to domestic financial conditions interest rates are expected to remain low throughout the year while the baht should continue to face appreciation pressures yunyong expects the monetary policy committee to maintain an accommodative stance to lend support to economic recovery it will likely keep the policy rate unchanged at 1 25 per cent throughout 2020 the centre still sees the probability of a rate cut in the first half of 30 per cent on three possible conditions weaker than expected growth much higher non performing loans and the baht s continued appreciation supported by a massive current account surplus the baht is expected to remain persistently strong closing 2020 at 29 5 30 5 per us dollar additional relaxation in capital outflows both for overseas business operations and investment in foreign assets will only marginally help ease pressure on the baht in the short run more time is needed to tackle structural limitations such as financial literacy foreign investment capabilities and impeding rules and regulations only after that would capital outflow be sizeable enough to significantly mitigate appreciation pressures on the baht there are three key risk factors for the thai economy in 2020 trade war uncertainties geopolitical risks and household and business financial vulnerabilities despite completion of the phase 1 trade deal between the us and china many uncertainties remain around america s protectionist policies that can impact global trade such as the next phase of the negotiation potential trade retaliations with europe and the decision to cut gsp privileges for many trading partners at the same time geopolitical risks especially from the conflict between the us and iran the prolonged protests in hong kong and brexit will continue to pose challenges for global growth recovery domestically key risks to growth include financial vulnerabilities among households and businesses particularly those with high debt and whose income suffers from the economic slowdown technological disruptions and increasing competition
us china sign phase one trade deal how to read the agreement by dorcas wong melissa cyrill and zoey zhang on january 15 2020 the us and china signed the much anticipated phase one trade deal us china economic and trade agreement in washington dc the office of the united states trade representative ustr and the ministry of commerce of china mofcom later released the full text of the deal in english and chinese this initial trade deal is perceived as the first sign of de escalation in the protracted us china trade war now going over 18 months it has witnessed the world s two biggest economies battle crises followed by back and forth negotiations week on week not to mention a tit for tat tariff war introduction of foreign technology restrictions and cases being fought at the wto while hailed as historic by those signing it hyperbolic for its modest aims what the deal hopes to be is enforceable its provisions puts into immediate effect tariff rollbacks expansion of trade purchases and renewed commitments on intellectual property ip rights technology transfer and currency practices among others during the signing ceremony at the white house us president donald trump touted the deal as a momentous step one that has never been taken before with china toward a future of fair and reciprocal trade with china chinese vice president liu he in turn delivered a message from the chinese president xi jinping who praised the trade deal as a sign that the two countries could resolve their differences with dialogue the mood as a result has been a mixture of relief after subsequent rounds of talks and consultations left all sides weary and businesses unsettled or facing losses the most important aspect of getting some sort of deal signed has therefore been a sense of deliverance from further stalemate or prolonged uncertainty and a sense of moving forward towards more constructive changes in the ways both countries do business including with each other not surprisingly then the agreement leaves many deeply rooted issues unresolved prominent among them is china s position on industrial subsidies further while the december 15 tariffs have been suspended the previous tariffs remain despite some rollback these grievances will be taken up in time determined by whether the trump administration considers it to be in its best interests in an election year china knows this and will want to slow down any future talks lest it expose itself to more visible compromise the two sides have sold the deal in their own language the us turning up the volume on chinese monetary commitments to purchase us 200 billion worth of us imports while china has stated that these will conform to market requirements and wto conditions the dual interpretation leaves ample space for future disputes nevertheless last week the two countries announced they would be resuming their twice yearly talks on trade and economic issues which were a convention under previous us presidents while the trump white house opted for a more confrontational and punitive approach that led to the trade war a return to old consultative ways might be necessary to rebuild the damaged bilateral relationship and shore up on much depleted trust reserves parallel to the noise generated by this phase one deal trade envoys from us japan and the european union met on january 14 and announced a proposal to strengthen the wto s provisions on industrial subsidies which they found to be insufficient to tackle market and trade distorting subsidization existing in certain jurisdictions a barely veiled reference to china how this impacts future trade discussions with china remains to be seen but one can expect that the new status quo is here to stay one that will likely see china face some tough situations with old trade partners this might drive beijing to invest more diligently on expanding new trade relationships including those along the belt and road and with the eurasian economic union but narrative and projections aside let s get into what the us china economic and trade agreement actually says webinar august 26 2020 we discuss the hong kong national security law and its impact on us businesses register today what s in the phase one trade deal the 96 page agreement consists of eight chapters on intellectual property rights technology transfer food and agricultural products financial services foreign exchange regulation trade expansion dispute resolution and final provisions it covers the main subjects of the section 301 investigation launched by the ustr against china in 2017 below we provide a reading of key provisions in the agreement tariff rollback the deal cancels the tariffs originally set to take effect on december 15 2019 that would have affected mass consumed chinese made imports like cellphones toys and laptops among others in addition it reaffirms trump s commitment to halve the september 1 2019 tariff from 15 percent to 7 5 percent on us 120 billion worth of chinese products including flat panel televisions bluetooth headphones and footwear however other tariffs will remain these include the 25 percent us tariffs slapped on us 250 billion worth of chinese products and china s retaliatory tariffs on us 110 billion of us goods according to us treasury secretary steven mnuchin more tariffs will be rolled back in the phase two trade deal which was brought up at the close of the phase one deal a summary of the tariffs implemented by both countries can be found in the table below expanding trade and services chapter 6 a centerpiece of the deal is china s pledge to purchase a minimum of us 200 billion worth of additional us goods and services over the next two years the additional us 200 billion in purchases include us 77 7 billion of manufactured goods us 32 billion of agricultural goods us 52 4 billion of energy goods and us 37 9 billion of services the table below provides a summary of china s schedule of increased purchases from 2020 to 2021 special focus appears to be placed on agricultural and financial service imports both of which formed their own chapters within the agreement the agricultural provisions support the expansion of us agricultural exports particularly seafood products poultry rice dairy infant formula horticultural products animal feed and additives pet food and agricultural biotechnology overall combining a baseline of us 186 billion purchases in 2017 with the increased us 200 billion purchases us exports to china should in theory climb to us 263 billion in 2020 and to us 309 billion in 2021 while washington is calling it a big win and american businesses and farmers may be appeased by these commitments analysts think it will be challenging for china to meet this trade goal such a significant jump in its us imports will mean china reducing imports from elsewhere to balance the country s total trade balance the shopping list also leaves unanswered questions what will happen to china s existing contracts with other countries for products like soybeans what will happen after two years when china s promises expire will the increased purchases distort the commodities markets intellectual property chapter 1 the 18 page long chapter accounting for a fifth of the full agreement demands various commitments on the areas of trade secrets pharmaceutical related ip geographical indications trademarks patents e commerce infringement and enforcement against pirated and counterfeit goods the theft of ip and trade secrets have been long time concerns of american companies and was one of the main triggers for the trump administration s tariff escalation the agreement contains provisions to protect confidential information considered to be trade secrets us companies believe this has not been sufficiently protected under chinese law significant progress is also made on the protection of pharmaceutical related ip the agreement also calls for china to submit an action plan to strengthen intellectual property protection within 30 days of the agreement taking effect technology transfer chapter 2 the deal says companies should be able to operate without any force or pressure from the other party to transfer their technology to persons of the other party any transfer of technology or licenses between people of each country must be voluntary according to the agreement the two countries also agreed to a provision that would prevent either government from directing or supporting domestic companies to acquire foreign technology that could create distortion in sectors and industries financial services chapter 4 the deal includes provisions to boost chinese market access to financial services firms the financial services chapter sees china promising improved access to its financial services namely banking insurance asset management and payment and fund management addressing common complaints made by us businesses about investment barriers to china s financial sector under the deal china has agreed to move forward the deadline for removing foreign ownership caps on securities firms which includes investment banking underwriting and brokerage operations by nine months to april 1 2020 currency chapter 5 the deal prohibits both the us and china from manipulation of exchange rates or interest rates to devalue their respective currency china also agreed to publicly disclose its foreign exchange reserves and quarterly imports of goods and services last year the trump administration labeled china a currency manipulator arguing that china was deliberately suppressing the value of its currency to give its exports a competitive advantage this label was dropped just ahead of the signing of the phase one trade deal dispute resolution chapter 7 the us and china will work through their differences over how to implement the agreement through bilateral consultations starting at the working level and then including levels with senior officials if these negotiations fail to resolve the ongoing dispute there will be procedures for imposing tariffs or other punitive measures what businesses can take away from this deal while the deal is being touted as a win win situation for both countries the private sector may not yet rest easy businesses on both sides have had two years of instability to push them to expand their areas of operations find new suppliers and sell to more diverse markets or focus on the chinese market itself the phase one deal will definitely ease tensions between china and the us in the short term and might even boost american exporters in select industries yet the unintended consequences of how china manages its new commitments how other trade partners approach china going forward and international efforts to rewrite wto provisions on trade relationships market competition and state subsidies will decide if the trade deal was worth it meanwhile much of the tariffs remain leaving less room to be upbeat for firms exposed to the trade war s costs several multinational firms have already moved partial operations to third countries in asean chinese firms on their part especially those in the technology sector have suffered enough punitive consequences to trust they will have unfettered access to american markets or will be able to source from the us uninterrupted the trade war has therefore already shaken existing global trade relationships into forging new partnerships and a renewed focus on finding alternative markets and suppliers in emerging economies this article was originally published on january 17 2020 and was last updated on march 2 2020

getty the markets are entering 2020 on the opposite footing to where they were a year ago in our fundamental view asset prices are more fully priced as risk premiums are highly compressed precipitating a cautious position and an active relative value structuring and trading approach at the beginning of 2019 the process of withdrawing excess liquidity and central bank rate normalization was in various stages of implementation globally and asset markets were incorporating a world with less accommodation today central banks are again adding liquidity after having reversed rate expectations leading markets to expect further rate accommodation and liquidity provisioning additionally risk assets are pricing 10 s p500 earnings growth for 2020 and much lower event risk driven by brexit and china us trade de escalation marto research the result has been a broad rally in risk assets during 2019 with 20 to 30 gains in us equity markets credit spreads tightening us government bond yields lower gold up 18 and implied volatility steady at historic lows so we ask how much is already priced into markets and how much more liquidity and accommodation will global central banks continue to provide in our view markets reflect a world with ample liquidity provisioning bias for further rate accommodation and relatively modest event risk accordingly we think markets are close to fully valued and while our base case is not inconsistent with this picture when we probability weight various scenarios it results in a more cautious view we also believe central banks are in the early stages of re evaluating monetary policy s ability to sustainably support growth in the near term the developing thinking around negative rates doing as much harm as good coupled with current levels of accommodation has increased the probability that central banks disappoint market expectations accordingly we will more actively manage our medium term themes capitalize on low volatility through longer dated vega positioning and seek alpha in relative value volatility and term structure positions that minimize our exposure to continued risk compression important themes we are monitoring 1 inflation primed for higher levels admittingly from a low base after ten years of economic stimulus inflation data is lower than what economic models would have suggested and has enabled global central banks to keep rates low forecasters are again calling for higher inflation in 2020 with pce survey forecasts around 2 0 vs 1 6 for 2019 combining a the fed s desire to let inflation run above target for a non trivial period b a negative real federal funds rate c the effect of trade tariffs d labor market constraints and e global growth stabilization we think markets are underpricing the potential for inflation to surprise to the topside long us rate curve steepeners position for break evens to widen with prices still well below the 2 target marto research 2 corporate earnings estimates will be revised lower q4 2019 earnings and forward guidance is crucial to the stability of risk assets the s p500 s 19x forward p e and analysts 2020 expectations for 10 yoy earnings growth looks aggressive against moderate gdp growth rising us political risks and stretched global leverage levels trade stock futures with a short bias through option structures look for high grade credit short opportunities via outright and options 3 limits of monetary policy will be front and center is there a reluctance for further rate accommodation we believe yes the efficacy of negative rates is now under more serious scrutiny in europe and the us for example the riksbank finally extracted itself from five years of negative policy rates last december even though real gdp declined materially and its unemployment rate rose moreover we are seeing research germany and fed speak against negative rates watching for the results of the fed s monetary policy review which should come mid year we think fed policy is geared towards a steeper curve with the potential of capping short rates inside the 5 year as a likely policy tool next recession what will be the dna of the lagarde ecb will she advocate more strongly for fiscal policy than monetary stimulus to combat economic weakness watching whether the fed decides there is need for a permanent repo facility and how they manage the balance

the early us primaries for momentum in our view bernie sanders is most dangerous for the markets march 3rd super tuesday will be an important moment of visibility on how left leaning the democratic party has moved there is a non trivial chance the democrat primary ends in a brokered convention given the 15 threshold for awarding delegates it is possible that no candidate reaches 50 without elaborating on the delegate math we are watching california on super tuesday as one of the most important races the probability of a brokered convention is currently 20 handicapping the election itself is virtually impossible at this stage and we are instead focused on how market unfriendly the democrat nominee may be selective volatility longs in currency markets if a social democrat gets

levels to 70 trillion in 2019 from 65 trillion in 2018 and 43 trillion a decade ago may hamper efforts to use fiscal stimulus in the next downturn especially in high debt to gdp countries like italy us unfunded liabilities are estimated at 122 trillion and expected to rise to 157 trillion by 2024 with some estimates even higher depending on the growth and interest rate assumptions oecd countries on average have 2x 3x of outstanding debt to gdp levels in unfunded pension liabilities coupled with dangerously low birth rates these obligations will be hard to meet currencies could be debased as
