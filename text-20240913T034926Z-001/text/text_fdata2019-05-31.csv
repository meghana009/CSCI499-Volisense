the tariff truce came to an abrupt end via presidential tweets on may 3 until those tweets us officials had been indicating that progress was being made and there was hope that at the sidelines of the g20 meeting that trump and xi would agree on a trade deal the end of the tariff truce marked a turning point in the markets risk appetites were reduced equities and yields fell the dollar eased in the first half of may as renewed trade tensions were understood as increasing the likelihood that the federal reserve would cut interest rates the greenback recovered in the second half of the month with the notable exceptions of the japanese yen and swiss franc as the still wide interest rate differentials and idea that the us is best prepared to weather escalating trade conflict ahead of the imposition of china s retaliatory tariffs on june 1 and as just as the process seeking ratification of the new north american free trade agreement has begun president trump surprised the world by claimed emergency powers and imposed a 5 tariff effective june 10 that could gradually rise to 25 at the start of q4 unless mexico tightens up its border controls there are likely to be far reaching even if unintended consequences for mexico the outlook for monetary policy and as an alternative for those seeking to move facilities from china and the us economy and future trade negotiation the current trajectory would put a 25 tariff on all the goods from the two countries that are the largest source of us imports and a 25 tariff on all car imports shades of smoot hawley the local elections proved disastrous for the uk tories at the beginning of the month and their performance in the eu parliament elections was not better prime minister may finally succumbed to pressure resigning before the results of the eu parliament elections were announced the risk off environment that followed the end of the tariff truce plus the heightened risks that may s successor would increase the risk of a no deal exit weighed sterling sterling fell nearly six cents over the course of the month and fell almost every day against the euro after trump s twitter storm on may 5 the june ecb june 6 and federal reserve june 19 meetings are among the month s highlights although neither central bank is expected to announce new initiatives both with present updated forecasts the ecb will also provide some more details of its new targeted long term refinancing operation tltro meanwhile the gap between the fed s declaratory policy patience wait and see and the market which is aggressively pricing in a rate cut before the end of the year has rarely been more stark the chinese yuan s 2 6 decline against the dollar in may unwound the lion s share of its gains for the year the fall however is not a reflection of officials seeking to offset the tariff effects in word and deed chinese officials have been tempering the yuan s decline and warning against speculators owing to interdependency and limited alternatives we argue that it is difficult for china to use the yuan s exchange rate its holdings of us treasuries or its dominance in rare earth minerals to use as leverage against the us due to the costs involved we identify them as possible measures at a much higher level of the escalation ladder dollar backed by the highest interest rates among high income economies the us dollar is higher against all the major currencies but the yen and canadian dollar so far in the first half of 2019 there is little doubt among economists that the us economy slowed markedly in q2 but this follows the overshoot in q1 at the same time market based measures of inflation expectations e g the five year five year forward and 10 year break even have fallen around 20 bp in may fed officials will likely see the tariffs as equivalent to a tax hike rather than focus on the resulting higher prices we still only a slim chance that trump and xi will meet on the sidelines of the g20 meeting the rhetoric was still rising as may ended the us has given europe and japan until late november to limited auto exports and this cast a cloud over the bilateral negotiations however unlike the new nafta agreement the negotiations with japan and europe are executive agreements which do not need congressional approval euro following the stronger than expected q1 us gdp reported on april 26 the euro recorded a low of almost 1 11 speculators sold into the euro s bounce and the single currency came back and made a marginal new low drawing even closer to 1 11 the news has already been discounted

elections in july italy s salvini with a strong showing in the european parliament elections may flex his muscles to push to become prime minister banking woes and the public debt issues remain

policy do not appear to be driving the yen the economy s apparent resilience in q1 despite a decline in consumption investment and exports was owed to the fact of government spending and the fact that imports fell faster than exports upper house elections will be held in july and there is a reasonable chance of lower house elections as well since elections for the lower house are not required until

and the complex system and widely geographically dispersed production functions sometimes within the same company in some industries a good can cross the borders many times before it is a finished good that means a product could be hit with the tariff several times and when we say that production is organized across the continent it is understood that it did not simply become this way large companies mostly american but also many european and japanese businesses have integrated the continent while canada and mexico legislative ratification process had begun the us move jeopardizes it just as the trade tensions with china are escalating china s retaliatory tariffs become effective tomorrow reports in chinese press warns that it has drawn up plans to weaponize rare earths there should be no doubt that china has such contingency plans it does not mean that it is imminent or inevitable we continue to see challenges in making the threat effective if china would embargo rare earth to the us us companies would likely respond in two ways first seek alternatives from other producers like australia this would likely push prices higher second businesses would move offshore the manufacturing that required the rare earths so instead of making super magnets for example with the imported rare earths the company for example would import the super magnets the us reports april

menafn daily news egypt egyptian banks are expected to record a strong loan growth of 22 5 during 2019 as macroeconomic conditions improve and lower interest rates boost demand simultaneously government s share of total loans will remain sizeable but decline gradually in the medium term as its austerity drive progresses and private sector activity picks up according to fitch solution africa monitor north africa june 2019 report issued on tuesday in libya s case the report indicates that libyan national army lna commander general khalifa haftar s advance toward tripoli threatens to exacerbate the country s civil conflict and trigger further refugee outflows haftar appears to be either looking to expand and consolidate his territorial control or pressure the rival government of national accord in tripoli into political concessions on the other hand the report forecasts that morocco s current account deficit will widen to 5 1 of the gdp in 2019 from an estimated 4 0 of the gdp in 2018 while gdp growth is to record to 2 9 and 3 2 in 2019 and 2020 respectively daily news egypt took a dive into the report to understand the latest economic and political risks for the north african region egypt remains on right track fitch believes that egyptian banks look set to record strong loan growth over 2019 due to the witnessed improvement in macroeconomic conditions with declining inflation easing pressures on local households and businesses and a more competitive exchange rate boosting exports regarding monetary policy the report cites that the central bank of egypt cbe has resumed its monetary easing cycle cutting interest rates by 100 basis points bps at its latest policy meeting on february 14 2019 with the aim of boosting credit expansion to promote private sector activity the report forecasts that cbe will pause its easing cycle around mid 2019 to allow for the inflationary impact of subsidy cuts to feed through consequently the agency revised their forecast for egyptian banks loan growth to 22 5 in 2019 from the previous 18 1 this also reflects the steady acceleration in loan growth seen over the second half of 2018 from 15 3 year over year y o y in july to 22 8 at the latest reading in november we nevertheless continue to highlight risks of global financial volatility returning and higher oil prices which could yet return a hawkish bias to the cbe s policy trajectory the report indicates over the medium term fitch notes that the government is looking to introduce a new tax law on sovereign debt holdings which could weigh on banks interest margins unless they divert a greater share of their liquidity toward loans this may serve to encourage loan growth in the years ahead should demand from high quality borrowers pick up sufficiently to facilitate such a shift in november 2018 several reports about a proposed change to how banks account for their income from government debt and that the new tax method will require accounting for income from treasuries as part of taxable income which would result in banks having to reallocate costs to match revenues according to the report the government s share of total loans will remain sizeable but decline gradually in the years ahead crowding out of the private sector remains an issue as credit demand from the government which accounted for 30 9 of total loans in november remains strong the growth in loans to the government averaged 36 5 in the first 11 months of 2018 as the fiscal deficit looks set to narrow only gradually we expect continued expansion in this segment over the next several years albeit at a decelerating pace meanwhile we believe private sector loan growth will pick up significantly as cost pressures ease borrowing costs reduce and the government continues to invest heavily in infrastructure credit extension to industry trade services and households rose by 8 0 27 4 9 7 and 18 6 respectively in november 2018 suggesting this dynamic is already playing out the report adds furthermore deposits will also expand although at a slower pace than loans strong economic activity and falling unemployment coupled with lower inflation will boost egyptians real incomes and likely raise saving rates we highlight that much of the population still remains unbanked which means there is substantial room for organic growth in lenders deposit bases over the coming years it is estimated that around 10 15 only of the egyptian population are banked though a higher rate in the range of 30 35 is estimated when taking into account individual savings at post offices the cbe s easing cycle will cap gains to some extent however fitch expects the pace of cuts to be gradual keeping real rates relatively attractive in the near to medium term overall the agency forecasts deposit growth at 15 0 in 2019 marking a slight increase from an estimated 14 5 in 2018 consequently a gradual increase in egypt s loan to deposit ratio is to be expected however at an estimated 45 8 in the third quarter q3 of 2018 and this remains among the lowest levels regionally concerning banks asset quality the report indicates that it has remained relatively high despite a challenging macroeconomic environment non performing loans npls stood at 4 4 of total loans as per the cbe data from q3 of 2018 having fallen from 11 0 in 2011 partly the result of npl write offs in terms of foreign exchange fx exposure fitch believes that egyptian banks have limited exposure to currency risks with foreign assets accounting for less than 10 of the total meanwhile the overall capital adequacy ratio of egyptian banks has improved from 14 0 in december 2016 to 15 6 in june 2018 egyptian pound set for further stability the report forecasts that the egyptian pound is likely to remain fairly stable in 2019 amid robust economic growth an improving external position and still attractive real interest rates in the short term three to six months the report indicates that the pound appreciation against the united states dollar in recent weeks as a result of reduced global financial volatility and renewed foreign interest in egyptian debt we expect the unit to remain fairly stable over the next few months amid slowing global financial tightening and reduced fears of a global growth correction however fitch foresees that as the cbe has now phased out its repatriation mechanism which previously had served to limit exchange rate volatility consequently somewhat greater movement in the pound moving forward is expected on the long term the agency retains our view for relative pound stability throughout the next six to 24 months while the cbe s likely resumption of its monetary easing cycle will put downside pressure on the unit we highlight that the pace of cuts is likely to prove gradual keeping real rates relatively attractive the report cites political instability as a downside risk to egypt s ongoing economic recovery and by extension the value of the pound while not our core view popular unrest could spread as a result of still challenging conditions for egyptian households and businesses and continued political repression in turn this could deter tourists from travelling to the country and also discourage the government from implementing further fiscal consolidation measures the latter would weigh on business confidence foreign investment and dollar inflows and thus cause faster than expected depreciation of the pound in addition large scale outflows of portfolio investments remain a concern in the event of a global growth correction and resultant risk off sentiment said the report libya oil prices ease deficit tripoli offensive increase risks of conflict escalation fitch report indicates that the libyan national army lna commander general khalifa haftar s advance toward tripoli threatens to exacerbate the country s civil conflict and trigger further refugee outflows the report explains that haftar appears to be either looking to expand and consolidate his territorial control or pressure the rival government of national accord gna in tripoli into political concessions should haftar be aiming for sustained territorial expansion then risks of conflict escalation would heighten dramatically both in the capital and elsewhere where lna forces may now be stretched too thin to fight off rival militias despite the ongoing conflict libya s fiscal deficit will gradually narrow over the coming quarters supported by higher oil revenues as recorded by the tripoli based authorities the majority of libya s tax revenue comes from oil and there is limited scope for any non oil revenue increases according to the report libya s crude oil production has been climbing over the past couple of years averaging 1 1m barrels per day b d in november 2018 its highest level since 2013 the report forecasts that libya s production will average 1 3m b d in 2019 and 1 35m b d day in 2020 higher than the 1m b d level recorded in 2018 concurrently oil prices are set to continue heading higher the decision by opec to cut 1 2m b d of supply as of january 2019 will help maintain a floor under brent and set the stage for gains in the new year as such our fitch oil and gas team forecasts brent to average 75 per barrel bbl for 2019 implying significant gains from current spot price levels of around 60 bbl morocco account deficit to widen eurozone weakness to curb growth fitch solutions believe morocco s current account deficit will widen to 5 1 of the gdp in 2019 from an estimated 4 0 of the gdp in 2018 according to the report the main driver is the widening of the goods trade deficit on the back of weak external demand and a rising import bill which would be mitigated by tourism and remittances the report forecasts that investor sentiment will remain broadly positive supported by robust external support and low short term external debt obligations by regional standards furthermore fitch expects morocco s current account deficit to grow in 2019 to 5 1 of the gdp mostly on the back of a widening goods trade deficit this would be noticeably larger than our 2018 estimate of 4 0 of the gdp but somewhat below the 10 year historical average of 5 6 of the gdp we at fitch solutions have revised down morocco s 2019 and 2020 growth forecasts to 2 9 and 3 2 respectively from 3 3 in both years on the back of a deteriorating growth outlook for the eurozone the report indicates algeria the transition question remains on april 2019 algeria s president abdelaziz bouteflika 82 announced his resignation after nearly two decades in power according to the report the move follows over a month of widespread protests across the country which began in response to the president s decision to run for a fifth term in office protests have since evolved into a wider expression of disapproval of the ruling elite composed of an opaque mix of military and business leaders as well as the president s close circle of the ruling elite fitch solutions forecasts that bouteflika s accelerated exit may have been the result of growing pressure from the military leadership with army chief of staff general ahmed gaid salah having repeatedly called for the president s resignation over the past week rather than signalling intensified rivalry between the military leadership and the executive branch of government therefore they believe the move points to continued relative cohesion within the political elite who appears to be looking for a way to grant just enough concessions to placate protesters while still maintaining control over the post bouteflika political transition

the tariff truce came to an abrupt end via presidential tweets on may 3 until those tweets u s officials had been indicating that progress was being made and there was hope that on the sidelines of

first half of may as renewed trade tensions were understood as increasing the likelihood that the federal reserve would cut the recovered in the second half of the month with the notable exceptions of the and as the wide interest rate differentials and the idea that the u s is best prepared to weather escalating trade conflicts were pondered ahead of the imposition of china s retaliatory tariffs on june 1 and just as the process seeking ratification of the new north american free trade agreement has begun president trump surprised the world by claimed emergency powers imposing a 5 tariff

declaratory policy patience wait and see and the market which is aggressively pricing in a rate cut before the end of the year has rarely been more stark the chinese s 2 6 decline against the dollar

backed by the highest interest rates among high income economies the u s dollar is higher against all the major currencies but the and so far in the first half of 2019 there is little doubt among

the bankersâ â power revolutionâ how the government got shackled by debt this article is excerpted from my new book banking on the people democratizing money in the digital age available in paperback june 1 the u s federal debt has more than doubled since the 2008 financial crisis shooting up from 9 4 trillion in mid 2008 to over 22 trillion in april 2019 the debt is never paid off the government just keeps paying the interest on it and interest rates are rising in 2018 the fed announced plans to raise rates by 2020 to normal levels a fed funds target of 3 375 percent and to sell about 1 5 trillion in federal securities at the rate of 50 billion monthly further growing the mountain of federal debt on the market when the fed holds government securities it returns the interest to the government after deducting its costs but the private buyers of these securities will be pocketing the interest adding to the taxpayers bill in fact it is the interest not the debt itself that is the problem with a burgeoning federal debt the principal just gets rolled over from year to year but the interest must be paid to private bondholders annually by the taxpayers and constitutes one of the biggest items in the federal budget currently the fed s plans for quantitative tightening are on hold but assuming it follows through with them projections are that by 2027 u s taxpayers will owe 1 trillion annually just in interest on the federal debt that is enough to fund president donald trump s trillion dollar infrastructure plan every year and it is a direct transfer of wealth from the middle class to the wealthy investors holding most of the bonds where will this money come from crippling taxes wholesale privatization of public assets and elimination of social services will not be sufficient to cover the bill bondholder debt is unnecessary the irony is that the united states does not need to carry a debt to bondholders at all it has been financially sovereign ever since president franklin d roosevelt took the dollar off the gold standard domestically in 1933 this was recognized by beardsley ruml chairman of the federal reserve bank of new york in a 1945 presentation before the american bar association titled taxes for revenue are obsolete the necessity for government to tax in order to maintain both its independence and its solvency is true for state and local governments he said but it is not true for a national government the government was now at liberty to spend as needed to meet its budget drawing on credit issued by its own central bank it could do this until price inflation indicated a weakened purchasing power of the currency then and only then would the government need to levy taxes not to fund the budget but to counteract inflation by contracting the money supply the principal purpose of taxes said ruml was the maintenance of a dollar which has stable purchasing power over the years sometimes this purpose is stated as the avoidance of inflation the government could be funded without taxes by drawing on credit from its own central bank and since there was no longer a need for gold to cover the loan the central bank would not have to borrow it could just create the money on its books this insight is a basic tenet of modern monetary theory the government does not need to borrow or tax at least until prices are driven up it can just create the money it needs the government could create money by issuing it directly or by borrowing it directly from the central bank which would create the money on its books or by taking a perpetual overdraft on the treasury s account at the central bank which would have the same effect the power revolution transferring the money power to the banks the treasury could do that in theory but some laws would need to be changed currently the federal government is not allowed to borrow directly from the fed and is required to have the money in its account before spending it after the dollar went off the gold standard in 1933 congress could have had the fed just print money and lend it to the government cutting the banks out but wall street lobbied for an amendment to the federal reserve act forbidding the fed to buy bonds directly from the treasury as it had done in the past the treasury can borrow from itself by transferring money from intragovernmental accounts social security and other trust funds that are under the auspices of the treasury and have a surplus but these funds do not include the federal reserve which can lend to the government only by buying federal securities from bond dealers the fed is considered independent of the government its website states the federal reserve s holdings of treasury securities are categorized as held by the public because they are not in government accounts according to marriner eccles chairman of the federal reserve from 1934 to 1948 the prohibition against allowing the government to borrow directly from its own central bank was written into the banking act of 1935 at the behest of those bond dealers that have an exclusive right to purchase directly from the fed a historical review on the website of the new york federal reserve quotes eccles as stating i think the real reasons for writing the prohibition into the can be traced to certain government bond dealers who quite naturally had their eyes on business that might be lost to them if direct purchasing were permitted the government was required to sell bonds through wall street middlemen which the fed could buy only through open market operations purchases on the private bond market open market operations are conducted by the federal open market committee fomc which meets behind closed doors and is dominated by private banker interests the fomc has no obligation to buy the government s debt and generally does so only when it serves the purposes of the fed and the banks rep wright patman chairman of the house committee on banking and currency from 1963 to 1975 called the official sanctioning of the federal open market committee in the banking laws of 1933 and 1935 the power revolution the transfer of the money power to the banks patman said the open market is in reality a tightly closed market only a selected few bond dealers were entitled to bid on the bonds the treasury made available for auction each week the practical effect he said was to take money from the taxpayer and give it to these dealers feeding off the real economy that massive wall street subsidy was the subject of testimony by eccles to the house committee on banking and currency on march 3 5 1947 patman asked eccles now since 1935 in order for the federal reserve banks to buy government bonds they had to go through a middleman is that correct eccles replied in the affirmative patman then launched into a prophetic warning stating i am opposed to the united states government which possesses the sovereign and exclusive privilege of creating money paying private bankers for the use of its own money i insist it is absolutely wrong for this committee to permit this condition to continue and saddle the taxpayers of this nation with a burden of debt that they will not be able to liquidate in a hundred years or two hundred years the truth of that statement is painfully evident today when we have a 22 trillion debt that cannot possibly be repaid the government just keeps rolling it over and paying the interest to banks and bondholders feeding the financialized economy in which money makes money without producing new goods and services the financialized economy has become a parasite feeding off the real economy driving producers and workers further and further into debt in the 1960s patman attempted to have the fed nationalized the effort failed but his committee did succeed in forcing the central bank to return its profits to the treasury after deducting its costs the prohibition against direct lending by the central bank to the government however remains in force the money power is still with the fomc and the banks a model we can no longer afford today the debt growth model has reached its limits as even the bank for international settlements the central bankers bank in switzerland acknowledges in its june 2016 annual report the bis said that debt levels were too high productivity growth was too low and the room for policy maneuver was too narrow the global economy cannot afford to rely any longer on the debt fueled growth model that has brought it to the current juncture the bis warned but the solutions it proposed would continue the austerity policies long imposed on countries that cannot pay their debts it prescribed prudential fiscal and above all structural policies structural readjustment that means privatizing public assets slashing services and raising taxes choking off the very productivity needed to pay the nations debts that approach has repeatedly been tried and has failed as witnessed for example in the devastated economy of greece meanwhile according to minneapolis fed president neel kashkari financial regulation since 2008 has reduced the chances of another government bailout only modestly from 84 percent to 67 percent that means there is still a 67 percent chance of another major systemwide crisis and this one could be worse than the last the biggest banks are bigger local banks are fewer and global debt levels are higher the economy has farther to fall the regulators models are obsolete aimed at a form of old fashioned banking that has long since been abandoned we need a new model one designed to serve the needs of the public and the economy rather than to maximize shareholder profits at public expense ellen brown developed her research skills

at the economic club of new york however let me be very clear we re attuned to potential risks to the outlook he said and if we saw a downside risk to the outlook then that would be a factor that

ten months after coming to power and after publicly claiming that he would rather commit suicide than go to the international monetary fund pakistan prime minister imran khan agreed to a debilitating stringent austere stabilisation programme with the imf uncharacteristically on a sunday may 12 however the bravado shown against better wisdom resulting in the inevitable embrace of the imf has cost the imran khan government and the economy of pakistan dear had his government acceded to an imf programme soon after it was sworn in even reluctantly on a wave of hope and rejuvenation to build his naya new pakistan the costs consequences and the criticism might have been less severe advertisement the 10 month delay cost khan his finance minister asad umar who was summarily dismissed in april on his return from washington where he attended the spring world bank and imf meetings umarâ s ouster was followed by the dismissal of the governor of pakistanâ s central bank the state bank of pakistan and also the removal of the finance secretary and the chairman of pakistanâ s federal bureau of revenue a wholesale change in leadership was required to get the deal through â initial discussions for which had started in october 2018 â and following the agreement changes were made in the finance and economic departments to ensure that the imf programme would be implemented if the reshuffle was unprecedented in scope and scale â â even for pakistan where such wholesale changes are made frequently â so too are some of the very strict conditions for the meagre 6 billion extended fund facility eff from the imf while pakistanâ s foreign exchange shortfall and requirements have been between 8 12 billion in recent years the expectation and hope many months ago was that the imf would lend pakistan twice of what it had moreover this 39 month eff programme is pakistanâ s 22nd bailout the 13th since the 1980s of which only two have actually been completed pakistan has been known as a â one tranche countryâ where soon after signing an agreement the government is unable to carry through the reforms suggested by the imf advertisement unprecedented also is the fact that three weeks following the staff level signing of the agreement its details have not been made public also there was no joint press conference as is the practice by the adviser to the prime minister on financeâ the new de facto finance minister who unlike his predecessor is an unelected technocrat who served as a minister in two earlier governments â and the imf chief negotiator though the agreement has not been made public numerous aspects of it have been revealed and a series of steps known as prior actions taken advertisement some of the key aspects made public through an imf press release require pakistan to move from a managed or dirty float for its exchange rate to a free market exchange rate manage revenue sharing between the centre and the provinces in a better way and raise considerable revenue over the next two financial years to plug the fiscal deficit these â prior conditionsâ also include raising of the prices of gas and electricity the imf has also asked the government to request friendly countries â china saudi arabia and the uae â to â roll overâ the estimated 10 2 billion they had lent to pakistan advertisement the reaction to the first setting the pakistani rupee supposedly at the mercy of the free market was manifest in a 9 devaluation of the currency immediately after the agreement was signed adding to a 34 erosion in the value over the last 16 months moreover as one of the pre conditions the state bank of pakistan brought its scheduled monetary policy rate announcement forward by 11 days and raised the basic interest rate by 150 basis points to 12 25 advertisement what to expect the writing is on the wall for pakistanâ s economy and for the people who anticipate a considerable deterioration in their livelihoods as it is pakistanâ s growth rate for this fiscal which ends june 30 will be around 3 at best the lowest in nine years and almost half of what it was just a year ago advertisement pakistanâ s per capita income has fallen over 8 in one year from 1 650 to 1 515 mainly on account of the depreciation inflation also nearing double digits is the highest in around five years with an imf programme that requires reducing development expenditure further devaluation having a considerable knock on effect on prices and rising interest rates things are only going to get far far worse advertisement calculating the economic and social costs and consequences of the imf programme economists fear inflation will rise dramatically to around 16 in one year further devaluation of the rupee will also affect prices and the unemployment rate will continue to rise over the three years of the programme they also suggest that pakistanâ s gross domestic product rate will fall further before it begins to rise while foreseeing a drop in per capita income over the next two years worst still are the assessments that the number of pakistanis living in poverty will increase by 13 million over the next three years and that around six million people will be unemployed in the next two years advertisement after the rot had set in â the rupee losing 9 in two weeks pakistanâ s stock market continuing its losing streak following the imf agreement and inflation heading towards double digits â addressing a gathering prime minister imran khan told his captive audience that they would need to bear the pain for only â two or two and a half monthsâ more after that he said people from all over the world would be lining up to work in pakistan and even day labourers would willingly pay income tax advertisement by all accounts pakistanâ s might be heading into its worst economic nightmare with considerably grim consequences for the pakistani people the tabdeeli change that khan promised in his naya pakistan has certainly set in but perhaps not in the direction his millions of voters and supporters had hoped for s akbar zaidi is a karachi based political economist
pakistan s islamic populist tehrik e insaaf pti government is preparing to bring down a savage austerity budget next month after reaching agreement with an international monetary fund imf technical team on a 6 billion bailout and structural adjustment package reports describe the terms of the bailout which still requires approval from the imf s board of directors as the toughest ever accepted by pakistan which has received imf aid 21 times since 1950 and more than a dozen times in the past 30 years at a press conference last saturday hafeez shaikh prime minister imran khan s principal economic adviser bluntly declared that the upcoming budget would be an austerity budget he claimed the army civilian and private institutions are on the same page and that all of them will participate in serious sustained and structured reforms and difficult decisions the imf is demanding that pakistan reduce its annual budget deficit by 5 billion or 0 6 percent of the country s gross domestic product gdp it is also demanding islamabad increase tax revenue by 36 percent or the equivalent of 2 2 percent of gdp dodging a question on whether the budget of pakistan s nuclear armed military will be cut shaikh affirmed that the sovereignty will be protected by giving every possible sacrifice defence and debt servicing currently consume more than half of all pakistan government expenditure shaikh s refusal to countenance any reduction in the defence budget means that the cuts to social and development spending will be even more savage reported plans include the elimination of subsidies for electricity gas and petroleum products shaikh did not elaborate where the increased tax revenue would come from the tax evasion of pakistan s ruling elite both government sanctioned and illicit is notorious to the point that even the imf advocates it do more to support the infrastructure needed to make pakistani capitalism more competitive but the pro big business pti like all its predecessors will undoubtedly ensure that most of the burden of any tax hikes falls on pakistan s impoverished workers and rural toilers according to a 2018 world bank report 30 percent of pakistanis are living in poverty and one in every five pakistanis is malnourished islamabad and the imf technical team reached agreement on the proposed bailout against the backdrop of intensifying geopolitical rivalry between the united states and china washington which over the past 15 years has downgraded its traditional strategic partnership with pakistan in pursuit of closer ties with its arch rival india is seeking to exploit pakistan s economic crisis to disrupt islamabad s burgeoning economic and military strategic ties with beijing last summer shortly after the pti government was elected to office the trump administration threatened to use its influence in the imf to block any bailout with secretary of state mike pompeo declaring that the us had no interest in rescuing chinese creditors since then washington has repeatedly raised concerns about pakistan s growing economic reliance on china and in particular the more than 60 billion china pakistan economic corridor cpec project not only would the cpec dramatically expand chinese pakistani economic ties it has major strategic implications as it would link western china to the pakistani arabian sea port of gwadar providing a means for beijing to partially counteract pentagon plans to blockade china by seizing indian ocean and south china chokepoints in the event of a war or war crisis the may 12 announcement of the proposed imf pakistan bailout package in no way means washington has relented in its opposition to the cpec or in its determination to limit and disrupt ties between islamabad and beijing if the deal is subsequently approved by the imf over whose policy the us retains a commanding say it will only be because washington calculates it has leveraged pakistan s economic crisis to the optimum in recent months pakistan has sought to curry the trump administration s favour by assisting it in launching peace negotiations with the taliban washington is also no doubt concerned about the impact of a refusal of all and any imf assistance to islamabad such action would only push pakistan further into china s economic and strategic embrace and could trigger an economic collapse that would be disruptive to an already fragile world economy full details of the imf pakistan package have yet to be announced but there is also much to suggest that the imf has made transparency about the financing and other details of the cpec a condition of its bailout package the proposed agreement falls far short of the 12 billion islamabad originally sought but will provide a desperately needed injection of funds to its depleted foreign reserves uncertain of its chances of securing imf assistance and wary of the draconian terms it expected would be attached to any bailout the pti government secured 9 2 billion in assistance from china saudi arabia and the united arab emirates last fall nevertheless the government continued backroom negotiations with the imf and repeatedly imposed austerity measures to demonstrate its determination to implement politically difficult pro investor reforms however pakistan s economic position has continued to deteriorate in recent months pakistan s rupee is among the worst performing currencies in asia with its value plunging more than 40 percent since december 2017 against the us dollar inflation has risen to 9 percent in recent months pakistan is facing a challenging economic environment with lackluster growth elevated inflation high indebtedness and a weak external position the imf statement announcing the bailout agreement said apart from demanding austerity the imf is also expected to have insisted on an aggressive drive to privatize state owned loss making enterprises prime minister imran khan who posed as a vociferous critic of the imf while in opposition and promised an islamic welfare state as part of his election campaign last year has restructured his government in recent weeks so as to demonstrate to the imf that he is ready to impose its diktats on the population this has involved elevating to senior positions in his government a number of people who played leading roles in imposing neo liberal reforms under the hated us backed dictatorship of general pervez musharraf khan picked shaikh musharraf s minister for privatization as his chief economic adviser after firing his finance minister asad umar in addition to serving in musharraf s government shaikh oversaw the implementation of a previous round of imf austerity measures while serving as finance minister of the pakistan people s party government that came to power after musharraf s regime unraveled shaikh is popularly reviled for refusing to provide any meaningful relief to the millions of people severely affected by unprecedented floods in 2010 khan has named ijaz shah who served as head of the intelligence bureau under musharraf to run the interior ministry shah s appointment is a sharp warning to the workers and toilers that the pti government is preparing to face down the inevitable eruption of popular opposition to its policies with vicious state repression the new governor of the state bank of pakistan sbp reza baqir was himself for 18 years a senior imf employee and as such played a leading role in designing and implementing anti worker structural adjustment programs in multiple countries when the announcement was made that baqir was becoming the head of pakistan s central bank he was the imf s senior resident representative to egypt advising president abdul fattah el sisi on the austerity measures to be implemented by his blood soaked military dictatorship the london based financial times responded to the announcement of the imf package for pakistan by publishing an editorial that demanded it enforce strict targets in pakistan after warning against possible backtracking by islamabad in the face of popular opposition the mouthpiece of britain s financial elite urged the imf to leverage the bailout against china an imf programme will at least help in that goal and limit the country s growing overdependence on china declared the times it then went on to insist that the imf require full transparency on the currently opaque terms of pakistan s bilateral loans from china and the repayments due after beijing invested 62 billion in the china pakistan economic corridor

this is why us monetary policy is so ineffective back in the 1980s and 1990s many people thought excessive government spending and the resulting debt would bring inflation or even hyperinflation we wanted a hawkish federal reserve or better yet a gold standard to prevent it reality turned out differently federal debt rose steadily inflation didn t here s a chart of the on budget public debt since 1970 debt leads to lower interest rates source st louis fedhere is the same data in terms of debt to gdp you can see the debt growth started to level out in the late 1990s but then took off again yet the only serious inflation in this whole period occurred in the first decade i am not saying we had no inflation at all obviously we did and in many parts of the economy more than the cpi reflects some of it showed up in asset prices stocks real estate instead of consumer goods we like that and typically don t consider it inflation but it is but there was nothing remotely like the kind of major inflation that this level of government debt should have caused my good friend lacy hunt of hoisington investment management presented two important theorems that explain this phenomenon i ll start with a quote from lacy federal debt accelerations ultimately lead to lower not higher interest rates debt funded traditional fiscal stimulus is extremely fleeting when debt levels are already inordinately high thus additional and large deficits provide only transitory gains in economic activity which are quickly followed by weaker business conditions with slower economic growth and inflation long term rates inevitably fall the first sentence will shock many people who think rising federal debt raises interest rates through a crowding out effect that means the government because it is the most creditworthy borrower sucks up capital and leaves less available to private borrowers they must then pay more for it via higher interest rates or a weakened currency that is the case for most countries in the world yet clearly it has not been the case for larger developed economies that s not to say it never will be but today s situation supports lacy s point and not just in the us in the us japan the eurozone and the uk sovereign rates fell as government debt rose that is not how most macroeconomic theories say debt funded fiscal stimulus should work additional cash flowing through the economy is supposed to spur growth and in turn raise inflation and interest rates this has not happened the reason it hasn t happened is that we have crossed a kind of debt rubicon in recent history in much of the developed world the existing debt load is so heavy that additional dollars have a smaller effect the new debt s negative effects outweigh any benefit the higher taxes that politicians often think will reduce the deficit serve mainly to depress business activity the result is slower economic growth plus lower interest rates and inflation past performance is really not an indicator of future results falling money velocity makes debt unproductive lacy s second theorem supports the first monetary decelerations eventually lead to lower not higher interest rates as originally theorized by economist milton friedman as debt productivity falls the velocity of money declines making monetary policy increasingly asymmetric one sided and ineffectual as a policy instrument the federal reserve controls money supply but has no effect on its velocity that is a serious problem looser financial conditions don t help when the economy has no productive uses for the new liquidity with most industries already having enough capacity the money had nowhere to go but back into the banks that s why velocity fell 33 in the two decades that ended in 2018 now if velocity is falling then any kind of fed stimulus faces a tough headwind it can inject liquidity but can t make people spend it nor can it force banks to lend and in a fractional reserve system money creation doesn t go far unless the banks cooperate conventional stimulus doesn t work anymore the banks respond to each crisis the same way and every time they find that it takes more aggressive action to produce the same effect obviously that can t go on forever in a world of falling monetary velocity the amount of gdp growth produced by each additional dollar of debt fell 24 in the last 20 years the result is that public and private debt keeps rising but also becomes less productive that s why we have so much more debt now and yet slower growth this also explains why growth has been so sluggish since 2014 that was when money supply peaked so for five years now we ve had both a shrinking money supply and slowing velocity that s not a recipe for inflation and the more recent jump in federal

fundamentals are not the only determinant of the way economies perform geopolitics can be equally and sometimes more important because they affect consumer business and investor confidence and the geopolitics pot is boiling with the u s china trade war u s iran tensions north korea remaining a wild card and the threat of a u s europe trade war in six months stock markets weren t happy in may as the u s china tariff battle escalated both the s p 500 composite index and the dow jones industrial average dropped by 5 after the u s increased tariffs on chinese goods on may 10 and those u s stock indices still were down by about 4 as of may 24 those market losses are much less alarming than the nearly 20 drop the markets suffered in december 2018 markets will be reassured if the trade war is resolved in the next few months and nothing else goes wrong but the markets clearly are nervous however a quick resolution is far from certain charles burbeck a global equities investor in london says it may take six months both sides in the dispute have hardened their positions both economies are growing more than was anticipated a few months ago so with no risk of imminent damage to their economies neither side has an incentive to move quickly jurrien timmer director of global macro with fmr llc a k a fidelity investments in boston says the delay in resolving the trade war suggests that price earnings p e multiples will come down some more he notes that the average p e ratio in the u k has dropped to around 12 from 16 during the three years that brexit has been dragging on he doesn t anticipate that much of a drop due to the trade war but says investors want to be compensated for increased uncertainty nevertheless most analysts aren t suggesting major changes to asset allocation in investment portfolios investors usually need a 50 or more chance of recession within the next year before rebalancing or going more defensive says sébastien lavoie chief economist with laurentian bank securities inc lbs in montreal he puts the current chance at 30 however your clients may want to consider some tweaks for example a report from national bank financial inc nbf suggests taking some profits from equities and leaving the proceeds in cash to use when market slides provide opportunities the nbf report also states that reducing exposure to emerg ing markets could be considered if the trade war continues china s growth will be dampened and the u s dollar us will rise emerging economies depend on china to buy their exports and these countries also have significant debt in u s dollars when the us rises the cost of servicing that debt increases in tandem dominique lapointe lavoie s colleague at lbs and an economist who works on tactical asset allocation recommendations suggests adding equities from defensive sectors specifically telecommunications consumer staples and utilities while still investing in growth stocks such as information technology it and industrials the amount of defensive investments depends on how worried your clients are if they are really worried lapointe says some u s reits could be a good idea lapointe isn t suggesting financials right now because the yield curve is flat giving banks little differential between the short term rates they charge for loans and the long term rates their assets are invested in he does say however that canadian banks are really solid they are well capitalized with excellent rules for risk management even if there s a recession he says these banks should be fine burbeck likes both it and u s banks particularly in combination which he says provides balance between growth and value he notes the possibility of it regulation but says it probably would be welcomed by companies because it would raise the barriers to entry and make retaining market share easier interestingly burbeck isn t worried about fintechs making banks vulnerable for the same reason the real strength of banks is mortgage loans and that requires large amounts of capital and is heavily regulated he also could see banks buying fintechs to enter that consumer channel another consideration is currency movements lavoie is forecasting the canadian dollar c to be around us80 by the second quarter of 2020 up by about 7 from the recent value of us75 that would cut into or even eliminate returns on u s investments unless your clients hedge their currency exposure however not everyone expects the c to rise in value beata caranci senior vice president and chief economist at toronto dominion bank in toronto is forecasting the loonie will remain near current levels the bottom line is that you and your clients need to keep an eagle eye on economic fundamentals geopolitical developments and currency movements economics recessions usually come when rising inflation forces central banks to raise interest rates but inflation has remained persistently low says timmer i can t come up with a case for an imminent downturn in the u s neither can most other economists and analysts but there are some sleepers for example lavoie is concerned about the amount and quality of u s corporate debt in march 55 of u s investment grade debt was rated bbb vs 43 a year ago this credit bubble could burst if interest rates rise which he anticipates will happen in 2020 burbeck agrees he s particularly concerned about private equity debt which is less scrutinized because it s private he notes that the sector is growing as more and more public companies go private caranci also flags corporate debt as being vulnerable but she doesn t anticipate rates will rise over the next year and a half timmer isn t as concerned saying the rising debt just reflects companies taking advantage of low interest rates to push out their bond issues maturities he also doesn t anticipate rates will rise analysts also are divided on inflation assuming the u s china trade war is resolved within the next few months timmer and caranci don t foresee signs of inflationary pressure emerging however lavoie burbeck and francois bourdon the last is chief investment officer at fiera capital corp in montreal think inflation will rise even without the tariffs continuing bourdon sees several factors that have delayed increases in inflation now that the u s economy is operating at full capacity these include improved productivity companies ability to source from alternative suppliers the disruptive impact of companies such as uber technologies inc and amazon com inc which have forced competitors to keep prices low and the ability of consumers to find bargains through online shopping but the deflationary impact of those factors won t last and he says we ll see prices rise soon adding that he wouldn t be surprised if the federal reserve board raises interest rates before yearend burbeck also believes inflation is lagging he agrees that online shopping has kept down the price of goods but not services and wages are a major component of services prices he also notes that china has been a huge deflationary force which is one reason the u s is trying to end the trade war geopolitical issues the u s economy can swallow the tariffs president donald trump imposed on china on may 10 without risking recession but if the additional tariffs threatened by trump are imposed and remain in place for an extended period the odds of an economic downturn will rise caranci analyzed the impacts of escalation of the trade war looking at both direct impacts and the more worrisome indirect impacts coming from changes in consumer business and investor confidence if the u s imposes tariffs of 25 on all chinese goods u s economic growth could drop by almost one percentage point ppt and inflation rise by 0 7 ppt most economists anticipate that the u s s economy will grow by only about 2 this year so if other negative factors come into play there could well be a recession china is in better shape its economy is much stronger growing by more than 6 so knocking 0 5 ppt off that caranci s estimate of maximum impact wouldn t be a major problem in addition the communist government has the ability to stimulate the economy quickly as has been done in the past year trump also has threatened to levy 25 tariffs on imports of cars from europe and japan although he has delayed a decision on that for six months lavoie and burbeck are more concerned about this threat than they are about the u s china trade war the u s is more dependent on europe than china for what it imports and what it exports lavoie says burbeck says that the tariffs would hurt germany europe s major growth engine in particular germany s large auto industry is struggling with decreased demand for diesel automobiles and lags other countries in developing electric cars in addition there are tensions between the u s and iran and the u s s relationship with north korea is deteriorating the us could take off amid concerns about nuclear arms in both iran and north korea while oil prices could soar if a flareup surrounding iran happens
by jenny leonard and shawn donnan president donald trump vowed to impose a 5 tariff on mexican goods until that country stops immigrants from entering the u s illegally brandishing a weapon used against a widening group of countries and jeopardizing a new north american trade agreement the tariff would take effect on june 10 until such time as illegal migrants coming through mexico and into our country stop trump said in a twitter post on thursday night he warned that the levy would gradually increase until the illegal immigration problem is remedied at which time the tariff will be removed the tariffs could rise as high as 25 on oct 1 trump said in a statement released by the white house the move which has major implications for american automakers and other companies with production south of the border and the u s economy as a whole represents trump s latest expansion of his trade wars it comes just days after he removed steel tariffs on mexico that had caused retaliation against u s farm products it also marries two of his signature issues trade and immigration as he ramps up his campaign for re election in 2020 markets react the mexican peso weakened by as much as 3 after trump s tweets while investors fled to the safest assets as concerns over new trade conflicts mounted the yen strengthened and s p 500 index futures tumbled heading for their worst

other officials would visit washington the following day to seek agreement and added that he s not a coward and is acting on principles jesus seade mexico s undersecretary of foreign relations for north america told reporters in mexico city thursday at a previously scheduled event that the country won t retaliate before discussing the matter with the u s but the tariff threat he added if turned into reality would be extremely serious economists warned the move could hurt both countries mexico s exports to the u s account for about four fifths of total overseas shipments or about 28 of its gross domestic product according to bloomberg chief economist tom orlik for the u s economy 5 tariffs on 346 billion of mexican imports means a price tag of about 17 billion which rises to 87 billion if the taxes increase to 25 american consumers will feel the impact more than they did with the china tariffs as price increases for items like food are more directly observable orlik said to impose the potential tariffs trump said he s invoking authorities under the international emergency economic powers act a tool that s used to impose treasury sanctions analysts and lawyers raised questions about the legality of using it in this context this is a misuse of presidential tariff authority and counter to congressional intent republican senator chuck grassley of iowa said in a statement thursday i support nearly every one of president trump s immigration policies but this is not one of them iowa s other republican senator joni ernst also criticized trump s move while i support the need for comprehensive border security and a permanent fix to illegal immigration this isn t the right path forward she said in a statement friday i m asking the president to reconsider and for democrats to work with us to find a solution to the humanitarian crisis at our southern border illegal immigration trump made curtailing undocumented immigration a centerpiece of his presidency and campaign he ran in 2016 on promises to build a border wall to keep out migrants and declared a national emergency to tap federal funds for construction after congress didn t provide as much money as the president demanded this month u s customs and border protection said in a tweet that it had apprehended 45 large groups of migrants that included more than 7 900 individuals on wednesday the agency said it stopped 1 036 people south of downtown el paso texas the largest group of undocumented immigrants it ever encountered according to a customs and border protection statement the tariff move came the same day that trump presented notice to congress to pass his renegotiated version of the north american free trade agreement which has allowed tariff free trade with mexico and canada since it came into effect in the 1990s the administration said thursday s plan to increase tariffs on its southern neighbor was not linked to trump s nafta replacement the united states mexico canada agreement which the white house is presenting as his no 1 legislative agenda item acting white house chief of staff mick mulvaney said on a call with reporters thursday night that the potential tariffs aren t part of a trade dispute but about the immigration problem he added that if the white house finds enough cooperation from mexico over the coming weeks the tariffs will either not take effect or will be lifted swiftly acting homeland security secretary kevin mcaleenan laid out what he called key opportunities for enhanced partnership with mexico that could spare the country from increased duties mcaleenan listed the need for mexico to step up its security efforts at its border with guatemala a crackdown on transnational criminal organizations and more cooperation and alignment on asylum policy if the u s imposes the tariffs it will be violating nafta as well as world trade organization commitments said kenneth smith ramos who was mexico s chief negotiator for the usmca when it was negotiated with the u s and canada last year under nafta you cannot increase tariffs unless there are trade remedy investigations or something that is allowed under the agreement he said so it would be a clear market access violation what bloomberg s economists say the read across from mexico to china will add to concerns that talks between washington d c and beijing are going nowhere mexico negotiated revisions to nafta only to be hit with sweeping higher tariffs other countries including china will be taking note perhaps concluding that negotiated agreements with the u s are of little worth chang shu yuki masujima tom orlik rufus yerxa president of the national foreign trade council a business group representing u s companies said the move was a huge blow to the

impose tariffs trump is reaching for one of his favorite policy tools to pursue a broader policy goal but he also faces risks of a backlash with polls showing the import taxes he has imposed on goods from china and elsewhere are not popular this is a dramatic escalation that will likely make it impossible for mexico to continue cooperating with this administration on trade or on controlling asylum

announcement of the same old one trick in a rather shocked he announced by his tweets to impose 5 tariff on all mexican imports until such time as illegal migrants coming through mexico and into our country stop and the tariff will gradually increase until the illegal immigration problem is remedied in the more detailed announcement by the white house trump said he was invoking the authorities granted to me by the international emergency economic powers act starting june 10 5 tariff will be imposed on all goods imported from mexico if the crisis persist tariffs will be raised to 10 on july 1 then 15 on august 1 20 on september 1 and 25 on october 1 he further warned if mexico fails to act tariffs will remain at the high level and companies located in mexico may start moving back to the united states to make their products and goods companies that relocate to the united states will not pay the tariffs or be affected in any way fed clarida interest rate consistent with talyor type rule results fed vice chair richard clarida reiterated the view that us economy is in a very good place also current interest rate lies in the range of neutral and remain appropriate softness in recent inflation is seen as transitory though he also outlined the conditions for a rate cut in persistent inflation miss or deterioration in global economic financial developments in a speech delivered yesterday he said the u s economy is in a very good place with the unemployment rate near a 50 year low inflationary pressures muted expected inflation stable and gdp growth solid and projected to remain so also the federal funds rate is now in the range of estimates of its longer run neutral level and the unemployment rate is not far below many estimates of u and plugging these inputs into a 1993 taylor type rule produces a federal funds rate between 2 25 and 2 5 percent which is the range for the policy rate that the fomc has reaffirmed fed s decision to leave interest rate unchanged in may reflects our view that some of the softness in recent inflation data will prove to be transitory nevertheless clarida also noted if the incoming data were to show a persistent shortfall in inflation below our 2 percent objective or were it to indicate that global economic and financial developments present a material downside risk to our baseline outlook then these are developments that the committee would take into account in assessing the appropriate stance for monetary policy boc wilkins trade war is a wild card and our major preoccupation boc senior deputy governor carolyn wilkins reiterated in a speech the central bank s view that the slowdown in late 2018 and early 2019 was temporary however global trade risks have increased thus the current accommodation provided by boc remains appropriate and upcoming rate decisions will remain data dependent with attention to household spending oil markets and the global trade environment she described trade war as the wild card on global and domestic outlook how costly are trade wars for the global economy in april we said tariffs over the past two years and trade policy uncertainty would chop 0 4 per cent from global gdp by the end of 2021 that s about us 350 billion while this can only be a rough estimate we know it matters more for trade dependent economies like canada s wilkins noted the positive development that us has dropped steel and aluminum tariffs recently increasing chance of ratification of usmca but other developments are discouraging with us and china escalated their dispute and canada caught in the crossfire she also noted the potential for more friction between the united states and european union she warned if the disputes were to worsen and become long lasting the outlook would be quite different not only would we see weaker economic demand but the supply side of the economy would also take a hit as companies deal with disruptions to their supply chains

the narendra modi led nda government formed its union council of ministers on may 30 after securing a thumping victory on may 23 a spectacle that left the united opposition gobsmacked modi s party the bjp singlehandedly bagged over 300 seats reflecting the nation s confidence in the leader but as the dust settles after nda s landslide mandate prime minister narendra modi and his cabinet of ministers will have a plateful of economic challenges to overcome narendra modi and his cabinet have to come to power for a second term amid a sharp economic slowdown photo reuters advertisement according to economists a concoction of issues has led to a growth slowdown over the last few quarters the three month long election also caught the economy off guard amid a global slowdown triggered by the us china showdown despite the sudden slowdown in growth modi s message was clear after the landslide victory to transform new india into a global economic leader below are some of the financial woes economists say pm narendra modi will have to deal with first unemployment unemployment remains a major concern in the country of 1 3 billion people whom narendra modi thanked for choosing him yet again the onus now lies on the government to resolve and resurrect data suggests that half the youth in india are aged 25 of which 19 million are expected to be jobless by the end of 2019 according to a 2018 report by the international labour organisation ilo also data compiled by centre for monitoring indian economy cmie revealed that employment rate in the country rose to 7 2 per cent in february the labour ministry has confirmed that the country s unemployment rate has touched 6 1 per cent the highest in 45 years photo reuters a year ago during the same period in february 2018 that figure was just about to touch six per cent labour participation rates have also witnessed a decline from 43 2 per cent in january 2019 to 42 7 per cent a month later to top it off an unpublished but leaked periodic labour force survey plfs conducted by nsso india now confirmed by the labour ministry indicated that unemployment levels have breached a four decade high in india at 6 1 per cent read it is official india s unemployment rate at 6 1 rises to 45 year high while the government said the report was incomplete and distanced itself from the contents of the leaked report unemployment remains a major area of concern for the government in its defence the government said the plfs survey by the nsso had a small sample size and that it wanted to find out the number of jobs created under the mudra micro units development and refinance agency scheme advertisement but the mudra study is yet to surface and there is no data on how many jobs have been generated due to the mudra scheme however there are several reports that indicate the scheme has not lived up to its expectations also read reality check how mudra missed its mark a collection of case studies show that only 3 per cent of the loans salvaged under the scheme generate monthly income over rs 10 000 moreover noted economists including former rbi governor raghuram rajan have warned that mudra loans could spiral into becoming the source of india s next non performing asset npa crisis raghuram rajan had warned earlier that the government s ambitious mudra scheme could end up being the next source of npa crisis photo reuters for the modi government streamlining this issue will be one of the biggest challenges it will face in the next five years while narendra modi s administration has successfully launched an assortment of social welfare schemes for the country s grassroots it failed in quelling debates around lack of employment data in the country a crucial challenge for the party going forward news analysis unemployment on rise gdp slips and you voted for vikas advertisement renowned indian economist kaushik basu opined in us publication new york times that india can hide unemployment data but not the truth the former world bank chief economist claims the country s economic situation may be worse than projected considering that fact that there has been no concrete data to monitor employment unemployment rates for the past few years he adds that analysts and economists now rely on indirect reports surveys since the labour bureau office under the ministry of labour and employment discontinued the process of carrying out such surveys since 2016 measuring employment is inherently difficult in india one reason is that the standard definition of what constitutes work being in regular employment for a certain number of hours and a regular salary comes from industrialized nations basu wrote like basu several other economists feel that india has immense potential in its booming youth the demographic dividend but opportunities have not grown in accordance growth slowdown besides a rise in unemployment the country seems to be witnessing a slowdown in growth over the past five few quarters in the third quarter of 2018 19 india s gdp growth slipped to 6 6 per cent after growing at 8 2 per cent in the first quarter and 7 2 per cent in the second quarter advertisement the gdp growth for the fourth quarter ended march 2019 released today indicated that it has slowed down to 5 8 per cent as stated in an earlier report by the state bank of india india s annual gdp growth rates has been revised to 6 8 from 7 2 last year photo representational image meanwhile economic growth for the year 2018 19 has also been revised to 6 8 per cent compared to the earlier figure of 7 2 per cent slipping to a five year low must read annual gdp falls to 6 8 from 7 2 last year march quarter growth slower than china the fresh data released by the statistics office makes it clear that the economy grew in the fourth quarter at the slowest pace in the last 17 quarters as per the new data india has also lost its fastest growing economy tag to china for the first time in two years while india did achieve the fastest growing economy under modi s watch it has failed to register double digit growth which according to noted economists is possible for a young country like india former rbi governor raghuram rajan and international monetary fund chief economist gita gopinath said earlier that india has the potential to grow over 10 per cent with its large workforce if disruptive reforms are discounted in a span of approximately a year the country s economic growth seems to have slipped from 8 2 per cent to 6 per cent or lower the rapid slowdown in growth needs to be fixed if india wants to achieve double digit growth sectoral snags many sectors have seen a decline in profits over the past few quarters due to muted consumer spending some key sectors that have witnessed a slowdown in growth include fmcg agriculture mutual funds real estate aviation and automobiles india today insight report why auto sales are down and why they won t rebound soon to put things into perspective over 300 listed companies have witnessed double digit fall in profits in q4 fy19 according to economists the slowdown in the growth of these sectors is a direct result of a slowdown in consumer consumption the sharp dip in gdp within just three quarters is a worrisome development for the government as the reduction in private consumption could add to the growth slowdown the government will also have to come up with strategies to counter a sharp slowdown in domestic consumption photo reuters in its march 2019 report the department of economic affairs under the finance minister admitted that declining growth of private consumption lacklustre increase in fixed investments and a slowdown in exports contributed to muted growth in gdp the poor financial results have not only reflected on the stock market but also pulled down india s gdp resolving sectoral delinquencies therefore will be a key task at hand for the government analysts at credit suisse are of the view that no recovery in sectoral indices will be possible in the first six months of 2019 20 and improvement if government rolls out fresh strategic policies can be seen only in the second half of the year however the government should examine the reason behind the slowdown in key sectors like fmcg which slowdown almost 14 per cent in the first three months of 2019 fiscal discipline the government needs to ensure that it maintains a balance between fiscal prudence and investment driven growth an imbalance could either lead to a slowdown or rise in inflation while the continuity in policy under nda 2 0 will be advantageous for companies the government should look at streaming its schemes including the goods and services tax gst the new tax reform that was started under nda s first term in 2016 till date compliance and registration process remain big issues under the tax regime the modi government also has to streamline the taxation rate further under the reform and ensure that no additional cess is incorporated within the present structure striking a balance between fiscal consolidation along with fresh structural reforms will be key to reviving the economy photo reuters while fixing existing snags through policy will be key in driving economic growth over the next five years the government also needs to consolidate its fiscal math as indicated by a number of brokerage firms even as economic expectations are high the government will have to first aim at consolidating the economy through non extreme reforms and then focus on investment driven growth india ratings principle economist sunil kumar saha has highlighted that while short term measures can deal with temporary snags it is important that the government fixes the structural reforms in the economy preventing double digit growth near term challenges the government faces two critical challenges in the short term growth slowdown and lowering consumer consumption according to economists the government has the option to increase investments to provide a temporary boost but it has to proceed with extreme caution as direct tax collections a key source of investment has not been satisfactory the government had set out with a direct tax collection target of rs 12 lakh crore but fell short by 82 000 crore due to lower corporate tax collections need of the hour big bang economic reforms planned in first 100 days of modi government 2 0 says niti aayog vice chairman while the government bettered its tax collection by 13 4 per cent compared to the previous fiscal it fell short of its 18 per cent target inadequate tax collection may even force the government to reduce its budgetary allocation for the current fiscal in fact average indirect tax collections under the goods and services tax regime have also not lived up to the mark leading to higher fiscal deficit however the latest collections figures showed improvement as collections for april rose over 10 per cent to rs 1 13 trillion from the corresponding period a year ago moreover collections under the indirect tax reform crossed the rs 1 trillion mark in three of the first four months of 2019 the international monetary fund imf recently said that modi s government near term challenges include reducing the npa crisis in the country and streamlining gst comparison interim budget 2019 how 5 years of modi compare to manmohan on fdi foreign exchange reserves among other hurdles the government needs to find ways to revive rural demand which has weakened due to heightened agricultural distress the farming sector has witnessed severe issues over the last few years amid boiling countrywide farmers protests regarding minimum support price msp and loan waivers many economists agree that the average agricultural growth under the modi government has been poor at just 2 5 per cent photo reuters though the government has tried filling in the gaps the sector has not performed well during modi s tenure much of it is due to the government s control of the sector noted agricultural economist ashok gulati explained in the past that farmers income in india still remains the main concern and the government should take steps to categorically reform the sector balancing act not just welfare schemes but the government now has to adopt a balancing act between development and consolidation in addition to compliance challenges all eyes will be on new union finance minister nirmala sitharaman who has to implement quick measures to balance growth and consolidation a key blend to achieving double digit growth in future
by jenny leonard and shawn donnan may 31 2019 at 07 16 am international trade president donald trump vowed to impose a 5 tariff on mexican goods until that country stops immigrants from entering the u s illegally brandishing a weapon used against a widening group of countries and jeopardizing a new north american trade agreement the tariff would take effect on june 10 until such time as illegal migrants coming through mexico and into our country stop trump said in a twitter post on thursday night he warned that the levy would gradually increase until the illegal immigration problem is remedied at which time the tariff will be removed the tariffs could rise as high as 25 on oct 1 trump said in a statement released by the white house the move which has major implications for american automakers and other companies with production south of the border and the u s economy as a whole represents trump s latest expansion of his trade wars it comes just days after he removed steel tariffs on mexico that had caused retaliation against u s farm products it also marries two of his signature issues trade and immigration as he ramps up his campaign for re election in 2020 markets react the mexican peso weakened by as much as 3 after trump s tweets while investors fled to the safest assets as concerns over new trade conflicts mounted the yen strengthened and s p 500 index futures tumbled heading for their worst week since the global rout in december german bund yields sank to a record as investors sought havens auto stocks were pummeled in european trading with fiatchrysler down 4 6 initial reaction from mexican officials was measured with president andres manuel lopez obrador saying in a letter to trump posted on twitter that i don t want confrontation lopez obrador said his foreign minister and other officials would visit washington the following day to seek agreement and added that he s not a coward and is acting on principles jesus seade mexico s undersecretary of foreign relations for north america told reporters in mexico city thursday at a previously scheduled event that the country won t retaliate before discussing the matter with the u s but the tariff threat he added if turned into reality would be extremely serious economists warned the move could hurt both countries mexico s exports to the u s account for about four fifths of total overseas shipments or about 28 of its gross domestic product according to bloomberg chief economist tom orlik for the u s economy 5 tariffs on 346 billion of mexican imports means a price tag of about 17 billion which rises to 87 billion if the taxes increase to 25 american consumers will feel the impact more than they did with the china tariffs as price increases for items like food are more directly observable orlik said to impose the potential tariffs trump said he s invoking authorities under the international emergency economic powers act a tool that s used to impose treasury sanctions analysts and lawyers raised questions about the legality of using it in this context this is a misuse of presidential tariff authority and counter to congressional intent republican senator chuck grassley of iowa said in a statement thursday i support nearly every one of president trump s immigration policies but this is not one of them iowa s other republican senator joni ernst also criticized trump s move while i support the need for comprehensive border security and a permanent fix to illegal immigration this isn t the right path forward she said in a statement friday i m asking the president to reconsider and for democrats to work with us to find a solution to the humanitarian crisis at our southern border illegal immigration trump made curtailing undocumented immigration a centerpiece of his presidency and campaign he ran in 2016 on promises to build a border wall to keep out migrants and declared a national emergency to tap federal funds for construction after congress didn t provide as much money as the president demanded this month u s customs and border protection said in a tweet that it had apprehended 45 large groups of migrants that included more than 7 900 individuals on wednesday the agency said it stopped 1 036 people south of downtown el paso texas the largest group of undocumented immigrants it ever encountered according to a customs and border protection statement the tariff move came the same day that trump presented notice to congress to pass his renegotiated version of the north american free trade agreement which has allowed tariff free trade with mexico and canada since it came into effect in the 1990s the administration said thursday s plan to increase tariffs on its southern neighbor was not linked to trump s nafta replacement the united states mexico canada agreement which the white house is presenting as his no 1 legislative agenda item acting white house chief of staff mick mulvaney said on a call with reporters thursday night that the potential tariffs aren t part of a trade dispute but about the immigration problem he added that if the white house finds enough cooperation from mexico over the coming weeks the tariffs will either not take effect or will be lifted swiftly acting homeland security secretary kevin mcaleenan laid out what he called key opportunities for enhanced partnership with mexico that could spare the country from increased duties mcaleenan listed the need for mexico to step up its security efforts at its border with guatemala a crackdown on transnational criminal organizations and more cooperation and alignment on asylum policy if the u s imposes the tariffs it will be violating nafta as well as world trade organization commitments said kenneth smith ramos who was mexico s chief negotiator for the usmca when it was negotiated with the u s and canada last year under nafta you cannot increase tariffs unless there are trade remedy investigations or something that is allowed under the agreement he said so it would be a clear market access violation what bloomberg s economists say the read across from mexico to china will add to concerns that talks between washington d c and beijing are going nowhere mexico negotiated revisions to nafta only to be hit with sweeping higher tariffs other countries including china will be taking note perhaps concluding that negotiated agreements with the u s are of little worth chang shu yuki masujima tom orlikclick here for more insight rufus yerxa president of the national foreign trade council a business group representing u s companies said the move was a huge blow to the american economy and casts serious doubt on passage of the new trade deal there goes usmca he said what trading partner is ever going to trust this administration to honor deals with the move to impose tariffs trump is reaching for one of his favorite policy tools to pursue a broader policy goal but he also faces risks of a backlash with polls showing the import taxes he has imposed on goods from china and elsewhere are not popular this is a dramatic escalation that will likely make it impossible for mexico to continue cooperating with this administration on trade or on controlling asylum flows from central america said edward alden a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations mexico has negotiated in good faith throughout on the usmca and has tried to work with the administration on migration unless this tariff is quickly reversed it will kill cooperation on both

on the 18th of august 2018 imran khan took the oath of office and promised to give the nation just about every good thing that it could imagine the wish list included the construction of five million new homes within his first 100 days discovering new tourist destinations swiftly recovering 200 billion of looted wealth and creating 10 million new jobs during his first term in other words he would create an islamic welfare state nine months into imran s tenure none of these promises have been realized three months ago the world bank noted that leading economic indicators were suggesting that a contraction in demand had begun large scale manufacturing which accounts for 65 percent of overall industrial output contracted by 2 3 percent between july january fy19 in agriculture four of the five major crops have witnessed a y o y decline in production due to water shortages and a decline in production area the exchange rate has continued to depreciate demand side pressures and higher fuel prices inflationary pressures have increased and average headline inflation reached 6 8 percent in the period between july 2018 and march 2019 current account deficit cad reached 3 3 percent of gdp in jul feb fy19 compared to 3 7 percent in jul feb fy18 overall imports contracted by 1 6 percent y o y but exports also declined by 0 1 percent y o y in spite of the exchange rate depreciation by mid january international reserves had fallen to us 6 6 billion or 1 3 months of imports with short term financing from the kingdom of saudi arabia united arab emirates and china reserves increased to us 10 5 billion or 2 0 months of imports by end march 2019 meanwhile the government continues to negotiate a support package with the international monetary fund large increases in debt servicing and defense expenditures resulted in higher fiscal deficit in h1 fy19 which reached 2 7 percent of gdp compared to 2 2 percent in h1 fy18 the fy19 fiscal deficit is projected between 6 8 7 0 percent of gdp a slippage of 2 7 2 9 percentage points compared to the budgeted target it concluded growth is projected to decelerate in fy19 and fy20 as the government tightens fiscal and monetary policies in late april and early may the international monetary fund imf visited pakistan and concluded pakistan is facing a challenging economic environment with lackluster growth elevated inflation high indebtedness and a weak external position decisive policies and reforms together with significant external financing are necessary to reduce vulnerabilities faster increase confidence and put the economy back on a sustainable growth path with stronger private sector activity and job creation imf has agreed in theory to provide a three year extended fund facility in the amount of 6 billion over three fiscal years beginning with fy20 and running through fy22 economist kaisar bengali said that the imf has a single point agenda in pakistan and that is to privatize all the assets which will lead to large scale unemployment just about all the nation s leading economists have criticized the imf loan s akbar zaidi author of the leading text on the economy of pakistan said that this was the worst imf program pakistan has ever signed adding that all imf programs are bad he noted this is the worst another economist of note kaisar bengali said that the imf has a single point agenda in pakistan and that is to privatize all the assets which will lead to large scale unemployment dr bengali added that the world bank and the imf are now in total control of pakistan s economy he said that the finance minister dr hafeez shaikh was being obstinate because he knows he is just answerable to washington he said the economy is failing because non productive expenditures such as the creation of a ministry of national reconciliation have reached unprecedented heights equally critical was dr ashfaque khan since interest payments and defense expenditures cannot be cut the axe of spending will fall on developmental expenditures dr khan added that the imf program will bring more harm than good to the economy echoing dr bengali s sentiments he said the international financial institutions are in total control he said there was a serious conflict of interest since pakistan s economic team was drawn from the same institutions with which it was getting the loans what will be the specific impact of the imf loan on pakistan dr hafiz pasha shahid kardar and muhammad imran pki henceforth have answered that question in a recent paper their prognostications all grim are based on simulations with the author s macro econometric model of pakistan pki say that the over arching goal of the imf program is to lower the budget and trade deficits the imf program will provide 6 billion to pakistan over three years beginning in fy20 and running through fy22 but before the money will be provided several pre conditions will have to be met in particular loan payments due to china saudi arabia and the uae will need to be rescheduled pki estimate that these liabilities amount to 18 billion over two years once the imf provides the loan it will require that the budget deficit currently at 2 of gdp be reduced sharply it should fall to 0 6 in the first year of the program in the second year it should turn intoa surplus in the third year that surplus has to amount to nearly 1 of gdp the other requirement is a reduction in the current account deficit which currently stands at 19 billion or 6 1 of gdp it will need to be lowered to under 2 in the next three fiscal years pki project the following impacts of the imf loan the investment rate was 16 4 of gdp in fy18 it is expected to fall to 15 in fy19 and to further drop to 14 5 in fy20 inflation which was 3 9 in fy18and is currently estimated at 8 2 and could reach double digits 16 in fy20 the number of people below the poverty line will rise by 9 million and the number of unemployed will rise by 51 between fy19 and fy20 the unemployment rate in fy21 will be just under 8 this contrasts with pti s promise of creating 2 million jobs annually for a total of 10 million in five years when all is said and down pakistan s gdp measured in dollar terms will display negative growth in fys18 20 such a bleak outcome will contrast sharply with the progress achieved under the previous government of course these are just model projections but what happens if they are realized the pti will be dealt a body blow those who installed imran in office will begin looking for a scapegoat the writer can be reached at ahmadfaruqui

president trump s threatened tariffs on mexico have the potential to affect as much as 360 billion in goods and would represent his biggest imposition to date of such duties on a u s trading partner the tariffs proposed to start on june 10 would apply to all imports from mexico hitting sectors that previously had little exposure to the administration s aggressive trade initiatives including importers of autos crude oil and fruits and vegetables the tariffs would escalate by 5 percentage points each month reaching 25 by october the administration said unless mexico takes unspecified actions to reduce the number of migrants arriving at the u s border major industries would be pulled into the trade fray the duties would hit 34 billion of passenger cars 34 billion of trucks and buses 14 billion of crude oil and 14 billion of fruits and vegetables all items that the u s doesn t import at substantial volumes from china if carried to completion it would be mr trump s most dramatic move on the trade front to date larger than his tariffs on washing machines or solar panels or steel or aluminum or any of the tranches of tariffs against china so far the administration has imposed 25 tariffs on roughly 250 billion of chinese imports although there too it has threatened to add roughly 300 billion of goods to its tariff lists the tariffs could potentially be devastating for mexico where exports are equivalent to more than one third of gross domestic product four fifths of mexico s exports go to the u s trade touches everything said carlos véjar a trade attorney and partner at holland knight in mexico city if not the heart it s the principal vein of the economy s circulatory system the u s announcement sent the peso down sharply in friday trading mexico responded with calls for talks to address u s concerns on immigration and it has yet to retaliate with tariffs of its own but should the trump administration follow through on its threat mexico would most certainly respond with tariffs targeted to exact maximum political damage when the u s imposed steel and aluminum tariffs on mexico in 2018 at the height of the renegotiation of the north american free trade agreement mexico retaliated with tariffs against some 3 billion worth of u s goods including steel pork cheese and apples industries often concentrated in areas controlled by mr trump s republican party for the u s mr trump s action is three pronged affecting the economy via direct tariff collections via the indirect effects on stock markets and business confidence and investment and via its potential to scuttle the trade deal signed last year but not yet ratified between mexico canada and the u s as is the case with mr trump s previous round of tariffs the direct effect at first is small a 5 tariff on all mexican imports last year would have brought in about 17 3 billion from u s importers a rounding error in a 21 trillion economy outside of the industries most directly affected by trade the u s economy has remained strong job growth driven largely by professional services health care and hospitality has remained robust but the closer industries are to the tariffs the more they are affected manufacturing growth has slowed to nearly a halt in recent months the federal reserve s measure of manufacturing output fell 0 5 in april in the sector of trade transportation and utilities the u s has lost jobs over the past three months if the tariffs eventually rise to 25 the economic impact becomes more substantial tariffs of that scale against all mexican goods would reduce the u s growth rate by 0 7 percentage point in 2020 according to gregory daco chief u s economist of oxford economics by raising costs on businesses and consumers and disrupting supply chains because u s exports are so important to mexico it could potentially push that country into recession he said with the stimulus effect from tax cuts and deficit spending also fading over time the u s growth rate could fall below 1 next year mr daco estimated the tariffs also rattle financial markets the dow jones industrials were down sharply friday with shares of auto makers and their suppliers among the biggest losers and as trade tensions linger business and market confidence is dented companies increasingly pull back on making big investment decisions global trade flows fall and manufacturing slows this indirect effect is hard to judge said roberto perli a partner at cornerstone macro llc but it would be naive to think there won t be an effect and that only mexico has something to lose from all this fears of a growing trade dispute are rippling among american consumers according to a report released friday the university of michigan s consumer sentiment index fell at the end of may from its reading earlier in the month as respondents said the prospect of higher prices brought on by the trump administration s tariffs dented their optimism as a result consumers said conditions were less favorable for buying appliances or other large household durable goods that could hold down household spending in the coming months even if a deal is quickly reached with mexico which seems plausible the damage to business confidence could be lasting with consequences that might still require a fed response said michael feroli chief u s economist at jpmorgan chase co mr feroli predicts the fed will cut interest rates twice this year to mitigate what would otherwise occur to growth business groups were quick to warn that the biggest economic impact of the tariffs could happen if mr trump s action torpedoes the u s mexico canada agreement which the three nations agreed to last year but that faces a difficult road to ratification usmca would govern the rules of trade for more than 1 2 trillion in goods that flow among the three countries every year while china is the largest single source of u s imports total goods trade with china stands at about 660 billion about half the total trade which would be covered by the renegotiated nafta imposing unilateral tariffs on mexico would be a grave error the business roundtable an association of the chief executives of blue chip u s corporations said in a statement duty free north american trade they said supports 12 million american jobs source dow jones

kiyoshi ota pool getty images in tokyo this week donald trump had a bad case of china on the brain best as japan s shinzo abe tried be couldn t quite hold the u s president s attention neither sumo nor golf nor an audience with the new emperor nor a naval base visit could distract u s president trump from his china bashing habit one likely reason the chinese yuan though president xi jinping doesn t tweet his sliding currency is trolling trump in tantalizing ways the question is whether the yuan s slide to 7 versus the u s dollar triggers trump to intensify his trade war odds are it will only xi s government can say whether it sanctions the biggest monthly yuan retreat since july 2018 at least on the surface beijing officials are fighting the trend take guo shuqing china s lead banking and insurance official who warns that traders shorting the yuan will inevitably suffer from a huge loss as chinese growth slows possibly even into the 5 range a more competitive exchange rate might be a welcome dynamic say economists at bank of america merrill lynch beijing could use all the stabilizers it can find as trump s tariffs throw sand in the gears of the all important export engine but guo s line in the foreign exchange sand makes sense on a couple of levels first china inc s huge and rising debt load the roughly 1 3 trillion of dollar denominated debt coming due over the next 12 months is greater than beijing s holdings of u s treasury debt the more that yuan slides the more expensive that debt is to service and the more likely big mainland companies are to default that leaves chinese officials with a devilishly difficult decision they can let companies fail and stomach the resulting chaos in markets including big stock losses at the shanghai and shenzhen exchanges or they can bail out companies denting xi s promise to let market forces play a decisive role in reform efforts this would reward bad behavior which investors call moral hazard second the risk of trolling trump in the days before trump landed in tokyo on may 25 trump hiked taxes on 200 billion of chinese goods to 25 from 10 his white house effectively barred huawei technologies from doing business in the world s biggest economy he threatens to tax all goods china ships america s way just over 500 billion annually he also has previewed a 25 duty on imports of cars and auto parts ap photo evan vucci clearly bowing to trump s mercantilism isn t in xi s dna it s the economic version of an immovable object versus an unstoppable force xi isn t just the strongest chinese leader in generations he s also a leader who knows he ll be around long after trump leaves the white house whether that s in 2021 or 2025 but then provoking trump isn t in xi s interest either letting the yuan weaken past 7 would increase the odds trump s treasury department will label beijing a manipulator adding a currency war to the trade battle on wednesday the treasury secretary steven mnuchin reminded china what s at stake though mnuchin didn t slap the m word of the yuan he added singapore malaysia and vietnam to washington s currency watchlist it seemed a bit gratuitous considering trump s own attacks on the federal reserve to cut interest rates that is until you consider the common thread countries with deep and deepening china trade links shinzo abe s japan also on the treasury s watchlist now ships more goods to china than the u s so does moon jae in s south korea which is also on the list looked at through this prism mnuchin firing bow shots at singapore malaysia and vietnam fits a trumpian pattern the yuan s 2 5 drop in may is coming just ahead of trump s planned chat with xi at next month s group of 20 summit in osaka the trajectory could have trump upping the pressure in the weeks ahead economists at citigroup for example think the yuan breaking the 7 level will trigger a stock selloff hence talk beijing might intervene in markets to cap the yuan this it s worth noting is the third time since 2015 that speculators tested china s exchange rate tolerance trump s trade war makes this time the most dangerous count kyle bass among short sellers assuming beijing will hold the line earlier this month the hayman capital hedge fund manager disclosed that he exited a long held bet against the yuan one possible reason it s gotten tougher to trade the yuan offshore that makes shorting china very expensive bass also may see 7 as xi s limit for yuan weakness this currency war risk has tokyo on guard though abe and trump just shared a glorious bromantic experience in tokyo trump has zero tolerance for a weaker yen that s quite a downer to abe a 30 depreciation was the main driver behind japan s longest expansion since the 1980s that run is now ending thanks to trump s tariffs abe like xi would risk a trump tantrum as the dollar moves higher as trump s political and legal jeopardy increases at home the odds of him lashing out abroad wagging the proverbial dog are increasing officials from venezuela to iran can attest to that so can xi s china which is loath to provoke a fresh trumpian attack that shakes world markets

washington the mexican government tried to defuse a major trade conflict with washington on friday saying that the two sides would meet in washington next week for high level discussions after president trump threatened punishing sanctions related to the migrant surge at the border the rushed meeting comes amid a chaotic 48 hours in which trump defied numerous aides and ordered them to impose tariffs on mexico because he felt the united states southern neighbor wasn t doing enough to stem the flow of migrants across the border trump s tariff decision shocked lawmakers business leaders and investors in part because it was the second trade war the president had launched against a major economic partner in the span of 21 days several weeks ago trump began charging large tariffs against 200 billion in chinese imports those costs are paid by u s importers and then often passed along to u s consumers mexico s foreign minister marcelo ebrard tweeted that he would lead the mexican delegation while secretary of state mike pompeo would represent the u s side the summit to resolve the u s dispute with our country will be on wednesday in washington ebrard said we will be firm and defend the dignity of mexico ebrard spoke earlier friday with pompeo and jared kushner trump s adviser and son in law about the issue according to another ebrard tweet the process of negotiation is beginning said the mexican official advertisement however it s unclear if white house officials share the same sense of optimism that a resolution could be swiftly reached trump won t even be in washington for the summit as he s scheduled to spend the week in europe that will leave mexican officials to negotiate with trump s advisers something that other foreign leaders have said is unproductive because the president often ignores their recommendations on thursday trump announced he would slap a 5 percent tariff beginning june 10 against all goods entering the united states from the southern border a surcharge that would hit millions of products like cars machinery fruits and vegetables trump promised the tariffs would escalate each month until mexico stopped migrants from crossing into the united states he followed this announcement with a series of twitter posts on friday that attacked mexico democrats and decades of foreign policy for what he alleged created a pipeline of migrants who brought drugs and crime into u s cities his twitter posts hit on so many themes that it was unclear what precisely he was demanding in exchange for waiving the penalties white house officials also could not articulate what trump wanted mexico to do aside from simply stopping migrants from crossing the border the tariff is about stopping drugs as well as illegals trump wrote the political and economic consequences of the tariffs could be severe some of trump s top economic advisers treasury secretary steven mnuchin and u s trade representative robert lighthizer raised concerns that the tariffs could imperil an overhaul of the 1994 north american free trade agreement meanwhile some business groups scrambled friday to consider asking a federal judge to intervene arguing that trump lacked the legal authority to impose tariffs unilaterally in such a fashion advertisement there s a real risk that it could spiral into something that is not pretty said carlos pascual who served as a u s ambassador to mexico during the obama administration democrats have begun to more directly challenge trump s adversarial approach to trade policy particularly his penchant for using tariffs to try and exert leverage sen kamala harris d calif who is running for president in 2020 said the cost of these tariffs is borne by american consumers not the countries trump is seeking to punish this is about taxing american consumers she said in an interview friday with noticias telemundo people are going to have to pay more for washing machines pay more for clothing pay more for shampoo when we look at the trade policy he is conducting in terms of china now with mexico it s going to result in people here paying billions of dollars more a year for consumer products mexican officials appeared initially stunned by the decision as they had worked with the white house last year to rewrite nafta and thought relations had improved earlier on friday ebrard wrote on twitter that the treatment of mexico is unfair and does not make economic sense to anyone ebrard added that mexico is the main trading partner of the united states what they receive from our country are essential goods and services productivity the flow of migrants from central america and other countries or the high consumption of narcotics are not the responsibility of mexico advertisement some white house officials including trade adviser peter navarro saw the tariffs as a clever way to force mexico to negotiate a way to stem border crossings after complaints for months that the mexican government wasn t doing enough but the tension raised the prospect of a prolonged standoff between the united states and mexico and economic experts warned that it could drive up prices on thousands of products and testing the economies in both nations it will be virtually impossible for many companies to quickly divert production of items they import from mexico to escape the higher fees the united states has never issued blanket tariffs against another country in the way trump has proposed and his legal authority is untested but confronting mexico over migration has been one of the most consistent themes of his political rise and he often pivots back to it as a way to rally his base as he did before the 2018 midterm elections despite trump s efforts to build a wall along the border and crack down on migration economic ties between the united states and mexico have only strengthened u s companies imported 346 5 billion in goods from mexico last year the supply chains between the united states and mexico have been forged over decades and were drawn closer by the 1994 north american free trade agreement many major manufacturers including ford caterpillar whirlpool and polaris make products in mexico and then ship items to the united states as the stock market slumped business groups reliant on imports from mexico scrambled to come up with a response senate finance committee chairman charles e grassley r iowa decried the tariffs as a misuse of presidential power and some companies were considering asking a federal court to intervene this is such a negative impact for the american economy and american families and we have no choice but to explore every option to push back said neil bradley executive vice president and chief policy officer at the u s chamber of commerce advertisement trump has expressed fury that his aides have not been able to stem a surge in migration across the mexico border many of the migrants are central americans coming from honduras and other impoverished countries and trump has blamed the mexican government for not doing more to prevent people from entering the united states even as lawmakers business groups and foreign leaders expressed alarm senior white house officials showed no sign of backing down or cowing under the blowback acting white house chief of staff mick mulvaney told reporters thursday evening that mexico s compliance with the new tariff threat would be done on an ad hoc basis navarro told cnbc on friday that mexico was exporting illegal aliens to the u s and that it had to stop if you look at it from an investor s point of view and a corporate point of view what we have in mexico is the export one of their high exports of illegal aliens and it s a criminal enterprise navarro said navarro s appearance was notable as he has been one of the biggest proponents of an adversarial trade policy that bucks foreign leaders other top economic advisers including mnuchin and national economic council director larry kudlow have privately urged a more cautious approach in the trade disputes they had not publicly commented on the mexico tariffs as of midday friday trump has designed the tariffs against imports from mexico and china in a way that makes them increasingly punitive over time white house officials believe the constant threat of more severe penalties should serve as a way to eventually force concessions advertisement just a month ago it appeared that economic relations with both countries had improved markedly but that all changed may 5 that s when trump announced he would impose large tariffs on chinese imports and three weeks later he turned his attention to mexico over that span the dow jones industrial average has fallen more than 1 200 points or 5 percent the mexican peso lost 3 4 percent against the dollar on friday as investors tried to price the fallout the u s economy relies heavily on imports from china but it is much more interconnected with suppliers in mexico making the impact of tariffs hard to absorb matthew slaughter dean of the tuck school of business at dartmouth college said the tariffs against mexico could quickly lead to the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs in the united states because of how interwoven the two economies have become starting to levy tariffs on mexico is like levying tariffs on texas said slaughter who was a member of the white house council of economic advisers during the george w bush administration lawmakers from both parties questioned the white house s tactics and sen rob portman r ohio said the surprising announcement could make it much harder for the white house to win congressional support an overhaul of nafta later this year democrats meanwhile accused trump is abusing trade tactics to fulfill campaign promises that have proved elusive donald trump has no credibility when it comes to america s national security and no coherent plan when it comes to trade sen ron wyden d

yields which anchor euro zone borrowing costs at record lows evaporating inflation expectations a u s china trade war that could soon spill into europe and worries about italy all mean ecb chief mario draghi should stick to his trademark dovish tone the bank will also have new economic forecasts to chew over 4 the albatross the u s federal reserve holds a two day conference in chicago where central bank insiders will huddle with private sector economists to debate how the fed might tweak things to better meet its dual mandate of stable inflation and full employment fed brains have been flummoxed by the apparent breakdown in the relationship between employment and prices and by their inability to coax inflation up to their 2 target for any length of time since establishing that target in 2011 the fed has managed to meet it only a handful of times and with the trade war ratcheting up it is again drifting out of reach when unemployment was last this low half a century ago both headline inflation and core inflation stripping out food and energy costs were far higher than they are today it s far from certain what will emerge from chair jerome powell s framework review initiative but it is clear that fed officials are fretful of losing the confidence of consumers and markets in their ability to steer inflation 5 man of action there are those who talk and those who act italian deputy prime minister matteo salvini has been quoted as saying during his one year in office salvini has certainly shown he can talk now markets may be find out if he s also a man of action emboldened by european parliamentary elections in which his far right party got a third of the votes salvini is threatening to tear up eu fiscal rules he argues the result gives his party a mandate to push through tax cuts and fight eu budget rules doing that would end the budget truce with the european commission after less than six months the rome brussels standoff will escalate after june 5 if the commission decides to start disciplinary steps against italy for failing to rein in debt it could impose fines as high as 8 7 billion euros we may also learn soon if salvini intends to dissolve his coalition with the 5 star movement and call snap elections something he has so far ruled out all that has put markets on high alert shares in italian banks have fallen to their lowest since september 2016 italian bonds sold off after the election and yield spreads over german yields have widened approaching last november s 300 bps the risk is that worsening debt metrics trigger credit rating downgrades in coming months that would raise bond yields further hurting italian banks if salvini and the commission do act buckle up for more turbulence reporting by sujata rao dhara ranasinghe and

central bank weekly talking points as the us china trade war has escalated the pboc has reverted to boosting the usdcnh exchange rate to offset the impact of the trump tariffs central banks like the boj and snb have to be more clever in trying to intervene in markets unlike the pboc meanwhile if the fed or the ecb were to act it would likely be along the interest rate channel rather than directly in fx markets looking for longer term forecasts on the us dollar check out the dailyfx trading guides trade tensions are rising in every corner of the globe at the center of every issue seems to be the united states be they issues with china the european union canada or mexico as the specter of trade wars rises we ve started to see policymakers take steps some concrete others less so in order to shore up their economies from downside risks not all central banks are created equally however and therefore the tactics that they ve used they re currently using and they will use in the future will all differ slightly people s bank of china reverts to currency intervention the people s bank of china is unique relative to g7 or developed economies central banks insofar as it does not respect the non direct fx intervention policy followed elsewhere accordingly usdcnh has become one of the most reliable tools for distilling sentiment about the us china trade war we ve previously detailed how a chinese yuan depreciation can effectively offset the negative economic impact of the trump tariffs read more chinese yuan at 7 00 barrier the most important level for currency markets other degrees of central bank interference with other central banks bound to no direct intervention in fx markets policymakers at some of the major central banks need to be creative in how they approach markets due to the soft growth and inflation environment that persists in countries like japan and switzerland for example market participants are well versed in the knowledge that interest rates maintained by the bank of japan and swiss national bank will be staying at or below zero for an extended period in turn surprise actions like what the snb did with the eurchf floor in september 2011 and january 2015 tend to be the most effective way to impact markets how will the fed respond to trade wars but for central banks like the federal reserve or european central bank there is too much global reliance on the stability of asset prices in order to dramatically surprise market participants instead these central banks move at a more glacial pace once every three months new growth inflation and jobs forecasts are produced that yield guidance on the forward path of interest rates policy is more predictable if the fed is going to get involved in trade wars then it is highly likely that it will do so along the interest rate route rather than directly intervening in usdcnh like the pboc or making a surprise policy announcement akin to the boj or snb to this end traders would be wise to watch how us rates markets have evolved in recent days as trade war concerns have skyrocketed fed funds pricing two potential rate cuts in 2019 the probability of a rate cut in 2019 has increased in a materially significant over the past week ahead of the may fed meeting there was a 68 chance of a 25 bps rate cut by the end of the year now those odds have risen to 91 in fact fed funds futures are

ireland denmark sweden and qatar venezuela remains anchored to the bottom of the ranking hit by inflation poor access to credit and a weak economy the resurgent asia pacific economies come as us economic growth at the start of 2019 was slightly slower than originally reported despite solid overall growth business investment in plant and equipment was its weakest since late 2015 in the us but it has remained robust despite president donald trump s extended government shutdown according to new data released yesterday the new estimate left trump s economic scorecard largely intact for the first three months of the year when growth usually slackens giving him with a potential boost ahead of next year s presidential elections gdp growth in the january march quarter was revised down to 3 1 per cent compared to the 3 2 per cent growth reported last month according to the commerce department s updated report latest figures the new commerce department estimate puts the first three months of 2019 at 3 1 per cent growth slightly above the trend but puts 2019 as a whole on an estimated 2 3 per cent the revised data showed american companies spent less on equipment and software but exports rose and consumers bought more cars than previously thought and even with the downward revision to growth which matched economists expectations it was still the hottest first quarter since 2015 and came with rosier new estimates for factory building and manufacturing activity which were helped by a drop in oil imports but economists do not think the momentum can be maintained in the second quarter especially given troubling indicators in other economic reports there were worrying signs in the latest gdp data including the second straight quarterly drop in corporate profits which took their biggest tumble in more than three years company earnings fell 65 4billion compared to the final quarter of 2018 the weakest showing since the end of 2015 after falling 9 7billion at the end of 2018 but for financial services companies revenues rose offsetting some of the steep decline late last year possibly reflecting wall street s strong run in the first quarter the commerce department also trimmed estimates for worker pay and inflation adjusted disposable income which declined from 2018 suggesting consumers may have less money to spend in the second quarter and amid the escalating trade war with china other signs of weakness persisted including a downward revision to a key measure of inflation the personal consumption expenditures price index or pce gdp remained fairly strong but core pce prices were even weaker than before and income data were relatively weak as well jim o sullivan of high frequency economics said in a research note while exports were broadly higher the report showed imports were still at their lowest in more than six years pointing to weaker demand and suggesting the economy could be running out of steam and though consumer spending and business investment were revised upward both were sharply slower than in the final months of 2018 business spending on fixed assets like factories and equipment was the softest since the end of 2015 chris low of ftn financial pointed to the weakness as a troubling signal for growth in the rest of the year this is the core of gdp consisting of household and business consumption and investment the driving force behind sustainable growth he said it sets the tone for future growth officials say the extended five week government shutdown early in the year when trump unsuccessfully demanded congress fund construction of a wall along the southern us border likely shaved about 0 3 percentage points from growth in the first quarter the shutdown immobilized major federal services on which much of the economy depends such as oil drilling permits food inspection and ice breaking at commercial ports advertisement the commerce department will have another chance to revise the first quarter result next month as more data become available

there s no question that many farmers are struggling this year with incomes down and bankruptcies up though some of the more dire reports on the farm sector recorded in the media are exaggerated what is indisputable is that prices for major commodities such as corn are on a downward trend and are significantly lower than they were less than a decade ago when prices were at or near record highs it s natural to blame any declines in the farm economy on the tariff war with china the trade dispute has certainly hurt the farm sector as the higher chinese tariffs on american agriculture has reduced demand for their crops especially the farm belt states of the midwest even president donald trump himself has admitted that the trade war has hurt farmers which is why he wants to send some of the money raised by his tariffs to the farmers directly but the daily headlines of a tariff war have overshadowed what might be an even bigger and longer term problem for farmers tight monetary policy at the federal reserve which has squeezed commodity prices across the board over the past year an index of all commodity prices including everything from oil to copper to timber to soybeans has recorded a price reduction of roughly 10 eight of the 10 major agriculture commodities have been falling in price why is that happening it isn t good weather or bumper crops because the losses are being felt across regions and hitting almost all the major crops one explanation for the farmers woes is tight money we know from historical experience that when money is loose and the printing presses shower the economy with cheap dollars commodity prices soar as in the 1970s when grocery bills soared when money is excessively tight as it is now commodity prices fall when almost all of the commodities from corn to copper to timber start to fall in price at the same time it is a pretty good signal that our monetary system is out of whack farmers are often the frontline victims of commodity deflation the extreme example of course was the great depression when farm bankruptcies skyrocketed with thin profit margins to begin with in a highly competitive global food market many farmers are being unnecessarily hurt by having to swallow an 8 reduction in prices following a similar decline last year of course free markets not government subsidies or fed monetary policy should determine which farmers should stay in business and which will fail the way to reduce artificial price fluctuations in the agricultural sector of our economy and get quick relief for our farmers is for the fed to increase dollar liquidity into our high flying american economy this would be an effective and overdue way for our nation s farmers to experience greater profits this reflation policy makes sense now given that the threat of economy wide inflation at this stage is minimal to nonexistent the dollar is strong thanks to world demand for dollars and the growth in output due to tax cuts and deregulation is pushing out the supply of goods and services which is deflationary not inflationary there isn t a whiff of inflation in consumer prices except for education and health care the wall street journal reports that the fed has undershot its inflation target 2 growth in the consumer price index for four months running the fed is hesitant to cut interest rates because it believes wrongly that a booming economy causes inflation which is a long ago dead keynesian idea a modest reflation would put some extra juice into the farm sector this would put added pressure on the chinese to make a deal with the trump administration that deal would press for the elimination of china s punitive tariffs on our farm products and open up markets to other made in america products this would also counter the brazen chinese strategy of meddling in american elections by intentionally targeting tariffs on farm products produced by rural voters in key battle ground states in the 2020 elections america has the most productive farmers in the world so a trade agreement that ratchets down tariffs on both sides of the pacific would greatly benefit the farm belt combining that with a monetary policy by the fed that allows the economy to continue to grow without inflation would help our farmers and workers across all industries and without one dime of taxpayer assistance
a long time ago i made my peace with the machinations within the gold market there are so many angles on who wants to manipulate gold that after a while any story you pluck out of thin air becomes plausible so this week it could be the fed or china or russia or the banksters or freaking aliens at this point the longer gold languishes below the 2016 post brexit high of 1 375 the more these stories crop up frankly i m bored by them no matter how much truth there may be in them because at the end of the day i have to believe that markets are bigger than men otherwise what s the point of talking about any of this other than as some form of masochistic therapy gold is a hedge not against inflation or bond yields or any of that other stuff it is a hedge solely against the loss of confidence in political institutions that back the fiat currencies against which it is measured all of the correlations between gold and interest rates money supply figures and the rest only function within the parameters of a market convinced of future political stability once that future stability begins getting deep discounts by markets and those relationships falter gold consolidates bides its time and then pops spectacularly at that point the longs feel vindicated and the manipulation stories morph into why gold won t go to 50 000 or some other thing to sell clicks so to look at the gold market as we close may we have to assess that big picture and realize that gold is caught between two very large forces they are the collapsing confidence in major governments around the world and the reality of falling dollar liquidity as represented by rising short term rates and falling long term rates add to this president donald trump s daily threats of tariffs and sanctions to derail a global economy already in trouble against this backdrop and increasingly aggressive capital control coming from both the u s and the eu the big story of the past couple of years in the gold market has been the wider demand coming from central banks not just russia the russians continue to buy at an ever increasing rate sometimes exceeding its own domestic production this week we saw both the philippines and serbia join in the list of buyers it may not be much but it s indicative that those looking toward a future less reliant on the dollar need to be prepared in 2018 central banks bought 651 5 tonnes of gold nearly 15 of total demand and that demand isn t slowing down in 2019 if anything it s still rising as the dollar rises and gold remains trapped below the breakout level central banks looking to protect themselves are finally seeking to diversify their holdings since their stock of u s treasuries is now at an all time high according to the latest tic report from the treasury dept in italy there is a story brewing behind the headlines of inter party fighting in the wake of the eu election results back in february a member of matteo salvini s lega tabled a bill to declare the country s gold reserves as belonging to the people not the bank of italy the unstated worry here is that in any budget fight between salvini and the eu the bank of italy could wind up being seized by the eu why because like the federal reserve the bank of italy is privately owned and the owners are the most vulnerable of italy s banks so with the ecb s powerful bail in powers it could take the step of declaring for example unicredit unsustainable on a sunday night and sell it for a dollar to deutsche bank it s not like this hasn t happened before or anything with the gold the property of the central bank and salvini s own finance minister giovanni tria stating only the ecb can use italy s gold for its monetary policy maneuvers you can see why this issue is so important if salvini tries to take italy out of the euro or issue a parallel currency internally both options he needs to leave on the table to fix italy s economy this issue seems to be off the table now but it will come back with a vengeance if things between the italians and the eu heat up as we get close to budget time in september then there s prime minister mahathir mohamad in malaysia saying it s time for a gold backed regional trade currency to use between the countries of southeast asia because of its stability versus the u s dollar this is a direct attack on trump s endless weaponization of the dollar as a means to achieve geopolitical goals he s become like the soup nazi from seinfeld no dollars for you patience around the world is wearing thin and thanks to trump s belligerence and frankly ignorance on trade issues he s got a falling stock market and a deepening yield curve inversion that is signaling recession straight ahead in this type of environment it is no wonder that gold is unsure of what to do with the world synthetically short dollars to epic proportions all rallies in gold are still sold as a means to procure dollars without upsetting other forex markets up until the last day of may the safe haven flows have all been into the bond markets because they can be posted as collateral while gold still floats at a discount as well there was this belief that trump wasn t completely off his rocker and would eventually cut a trade deal with china but with his insane demand of a 5 per month rising tariff on mexico to get the border under control the markets are now coming to terms with the fact that there is a true mad man in the white house between mohammad s call for a new gold backed trade currency falling equity prices worldwide a rising dollar against everything except the japanese yen the recipient of carry trade unwinds as the pound and euro freefall and trump s pandering to his base on mexico gold finally put in a definitive statement that it still functions as a check on global unrest versus just being a plaything for the forex markets rallying more than 30 over the last two days in may part of the reason gold has languished has been the relative strength of the equity markets the capital flight out of europe took the early form of stronger u s equity performance versus european indexes like the german dax or the british ftse 100 this has suppressed safe haven flows into gold as the dollar rose but now that the yield curve is screaming recession economic data and corporate profits signaling we ve reached the cycle peak the fed will have to lower rates at the next meeting if not beforehand and that should light a further fire under gold and propel it back toward the breakout level of 1 375 and probably beyond money markets contributor tom luongo is the publisher of the gold goats n guns newsletter his work also is published at strategic culture foundation lewrockwell com zerohedge and russia insider a libertarian adherent to austrian economics he applies those lessons to geopolitics gold and central bank policy
global financial markets are rocked by trump s decision to use tariffs as a way to force mexico to solve border security crisis of the us 5 tariffs will be imposed in all mexico imports to us starting june 10 then gradually as trump claimed go up to 25 on october 1 the implications to some is huge as trump is now using tariffs for non economic issues it s much more than just protectionism on the other hand the never ending trade negotiations are going nowhere after the collapse and china is preparing more retaliations the positive news though is that us economy data released remain solid to

agostini invision ap immigration from central america is not new to mexico but the magnitude of it is new mexico has its own problem on how to deal with this issue enforce its laws and use the limited resources they have in order to care for all these new immigrants says joel virgen rojano the mexico economist for bnp paribas mexico s president andres manuel lopez obrador best known as amlo said mexico was indeed dealing with the massive flow of central american migrants and would prove to washington that it was doing its part amlo has also pushed for new investment in central america though investment and foreign aid has yet to stop the flow of migrants the only problem is that amlo s measures are not a short term solution rojano says amlo recently changed laws allowing for immediate temporary work permits for migrants especially for those seeking asylum the current influx of illegal crossings into the united states from mexico is overwhelming the resources of customs and border patrol and the department of homeland security over the past 21 days an average of over 4 500 people have crossed into the u s illegally or arrived at ports of entry without documents acting secretary

threat designed to pressure mexico to be a stronger partner on the immigration front the decision to do this came on the same day to ratify the new nafta trade deal so maybe this is trump telling the democrats that this is about trade and immigration says louis lau a fund manager with brandes investment partners thinking out loud maybe he feels the trade war with china didn t work well enough so he feels he has to hit mexico maybe move jobs to the u s i m a little confused right now he says mexico is not china their ability to respond to tariffs is limited economically but some market participants think they will go after agriculture products a double whammy for red states in the midwest seeing how china is doing the same i m reaching a preliminary view that trump is bad for emerging markets in general says lau no emerging market is safe from trump

s plan in his six months in office veteran leftist lopez obrador has consistently sought to deflect the u s president s barbs and avoid embroiling himself in a confrontation he predicted that trump who is also engaged in a worsening trade war with china would rectify his demand i tell all mexicans to have faith we will overcome this attitude of the u s government they will make rectifications because the mexican people don t deserve to be treated in the way being attempted lopez obrador told reporters in april trump took a step back from an earlier threat to close the southern border to

unexpected threat added to fears that escalating trade wars will push the united states and other major economies into recession the influential u s chamber of commerce business group is looking at

mexico canada agreement which is meant to replace the north american free trade agreement steep tariffs trump who has embraced protectionism as part of an america first agenda aimed at reshaping global trade ignited fears in mexico and on global financial markets on thursday when he announced he would ratchet up tariffs on mexico until the illegal immigration problem is remedied the plan would impose a 5 tariff on mexican imports starting on june 10 and increase monthly up to 25 on oct 1 such levies would deliver a heavy blow to mexico s economy which is underpinned by exports to the

one of america s top trading partners in goods mexico s main stock index was down 1 3 on friday after opening the session sharply lower and the peso currency was down more than 2 5 against the dollar foreign minister marcelo ebrard who was due to travel to washington on friday on twitter called trump s treatment of mexico unfair and said the tariffs made no economic sense for anyone but trump sought to turn up the pressure again on friday mexico makes a fortune from the u s have for decades they can easily fix this problem time for them to finally do what must be done trump wrote on twitter trump vowed frequently during his 2016 election campaign to make mexico pay for construction of a wall on the u s mexican border to curb illegal immigration but successive mexican governments have firmly rejected that idea the u s congress also refused a request from trump for 5 7 billion to help build the wall prompting him to declare a national emergency and try to divert funds from other areas of the u s government the issue is now in the courts trump and his fellow republicans say something needs to be done to stem the biggest migrant surge on the southern border in a decade u s officials say 80 000 people are being held in custody with an average of 4 500 mostly central american migrants arriving daily overwhelming the ability of border patrol officials to handle them a senior white house official said trump was particularly concerned that u s border agents apprehended a group of 1 036 migrants illegally crossing the border from mexico on wednesday officials said it was the largest single group since october before unveiling the tariff threat trump posted a video purporting to be of the crossing on his twitter feed since taking office in december mexico s lopez obrador has urged trump to help him tackle migration by promoting economic development in guatemala honduras and el salvador where most of the migrants apprehended on the u s border come from pledging to exercise great prudence in seeking a resolution to the tariff dispute the mexican president said he did not want to involve the world trade organization for now though lopez obrador again stressed the need for diplomacy on friday he has in the past offered pointed criticism of trump over migration policy he was adamant that he had the support of mexicans living in mexico and the united states lopez obrador who won election last year in a landslide in 2017 likened trump s attitude towards migrants to nazi germany s persecution of jews in a letter responding to trump s announcement on thursday lopez obrador called trump s america first policy a fallacy and accused him of turning the united states into a ghetto that stigmatized and mistreated migrants

all goods coming into our country from mexico until such time as illegal migrants coming through mexico and into our country stop the tariff will gradually increase until the illegal immigration

be short lived while directly impacting the mexican peso last seen down 2 36 for the day the broader implications for global risk appetite shouldn t be as adverse as those spurred by the us sino trade dispute however the move does leave investors wondering when trump s attention will be turned elsewhere with the european auto sector thought to be at risk while the tariffs on mexico are likely to have less of a global spillover in comparison to the us china trade dispute it is nonetheless a negative for risk sentiment as it shows that the us administration is not afraid of a multi front trade

the mexican government tried to defuse a major trade conflict with washington on friday saying that the two sides would meet in washington next week for high level discussions after president trump threatened punishing sanctions related to the migrant surge at the border the rushed meeting comes amid a chaotic 48 hours in which trump defied numerous aides and ordered them to impose tariffs on mexico because he felt the united states southern neighbor wasn t doing enough to stem the flow of migrants across the border trump s tariff decision shocked lawmakers business leaders and investors in part because it was the second trade offensive against a major economic partner that the president had launched in the span of 21 days several weeks ago trump began charging large tariffs against 200 billion in chinese imports those costs are paid by u s importers and then often passed along to u s consumers advertisement mexico s foreign minister marcelo ebrard tweeted that he would lead the mexican delegation while secretary of state mike pompeo would represent the u s side the summit to resolve the u s dispute with our country will be on wednesday in washington ebrard said we will be firm and defend the dignity of mexico ebrard spoke earlier friday with pompeo and jared kushner trump s adviser and son in law about the issue according to another ebrard tweet the process of negotiation is beginning said the mexican official however it s unclear if white house officials share the same sense of optimism that a resolution could be swiftly reached trump won t even be in washington for the summit as he s scheduled to spend the week in europe that will leave mexican officials to negotiate with trump s advisers something that other foreign leaders have said is unproductive because the president often ignores their recommendations les informo que la cumbre para resolver el diferendo de eu con nuestro país será el miércoles en washington mike pompeo encabeza delegación norteamericana este servidor la mexicana hay disposición de diálogo seremos firmes y defenderemos la dignidad de méxico marcelo ebrard c m_ebrard may 31 2019 on thursday trump announced he would slap a 5 percent tariff beginning june 10 against all goods entering the united states from the southern border a surcharge that would hit millions of products like cars machinery fruits and vegetables trump promised the tariffs would escalate each month starting july 1 reaching a maximum of 25 percent in october unless mexico stopped migrants from crossing into the united states advertisement he followed this announcement with a series of twitter posts on friday that attacked mexico democrats and decades of foreign policy for what he alleged created a pipeline of migrants who brought drugs and crime into u s cities his twitter posts hit on so many themes that it was unclear what precisely he was demanding in exchange for waiving the penalties white house officials also could not articulate what trump wanted mexico to do aside from simply stopping migrants from crossing the border the tariff is about stopping drugs as well as illegals trump wrote president trump on may 30 vowed to impose a 5 percent tariff on all goods coming from mexico unless it stopped the flow of illegal immigration to the u s video reuters the political and economic consequences of the tariffs could be severe some of trump s top economic advisers treasury secretary steven mnuchin and u s trade representative robert e lighthizer raised concerns that the tariffs could imperil an overhaul of the 1994 north american free trade agreement meanwhile some business groups scrambled friday to consider asking a federal judge to intervene arguing that trump lacked the legal authority to impose tariffs unilaterally in such a fashion advertisement there s a real risk that it could spiral into something that is not pretty said carlos pascual who served as a u s ambassador to mexico during the obama administration democrats have begun to more directly challenge trump s adversarial approach to trade policy particularly his penchant for using tariffs to try to exert leverage sen kamala d harris d calif who is running for president in 2020 said the cost of these tariffs is borne by american consumers not the countries trump is seeking to punish this is about taxing american consumers she said in an interview friday with noticias telemundo people are going to have to pay more for washing machines pay more for clothing pay more for shampoo when we look at the trade policy he is conducting in terms of china now with mexico it s going to result in people here paying billions of dollars more a year for consumer products advertisement mexican officials appeared initially stunned by the decision as they had worked with the white house last year to rewrite nafta and thought relations had improved earlier on friday ebrard wrote on twitter that the treatment of mexico is unfair and does not make economic sense to anyone share this article share ebrard added that mexico is the main trading partner of the united states what they receive from our country are essential goods and services productivity the flow of migrants from central america and other countries or the high consumption of narcotics are not the responsibility of mexico some white house officials including trade adviser peter navarro described the tariffs as a clever way to force mexico to negotiate on stemming border crossings after complaints for months that the mexican government wasn t doing enough advertisement but the tension raised the prospect of a prolonged standoff between the united states and mexico and economic experts warned that it could drive up prices on thousands of products and testing the economies in both nations it will be virtually impossible for many companies to quickly divert production of items they import from mexico to escape the higher fees the united states has never issued blanket tariffs against another country in the way trump has proposed and his legal authority is untested but confronting mexico over migration has been one of the most consistent themes of his political rise and he often pivots back to it as a way to rally his base as he did before the 2018 midterm elections despite trump s efforts to build a wall along the border and crack down on migration economic ties between the united states and mexico have only strengthened u s companies imported 346 5 billion in goods from mexico last year the supply chains between the united states and mexico have been forged over decades and were drawn closer by the 1994 north american free trade agreement many major manufacturers including ford caterpillar whirlpool and polaris make products in mexico and then ship items to the united states advertisement as the stock market slumped business groups reliant on imports from mexico struggled to come up with a response senate finance committee chairman charles e grassley r iowa decried the tariffs as a misuse of presidential power this is such a negative impact for the american economy and american families and we have no choice but to explore every option to push back said neil bradley executive vice president and chief policy officer at the u s chamber of commerce trump has expressed fury that his aides have not been able to stem a surge in migration across the mexico border many of the migrants are central americans coming from honduras and other impoverished countries and trump has blamed the mexican government for not doing more to prevent people from entering the united states advertisement even as lawmakers business groups and foreign leaders expressed alarm senior white house officials showed no sign of backing down or cowing under the blowback acting white house chief of staff mick mulvaney told reporters thursday evening that assessing mexico s compliance with the conditions of the new tariff would be done on an ad hoc basis navarro told cnbc on friday that mexico was exporting illegal aliens to the united states and that it had to stop if you look at it from an investor s point of view and a corporate point of view what we have in mexico is the export one of their high exports of illegal aliens and it s a criminal enterprise navarro said navarro s appearance was notable as he has been one of the biggest proponents of an adversarial trade policy that bucks foreign leaders other top economic advisers including mnuchin and national economic council director larry kudlow have privately urged a more cautious approach in the trade disputes they had not publicly commented on the mexico tariffs as of midday friday advertisement trump has designed the tariffs against imports from mexico and china in a way that makes them increasingly punitive over time white house officials believe the constant threat of more severe penalties should serve as a way to eventually force concessions just a month ago it appeared that economic relations with both countries had improved markedly but that all changed may 5 that s when trump announced he would impose large tariffs on chinese imports and three weeks later he turned his attention to mexico over that span the dow jones industrial average has fallen more than 1 200 points or 5 percent the mexican peso lost 3 4 percent against the dollar on friday as investors tried to price the fallout the u s economy relies heavily on imports from china but it is much more interconnected with suppliers in mexico making the impact of tariffs hard to absorb matthew slaughter dean of the tuck school of business at dartmouth college said the tariffs against mexico could quickly lead to the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs in the united states because of how interwoven the two economies have become starting to levy tariffs on mexico is like levying tariffs on texas said slaughter who was a member of the white house council of economic advisers during the george w bush administration lawmakers from both parties questioned the white house s tactics and sen rob portman r ohio said the surprising announcement could make it much harder for the white house to win congressional support an overhaul of nafta later this year democrats meanwhile accused trump is abusing trade tactics to fulfill campaign promises that have proved elusive donald trump has no credibility when it comes to america s national security and no coherent plan when it comes to trade sen ron wyden d ore said

the global growth deterioration fed markets paid little attention to comments from both the fed s clarida who was at the new york economics club and the fed s main man on bank regulation quarles who spoke at a conference in dc quarles reiterated interest rates should be used for the fed s mandate of inflation and employment goals rather than to address concerns about financial stability vice chairman clarida stated if we saw a downside risk to the outlook then that would be a factor that could call for a more accommodative policy markets are eagerly waiting for that key moment when the fed capitulates and signals rate cuts are coming fed speak will be plentiful over the next several days but markets may focus in on fed chairman jerome powell s june 4th remarks at the start of a two day fed conference in chicago while powell may be unlikely to deliver a clear message that rates will be coming down he should address the concerns to growth that are stemming from the us china trade

trump placing tariffs on all trade with mexico last night president trump announced a new round of tariffs against mexico for reasons that have nothing to do with trade itself doug mataconis 27 comments as he headed off to address the graduating class at the air force academy yesterday morning president trump said that he d have a major announcement on immigration in the near future that announcement apparently came late yesterday with what can only be described as one of the most foolish ideas ever conceived washington president trump said thursday that he would impose a 5 percent tariff on all imported goods from mexico beginning june 10 a tax that would gradually increase until the flow of undocumented immigrants across the border stopped the announcement which mr trump made on his twitter feed said the tariffs would be in place until such time as illegal migrants coming through mexico and into our country stop in a presidential statement that followed he said that tariffs would be raised to 10 percent on july 1 if the crisis persists and then by an additional 5 percent each month for three months they would remain at 25 percent until mexico acted he said an across the board tariff on all mexican goods would exact a serious toll on american consumers and corporations and is likely to generate significant opposition among businesses rufus yerxa the president of the national foreign trade council which represents the nation s largest exporters called the move a colossal blunder the president s threat escalated his immigration fight with mexico and is a significant move against an american ally that essentially dared the mexican government to risk economic catastrophe on both sides of the border if it did not capitulate to the demands of the united states president but while mr trump has made cracking down on illegal immigration a priority his announcement on thursday could derail another of his chief goals revising the north american free trade agreement with canada and mexico markets reacted quickly the mexican peso weakened against the american dollar while shares of japanese automakers fell because many of them have manufacturing facilities in mexico futures that track american stocks suggested wall street would open lower on friday previous administrations have tried to pressure the mexican government to do more to stem the flow of migrants and to combat drugs and other crime but no president has used the kind of blunt force threat that mr trump wielded on thursday night against a neighbor and an ally as critical to the american economy as mexico mexico is washington s largest trading partner sending across the border items like tomatoes cars and rugs mexico sent the united states 346 5 billion of goods last year meaning that a 5 percent tariff on those products would amount to a tax increase of more than 17 billion most of the costs would then be passed on to businesses and consumers mexico s deputy foreign minister for north america jesús seade said at a hastily arranged news conference on thursday that mr trump s announced tariffs would be disastrous and suggested mexico could retaliate against american products but in a letter to mr trump posted online president andrés manuel lópez obrador of mexico said he did not want a confrontation with his american counterpart and insisted on the need for dialogue mr trump s frustration over the rising number of illegal border crossings has steadily risen since january when democrats refused to grant him billions of dollars to build his long promised wall along the southwestern border since then he has consistently framed immigration as a national security crisis and tried different tactics to punish the countries he blames for the flow of migrants he has moved to cut off all foreign aid to countries like guatemala honduras and el salvador and threatened to completely seal off the border with mexico a move that numerous officials told him would violate american law and international treaties administration officials on thursday portrayed the president s move as a matter of national security suggesting it would take priority over other goals the situation is both a humanitarian and a border security crisis that has become a national emergency kevin mcaleenan the acting secretary of homeland security said in a conference call with reporters after the announcement echoing the messaging that mr trump has used relentlessly for the past several months white house officials were vague about what actions by mexico would satisfy mr trump enough to postpone or cancel the tariffs mr mcaleenan said the mexicans needed to do three things increase security at the border with guatemala crack down on criminal gangs that help migrants and help the united states more with asylum seekers we are going to judge success here by the number of people crossing the border and that number needs to come down substantially said mick mulvaney the acting white house chief of staff he added that the administration would judge mexico s actions on a day to day week to week basis mr mulvaney said administration officials had consulted with leadership in both chambers of congress before announcing the tariffs saying that they had talked to republicans more than we did democrats he later joked that the actual number of democrats the administration had briefed was zero here s the president s tweet announcing the new policy at which time the tariffs will be removed details from the white house to follow donald j trump realdonaldtrump may 30 2019 the white house also released a statement that if anything was less coherent than the president s tweet as everyone knows the united states of america has been invaded by hundreds of thousands of people coming through mexico and entering our country illegally this sustained influx of illegal aliens has profound consequences on every aspect of our national life overwhelming our schools overcrowding our hospitals draining our welfare system and causing untold amounts of crime gang members smugglers human traffickers and illegal drugs and narcotics of all kinds are pouring across the southern border and directly into our communities thousands of innocent lives are taken every year as a result of this lawless chaos it must end now mexico s passive cooperation in allowing this mass incursion constitutes an emergency and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the united states mexico has very strong immigration laws and could easily halt the illegal flow of migrants including by returning them to their home countries additionally mexico could quickly and easily stop illegal aliens from coming through its southern border with guatemala if mexico fails to act tariffs will remain at the high level and companies located in mexico may start moving back to the united states to make their products and goods companies that relocate to the united states will not pay the tariffs or be affected in any way over the years mexico has made massive amounts of money in its dealings with the united states and this includes the tremendous number of jobs leaving our country should mexico choose not to cooperate on reducing unlawful migration the sustained imposition of tariffs will produce a massive return of jobs back to american cities and towns remember our great country has been the piggy bank from which everybody wants only to take the difference is that now we are firmly and forcefully standing up for america s interests we have confidence that mexico can and will act swiftly to help the united states stop this long term dangerous and deeply unfair problem the united states has been very good to mexico for many years we are now asking that mexico immediately do its fair share to stop the use of its territory as a conduit for illegal immigration into our country the scope of these tariffs and the damage that they are likely to do to the american economy cannot be understated just recently mexico became our biggest trading partner surpassing china by a slight margin in terms of volume of trade last year before that it was our second largest trading partner thanks largely to economic and industrial modernization in mexico the basis for that trade has become more complex in recent years for example much as is the case with canada it has become quite common for companies such as general motors and nissan to build the cars sold in the american market in both countries with many of the parts used in cars built in the united states including parts made in mexico and vice versa furthermore imports from mexico include cars machinery fuel medical devices and other goods mexico is also our largest foreign supplier of agricultural products such as cucumbers grapes and avocados our neighbor to the south is also a major supplier of beer to the united states increased tariffs on everything that comes across the border from mexico is going to mean higher prices for all of these products and for products that they are used in furthermore imports from mexico include cars machinery fuel medical devices and other goods mexico is also our largest foreign supplier of agricultural products such as cucumbers grapes and avocados our neighbor to the south is also a major supplier of beer to the united states increased tariffs on everything that comes across the border from mexico is going to mean higher prices for all of these products and for products that they are used in this isn t the first time that president trump has used trade to lash out at one of america s closest allies and biggest trading partners of course around this same time last year for example the president revoked the exemption from the steel and aluminum tariffs that had been announced back in march that applied to american allies in europe as well as canada and mexico in doing so trump claimed that he was taking this action for national security reasons objectively speaking of course the idea that these allies are a national security threat to the united states or that we could not rely on them as a source for aluminum and steel in the event of a national emergency or military threat is absurd needless to say this didn t go over very well with our allies in europe and elsewhere canada s foreign minister called the new tariffs absurd for example and european union officials announced retaliatory tariffs against american goods it appeared that this particular dispute appeared as if it was resolved later in the year when the president announced success in the negotiation of the so called u s mexico canada agreement usmca which is essentially an updated version of the north american free trade agreement nafta an agreement that the president has spoken out against for years with the announcement of these new tariffs though it appears as if trump is creating a new showdown with a neighbor and close ally and potentially calling into question the future of the agreement he had negotiated with mexico and canada philip klein at the washington examiner calls trump s new trade policy reckless and mindbogglingly stupid first in the most direct way raising tariffs on mexico will mean a tax increase of up to 25 on american families and businesses purchasing any products from mexico one of the u s leading trade partners in 2018 americans imported 346 5 billion in goods from mexico so on that basis it would amount to a nearly 87 billion tax increase it also will punish industries that will be affected by inevitable retaliatory tariffs secondly this threat comes as the trump administration was jump starting the approval process for the united states mexico canada agreement that trump previously touted as a major trade victory but that has yet to be officially ratified this will surely disrupt that process thirdly the whole justification for the previous administration s tariffs has been that they were all part of a broader strategy to negotiate better trade deals yet in this case trump is trying to lump trade in with cracking down on illegal immigration which is a separate issue even if it could be argued there is a relationship between the two fourthly it s difficult to see how this would facilitate containing illegal mexican immigration the surest way that mexico has to reducing the desire of mexicans to leave for america is to improve the mexican economy which would be immensely more difficult in the midst of a trade war with the u s fifthly it s unclear what the metric will be for determining whether the illegal immigration problem is remedied does that mean no illegal immigration from mexico a reduction by a certain percentage i suppose we ll have to leave that to the white house staffers tasked with translating trump s insane tweets into official policy language and david fickling at bloomberg calls the idea borderline crazy clearly any such move on tariffs would rip apart the complex web of manufacturing supply chains that crisscross the mexican border many of which are as beneficial to u s jobs as mexican ones fully 36 of the value added in mexican exports comes from foreign countries much of that from america the country is the second biggest foreign buyer of u s goods with 265 billion in imports from the circular trade in car parts to the crude that gulf coast refineries import from mexico and send back in the form of gasoline and diesel there s an entire cross border economy that would be devastated by these moves more importantly though the sudden and unexpected announcement of tariffs rising as high as 25 deals hard to reverse damage to america s image as a reliable partner until a few hours ago you could be forgiven for thinking that trade relations in north america were in a pretty good place the section 232 tariffs on mexican metal imposed last year were lifted just two weeks ago the u s mexico canada agreement that president donald trump intended to replace the north american free trade agreement has been signed though it s unlikely ever to pass congress and into law rather than provide consistent policy which allows foreign governments and businesses across the world to calibrate their decisions to the prevailing environment this whipsaw diplomacy weakens america s ties with its alliesand causes capital to hunker down and wait for more predictable times forecast new orders in march fell to their lowest level since 2012 in a survey of u s businesses by the federal reserve bank of philadelphia capital spending plans have fallen sharply from their peaks when president trump took office despite robust corporate profits klein and fickling are of course absolutely correct in their assessment of this latest announcement from the president as a general rule tariffs are a bad idea because contrary to what the president apparently believes they end up being paid by american consumers and businesses and hurting the american economy if those tariffs are targeted to specific industries of course it s possible that some american based companies will benefit from reduced competition and the possibility that they can benefit from the fact that their foreign competitors will have to increase prices but it is inevitably true that the damage the tariffs will due to consumer s businesses and the economy as a whole will far outweigh any good that the tariffs might accomplish these tariffs though aren t even being imposed for economic reasons they are being imposed for entirely unrelated reasons that have nothing to do with our trade with mexico instead they are being imposed over a largely fictional concern over a surge of migrants at the u s mexican border most of them from central america where they are fleeing poverty gang violence and government crackdowns this is a supposed crisis that the president has used in the past such as in the run up to the 2018 midterm elections the during the budget negotiations that led to a five week long government shutdown in december and january and as a justification for a national emergency at the southern border the reality of this crisis of course is that this supposed flood of migrants consists mostly of women children and families fleeing conditions not dissimilar from what has led previous groups of immigrants to seek refuge in the united states more importantly imposing tariffs that in the end will hurt the united states more than mexico seems like an insane way to deal with a situation that in the end can only be dealt with on the ground in central america even leaving all of this aside as klein notes it s hard to see exactly how these tariffs are going to do anything with regard to cross border crossings that start in central america as we have seen for the past several years this flow of migrants is typically so large that there s next to nothing mexican authorities can do about it additionally there are international treaties governing the treatment of refugees that constrain nations from taking certain actions against people asserting asylum claims and both the united states and mexico are signatories to those agreements furthermore it is entirely unclear from either the president s tweet or the white house statement exactly how the united states or more specifically trump himself and his increasingly quixotic and irrational moods is going to measure how effective mexico is being at stemming the flow of migrants finally if you want to curtail immigration across the southern border it is obvious that the worst possible policy to pursue is one that in the end will weaken the economy of the nation on the other side of that border a weaker national economy in mexico will likely lead to an increase in people trying to cross the border for jobs and better economic opportunity given the fact that these tariffs won t start going into effect it s possible that we may be able to avert this disaster but it s hard to see exactly how if this trade dispute with mexico was about economic issues then its possible that the two nations could reach some sort of accord that would satisfy trump s concerns in this case though we re dealing with tariffs that are being imposed for entirely non economic reasons and more importantly for reasons that are hard to measure when it comes to effectiveness let s say for example that mexico makes some sort of pledge over the next ten days regarding how it treats these migrants will that be enough to convince trump not to impose the tariffs how will we measure if that pledge is being upheld and how do we know that this president who is known primarily for agreeing to something at one point only to change his mind days or even hours later will live up to any agreement mexico puts before him

mexico one of america s largest trading partners only amplifies investor worries about how trade tensions will disrupt business and slow global economic growth wall street was already growing concerned about the escalating trade battle with china this is just the latest worry to put on the fire for investors ryan detrick senior market strategist at lpl financial wrote in a note to clients the big question at the end of the day though is can we really fight two trade wars at the same time the united states imported 346 billion of goods from mexico last year including everything from auto parts and avocados to beer and televisions automakers which rely on mexico as a vital part of their supply chain fell sharply fiat chrysler lost 5 while general motors declined 4 and ford lost 3 parts suppliers including lear and delphi technologies also stumbled constellation brands which owns corona and modelo especial plunged nearly 7 alarming decision trump said the united states will impose a 5 tariff on all mexican imports starting on june 10 as a punishment for illegal immigrants crossing the mexican border into the united states the white house indicated the tariff would increase by increments of 5 percentage points each month until it reaches 25 in october some analysts expressed concern that trump is imposing tariffs in response to immigration problems not economic or trade ones tariffs can be thrown around as an economic bomb for anything now peter boockvar chief investment officer at bleakley advisory group wrote in a note to clients global growth rates will only continue to suffer kristina hooper chief global market strategist at invesco called it an alarming decision by the us administration to open up a new and unexpected frontier by using tariffs as a weapon beyond just trade policy markets don t like surprises and this is a big surprise hooper wrote in a note worse there were signs that the crackdown on mexico may not be part of a broader economic
