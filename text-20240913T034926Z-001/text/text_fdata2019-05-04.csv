authored by alasdair macleod via goldmoney com cyber wars and all that behind the huawei story we must not forget there is a wider financial war being waged by america against china and russia stories about china s banks being short of dollars are incorrect the shortage is of inward capital flows to support the us government s budget deficit by attracting those global portfolio flows instead china s belt and road initiative threatens us government finances so the financial war and associated disinformation can be expected to escalate hong kong is likely to be in the firing line due to its role in providing china with access to international finance introduction huawei is hitting the headlines from ordering the arrest of its chief financial officer in vancouver last december to the latest efforts to dissuade its allies from adopting huawei s 5g mobile technology it has been a classic deep state operation by the americans admittedly the chinese have left themselves open to attack by introducing a loosely drafted cybersecurity law in 2016 17 which according to western defence circles appears to require all chinese technology companies to cooperate with chinese intelligence services consequently no one now knows whether to trust huawei who have some of the leading technology for 5g the problem for network operators is who to believe intelligence services are in the business of dissembling which they do through political puppets all of which are professionals at being economical with the truth who can forget weapons of mass destruction more recently there was the skripal poisoning mystery the russians would have been bang to rights if it wasn t for skripal s links through pablo miller to christopher steele who put together the dodgy dossier on trump s alleged behaviour in a russian hotel the safest course is to never believe anything emanating from a government security agency which does not help hapless network operators they and the rest of us should look at motives the attack on huawei is motivated by a desire to impede china s technological progress which is already eclipsing that of america and america is using her leadership of the 5 eyes intelligence group of nations to impose her geostrategic will on her allies the row in britain this week escalated from a cabinet level security breech on this subject to american threats of withholding intelligence from the uk if uk companies are permitted to order huawei 5g equipment to the sacking of the minister of defence a threat to withhold intelligence sharing if carried out only serves to isolate the americans but you can see how desperate the americans are to eliminate huawei furthermore the huawei controversy is part of a wider conflict with america determined to stop the chinese changing the world s power structure moving it from under america s control when china was just a cheap manufacturing centre for low tech goods that was one thing but when china started developing advanced technologies and began to dominate global trade that was another china must be put back in its box so far all attempts to do so appear to have failed control of afghanistan seen as an important source of minerals ready to be exploited by china has been a costly failure for the west attempts to wrest control of syria from russia s sphere of influence also failed russia is china s economic and military ally america failed to bring russia to her knees so now the focus is directly on destroying or at least containing china china has already outspent america in africa central and south america buying influence away from america in her traditional spheres of influence attempts to neutralise north korea are coming unstuck in truth there is an undeclared war between china and russia on one side and america and her often reluctant allies on the other it will now escalate mainly because america increasingly needs global portfolio flows to cover her deficits america s financial war strategy behind the cyber war there is a financial war in the financial war america has the advantage of its currency hegemony which it exercises to the full it has allowed americans to have lived beyond their means by importing more goods than they export and the government spends more than it receives in taxes in order to achieve these benefits inward capital flows are necessary to finance them to date these have totalled in current value terms some 25 trillion being total foreign ownership of dollar assets and deposits america s policy of living beyond its means now requires more than just recycled trade flows inward portfolio flows are required as well global portfolios comprised of commercial cash balances as well as investment money periodically increase their exposure to other regions potentially leaving america short the problem is resolved by destabilising the region that has most recently benefited from capital investment to encourage money to return to dollars and thus america s domestic markets now that she is due to escalate infrastructure spending both in china and along the new silk roads it is china s turn this will be the opinion of qiao liang who was a major general in the pla and one of its chief strategists it was his explanation for the south east asian crisis of 1997 when a run started on the thai baht and spread to all neighbouring countries in the decade prior to the crisis the region saw substantial inward capital flows so much so that countries such as malaysia the philippines and indonesia ran significant deficits on their balance of payments this conflicted with the us s trade balance which was beginning to deteriorate the solution was the collapse of the south east asia investment story which stimulated the re allocation of investment resources in favour of the dollar and america qiao liang cites a number of other examples from the latin american crisis in the early 1980s to ukraine whose yellow revolution reversed investment flows into central europe this did not go to plan with over a trillion dollars worth of investment coming out of europe most being redirected to the chinese economy which was the most attractive destination at that time through the new shanghai shenzhen hong kong stock connect in april 2014 china facilitated inward investment and the ability for foreign investors to realise profits without going through exchange controls being the gateway for foreign investors our story now moves to hong kong according to chinese and russian intelligence sources america tried to destabilise it with covert support for the occupy hong kong movement between september and december 2014 the fed ended its qe that october and international capital was needed back in the us the americans had also escalated the row over the spratly islands and scarborough shoal at the beginning of that year which effectively halted free trade negotiations between china japan south korea macau taiwan and hong kong the chinese hoped this potential free trade area could be expanded to include the asean fta which would then have been the largest in the world by gdp and an area in which they could develop the renminbi as the reserve currency these plans were effectively scuppered but china was not provoked into a public response by these actions instead they started reducing their us treasury holdings in their dollar reserves from 1 27 trillion to 1 06 trillion in 2016 not a great fall but demonstrating they were not recycling their trade surpluses into dollars all that happened at a time when both the american and global economies were expanding admittedly at muted rates trump s trade protectionism has changed that and early indications are that the us economy is now stalling tax revenues are falling short while government expenditures are rising america now urgently needs more inward capital flows to finance the growing budget deficit if qiao liang were to comment doubtless his conclusion would be that america will increase its attack on china to precipitate disinvestment and reallocation to the dollar and so the attacks have begun first by trying to break huawei now the mainstream media perhaps with off the record briefings are claiming china and hong kong are facing difficulties last week the wall street journal published an article claiming china s banks are running out of dollars clearly this is untrue china s banks can acquire dollars any time they want either by selling other foreign currencies in the market or by selling renminbi to the people s bank they have their dollar position because they choose to have it and furthermore all commercial banks use derivatives which are effectively off balance sheet exposure furthermore with the us running a substantial trade deficit with china dollars are flooding in all the time following the wsj article various other commentators have come up with similar stories how convenient it seems for the us government to see these bearish stories about china just when they need to ramp up inward portfolio flows to finance the budget deficit there is anyway a general antipathy among american investors to the china story so we should not be surprised to see the china bears restating their case one leading china bear at least by reputation for his investment shrewdness is kyle bass of hayman capital management according to zero hedge he has written his first investment letter in three years saying of hong kong today newly emergent economic and political risks threaten hong kong s decades of stability these risks are so large they merit immediate attention on both fronts we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us if only it were so simple it is time to put the alternative case hong kong is important because china uses hong kong and london to avoid being dependent on the us banking system for international finances and that s why the us s deep state want to nail hong kong lop sided analysis bass is correct in pointing out the hong kong property market appears highly geared and that property prices for office residential and retail sectors have rocketed since the 2003 trough to a large extent it has been the inevitable consequence of the currency board link to the us dollar which broadly transfers the fed s inflationary monetary policy to hong kong s more dynamic economy bass s description of the relationship between the banks the way they finance themselves and property collateral is reminiscent of the factors that led to the secondary banking crisis in the uk in late 1973 empirical evidence appears to be firmly on bass s side except that is for a significant difference between events such as the uk s secondary banking crisis and virtually every other property crisis hong kong is a truly international centre and the banks role in property transactions is as currency facilitator rather than lender in 2017 hong kong was the third largest recipient of foreign direct investment substantially property after the us and china fdi inflows rose by 104bn to total nearly 2 trillion largest investors were china followed by corporate money channelled through offshore centres so yes hong kong banks will be hurt by a property crisis but not as much as bass implies it is foreign and chinese banks that have much of the property as collateral it is not the hong kong banks that have fuelled the property boom with domestic credit but foreign money bass fails to mention that a collapse in property prices and the banking system is unlikely to be confined to hong kong central banks have made significant progress in ensuring all banking systems are tied into the same credit cycle unwittingly they have simply guarenteed that the next credit crisis will hit everyone at the same time it won t be just hong kong but the eu japan britain and america everyone will be in difficulty to a greater or lesser extent interestingly the lehman crisis which occurred after hong kong property prices had already doubled from 2003 caused strong inflows to develop driving the hong kong dollar to the top of its peg the situation appears to be similar today with us outward investment at low levels but near record levels of foreign ownership of dollar assets despite hong kong s foreign direct investment standing at 2 trillion the prospect of capital repatriation to hong kong should not be ignored probably the most important claim in bass s letter is over the future of the currency peg operated by the hong kong monetary authority hkma he claims that the aggregate balance which is a line item in the hkma s balance sheet is the equivalent of the us fed s excess reserves and that once depleted the pressure on the currency board will become untenable and the peg will break the aggregate balance on the hkma s balance sheet has declined significantly over the last year from hk 180bn to hk 54 4bn currently the decision about changes in aggregate balances comes from the banks themselves and for this reason they are commonly taken to reflect capital flows into and out of the hong kong dollar this is different from aggregate balances reflecting actual pressures on the peg as suggested by bass the hkma maintains a us dollar coverage of 105 112 5 of base money currently about 110 and has further unallocated dollar reserves if necessary the peg is maintained by the hkma varying its base money not just by managing a base lending rate giving a spread over the fed s fund rate not just by influencing the commercial banks aggregate balances but by addressing the three other components that make up the monetary base these are certificates of indebtedness government notes and coins in circulation and exchange fund bills and notes efbns in practice it is the efbns in conjunction with the aggregate balances that are used to adjust the monetary base and keep the currency secured in the convertibility zone of 7 75 and 7 85 to the us dollar in maintaining the peg the hkma prioritises maintaining it over managing the money supply there is little doubt this goes against the grain of mainstream western economists who believe inflation good deflation bad over the last year base money in hong kong contracted from hk 1 695bn to hk1 635bn does this worry the hkma not at all how the chinese will act in the circumstances of a new global credit crisis is yet to be seen but we should bear in mind that they are probably less keynesian in their approach to economics and finance than westerners admittedly they have freely used credit expansion to finance economic development but theirs is a mercantilist approach which differs significantly from ours we simply impoverish our factors of production through wealth transfer by monetary inflation we think this can be offset by fuelling financial speculation and asset inflation china enhances her production and innovation by generating personal savings wealth is created by and linked more directly to production the objectives and effects of monetary and credit inflation between china s application of it and the way we do things in the west are dissimilar and it is a common mistake to ignore these differences the threat to china s ability to manage its affairs in a credit crisis is significantly less than the threat to western welfare dependent nations whose governments are highly indebted while china s is not china is sure to see the financial and monetary stability of hong kong as being vital to the mainland s interests apart from the bank of china s hong kong subsidiary being the second largest issuer of bank notes the peoples bank itself maintains reserve balances in hong kong dollars which in the circumstances kyle bass believes likely they can increase to support the hkma s management of the currency peg conclusions it is a mistake to think the hong kong property market is as much of a systemic danger as it first appears expectations of a devaluation of the peg appear to be wishful thinking by the bears far more important are the consequences of the cyber and financial war being pursued against china and russia its close ally by the american deep state under president trump it was accelerated by his trade tariff policies which are fundamentally an attack on china s economy china will be a hard nut to crack and the effect of america s trade protectionism has been to trigger a diminution in international trade which is now becoming apparent the negative effects on the american economy appear to be being underestimated the attempt to destroy huawei s 5g global ambitions is both the current and most visible part of an undeclared cyber and financial war trade protectionism was only a step along the way the financial war is now escalating with the global economy facing at least a significant recession almost certain to trigger an overdue credit crisis the chinese have long been on a financial war footing as shown by qiao liang s analysis of how america needs global portfolio flows and what they are prepared to do to attract them western thinking that the chinese and their russian allies are vulnerable to american hegemony has been disproved time and again financial analysts consistently fail to understand the chinese are not muppets china will not be provoked and by standing firm they are sure to protect hong kong and get on with diverting investment flows from a failing us economy into its belt and road initiative this will force a financial crisis on the americans of their own making at least that s how china has always seen it and they see no need for their passive financial war strategy to change
will yuan replace us dollar and make gold shine the us dollar will collapse or it will be replaced by another currency we hear such statements all the time are they true we decided to check these claims so we invite you to read our today s article about the us dollar s international supremacy and find out whether the greenback s demise is likely in the foreseeable future let s also draw implications from the analysis for the precious metals market we have heard about the fall of the us dollar s significance for over half a century in particular the rise of china s economy threatens the greenback s dominance trump s unsound fiscal policy and the recent powell s dovish turn only reinforce these fears so let s analyze whether such a scenario is likely in the foreseeable future and let s draw implications for the precious metals market the dollar s supremacy started around 1955 when reserves held in greenback exceeded those held in pound sterling since then the us dollar is a king to be clear we do not maintain that greenback is a wonderful currency without problems and better than gold no it simply has no competitors among other fiat currencies it is a king of beggars initially after the gradual demise of british currency the only possible alternatives to the greenback were the japanese yen and the deutsche mark as japan and germany noted impressive pace of economic development however both economies were much smaller and with less liquid financial market moreover the us army stationed in both countries which cast a shadow over their currencies the situation has not improved since then in the 1990s germany struggled with the reunification while japan fell into multi year stagnation after the burst of the enormous asset price bubble actually one may convincingly claim that japan has not fully recovered yet as the country still faces deflation weak banks adverse demographics sluggish growth or even periodic bouts of negative growth and negative interest rates indeed the bank of japan is running the most accommodative machine of any central bank that it systematically important hence yen is not likely candidate to replace the us dollar many analysts believed that 21th century will bring some changes as the ecb launched euro a new common currency for several european countries however for almost every economist with some knowledge about the international monetary system it was clear that a project based on a unified monetary policy and heterogeneous fiscal policy each member of the eurozone conducts its own policy could not pose a serious threat to the us dollar the euro is too fragile which was revealed by the great recession and the sovereign debt crisis the current italy s problems are just an old shortcomings in a new disguise i write more about the latest twenty years of the eurozone in the february edition of the market overview last but not least germany is also an obstacle for euro to gain in importance you see berlin favors the policy of a balanced budget for us it is a very sound policy but it results in the small supply of german bunds so investors prefer to park their funds in the us treasury market which is the most liquid market in the world if not euro and not yen so maybe yuan will dethrone the us dollar this is what many analysts expect based on china s economic potential after all the imf included the chinese renminbi into the sdr basket in october 2016 however the yuan is not likely to replace the us dollar anytime soon the main reason is shallow financial market in china it still lacks transparency and it is controlled to large extent by the authorities do you remember august 2015 when the people s bank of china devalued the currency i bet you do let s look at the chart below the share of the yuan in global currency reserves amounted to 1 8 percent in q3 2018 it does not look like a great threat for us dollar does it chart 1 composition of world s total foreign currency reserves from q1 2010 to q3 2018 green line us dollar blue line euro purple line pound sterling orange line japanese yen red line chinese yuan investors should remember that there are four things needed in order for a currency to play a global role size stability liquidity and security although china s economy and trade payments are big the yuan is not stable not liquid and not secure the financial system is still heavily controlled by the authorities and it is not open and transparent although the share of the us dollar in the world s total foreign reserves has declined somewhat since 2015 it remained dominant with share above 60 percent the euro which is the second most popular reserve currency has share amounting to 20 percent or one third of the greenback s share moreover although dollar s role as official reserve diminished slightly its share in bank external claims has risen similarly volumes through u s based dollar wire transfer and settlement systems have also continued to rise to sum up tina says that the us dollar will remain the world s global reserve despite all its shortcomings who is tina it is the slogan used by margaret thatcher there is no alternative yen let s be serious japan still cannot stand on its own feet after post bubble recession approaching the third lost decade euro no way as long as there are doubts about the eurozone s survival yuan maybe someday but not anytime soon as the renminbi is not freely floating while china s capital markets are not yet fully open the implications for the precious metals market are clear the gold bulls should not count on yuan replacing the us dollar it is not going to happen anytime soon you may not like america and its currency but the fact is the greenback will remain the dominant fiat currency us dollar will remain relatively strong which will be a headwind for the yellow metal however when china liberalizes and opens its capital market the gradual reshuffle in the composition of the foreign reserves may occur which could support gold thank you if you enjoyed the above analysis and would you like to know more about the link between the u s economy and the gold market we

dubai as the turkish lira continues to fall economists and analysts say they don t see a quick end to the crisis i am not that optimistic on that said turkish professor gokhan bacik who teaches at palacky university in czech republic when asked if he sees an end to the turkish currency crisis in the foreseeable future because one reason is the economic crisis in turkey is now structural which means turkey to overcome this problem should immediately make some reforms in politics in foreign policy in rule of law so i am not the government is ready to do so right now bacik told gulf news the economic crisis in turkey is now structural which means turkey should make reforms gokhan bacik professor at palacky university the economic problem is really a big headache for turkish president recep tayyip erdogan and a complex concern for the turkish government said the turkish political scientist however it is unclear which direction the turkish government is going to take in handling the economic crisis and until then the leadership in ankara should realise either some reforms or speaking directly with the imf because definitely turkey needs some kind finance some kind of consultation bacik said the drop in the relative value of the lira which started in 2018 has benefited the country s tourism sector but other sectors including imports exports and foreign direct investments fdi have either suffered or are expected to 3 contraction in turkish economy in fourth quarter the turkish economy is expected to continue to contracting throughout 2019 the lira lost nearly 30 per cent of its value against the us dollar in 2018 in response to concerns over the central bank s independence and deteriorating relations between ankara and washington the devaluation of the turkish currency pushed inflation high thereby limiting companies abilities to repay foreign debts and multiplying the number of bad loans economic reports said only a few developing markets have seen the weakness that the turkish lira has experienced jameel ahmad head of currency strategy at fxtm the turkish economy contracted by 3 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year and the contraction is expected to continue this year the international monetary fund imf has put its estimate at around 2 5 per cent turkey s lira was the second worst performing currency in an emerging market after the argentine peso which fell 57 per cent last year said economists among other currencies the brazilian real lost 15 per cent the south african rand shed 12 per cent and the russian rouble slid 11 74 per cent said jameel ahmad global head of currency strategy and market research at fxtm a global foreign exchange broker 30 decline in turkish lira s value against the dollar last year emerging market currency weakness has been a widespread theme on a global level since early last year but only a few developing markets have seen the weakness that the turkish lira has experienced during this period ahmad told gulf news though the currency weakness encouraged an economic recession one sector in the turkish economy came out as a winner in the crisis he said when it comes to tourism you would naturally expect the sector to benefit from such abrupt weakness in a currency visitors to turkey for tourism are now getting approximately a 30 per cent discount on their trip when compared to what the valuation of the lira would have been before 2018 ahmad said the turkish lira weakness reflects macro uncertainties that are going to also impact the inflows monica malik chief economist at abu dhabi commercial bank nevertheless it is still too early to comment on the impact of the currency crisis on the competitiveness of other sectors in the turkish economy including exports and foreign direct investments fdi the turkish lira weakness reflects macro uncertainties that are going to also impact the inflows especially long term investment so while exports of goods and services are becoming more competitive we do not envisage many companies moving to turkey at this point said monica malik chief economist at abu dhabi commercial bank until there is a greater clarity on the economic and political backdrop we see foreign investors remaining cautious she told gulf news an external weakness of the turkish economy has historically been the reliance on portfolios flows with fdi levels weak ankara s exports depend on foreign currency and the fact that turkey imports energy resources namely oil and some parts for its industrial sectors increases the impact of the currency crisis on the economy experts said the third point if you analyse the turkish debt in detail it mostly belongs to the private sector bacik said so having this very bad currency crisis is really troubling financing the debt it is not going to work for them some reports and websites say turkey has become a hub for plastic surgery in the middle east region a fact that many observers relate to the currency crisis which has boosted the competitiveness of turkey in the field however experts including bacik say such attractiveness is not sufficient to deal with the crisis
indexing and passive investment have little to learn from macro at the start of april the bloomberg barclay bond index included mainland chinese bonds for the first time a macro strategist could have explained how china s 10 year yield had been falling since reaching above 4 in may june 2018 was near 3 40 in late march and why it might not go down much further the government was committed to supporting the economy new stimulus was being delivered and more were in the pipeline the yuan had appreciated by nearly 2 5 in q1 it was the third strongest currency behind the russian rouble 6 2 and thai baht 2 6 the dollar had approached a level cny6 70 where chinese officials had seemed to draw a line signals are indirect and can change not only were yields low but the currency was strong it was not an attractive time to be adding mainland bonds to the portfolio still the index is the index if one second guesses the index that makes it a different kind of fund actively managed funds cost more than passive funds though fixed income managers are more likely to beat their benchmark than equity managers in a more immediate sense macro does not seem to matter either the us reported growth accelerated q1 to above three percent blowing away expectations and the dollar meh the us reported a jobs beat a week later and a drop in the unemployment rate and again meh the eurozone reported better stronger than expected growth with italy emerging from the h2 18 recession it followed it up with a larger than expected rise in cpi the euro did not get any traction was near the lows for the week prior to the us jobs report but let s not jettison macro too quickly equity analysts often talk about the market as a discounting mechanism to say that same thing slightly differently markets anticipate there was net demand for dollars ahead of the gdp report there was demand for dollars before the employment report it is as if the smart money bought the dollar effect before the cause strong economic data it is as if some of those who bought ahead of the news were happy to sell to those who thought the headlines justified a stronger dollar we suspect that divergence that has been the primary fuel of the dollar s rally has run its course for now us growth is not quite as strong as it may look and the eurozone is not as weak the risk is on the upside for the european service and composite pmi even in germany where the manufacturing sector is still contracting the flash service pmi was a five month high the uk is likely to report that growth accelerated to 0 5 in q1 from 0 2 in q4 18 which would lift the year over year rate to 1 8 from 1 4 japan is the laggard it will not report q1 gdp until the middle of the month but it looks like it contracted household spending in march is expected to have slowed on a year over year basis for the second month here is part of the problem cash earnings are a falling year over year and march is likely to be the third consecutive decline since deflation has been arrested the reserve banks of australia and new zealand meet the rbnz is more likely to cut rates that the rba the market has a little more than half the cut discounted the new zealand dollar has fallen a little more than 5 since late march it came within a few hundredths of a penny from the flash crash low 0 6575 on january 3 along with other currencies it staged an upside reversal ahead of the weekend it was mostly a question of the broader us dollar pullback but the market may be looking past the first cut if it is one and done there would be scope for the kiwi to trade higher the market appears to have discounted a little more than a 1 in 3 chance of second rate cut this year in this context what the rbnz says may be more important than what it does some will argue that the case for an rba rate cut is just as compelling but the market thinks otherwise the derivatives suggest around a 37 chance of a cut has been priced however speculators in the futures market have net short australian dollar futures position 54k vs 11 5k yet the aussie had fallen about 3 1 since april 17 when it tested a two month high a little above 0 7200 it made a marginal new low since the flash crash in the knee jerk reaction to the jobs data 0 6985 before recovering to almost 0 7025 and closing again on above 0 7000 the previous floor as china returns from an extended may day holiday there will be several economic reports including international reserves might increase a little and trade slower growth in exports and a smaller contraction in imports may result in a wider surplus consumer price pressures probably edged a little higher to 2 5 matching its highest level since the first quarter last year the deflationary scare in producer prices has subsided it might rise it 0 6 which would be the strongest this year the takeaway is that what appeared to have been a slowing of the chinese economy has been arrested brexit is about to enter a new phase the local elections results were stark of 8400 council seats the tories loss almost 1335 considerably worse than expected labour cannot capitalize on the tory self immolation it lost 82 seats the lib dems were the big winner picking up 703 seats and the greens who are also pro europe gained 194 seats independents also did well the key to what happens next is the lesson that is taken from these results talks between the government and labour resume next week there is a small window of opportunity to strike a deal which would probably entail a softer exit than the kind envisioned by the likes of boris johnson or nigel farage talk suggests if a deal can be made it will be known by the end of next week if a deal cannot be worked out shortly the pressure on may to step down will build she led the party into losing its majority in the house of commons the withdrawal agreement her government negotiated for 18 months did what little else has done it united parliament delivering historic defeats to her bill not one twice but three times sterling s impressive pre weekend rally was more than a reflection of the dollar s pullback it approached its best level in two years against the euro and is supported by a 15 bp increase in the implied yield of the december short sterling futures contract speculators in the currency futures have seen a nearly two thirds increase in gross long positions since late march meanwhile the premium for three month sterling puts over calls has shrunk to its smallest level since last june the federal reserve cut the interest rate it pays on reserves because not capping the effective average fed funds rate it has tried this strategy twice in h2 18 with little success the immediate impact was inauspicious the interest on reserves now stands at 2 35 while was 2 41 the day after the fomc meeting the secured overnight funding rate that may eventually replace libor finished last week at 2 50 the top of the fed funds target range powell said that the soft inflation was transitory this might not be as controversial as some made it seem april cpi will be reported at the end of next week recall that the year over year pace was nearly halved from last june and july s 2 9 to 1 5 in february a 0 4 increase that is the median forecast in the bloomberg survey would lift the year over year back above 2 0 for the first time since last november it may not sound like much but a 0 1 rise in the core rate would be the first increase this year the mueller report was only one front on which president trump is being stymied moore is his fourth candidate to the federal reserve that was not defeated by democrats but by republicans a party that continues to support trump by an overwhelming majority the republicans are also threatening to reject trump s 2 trillion infrastructure initiative that is the subject of talks with the democrats north korea reportedly tested several short range missiles for the first time in two years the steel and aluminum tariffs are threatening to sabotage the new north american free trade agreement the march trade balance due may 9 could impact revisions to q1 gdp but they will be a reminder that despite because of the administration s economic nationalism the trade balance has deteriorated by nearly 20 over the past two years the 12 month moving average has been above 51 bln a month for the past five months the quarterly refunding takes place next week it is a reminder of the cost of last year s stimulus the treasury will auction 84 bln of coupons that same as in q1 it will raise almost 29 bln of new cash recall that treasury is taking extraordinary but not unprecedented measures in lieu of the debt ceiling being lifted these measures are limited and it appears crunch time could be by the end of q3 china s trade negotiating team will be in washington in the coming days there have been some reports that president xi s calendar is making space for a meeting with trump next month which suggests an agreement is near leaks from china are rare raising the possibility that it was purposeful at the same time there is talk that an announcement of a meeting could take place by the end of the week ahead recent accounts indicate that the us has softened its position on intellectual property rights in biologics and in cyber espionage a deal is an executive agreement which means that unlike nafta 2 0 it will not require senate approval the same holds for the current talks with europe and japan disclaimer
one of gold s most admirable qualities is its unchanging nature not only does it retain its shape and characteristics more importantly it also preserves its value over the long term as financial commentator peter a burshre once commented regardless of the dollar price involved one ounce of gold would purchase a good quality man s suit at the conclusion of the revolutionary war the civil war the presidency of franklin roosevelt and today no wonder this imperishable and non diminishing asset is synonymous with akshaya tritiya a day meant to mark prosperity and wealth in indian culture but while we indians love gold

presented by other entities they are provided to you in order to give you a better sense of tc energy s operating performance liquidity and its ability to generate funds to finance its operations with that i ll turn the call over to russ russ girling president and chief executive officer thank you david and good afternoon everyone and thank you very much for joining us here late on friday afternoon we recognize it s been a busy week for most of you before providing an update on our progress that we ve made over the last three months i d like to thank our shareholders again for supporting our name change earlier today at the annual meeting as explained when we announced the change in january we believed that tc energy better reflects our current position as one of north america s leading energy infrastructure companies with critical assets and dedicated employees across three countries canada the united states and mexico turning to our progress in early 2019 as highlighted in our quarterly report to shareholders during the first quarter our 100 billion portfolio of high quality long life energy infrastructure assets continued to perform from strong supply demand fundamentals in the core geographies that we serve and we continue to realize on the growth expected from our industry leading capital expansion program has replaced new long term contracted and rate regulated assets into service in a nutshell the demand for our infrastructure remains strong driving historically high utilization rates across all of our systems that combined with new assets entering service resulted in record first quarter earnings and cash flow evidence of this can be seen in our comparable earnings of 1 07 per share for the three months ended march 31 2019 during the quarter we also placed approximately 5 3 billion of new assets into service including the mountaineer and gulf xpress projects on our columbia systems as well as various ngtl system expansions today we are advancing approximately 30 billion of secured capital projects with approximately 7 billion of those projects expected to be completed by the end of this year we also continue to advance over 20 billion of projects under development including keystone xl and the refurbishment to five additional reactors at bruce power as part of their long term life extension program in addition we continue to make progress funding our capital program by raising approximately 1 2 billion early in 2019 that included 1 billion of 30 year term debt which was issued in april at compelling rates and 226 million of common equity under the dividend reinvestment program we also remain on track to complete the sale of our coolidge generating station in arizona for approximately 465 million u s by mid year and continue to progress in various other portfolio management activities looking forward we expect our strong operating and financial performance to continue and therefore 2019 comparable earnings per share are expected to be higher than the record results we produced in 2018 at the same time our overall financial position remains solid and we believe that we re well positioned to achieve our targeted credit metrics in 2019 don will provide more detail on our first quarter finance results in funding in a few moments but before that i ll expand on some of the recent developments beginning with a brief review of our financial results excluding certain specific items comparable earnings were 987 million or 1 07 per share in the first quarter an increase of 123 million or 0 09 per share over the same period in 2018 that equates to a 9 increase on a per share basis after recognizing the effect of common shares issued under the dividend reinvestment program in 2018 and 2019 and our atm program in 2018 comparable ebitda increased 320 million to approximately 2 4 billion while comparable funds generated from operations of 1 8 billion were 180 million higher than the first quarter of 2018 based on the strength of our financial performance and our growth outlook the board of directors today declared a second quarter dividend of 0 75 per common share which is equivalent to 3 per share on an annual basis this represents an 8 7 increase over the amount declared in the second quarter of 2018 and equates to a payout of approximately 75 of comparable earnings and 40 of internally generated cash flow leaving us with the financial capacity to continue to invest in our businesses next i d like to make a few comments about our five operating businesses firstly in canadian natural gas customer demand for access to our systems remains strong and we continue to work with the industry on options to connect growing western canadian gas to markets across north america evidence of that demand for our services can be seen in the volumes that we transported across our network our ngtl system delivered an average of 13 5 billion cubic feet a day in the first quarter consistent with the volume that we transported over the same period last year on the canadian mainline total deliveries averaged 5 9 billion cubic feet a day in the first quarter today we are advancing about 8 6 billion of expansion program on the ngtl system that will add approximately 3 billion cubic feet per day of incremental delivery capacity to the system by the end of 22 we also continue to actively work with lng canada on our coastal gaslink pipeline project following a positive final investment decision last october on their lng terminal in kitimat british columbia the 6 2 billion pipeline project will have an initial capacity of 2 1 billion cubic feet a day with the potential of expansion up to 5 billion cubic feet a day all of the necessary regulatory permits have been received to allow us to proceed and pre construction activities continue at many locations along the pipeline route moving to our u s natural gas pipelines where the demand for our services reached record levels as highlighted previously our broad network has historically served about 25 of u s demand on a daily basis more recently winter deliveries averaged 24 4 billion cubic feet a day and the cold temperatures that grip much of north american in late january and early february led to a peak day delivery record for our company in the united states of 33 1 billion cubic feet a day on january 30 in addition to moving record volumes on our existing us systems during the first quarter we continued to advance 5 8 billion of secured expansion projects columbia s mountaineer xpress along with gulf xpress projects were phased into service over the first quarter of 2019 at the same time we continue to identify new opportunities across our broader us natural gas pipeline portfolio to connect marcellus and western canadian sedimentary supply to markets an example of that is our grand chenier xpress project which was sanctioned in february it s an a r pipeline project that will connect supply directly to the gulf coast lng export markets through additional compression facilities subject to a positive customer fid the project is expected to enter service in two phases over the 2021 and 2022 period at a cost of about 200 million u s turning to mexico where we re advancing construction on three pipelines at a total cost of about 3 billion while the sur de texas pipeline has experienced force majeure events that have delayed in service construction and commissioning activities are progressing such that we anticipate mechanical completion in may with an expected june in service date construction on the villa de reyes project is ongoing with a phased in service anticipated to commence in the second half of 2019 finally the construction on the central segment of the tula project has been delayed due to lack of progress on indigenous consultations by the mexican government as a result we expect that project to enter service toward the end of 2020 we have negotiated separate cfe contracts that would allow certain segments of the tula villa de reyes project to be placed in service when the facilities are complete and gas is available turning to our liquids business which produced very strong results in the quarter keystone which is underpinned by long haul take or pay contracts for about 550 000 barrels a day essentially ran at capacity in the first quarter moving an average of 590 000 barrels a day on the southern portion of the system or what we call the u s gulf coast segment capacity was increased throughout 2018 reaching approximately 700 000 barrels a day by year end as capacity increased we maintained near full utilization rates in the fourth quarter and again into the first quarter of 2019 in addition we continued to benefit from a higher contribution from liquids marketing activities largely due to improved volumes and margins as a result of favorable market conditions on the project development side commissioning has been completed on the 200 million white spruce pipeline and commercial in service was achieved here early in may also in the first quarter we entered into an agreement with motiva to construct a pipeline to connect between the keystone pipeline system and motiva s 630 000 barrels a day refinery in port arthur that connection is targeted to be operational in the second quarter of 2020 finally in the liquids business during the first quarter we continued to advance keystone xl in late march the u s president issued a new presidential permit for the project which supersedes the 2017 permit the president s actions clarify the national importance of keystone xl and aims to bring more than 10 years of environmental review to closure president trump has been clear that he wants to create the jobs and advance us energy security and keystone xl does both of these things in an environmentally sustainable and responsible way we thank him for his leadership and steadfast support of this critical energy infrastructure project also with respect to keystone xl in nebraska which as you know we received approval of the route in the state however as you know that decision has been challenged we expect the nebraska supreme court could reach a decision in the second quarter of 19 with respect to an appeal of the nebraska public service commission s approval of our route we continue to participate together with the u s department of justice in lawsuits commenced in montana to defend legal challenges to the u s presidential permit and the exhaustive environmental assessments that support the u s president s actions we ve secured commercial support for all available capacity on the keystone xl system and we remain committed to the project we continue to carefully and methodically obtain the regulatory and legal approvals necessary before we advance the project to construction turning now to power and storage which was previously known as the energy segment the name change was made to better describe our assets and operations in the segment it does not imply any change in strategy or have any impact on previously recorded segmented results in power and storage we experienced equipment failure on the 1 7 billion napanee project while progressing commissioning activities on the plant during the first quarter as a result we now expect the 900 megawatt plant to be placed into service in the second half of 29 once that equipment is repaired work also continues on the bruce power life extension project where we expect to invest approximately 2 2 billion in bruce power s unit 6 program as well as the ongoing asset management program through 2023 when unit 6 refurbishment is complete bruce power s contracted price of approximately 68 00 per megawatt hour increased to approximate 75 00 per megawatt hour on april 1 2019 to reflect the capital to be invested under these programs as well as a normal annual inflation adjustment finally in the power and storage segment we have entered into an agreement to sell our coolidge generating station in arizona for approximately 465 million or 620 million canadian the sale is expected to close mid 2019 this sale allows us to serve a significant value for mature assets that represented less than 10 of our generating capacity and then redeploy that capital into our 30 billion secured capital program thereby reducing our need for external capital including common equity in summary today we are advancing 30 billion of secure projects that are expected to enter service by 2023 it includes approximately 5 billion of maintenance capital 85 of which is related to our rate regulated natural gas pipelines and therefore is expected to be added to rate base and generate a return on enough capital identical to that which we realize on expansion projects we have invested approximately 10 billion into that program to date with approximately 7 billion of those projects expected to enter service in 2019 the projects expected to be completed this year includes the 2 8 billion of the ngtl expansions as well as the sur de texas natural gas pipeline in mexico and the napanee gas fired power plant in ontario notably all of these projects are underpinned by cost of service regulation or long term contracts giving us a high degree of visibility to the earnings and cash flow that we generate as they enter service this highlights the significant growth in ebitda that is expected as we continue to advance our secured capital program as you can see on this chart comparable ebitda which has increased from 5 9 billion in 2015 to 8 6 billion in 2018 is expected to reach approximately 10 billion by 2021 that equates to a compound average growth rate of about 9 over the six year period and just as important as the magnitude of that growth is the quality of the growth with over 95 of our ebitda coming from regulated assets or long term contracts in addition as i said we are advancing 20 billion of projects currently under development any one of those projects could further enhance our growth profile as well as our strong competitive north american position based on our confidence in our growth plans we expect to continue to grow the dividend at an average annual rate of 8 10 through 2021 and as always it has been our practice the growth of dividends is expected to be supported by sustainable growth in earnings and cash flow on a per share basis and strong distributable cash flow coverage ratios in summary i ll leave you with the following key messages today we are a leading north american energy infrastructure company with a strong track record of delivering long term shareholder value our assets are critical to the functioning of the north american economy and the demand for our services remains strong in 2018 our 100 billion asset portfolio generated 8 6 billion of annual ebitda with approximately 95 coming from regulated businesses or long term contracted assets looking forward we have five significant platforms for growth canadian us and mexican gas pipelines liquids pipelines and power and storage just as we have done since 2000 as we advanced our 30 billion secured capital program we expect to deliver continuous growth in earnings and cash flow and dividends on a per share basis in addition we have over 20 billion of projects that are in the advanced stages of development and we expect numerous other outgrowth opportunities to emanate from our existing extensive critical assets footprint we have a long history of prudently funding our capital programs and we are on track to continue to de lever our balance sheet post the 2016 acquisition of columbia and achieve our targeted credit metrics here in 2019 that concludes my prepared remarks i ll turn the call over to don he ll provide more details on our first quarter financial results don marchand executive vice president and chief financial officer great thanks russ and good afternoon everyone as outlined in our quarterly report issued earlier today we re pleased to report that net income attributable common shares increased by 270 million to 1 billion or 1 09 per share in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 734 million or 0 83 per share for the same period in 2018 first quarter 2019 and 2018 results included an after tax loss of 12 million and an after tax gain of 6 million respectively related to the run off of our u s northeast power marketing contracts these specific items as well as unrealized gains and losses from changes in risk management activities are excluded from comparable earnings comparable earnings in the first quarter rose by 123 million to 987 million or 1 07 per share compared 864 million or 0 98 per share in 2018 representing a 9 increase on a per share basis per share amounts account for the dilutive impact of common shares issued under our dividend reinvestment plan in 2018 and 2019 and at the market program in 2018 our positive results reflect broad operational strength and solid cash generation particularly in canadian and u s natural gas pipelines along with liquids pipelines turning to our business segment results on slide 15 in the first quarter comparable ebitda from our five operating businesses was approximately 2 4 billion a 320 million or 16 increase year over year note that we do not include afudc which amounted to 139 million in the quarter in ebitda as outlined in the quarterly report canadian natural gas pipeline s comparable ebitda of 556 million was 62 million higher than for the same period in 2018 the increase was primarily due to the recovery of depreciation and increased rates approved in both ngtl in 2018 2019 settlement and the mainline neb 2018 decision as well as higher flow through taxes and incentive earnings in terms of year over year comparison as a result of the timing of the neb 2018 decision the full year impact of higher depreciation flow through taxes and incentive earnings on the mainline was not reflected until the fourth quarter of 2018 i would note that for canadian natural gas pipelines changes in depreciation financial charges and income taxes impact comparable ebitda but do not have a significant impact on net income as they are almost entirely recovered in revenues on a flow through basis net income for the ngtl system increased 21 million compared to first quarter 2018 because of a higher average investment base and reflects an improved roe of 10 1 on 40 deemed equity net income for the canadian mainline increased by 7 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to the same period last year mainly due to higher incentive earnings the 2018 neb decision previously mentioned preserved the incentive arrangement in place since 2015 along with an improved roe of 10 1 on 40 deemed equity us natural gas pipeline s comparable ebitda of 730 million u s or 972 million canadian increased by 95 million u s or 168 million canadian compared to the same period in 2018 mainly due to increased earnings from columbia gas and columbia gulf growth projects placed in service partially offset by decreased earnings in bison due to 2018 customer agreements to pay out their future contracted obligations and terminate their contracts mexico natural gas pipeline s comparable ebitda of 110 million u s or 146 million canadian decreased 17 million u s or 14 million canadian compared to first quarter 2018 driven primarily by lower recorded revenues from operations as a result of changes in timing of revenue recognition in 2018 and lower equity earnings from our investment in the sur de texas pipeline note that while in construction sur de texas records afudc net of interest expense on an inter affiliate loan which amount is fully offset in interest income and other in the corporate segment liquids pipeline s comparable ebitda rose by 132 million to 563 million driven by higher volumes on the keystone pipeline system and a higher contribution from liquids marketing activities as a result of increased volumes and margins as mentioned by russ to better describe our assets and operations the previously disclosed energy segment has been renamed power and storage comparable power and storage ebitda decreased by 25 million year over year to 151 million due to decreased western and eastern power results largely resulting from the sale of our interest in the cartier wind power facilities in october 2018 and costs related to napanee s delayed in service these were partially offset by wider realized natural gas storage price spreads and stronger bruce power results due to the net effect of positive fair value adjustments and other returns on investment supporting employee post retirement benefits and lower volumes and revenue resulting from higher outage days for all our businesses with u s dollar denominated income including u s natural gas pipelines mexico natural gas pipelines and parts of liquids pipelines and power and storage canadian dollar translated ebitda was positively impacted by a stronger u s dollar versus the first quarter of 2018 this was largely offset by higher translated interest expense on u s dollar denominated debt and realized hedging losses reported in comparable interest income in other as our u s dollar denominated operations continue to grow our exposure to foreign exchange movements will increase a sizable portion of which is naturally offset by interest expense on u s dollar denominated debt the residual balance is actively managed on a rolling one year forward basis using foreign exchange derivatives however the natural exposure beyond that period remains now turning to the other income statement items on slide 16 depreciation and amortization of 608 million increased 73 million versus first quarter 2018 largely on account of higher composite depreciation rates approved in the mainline neb 2018 decision and the ngtl 2018 2019 settlement new facilities entering service across our businesses and the impact of a stronger u s dollar partially offset by the sale of our interests in the cartoon cartier wind power facilities in 2018 and the cessation of depreciation on our coolidge generating station upon classification is held for sale at december 31 2018 interest expense included in comparable earnings of 586 million was 59 million higher year over year as a result of new long term debt issuances net of maturities higher levels of short term borrowing and the foreign exchange impact of a stronger u s dollar on translation of the u s dollar denominated interest partially offset by higher capitalized interest related to napanee and keystone xl afudc rose by 34 million to 139 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 an increase in canadian dollar denominated afudc was primarily due to capital expenditures on our ngtl system while an increase in u s dollar denominated afudc was driven by continued investment in u s natural gas pipelines and mexico projects comparable interest income and other declined 34 million year over year primarily as a result of realized hedging losses on foreign exchange management in the first quarter of 2019 compared to realized gains in 2018 partially offset by higher interest income related to the intra affiliate loan receivable from the sur de texas joint venture described earlier offsetting the corresponding interest expense recorded in comparable ebitda even though they fully offset on consolidation gaap requires that we report the interest income and expense elements of this loan separately in the financial statements income tax expense included in comparable earnings was 228 million in first quarter 2019 compared to 171 million for the same period last year primarily due to higher comparable earnings before income taxes higher flow through taxes in canadian natural gas pipelines and lower foreign tax rate differentials net income attributable to non controlling interest increased by 7 million for three months ended march 31 2019 mostly due to higher earnings in tc pipelines lp and the impact of a stronger u s dollar in 2019 on their translation to canadian dollars finally preferred share dividends were comparable to first quarter 2018 now moving to cash flow and distributable cash flow on slide 17 comparable funds generated from operations were approximately 1 8 billion in the first quarter reflecting an increase of 180 million year over year driven largely by higher comparable earnings as well as the recovery of higher depreciation for both the canadian mainline and ngtl system distributable cash flow reflecting only non recoverable maintenance capital was just over 1 6 billion or 1 76 per share compared to approximately 1 4 billion or 1 63 per share in the first quarter of 2018 resulting in a coverage ratio of 2 3 times now turning to slide 18 during the first quarter we invested approximately 2 3 billion in our capital program and successfully funded it primarily through our strong and growing internally generated cash flow notes payable and common equity from our dividend reinvestment plan our dividend reinvestment plan or drip continues to provide incremental subordinated capital in support of our growth and credit metrics in the first quarter the participation rate among common shareholders was approximately 33 representing 226 million of reinvestment also in the first quarter we received a distribution of 120 million from bruce power relating to their issuance of senior notes in the capital markets in december last year we entered into an agreement to sell our coolidge generating station for approximately 465 million u s or 620 million canadian the sale was subject to a third party right of first refusal which was subsequently exercised and will result in an estimated 55 million after tax gain to be recognized upon closing of the transaction which is expected to occur in mid 2019 in april we raised 1 billion through an offering of 30 year senior unsecured notes in the canadian market at a rate of 4 34 funding activity continues to highlight the depth and diversity of the financing options available to us allowing us to prudently fund our capital program and achieve targeted credit metrics now turning to slide 19 this graphic highlights are forecasted sources and uses of funds through 2021 starting in the left column the gross funding requirement over the next three years is projected to be 29 billion comprised of dividend and non controlling interest distributions of approximately 10 billion and capital expenditures of approximately 19 billion including maintenance capital as a reminder we are pursuing joint venture partners as well as potential asset level financing toward funding the 6 2 billion coastal gaslink project the expenditure will be spread over approximately four years with the bulk of it in 2020 and 2021 for purposes of our funding program outlook we assume we retain a 25 interest in coastal gaslink which is reflected in our capital requirements the second column highlights aggregate sources including approximately 21 billion of internally generated cash flow an estimated 700 million of proceeds from our dividend reinvestment plan for the january through july 2019 dividend payments as well as 620 million of proceeds from the sale of coolidge generating station that leaves a capital markets requirement of approximately 6 7 billion in the far right column aside from refinancing normal course maturities we expect to issue approximately 3 billion of incremental senior debt through 2021 within the constraints of our targeted credit metrics of debt to ebitda in high fours and minimum ffo to debt of 15 additionally we expect to issue 1 5 billion of hybrids maintaining these securities along with preferred shares at about 15 of our capital structure the remaining 2 2 billion as illustrated in the top right box will be comprised of activities such as incremental drip proceeds beyond the dividend most recently declared and portfolio management drip remains a quarter to quarter decision influenced by financial performance against targeted credit metrics along with the cadence of getting new assets into service and the timing of asset sales aside from coolidge we have assets generating approximately 500 million in annual contracted ebitda that have been identified as potential viable portfolio management candidates applying a reasonable multiple the associated proceeds would notably exceed our residual funding requirement as in the past while we generally do not pre announce targeted asset sales silence should not be construed as inactivity in summary we believe our external funding needs are eminently achievable in the context of the multiple financing levers available and the clear accretive and credit supportive use of proceeds all decisions are evaluated on a per share basis and further share count increases will be assessed against additional portfolio management we reiterate that we do not foresee a need for discreet equity to complete our secured 30 billion capital program and our goal is to revert to our historical self funding model as expeditiously as possible in closing i offer the following comments our positive financial and operational results in the first quarter continue to highlight our diversified low risk business strategy and reflect the strong performance of our legacy portfolio bolstered by continuing additions of high quality assets from our ongoing capital program today we are advancing a 30 billion suite of secured projects and have five distinct platforms for future growth in canadian u s and mexico natural gas pipelines liquids pipelines and power and storage our overall financial position remains solid supported by our strong credit ratings and a straightforward capital structure our overall financial position to fund our near term capital program through resilient and growing internally generated cash flow and ready access to capital markets on compelling terms supplemented further by capital recycling we will continue to make all funding decisions through the lens of per share metrics our portfolio of critical energy infrastructure projects is poised to generate significant growth and high quality long life earnings and cash flow for our shareholders that is expected to support annual dividend growth of 8 10 through 2021 success in adding to our growth portfolio in the coming years could augment or extend the company s dividend growth outlook further that s the end of my prepared remarks i ll now turn the call back over to david for the q a david moneta vice president of investor relations thanks don just a reminder before i turn it over to the conference coordinator for questions from the investment community we ask that you limit yourself to two questions and if you have any additional questions please reenter the queue with that i ll turn it back to the conference coordinator questions and answers operator certainly sir ladies and gentlemen we will now take questions from the telephone lines if you have a question and you re using a speakerphone please lift your handset before dialing your selection if you have a question you can register by dialing 1 on your telephone keypad and you can cancel your question if you wish by dialing the sign please press 1 at this time if you have a question the first question is from jeremy tonet at jp morgan please go ahead your line is now open jeremy tonet jp morgan analyst hi good afternoon i just want to start off with keystone xl here and i want to understand if fid has not been made at this point because of other issues outstanding with nebraska and so on how does that impact i guess the potential timeline if you were going to take fid it seems like you would have had to get the construction crews by now so maybe construction wouldn t happen this summer and the timeline would kind of be pushed back a bit here i also just wanted to know how you think that impacts your balance sheet and your leverage metrics and thoughts on portfolio management it seems like there are some reports out there about some sizable packages that could happen paul miller president of liquids pipelines jeremy it s paul here i ll start with the first question involving the construction timing on keystone xl we continue to work through the various legal and regulatory issues that we have in front of is and resolution of these will be critical to us moving forward on an fid decision in the meantime we have and continue to work on some construction preparation activities but what the current injunction imposed on us our ability to pursue a lot of those activities is somewhat restricted so at this point we have lost the 2019 construction season in the united states we continue our construction planning continue monitoring our progress on the various litigations that are out in front of us and once resolved we ll make a determination on construction start and duration of that construction program in regard to engaging resources such as contractors etcetera we continue to deal with the marketplace but we also continue to be very disciplined in our capital spending and what commitments we re going to make in the face of uncertainty don marchand executive vice president and chief financial officer hey jeremy it s don here first thing with respect to portfolio management we don t comment on specific rumors or processes running unless they re in the public domain and i wouldn t necessarily tie anything under way right now to kxl directly we look at portfolio management more holistically as something normal course in our dna now in terms of capital recycling in terms of kxl funding specifically we continue to look at funding scenarios that will refine as we get through the regulatory stage gates and closer to an fid and we get better cost and timing certainty if we re actually proceeding on that front as we mentioned before it s likely in all the above strategy probably not a lot of senior debt capacity through construction given our credit metric targets and absence of any cash flow until it would be in service certainly portfolio management continues in the normal course here kxl would bring some hybrid capacity probably 15 of the balance sheet growth would be funded through hybrids we would actively consider joint venture partners in terms of looking at the finance load per share metrics and risk sharing equity probably would be required in some form you could look to the drip the atm discreet issuance of some permutation it s kind of all open ended but we continue to work through cost timing and risk sharing and again on all of the above strategy on the funding side jeremy tonet jp morgan analyst that s helpful thanks for that just turning to the liquid side it seems like you guys have exceeded our estimates once again there and so i was wondering if you could just help us think through the level of kind of ratable earnings granted you guys the best majority of your earnings are stable but there is a component that is you re able to kind of capture spreads out there i m just wondering if you could give any type of sense for how much of that is already locked in this year just trying to better gauge how we think about the earnings potential from that segment don marchand executive vice president and chief financial officer sure let me walk through the components jeremy to your point a good point of the liquids business particularly around the keystone pipeline system is locked in the system itself the pipeline itself is 94 contracted with long term take or pay contracts and then the other 6 that we have for spot is a largely utilized so i would anticipate that portion to see similar results quarter over quarter plus and minus a half a cent the variability you see potentially is on the market link portion of the keystone pipeline system and it s good variability in that we continue to increase the capacity on the southern leg of our system investor day last year i indicated that we would be targeting about mid 700 000 barrel per day range on the southern end and we achieved that in the first quarter and you see that in the quarter over quarter results where probably about 0 02 of that increase is attributable to the higher volume on market length as is our practice as we increase this capacity we look to lock it down by way of long term contracts and we are in the marketplace today trying to lock down that incremental capacity with contracts another component of the variability is the liquids marketing results quarter over quarter you saw similar results and our results can be driven largely by the market differentials particularly the brent ti spread and when you look at where the spread was last quarter versus q1 approximately equal we saw similar results going forward q2 with what we have locked down and where the market s at i would anticipate q2 would be very similar q3 and q4 on the forward curves we see some weakness we will go in and out of the market as we see opportunities but with the forward curves today i would anticipate q3 may be 0 01 0 02 lower than what we saw in q1 and anticipate in q2 and depending on where the market moves and our performance we may see yet another penny decline in q4 but we will go and take advantage of those opportunities in the marketplace as they present themselves jeremy tonet jp morgan analyst that s very helpful thanks for taking my question don marchand executive vice president and chief financial officer you re welcome david moneta vice president of investor relations thanks jeremy operator thank you the next question is from linda ezergailis at td securities please go ahead your line is now open linda ezergailis td securities analyst thank you on page 18 you sight a simple understandable corporate structure and you re substantially there i did notice you were silent in terms of mentioning tc pipelines can you give us a comment on how you think tc pipelines fits into transcanada over the long term and how do you continuously assess the merits of it to remaining an mlp in your strategy don marchand executive vice president and chief financial officer hi linda it s don here yeah these are core assets but also note that versus peers in the industry our lp is a fairly small portion of a 100 billion balance sheet so it s not a pervasive vehicle for holding our assets i would continue to describe the lp as neither a source nor use of capital at this time drop downs are not a viable funding option right now but we continue to monitor the lp but i would say there are no distinct plans at this point to make any strategic move to change things up there linda ezergailis td securities analyst okay thank you for the update and just a question now on the ngtl application i m wondering maybe this is a question for tracy how might this kind of enhance the service offerings you can provide customers and maybe your business objectives are there any contentious aspects given that the regulator has decided to go to a hearing and could we see the mainline rate design and services evolve as well over time is this part of a bigger grander plan and maybe you can just give us an update on how you re thinking about that tracy robinson president of canadian natural gas pipelines sure linda thank you the application that went in on the ngtl was on rate design and it had two purposes really we restructured the design to more accurately reflect how volumes flow now on the ngtl system so there were some changes in tolls and services related to that secondly it took on this issue of how we toll the north montney mainline you will recall that we received some feedback from the board that a full roll in on north montney they felt wasn t appropriate we continue to believe it is appropriate but we took the guidance from the board with surcharge part of that application is a surcharge on the north montney mainline that is the piece that is going to go to a hearing before the board it s very complex it s very large it spans the full scope of the ngtl system and there are different points of view on it there are folks like us who believe montney should be a full roll in and there are others who believe it should not be so the board has decided to have that dialogue through a hearing and they have scheduled that hearing now as it relates to the mainline we are in the process of a very interesting dialogue with our customers right now as you know at the end of 2020 the rate base will separate between the western mainline and the eastern part of that network and that gives us some options some flexibility to think about tolls and services a little bit differently on that line that s dialogue that s under way right now and we would expect it to culminate later this year or earlier next year with an application to the board for the next iteration of the structure for the mainline in all cases what we re looking for are answers that will facilitate the competitive access of the basin s volume to market we have a basin that s prolific got some great wells very competitively priced gas and we want to be helpful in getting into any market linda ezergailis td securities analyst thank you and is this something that we ll get an update on maybe at your investor day this fall or sooner in terms of how it might be evolving or is it still very early tracy robinson president of canadian natural gas pipelines i think it s still very early it depends on how those conversations go so it may be investor day maybe a little bit later depending on it s a very complex topic and lots of different options as we think about the full flexibility that we have before us as an industry so later this year perhaps linda ezergailis td securities analyst thank you david moneta vice president of investor relations thanks linda operator thank you the next question is from rob hope at scotia bank please go ahead your line is now open rob hope scotia bank analyst good afternoon everyone i would like to circle back on your comments on keystone xl specifically how you think the path forward is in terms of the development timeline here will you kind of take your foot off the gas and wait until you get all the legal and regulatory challenges behind you and also how do you think about building a pipeline into the next administration paul miller president of liquids pipelines rob it s paul here i think the best way to describe it is our focus is managing the legal and the regulatory items in front of us because those ultimately have to be resolved before we move forward in consultation with our shipper group we remain disciplined in what resources we commit today to allow us to potentially start construction but we will not make any major capital commitments until we have a clear path to construction and that determination will be made once we have greater clarity around the legal and the regulatory hurdles in front of us rob hope scotia bank analyst all right and then thoughts on building it into the next administration paul miller president of liquids pipelines the next administration is going to be what it is keystone xl is a very important project for our industry and it s a very important project for north america and the construction start and the duration may overlap into the next administration we don t know but ultimately we will move forward with keystone xl when we have all the necessary approvals when we have identified and assessed all the risks and having those regulatory and legal issues behind us provide us with a level of comfort that will ultimately be able to construct this pipeline in normal course rob hope scotia bank analyst all right thank you for that then just switching over to the coastal gaslink when you look at the schedule there are there any key choke points we should be aware of that could push the schedule off there tracy robinson president of canadian natural gas pipelines no rob there aren t at this point we are under construction largely preconstruction activities along numerous points along that pipe path primarily clearing and setting up the camps we ll be into the heart of construction of laying pipe next year in 2020 and as of now i mean it s very early on in the project but as of now we are roughly where we would expect to be a little bit behind in the territory in which we ve had some opposition but we now have full access to the pipe path and remain in constant dialogue with all of our partners including the first nations along the right of way we are where we need to be right now rob hope scotia bank analyst thank you for the color david moneta vice president of investor relations thanks rob operator thank you the next question is from robert catellier at cibc capital markets please go ahead the line is now open robert catellier cibc capital markets analyst all right thank you i think i ll follow up on the coastal gas line as you go through the process here for the jurisdictional challenge are you getting any sense of what transitional provisions if any might be applicable should the jurisdiction change as part of this process in other words do you have the what s your sense of what you need to do if you have to change jurisdiction in terms of project review tracy robinson president of canadian natural gas pipelines robert i would tell you we are in the final stage of that process right now yesterday and today our teams are in front of the neb with the oral submissions which is the final step and i would note that we still we continue to believe that this project is properly positioned within the provincial jurisdiction of british columbia i would note that based on the evidence that s been submitted in the process the attorneys general of canada and of the provinces have all taken the same position we remain optimistic that that will be the outcome there is precedent as you know if the neb were to decide differently and point us toward a federal jurisdiction there is precedent as to how that transition would take place and it would be our expectation that that would be a very orderly transition robert catellier cibc capital markets analyst okay and then i mean other than reducing your ownership of keystone xl are there any other updated thoughts you could share on strategies to mitigate that last mile risk particularly now because it does look like it does go through another administration are there any other risk sharing mechanisms with shippers that are under consideration don marchand executive vice president and chief financial officer well robert we do have today risk sharing mechanisms with shippers on the development cost 50 50 but as we assess the last mile risk again we continue to methodically work the various issues in a very disciplined fashion and the key to the last mile risk is really to plan and prepare and minimize that variability and ultimately asses your efforts to mitigate the last mile risk leading into an fid where we re at today is we continue to identify and mitigate those risks but ultimately it s going to be at fid where we make that ultimate call on how good of a job we ve done robert catellier cibc capital markets analyst okay i guess what i m getting at here have you socialized these with rating agencies and lenders or do you approach your funding strategy differently in the current environment or is it sort of all of the above as you indicated earlier russ girling president and chief executive officer hey robert it s russ that s getting ahead of where we are first of all we have to determine whether we can get the permits and solve the legal issues that are in front of us today at that point we can assess what the risks are and at that point we can assess how we re going to finance it mitigate any risk that s left at the end of that period we re not at that point yet where we can have those conversations with those parties we do continue as paul said to have conversations with our shippers who have all indicated the importance of this project both producers in canada and the united states and refiners and as well you would note that there is a large conversation going on in the media right now on the importance of egress leaving western canada and the importance of that all of those things will be considered at the right time but it s premature to be considering rating agency comments and those kinds of things because at this point in time frankly we don t have anything to put in front of them robert catellier cibc capital markets analyst okay that s very helpful thank you operator thank you the next question is from robert kwan at rbc capital markets please go ahead your line is now open robert kwan rbc capital markets analyst all right good afternoon this is probably a question for stan just turning to the u s gas pipeline side of things and the opportunities that are in front of you there s within this projects under development in this other capacity capital 700 million you also have 500 million under secured i don t know if there s been some movement from the annual but in the projects under development that are new i m just wondering what types of things are you looking at and how does this tie back to what you had at investor day in terms of the eight or so projects that you highlighted stan chapman president of u s natural gas pipelines robert this is stan it is quite consistent with what we showed you at investor day there has been some movement on the capital table and the projects that are under development that you re referring to are projects that are essentially commercially secure but are still subject to fid by our counterparties we moved them over in that respect with respect to what s potentially coming down i would say the fundamentals in the industry particularly in the u s point to growth in terms of increased production they point to lng growth and they point to growth in power gen and as we sit right now we have projects in various stages of origination across virtually all of our pipes in the u s i would expect that perhaps as early as later this year you re going to see another supply push project a gts system which would be done in conjunction with tracy and the canadian gas team i would suggest that you re likely to see a power generation project or two on the columbia assets as we continue to see the need for additional natural gas power generation in that region and then we re going to continue to develop lng exports if you look at the two projects that we have in service right now cameron lng and then the eastern path of wbx plus the two projects that are pending third party fids we have about three bcf of lng export projects in the works right now and i think that there s a likelihood that you could see that number jump up to four bcf in the not too distant future continued growth opportunities and on top of all that we re still seeing growth in the appalachian basin despite what we re hearing from the producers the rig count is up about 10 since the end of december to 77 our production is on pace to grow out of the appalachian basin to the tune of about two to three bcf by the end of the year all of those are bullish on what we said that additional takeaway capacity is going to be needed out of the region perhaps sooner than we thought and our pipeline assets are uniquely situated to do just that robert kwan rbc capital markets analyst that s great color maybe just finishing on funding you ve got the 2 2 billion other kind of bucket that you laid out how does that number move around though from a credit metric perspective as you think about the drip which generally is probably better from a credit perspective than asset sales then as you think about asset sales what the decision making process is it really what sale price you think you can get versus your long term hold value or is there a bias to a stronger upfront valuation given that s a little bit more supportive of the credit metrics during your build out don marchand executive vice president and chief financial officer good question certainly drip is dollar for dollar equity whereas asset sales are releasing equity in some debt capacity there so not every dollar is created equal what s in that bucket is it is not 2 2 billion of pure equity put it that way we think some combination of drip that we have done to date and then we will evaluate drip at the next quarter as well depending on where we are on our projected credit metrics of being in the high fours for 2019 and 15 ffo to debt for this year as well how that weighs in with the cadence of bringing our projects in service we re watching sur de texas we re watching napanee as to when those thing come in service and that will influence our thinking we do have coolidge preparing to close here as i alluded to across the spectrum of asset sales we have stuff at varying stages here we won t get into the specific details of that but again there is stuff moving there in terms of sale versus whole value it s pretty important for us that we achieve at least our whole value on these assets but we are looking at per share metrics here what we re issuing stock at through a drip plan also informs us on that front that s kind of a long way of saying we factor all this in what you should take away from the portfolio management side is the 500 million of contracted ebitda and some reasonable multiple on top of that that number is substantially bigger than the 2 2 billion that s in that box right now so we re comfortable we can backfill that in with portfolio management we ll look at drip again in july and we should be able to track to at least we believe we ll be tracking to those credit metrics for the full year 2019 robert kwan rbc capital markets analyst okay and just on that valuation though it sounds like there is a bias to trying to sell assets that have a stronger upfront multiple don marchand executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah these are all contracted assets so some of them have longer contracts and shorter contracts that weigh into it but without getting into specific ebitda multiples on this stuff there s a bit of a cluster there russ girling president and chief executive officer i would say that on the principle we re probably driven more by value than multiple and we ll look at risk adjusted implied cost of capital that we can sell those assets at and to the extent that we can sell them at a cost of capital that we think is very attractive that s more what the driver is we look at shareholder value in terms of net present as opposed to multiple the multiple differences aren t going to make a large difference on our credit metrics at the end of the day so we re driven by shareholder value more than anything else don marchand executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah the other point to keep in mind here is cash taxes on these sales so the incident of cash taxes influence is the thinking as well robert kwan rbc capital markets analyst that s great thank you very much david moneta vice president of investor relations thanks robert operator thank you the next question is from andrew kuske at credit suisse please go ahead your line is now open andrew kuske credit suisse analyst thank you good afternoon my first question is just about columbia gas and just the year over year difference on what was generated in the quarter i m just curious if you have a breakdown handy on what amount of that was just plants and service versus just weather conditions where you had increased flow stan chapman president of u s natural gas pipelines yeah this is stan most of that is directly related to the phasing of the colombia projects at mountaineer and gulf xpress going into full commercial service as of march 15th there was a minor upside associated with the cold weather that we experienced toward the end of january but think of that predominantly as just the growth projects being placed in service andrew kuske credit suisse analyst okay that s very helpful and then probably a question for don just on the 500 million of ebitda the contracted ebitda that could be sales candidates do you have any kind of color on just the buckets of the business that 500 comes from don marchand executive vice president and chief financial officer no we won t comment on specific assets involved in that andrew kuske credit suisse analyst okay and then maybe just one final question a sort of broader question now that you ve gotten rid of a lot of the power business and you are giving out a lot of higher quality cash flows at this stage in time how has the overall risk management function changed within transcanada don marchand executive vice president and chief financial officer well as you look at the key buckets on the risk management side here i ll look at two specifically here first the counterparty risk as we ve sold off some contracted assets with fairly high quality counterparties it maybe moved marginally it really hasn t had that pervasive of an impact on counterparty risk in terms of market risk when you look at the assets that we ve sold the merchant northeast power business with the whole zone j capacity pricing market yeah the market risk aspects the company has dropped quite dramatically i would say we are 95 plus contracted ebitda now going forward the dissipation of that market risk has been quite pronounced russ girling president and chief executive officer yeah i think the predominant portion of that yield so as a sub 5 of variable ebitda the lion s share of that would be on the liquid side of our business and as paul pointed out our objective is to try to lock down that variability and continue to narrow that amount the portion of that 5 that exists in our power business is fairly small from where it used to be don marchand executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah the remaining price market price risk is really in alberta on our cogens and unregulated gas storage business volumetric flows and pricing and pricing on business would be the other aspect of that as russ mentioned andrew kuske credit suisse analyst okay that s great thank you david moneta vice president of investor relations thanks andrew operator thank you the next question is from shneur gershuni at ubs please go ahead your line is now open shneur gershuni ubs analyst thank you good afternoon guys one of my questions has been asked and answered i just wanted to circle back to the keystone xl question from before just to understand this correctly if you cross the t s and dot the i s on all of the regulatory issues you re not concerned about crossing administrations or are you concerned and could that be a potential delay factor paul miller president of liquids pipelines not concerned this is paul here the regulatory process which is laid out in front of us well defined and as always we ve been following that regulatory process to the t our regulatory process has been disrupted somewhat with some of the litigation that we re facing today the two primary pieces of litigation the challenge to the nebraska route approval by the public service commission that rests today with the nebraska supreme court and we await a decision from that court that is a final non appealable decision the second area of litigation revolves around the presidential president specifically the 2017 presidential permit with the issuance of the 2019 presidential permit it did three things it superseded the 2017 permit it rendered moot the challenges to the 2017 permit and it also clarified that the cross border approval was issued by the president acting under his constitutional authority with the issuance of that 2019 presidential permit we have applied to the us district appeals court to vacate the federal district court of montana s judgment including lifting the injunction with that litigation behind us it brings us back to the regulatory approvals and our construction strategy is to have those regulatory approvals all in place before we proceed on the construction management side the key to managing your last mile risk is to have all of your regulatory approvals have all of your land have all of your resources have all of your crews have all of your material and once we have clarity around our ability to move forward we will go out and secure those resources and then we ll start construction that process that start is not yet known and the duration will be a function of how much preconstruction planning we re able to perform between now and when we start construction and it may overlap into the next administration but with regulatory approvals in hand and the rule of law we feel comfortable constructing in that scenario shneur gershuni ubs analyst that makes sense and thank you for that clarity it s very appreciated maybe as a follow up and sticking on the regulatory front i was wondering if you can talk about the canadian regulatory situation bill c 69 how do you see it potentially impacting tc energy on an ongoing basis if it was to go through does it put anything at risk stan chapman president of u s natural gas pipelines i think on the public record we ve been pretty clear on c 69 that in its current form it s not a bill that we support and do believe that it could have significant negative impacts on both our base business and our ongoing expansion we ve been pretty specific and detailed in our responses to the consultation process and those are all well documented and we continue to work in those consultation processed to hopefully secure changes that would make that bill something that s more workable but in its current form we re not supportive of the bill shneur gershuni ubs analyst if the government changes hands in october would that make everything moot or do all parties support this stan chapman president of u s natural gas pipelines again i think probably similar to our answers on the previous questions with regard to keystone xl we believe that what we re doing is important and that energy demand continues to grow bringing new supply to market on new modern infrastructure is good for the economy job creation energy security national security across the board and i think those fundamentals transcend political parties on both sides of the border and in all political parties in canada there s no question that everybody understands the demand for energy continues to grow and that building modern infrastructure is the safest way to get that product from those who produce it to those who need it in between there there s a whole bunch of stuff noise but those fundamentals exist and that s we continue to be confident in our business but on a daily basis we have to work our way through these processes in our view what we do is fundamental and that hasn t changed over the last number of years shneur gershuni ubs analyst great thank you very much and enjoy the rest of your weekend david moneta vice president of investor relations thanks shneur operator thank you the next question is from jeremy rosenfield at industrial alliance please go ahead your line is now open jeremy rosenfield industrial alliance analyst thank you just a couple of cleanup questions here just on the motiva lateral can you provide any additional details in terms of the size of that potential investment and whether it gets rolled into the keystone system or cost recovery and the return is sort of stand alone there paul miller president of liquids pipelines hi jeremy it s paul here the motiva lateral we haven t disclosed the capital cost but it is included in our capital table under other with what s included in that bucket of 100 million of capital we do have a cost recovery mechanism in place but more importantly what it does do it attached the keystone pipeline system to the largest refinery in north america to the 630 000 barrel per day motiva refinery and this is consistent with some of our past activity over the last couple of years as we ve waited on the various approvals for keystone xl we have extended the reach of the keystone system into houston into texas city over to lake charles and the value of your pipe increases as you increase the liquidity both upstream and downstream the motiva lateral is another example of us extending the reach of the keystone pipeline system jeremy rosenfield industrial alliance analyst thank that was a good lead into my follow on question which was just around extensions of the system and whether you can move forward with some of the extensions of keystone potentially before actually keystone xl could potentially move forward with keystone xl that is what other upstream and downstream options are there that you could envision before kxl paul miller president of liquids pipelines kxl is the pipe section of the keystone system which runs from hardisty alberta down to steele city nebraska our footprint includes opportunities both upstream of that as well as downstream when i look upstream we have in place plans within the intra alberta marketplace we have a lot of opportunities in front of us the heartland pipeline which connects the edmonton market down to the hardisty market is a fully permitted pipeline by the regulator we have the grand rapids system which delivers crude from the production areas down into the edmonton market we had the opportunity to loop that again that loop is fully permitted these opportunities however are waiting for clarity around egress from alberta and with clarity around that egress from alberta the anticipation is you will see additional investment in alberta in the upstream which will necessitate additional infrastructure to move that crew to the market hubs such as edmonton and hardisty and ultimately down pipelines such as keystone and keystone xl on the southern end of the system we have seen increased production of crude oil coming out of the permian that has necessitated infrastructure to move those volumes to the marketplace we saw this increase and we reacted to this increase on our marketlink system which is south of cushing we took the opportunity to increase the capacity which was running at about 450 000 barrels per day a few years ago up to 750 000 barrels per day and as we see more opportunities to increase our capacity and our reach we will look at those opportunities today with the increase in capacity we ve achieved on marketlink we ve gone to the marketplace by way of an open season to see what sort of contract support we can get for both the existing capacity and in the event that we get into an oversubscribed position what additional capital we might deploy on the strength of these additional contracts to increase that capacity even further we re always looking for opportunities around the footprint and the nature of the keystone system footprint which runs right down the mid continent gives us opportunities right along the pipeline because that s where a lot of the emerging basins are jeremy rosenfield industrial alliance analyst when do you expect to have the results back from the open season on that marketlink initiative paul miller president of liquids pipelines we launched the open season mid april and we typically run for about 30 45 days then it typically takes anywhere from 30 to 60 days to work through credit and stuff like that so it could be about 60 65 70 days from now jeremy rosenfield industrial alliance analyst okay great thank you that s it for me paul miller president of liquids pipelines you re welcome david moneta vice president of investor relations thanks jeremy operator thank you the next question is from patrick kenney at national bank please go ahead your line is now open patrick kenney national bank analyst yeah hey guys i m just wondering if you could comment on the ngtl maintenance program for the summer perhaps compare it to last year in terms of not so much the financial impact but the operational impact on customers and if there s been any delay in kicking off the maintenance program here just given this beautiful spring weather out west right now tracy robinson president of canadian natural gas pipelines hi patrick it s tracy when we talk about a maintenance program on the ngtl system it s actually a combination of two things one is the maintenance and the other is the work that we do in the system to expand from a capital perspective we have a program this year that s going to run a fairly significant program but it will run an impact about what it looked like last year we ve done i think a good job in the last number of years of planning the maintenance program relative to the outages relative to the capital expansion work that we re doing and so we ve seen a fairly dramatic reduction in impact on our restrictions of flow in the pipe if you look at 2018 over 2017 our number of days that we restricted flow upstream james river the ability to get onto the pipe up there reduced by about half we re continuing to work to reduce that as we go forward we would expect this year to come in a little bit under that the workload is fairly heavy we have started on time and are on track on it and we expect that to continue over the course of the year but we re continuing to work to minimize the impact of that patrick kenney national bank analyst okay that s great i appreciate that then don i know you can t comment on specific assets for sale but just given the repairs at napanee will take us into late 2019 here and i assume that napanee represents a healthy portion of that 500 million of contracted ebitda it s safe to say that napanee is off the table for at least 2019 don marchand executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah as i mentioned earlier we won t comment on specific assets patrick kenney national bank analyst fair enough maybe just one last one here back to the marketlink open season paul i know also you can t talk specifics around where the system is today from a commercial perspective especially pre kxl but perhaps you can give us a sense as to what the longer term goal is for the system from a contracted versus spot basis just in order to maximize the risk adjusted return on the system paul miller president of liquids pipelines sure but probably again it s a bit of a good news story we typically plan it about 80 contracted on marketlink but there a bit of a lead leg here we increase the capacity and given the differentials we see the value for marketlink is considerable so we typically run full with a good portion of that being spot we go to an open season we contact that up to de risk and then we see the market is still looking for additional capacity so we increase the capacity on the system which increases really the spot component or decreases the contractual component and then we catch up i think a good run rate estimate given this step up is probably 80 in a scenario where we could contract it up 90 100 we would do that but again it s a bit of a good news story we re kind of always chasing the contracts after we increase the capacity we will see the results of the open season here in a couple months and we ll assess the next step or the next phase of capacity increase again depending on what sort of contractual support we achieve and where we think the market fundamentals are going patrick kenney national bank analyst okay that s great thanks everybody david moneta vice president of investor relations okay thanks pat operator thank you the next question is from alex kania at wolfe research please go ahead your line is now open alex kania wolfe research analyst hi there thanks very much these questions are for stan first you mentioned the accelerated need for appalachian takeaway potentially and certainly one thing that s come up recently is really the heightened legal pushback that some of these other takeaway are getting really in the fourth circuit how do you assess that risk and your exposure to that as you consider trying to figure out more takeaway solutions or is this just kind of 20 existing pipes and are there ways for you to potentially step in to help serve the demand in those areas if one or two of these pipes find it difficult to move forward ultimately stan chapman president of u s natural gas pipelines yeah great question and i would say that one thing that distinguishes many of our projects from some of our competitors is the fact that our projects tend to be in corridor expansions as opposed to greenfield bill which significantly de risks some of the environmental concerns that we re dealing with then secondly keep in mind we still have projects like our buckeye xpress which is a project where we re doing some work with respect to liability and integrity issues and rather than putting the same sized pipe in the ground we re going to put a bigger sized pipe in the ground that s going to be ready to go and in service in late 2020 early 21 as this initial production comes online shippers are not necessarily going to need to wait for a process to play out we ll have that capacity ready to go as i pointed out so far in 2019 we re seeing more production out of the basin than we thought with respect to whether or not we could potentially step in and provide an alternative route for some of the other projects out there that are that are facing these challenges in the courts the short answer is we can we have had very cursory discussions with some but obviously those third parties would prefer to build the projects themselves until we get a little bit further down the road where it s more definitive as to whether or not these projects are going to go we ll just keep that in the discussion phase and something that we may be able to pull out to help them at a later date alex kania wolfe research analyst great thanks david moneta vice president of investor relations operator thank you the next question is from michael lapides at goldman sachs please go ahead your line is now open michael lapides goldman sachs analyst hey guys an easy question on mexico and then one on the canadian gas pipeline business i m just curious in mexico when do you think with the pipelines under construction and in development you ll be at a full annual run rate ebitda is that a 2020 timeframe is that a 2021 timeframe or later francois poirier executive vice president of corporate development and strategy hey michael it s francois as i think we mentioned in the quarterly results we plan on bringing texas here into service shortly achieving mechanical completion here later in the month of may and then expect cfe to be declaring in service in the month of june on villa de reyes we plan on bringing that pipeline into service in three phases we have a northern segment a southern segment and then a lateral toward the west and we ve secured interruptible contracts with the cfe to be able to bring those portions into service as interconnections become available and gas is available as we ve indicated one or two of those portions we expect and are planning to put into service here in the second half of 2019 and then the balance in the first half of 2020 tuxpan tula as you know the 90 kilometer middle segment to obligation to conduct consultations we ve indicated that the estimated completion now has been pushed off to the end of 2020 we have achieved mechanical completion of the east and west segments of that pipeline and as with villa de reyes has secured interruptible contracts with the cfe to provide much needed gas supply to their power plants on those segments to answer your question based on those timelines i think you could expect to see a full run rate by the end of 2020 michael lapides goldman sachs analyst got it don marchand executive vice president and chief financial officer michael michael lapides goldman sachs analyst oh go ahead don marchand executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah michael it s don here i ll just remind everyone that we are being paid on all of these pipes through force majeure payments it s just the force majeure payments are not in ebitda they re going to balance sheet michael lapides goldman sachs analyst got it okay that s super helpful actually one small think on the mexico pipe business i noticed that some of the individual pipelines the ones that are already in service and operating actually saw year over year ebitda down in this quarter versus last year it s really small numbers but i was just curious is that the trajectory we should expect going forward should it be relatively flat year over year i m just curious glenn menuz vice president and controller michael it s glenn for the pipelines other than texas this quarter represents a pretty reasonable run rate michael lapides goldman sachs analyst run rate meaning it will decline each year glenn menuz vice president and controller no as in this will be the level going forward michael lapides goldman sachs analyst got it that sounds perfect then finally on the canadian gas pipeline business i noticed that volumes were relatively flat year over year is that due to pipeline restrain issues meaning obviously needing to continue to add capacity was that a weather related issue year over year a production issue meaning just due to less associated gas potentially given the crude production cuts i m just kind of curious on the volumetric side tracy robinson president of canadian natural gas pipelines michael the system actually over the quarter in all the cold weather performed extremely well this year and the pull out of the system on market was very strong we hit a new peak in the intra alberta of just over seven five that s a good news story where we did see we expected more receipts onto the system than we got and it is as you say that cold weather causes some problems on the production side so we had capacity that was not utilized on the receipt side of the business the system is bigger we moved 900 million cubic feet a day last year more through the system than we did the year before and we re continuing to grow it just in the cold weather months we had some issues in bringing those volumes on michael lapides goldman sachs analyst got it thank you guys much appreciated david moneta vice president of investor relations

comparable distributable cash flow these and certain other comparable measures are considered to be non gaap measures as a result they may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities they are provided to you in order to give you a better sense of tc energy s operating performance liquidity and its ability to generate funds to finance its operations with that i ll turn the call over to russ russ girling president and chief executive officer thank you david and good afternoon everyone and thank you very much for joining us here late on friday afternoon we recognize it s been a busy week for most of you before providing an update on our progress that we ve made over the last three months i d like to thank our shareholders again for supporting our name change earlier today at the annual meeting as explained when we announced the change in january we believed that tc energy better reflects our current position as one of north america s leading energy infrastructure companies with critical assets and dedicated employees across three countries canada the united states and mexico turning to our progress in early 2019 as highlighted in our quarterly report to shareholders during the first quarter our 100 billion portfolio of high quality long life energy infrastructure assets continued to perform from strong supply demand fundamentals in the core geographies that we serve and we continue to realize on the growth expected from our industry leading capital expansion program has replaced new long term contracted and rate regulated assets into service in a nutshell the demand for our infrastructure remains strong driving historically high utilization rates across all of our systems that combined with new assets entering service resulted in record first quarter earnings and cash flow evidence of this can be seen in our comparable earnings of 1 07 per share for the three months ended march 31 2019 during the quarter we also placed approximately 5 3 billion of new assets into service including the mountaineer and gulf xpress projects on our columbia systems as well as various ngtl system expansions today we are advancing approximately 30 billion of secured capital projects with approximately 7 billion of those projects expected to be completed by the end of this year we also continue to advance over 20 billion of projects under development including keystone xl and the refurbishment to five additional reactors at bruce power as part of their long term life extension program in addition we continue to make progress funding our capital program by raising approximately 1 2 billion early in 2019 that included 1 billion of 30 year term debt which was issued in april at compelling rates and 226 million of common equity under the dividend reinvestment program we also remain on track to complete the sale of our coolidge generating station in arizona for approximately 465 million u s by mid year and continue to progress in various other portfolio management activities looking forward we expect our strong operating and financial performance to continue and therefore 2019 comparable earnings per share are expected to be higher than the record results we produced in 2018 at the same time our overall financial position remains solid and we believe that we re well positioned to achieve our targeted credit metrics in 2019 don will provide more detail on our first quarter finance results in funding in a few moments but before that i ll expand on some of the recent developments beginning with a brief review of our financial results excluding certain specific items comparable earnings were 987 million or 1 07 per share in the first quarter an increase of 123 million or 0 09 per share over the same period in 2018 that equates to a 9 increase on a per share basis after recognizing the effect of common shares issued under the dividend reinvestment program in 2018 and 2019 and our atm program in 2018 comparable ebitda increased 320 million to approximately 2 4 billion while comparable funds generated from operations of 1 8 billion were 180 million higher than the first quarter of 2018 based on the strength of our financial performance and our growth outlook the board of directors today declared a second quarter dividend of 0 75 per common share which is equivalent to 3 per share on an annual basis this represents an 8 7 increase over the amount declared in the second quarter of 2018 and equates to a payout of approximately 75 of comparable earnings and 40 of internally generated cash flow leaving us with the financial capacity to continue to invest in our businesses next i d like to make a few comments about our five operating businesses firstly in canadian natural gas customer demand for access to our systems remains strong and we continue to work with the industry on options to connect growing western canadian gas to markets across north america evidence of that demand for our services can be seen in the volumes that we transported across our network our ngtl system delivered an average of 13 5 billion cubic feet a day in the first quarter consistent with the volume that we transported over the same period last year on the canadian mainline total deliveries averaged 5 9 billion cubic feet a day in the first quarter today we are advancing about 8 6 billion of expansion program on the ngtl system that will add approximately 3 billion cubic feet per day of incremental delivery capacity to the system by the end of 22 we also continue to actively work with lng canada on our coastal gaslink pipeline project following a positive final investment decision last october on their lng terminal in kitimat british columbia the 6 2 billion pipeline project will have an initial capacity of 2 1 billion cubic feet a day with the potential of expansion up to 5 billion cubic feet a day all of the necessary regulatory permits have been received to allow us to proceed and pre construction activities continue at many locations along the pipeline route moving to our u s natural gas pipelines where the demand for our services reached record levels as highlighted previously our broad network has historically served about 25 of u s demand on a daily basis more recently winter deliveries averaged 24 4 billion cubic feet a day and the cold temperatures that grip much of north american in late january and early february led to a peak day delivery record for our company in the united states of 33 1 billion cubic feet a day on january 30 in addition to moving record volumes on our existing us systems during the first quarter we continued to advance 5 8 billion of secured expansion projects columbia s mountaineer xpress along with gulf xpress projects were phased into service over the first quarter of 2019 at the same time we continue to identify new opportunities across our broader us natural gas pipeline portfolio to connect marcellus and western canadian sedimentary supply to markets an example of that is our grand chenier xpress project which was sanctioned in february it s an a r pipeline project that will connect supply directly to the gulf coast lng export markets through additional compression facilities subject to a positive customer fid the project is expected to enter service in two phases over the 2021 and 2022 period at a cost of about 200 million u s turning to mexico where we re advancing construction on three pipelines at a total cost of about 3 billion while the sur de texas pipeline has experienced force majeure events that have delayed in service construction and commissioning activities are progressing such that we anticipate mechanical completion in may with an expected june in service date construction on the villa de reyes project is ongoing with a phased in service anticipated to commence in the second half of 2019 finally the construction on the central segment of the tula project has been delayed due to lack of progress on indigenous consultations by the mexican government as a result we expect that project to enter service toward the end of 2020 we have negotiated separate cfe contracts that would allow certain segments of the tula villa de reyes project to be placed in service when the facilities are complete and gas is available turning to our liquids business which produced very strong results in the quarter keystone which is underpinned by long haul take or pay contracts for about 550 000 barrels a day essentially ran at capacity in the first quarter moving an average of 590 000 barrels a day on the southern portion of the system or what we call the u s gulf coast segment capacity was increased throughout 2018 reaching approximately 700 000 barrels a day by year end as capacity increased we maintained near full utilization rates in the fourth quarter and again into the first quarter of 2019 in addition we continued to benefit from a higher contribution from liquids marketing activities largely due to improved volumes and margins as a result of favorable market conditions on the project development side commissioning has been completed on the 200 million white spruce pipeline and commercial in service was achieved here early in may also in the first quarter we entered into an agreement with motiva to construct a pipeline to connect between the keystone pipeline system and motiva s 630 000 barrels a day refinery in port arthur that connection is targeted to be operational in the second quarter of 2020 finally in the liquids business during the first quarter we continued to advance keystone xl in late march the u s president issued a new presidential permit for the project which supersedes the 2017 permit the president s actions clarify the national importance of keystone xl and aims to bring more than 10 years of environmental review to closure president trump has been clear that he wants to create the jobs and advance us energy security and keystone xl does both of these things in an environmentally sustainable and responsible way we thank him for his leadership and steadfast support of this critical energy infrastructure project also with respect to keystone xl in nebraska which as you know we received approval of the route in the state however as you know that decision has been challenged we expect the nebraska supreme court could reach a decision in the second quarter of 19 with respect to an appeal of the nebraska public service commission s approval of our route we continue to participate together with the u s department of justice in lawsuits commenced in montana to defend legal challenges to the u s presidential permit and the exhaustive environmental assessments that support the u s president s actions we ve secured commercial support for all available capacity on the keystone xl system and we remain committed to the project we continue to carefully and methodically obtain the regulatory and legal approvals necessary before we advance the project to construction turning now to power and storage which was previously known as the energy segment the name change was made to better describe our assets and operations in the segment it does not imply any change in strategy or have any impact on previously recorded segmented results in power and storage we experienced equipment failure on the 1 7 billion napanee project while progressing commissioning activities on the plant during the first quarter as a result we now expect the 900 megawatt plant to be placed into service in the second half of 29 once that equipment is repaired work also continues on the bruce power life extension project where we expect to invest approximately 2 2 billion in bruce power s unit 6 program as well as the ongoing asset management program through 2023 when unit 6 refurbishment is complete bruce power s contracted price of approximately 68 00 per megawatt hour increased to approximate 75 00 per megawatt hour on april 1 2019 to reflect the capital to be invested under these programs as well as a normal annual inflation adjustment finally in the power and storage segment we have entered into an agreement to sell our coolidge generating station in arizona for approximately 465 million or 620 million canadian the sale is expected to close mid 2019 this sale allows us to serve a significant value for mature assets that represented less than 10 of our generating capacity and then redeploy that capital into our 30 billion secured capital program thereby reducing our need for external capital including common equity in summary today we are advancing 30 billion of secure projects that are expected to enter service by 2023 it includes approximately 5 billion of maintenance capital 85 of which is related to our rate regulated natural gas pipelines and therefore is expected to be added to rate base and generate a return on enough capital identical to that which we realize on expansion projects we have invested approximately 10 billion into that program to date with approximately 7 billion of those projects expected to enter service in 2019 the projects expected to be completed this year includes the 2 8 billion of the ngtl expansions as well as the sur de texas natural gas pipeline in mexico and the napanee gas fired power plant in ontario notably all of these projects are underpinned by cost of service regulation or long term contracts giving us a high degree of visibility to the earnings and cash flow that we generate as they enter service this highlights the significant growth in ebitda that is expected as we continue to advance our secured capital program as you can see on this chart comparable ebitda which has increased from 5 9 billion in 2015 to 8 6 billion in 2018 is expected to reach approximately 10 billion by 2021 that equates to a compound average growth rate of about 9 over the six year period and just as important as the magnitude of that growth is the quality of the growth with over 95 of our ebitda coming from regulated assets or long term contracts in addition as i said we are advancing 20 billion of projects currently under development any one of those projects could further enhance our growth profile as well as our strong competitive north american position based on our confidence in our growth plans we expect to continue to grow the dividend at an average annual rate of 8 10 through 2021 and as always it has been our practice the growth of dividends is expected to be supported by sustainable growth in earnings and cash flow on a per share basis and strong distributable cash flow coverage ratios in summary i ll leave you with the following key messages today we are a leading north american energy infrastructure company with a strong track record of delivering long term shareholder value our assets are critical to the functioning of the north american economy and the demand for our services remains strong in 2018 our 100 billion asset portfolio generated 8 6 billion of annual ebitda with approximately 95 coming from regulated businesses or long term contracted assets looking forward we have five significant platforms for growth canadian us and mexican gas pipelines liquids pipelines and power and storage just as we have done since 2000 as we advanced our 30 billion secured capital program we expect to deliver continuous growth in earnings and cash flow and dividends on a per share basis in addition we have over 20 billion of projects that are in the advanced stages of development and we expect numerous other outgrowth opportunities to emanate from our existing extensive critical assets footprint we have a long history of prudently funding our capital programs and we are on track to continue to de lever our balance sheet post the 2016 acquisition of columbia and achieve our targeted credit metrics here in 2019 that concludes my prepared remarks i ll turn the call over to don he ll provide more details on our first quarter financial results don marchand executive vice president and chief financial officer great thanks russ and good afternoon everyone as outlined in our quarterly report issued earlier today we re pleased to report that net income attributable common shares increased by 270 million to 1 billion or 1 09 per share in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 734 million or 0 83 per share for the same period in 2018 first quarter 2019 and 2018 results included an after tax loss of 12 million and an after tax gain of 6 million respectively related to the run off of our u s northeast power marketing contracts these specific items as well as unrealized gains and losses from changes in risk management activities are excluded from comparable earnings comparable earnings in the first quarter rose by 123 million to 987 million or 1 07 per share compared 864 million or 0 98 per share in 2018 representing a 9 increase on a per share basis per share amounts account for the dilutive impact of common shares issued under our dividend reinvestment plan in 2018 and 2019 and at the market program in 2018 our positive results reflect broad operational strength and solid cash generation particularly in canadian and u s natural gas pipelines along with liquids pipelines turning to our business segment results on slide 15 in the first quarter comparable ebitda from our five operating businesses was approximately 2 4 billion a 320 million or 16 increase year over year note that we do not include afudc which amounted to 139 million in the quarter in ebitda as outlined in the quarterly report canadian natural gas pipeline s comparable ebitda of 556 million was 62 million higher than for the same period in 2018 the increase was primarily due to the recovery of depreciation and increased rates approved in both ngtl in 2018 2019 settlement and the mainline neb 2018 decision as well as higher flow through taxes and incentive earnings in terms of year over year comparison as a result of the timing of the neb 2018 decision the full year impact of higher depreciation flow through taxes and incentive earnings on the mainline was not reflected until the fourth quarter of 2018 i would note that for canadian natural gas pipelines changes in depreciation financial charges and income taxes impact comparable ebitda but do not have a significant impact on net income as they are almost entirely recovered in revenues on a flow through basis net income for the ngtl system increased 21 million compared to first quarter 2018 because of a higher average investment base and reflects an improved roe of 10 1 on 40 deemed equity net income for the canadian mainline increased by 7 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to the same period last year mainly due to higher incentive earnings the 2018 neb decision previously mentioned preserved the incentive arrangement in place since 2015 along with an improved roe of 10 1 on 40 deemed equity us natural gas pipeline s comparable ebitda of 730 million u s or 972 million canadian increased by 95 million u s or 168 million canadian compared to the same period in 2018 mainly due to increased earnings from columbia gas and columbia gulf growth projects placed in service partially offset by decreased earnings in bison due to 2018 customer agreements to pay out their future contracted obligations and terminate their contracts mexico natural gas pipeline s comparable ebitda of 110 million u s or 146 million canadian decreased 17 million u s or 14 million canadian compared to first quarter 2018 driven primarily by lower recorded revenues from operations as a result of changes in timing of revenue recognition in 2018 and lower equity earnings from our investment in the sur de texas pipeline note that while in construction sur de texas records afudc net of interest expense on an inter affiliate loan which amount is fully offset in interest income and other in the corporate segment liquids pipeline s comparable ebitda rose by 132 million to 563 million driven by higher volumes on the keystone pipeline system and a higher contribution from liquids marketing activities as a result of increased volumes and margins as mentioned by russ to better describe our assets and operations the previously disclosed energy segment has been renamed power and storage comparable power and storage ebitda decreased by 25 million year over year to 151 million due to decreased western and eastern power results largely resulting from the sale of our interest in the cartier wind power facilities in october 2018 and costs related to napanee s delayed in service these were partially offset by wider realized natural gas storage price spreads and stronger bruce power results due to the net effect of positive fair value adjustments and other returns on investment supporting employee post retirement benefits and lower volumes and revenue resulting from higher outage days for all our businesses with u s dollar denominated income including u s natural gas pipelines mexico natural gas pipelines and parts of liquids pipelines and power and storage canadian dollar translated ebitda was positively impacted by a stronger u s dollar versus the first quarter of 2018 this was largely offset by higher translated interest expense on u s dollar denominated debt and realized hedging losses reported in comparable interest income in other as our u s dollar denominated operations continue to grow our exposure to foreign exchange movements will increase a sizable portion of which is naturally offset by interest expense on u s dollar denominated debt the residual balance is actively managed on a rolling one year forward basis using foreign exchange derivatives however the natural exposure beyond that period remains now turning to the other income statement items on slide 16 depreciation and amortization of 608 million increased 73 million versus first quarter 2018 largely on account of higher composite depreciation rates approved in the mainline neb 2018 decision and the ngtl 2018 2019 settlement new facilities entering service across our businesses and the impact of a stronger u s dollar partially offset by the sale of our interests in the cartoon cartier wind power facilities in 2018 and the cessation of depreciation on our coolidge generating station upon classification is held for sale at december 31 2018 interest expense included in comparable earnings of 586 million was 59 million higher year over year as a result of new long term debt issuances net of maturities higher levels of short term borrowing and the foreign exchange impact of a stronger u s dollar on translation of the u s dollar denominated interest partially offset by higher capitalized interest related to napanee and keystone xl afudc rose by 34 million to 139 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 an increase in canadian dollar denominated afudc was primarily due to capital expenditures on our ngtl system while an increase in u s dollar denominated afudc was driven by continued investment in u s natural gas pipelines and mexico projects comparable interest income and other declined 34 million year over year primarily as a result of realized hedging losses on foreign exchange management in the first quarter of 2019 compared to realized gains in 2018 partially offset by higher interest income related to the intra affiliate loan receivable from the sur de texas joint venture described earlier offsetting the corresponding interest expense recorded in comparable ebitda even though they fully offset on consolidation gaap requires that we report the interest income and expense elements of this loan separately in the financial statements income tax expense included in comparable earnings was 228 million in first quarter 2019 compared to 171 million for the same period last year primarily due to higher comparable earnings before income taxes higher flow through taxes in canadian natural gas pipelines and lower foreign tax rate differentials net income attributable to non controlling interest increased by 7 million for three months ended march 31 2019 mostly due to higher earnings in tc pipelines lp and the impact of a stronger u s dollar in 2019 on their translation to canadian dollars finally preferred share dividends were comparable to first quarter 2018 now moving to cash flow and distributable cash flow on slide 17 comparable funds generated from operations were approximately 1 8 billion in the first quarter reflecting an increase of 180 million year over year driven largely by higher comparable earnings as well as the recovery of higher depreciation for both the canadian mainline and ngtl system distributable cash flow reflecting only non recoverable maintenance capital was just over 1 6 billion or 1 76 per share compared to approximately 1 4 billion or 1 63 per share in the first quarter of 2018 resulting in a coverage ratio of 2 3 times now turning to slide 18 during the first quarter we invested approximately 2 3 billion in our capital program and successfully funded it primarily through our strong and growing internally generated cash flow notes payable and common equity from our dividend reinvestment plan our dividend reinvestment plan or drip continues to provide incremental subordinated capital in support of our growth and credit metrics in the first quarter the participation rate among common shareholders was approximately 33 representing 226 million of reinvestment also in the first quarter we received a distribution of 120 million from bruce power relating to their issuance of senior notes in the capital markets in december last year we entered into an agreement to sell our coolidge generating station for approximately 465 million u s or 620 million canadian the sale was subject to a third party right of first refusal which was subsequently exercised and will result in an estimated 55 million after tax gain to be recognized upon closing of the transaction which is expected to occur in mid 2019 in april we raised 1 billion through an offering of 30 year senior unsecured notes in the canadian market at a rate of 4 34 funding activity continues to highlight the depth and diversity of the financing options available to us allowing us to prudently fund our capital program and achieve targeted credit metrics now turning to slide 19 this graphic highlights are forecasted sources and uses of funds through 2021 starting in the left column the gross funding requirement over the next three years is projected to be 29 billion comprised of dividend and non controlling interest distributions of approximately 10 billion and capital expenditures of approximately 19 billion including maintenance capital as a reminder we are pursuing joint venture partners as well as potential asset level financing toward funding the 6 2 billion coastal gaslink project the expenditure will be spread over approximately four years with the bulk of it in 2020 and 2021 for purposes of our funding program outlook we assume we retain a 25 interest in coastal gaslink which is reflected in our capital requirements the second column highlights aggregate sources including approximately 21 billion of internally generated cash flow an estimated 700 million of proceeds from our dividend reinvestment plan for the january through july 2019 dividend payments as well as 620 million of proceeds from the sale of coolidge generating station that leaves a capital markets requirement of approximately 6 7 billion in the far right column aside from refinancing normal course maturities we expect to issue approximately 3 billion of incremental senior debt through 2021 within the constraints of our targeted credit metrics of debt to ebitda in high fours and minimum ffo to debt of 15 additionally we expect to issue 1 5 billion of hybrids maintaining these securities along with preferred shares at about 15 of our capital structure the remaining 2 2 billion as illustrated in the top right box will be comprised of activities such as incremental drip proceeds beyond the dividend most recently declared and portfolio management drip remains a quarter to quarter decision influenced by financial performance against targeted credit metrics along with the cadence of getting new assets into service and the timing of asset sales aside from coolidge we have assets generating approximately 500 million in annual contracted ebitda that have been identified as potential viable portfolio management candidates applying a reasonable multiple the associated proceeds would notably exceed our residual funding requirement as in the past while we generally do not pre announce targeted asset sales silence should not be construed as inactivity in summary we believe our external funding needs are eminently achievable in the context of the multiple financing levers available and the clear accretive and credit supportive use of proceeds all decisions are evaluated on a per share basis and further share count increases will be assessed against additional portfolio management we reiterate that we do not foresee a need for discreet equity to complete our secured 30 billion capital program and our goal is to revert to our historical self funding model as expeditiously as possible in closing i offer the following comments our positive financial and operational results in the first quarter continue to highlight our diversified low risk business strategy and reflect the strong performance of our legacy portfolio bolstered by continuing additions of high quality assets from our ongoing capital program today we are advancing a 30 billion suite of secured projects and have five distinct platforms for future growth in canadian u s and mexico natural gas pipelines liquids pipelines and power and storage our overall financial position remains solid supported by our strong credit ratings and a straightforward capital structure our overall financial position to fund our near term capital program through resilient and growing internally generated cash flow and ready access to capital markets on compelling terms supplemented further by capital recycling we will continue to make all funding decisions through the lens of per share metrics our portfolio of critical energy infrastructure projects is poised to generate significant growth and high quality long life earnings and cash flow for our shareholders that is expected to support annual dividend growth of 8 10 through 2021 success in adding to our growth portfolio in the coming years could augment or extend the company s dividend growth outlook further that s the end of my prepared remarks i ll now turn the call back over to david for the q a david moneta vice president of investor relations thanks don just a reminder before i turn it over to the conference coordinator for questions from the investment community we ask that you limit yourself to two questions and if you have any additional questions please reenter the queue with that i ll turn it back to the conference coordinator questions and answers operator certainly sir ladies and gentlemen we will now take questions from the telephone lines if you have a question and you re using a speakerphone please lift your handset before dialing your selection if you have a question you can register by dialing 1 on your telephone keypad and you can cancel your question if you wish by dialing the sign please press 1 at this time if you have a question the first question is from jeremy tonet at jp morgan please go ahead your line is now open jeremy tonet jp morgan analyst hi good afternoon i just want to start off with keystone xl here and i want to understand if fid has not been made at this point because of other issues outstanding with nebraska and so on how does that impact i guess the potential timeline if you were going to take fid it seems like you would have had to get the construction crews by now so maybe construction wouldn t happen this summer and the timeline would kind of be pushed back a bit here i also just wanted to know how you think that impacts your balance sheet and your leverage metrics and thoughts on portfolio management it seems like there are some reports out there about some sizable packages that could happen paul miller president of liquids pipelines jeremy it s paul here i ll start with the first question involving the construction timing on keystone xl we continue to work through the various legal and regulatory issues that we have in front of is and resolution of these will be critical to us moving forward on an fid decision in the meantime we have and continue to work on some construction preparation activities but what the current injunction imposed on us our ability to pursue a lot of those activities is somewhat restricted so at this point we have lost the 2019 construction season in the united states we continue our construction planning continue monitoring our progress on the various litigations that are out in front of us and once resolved we ll make a determination on construction start and duration of that construction program in regard to engaging resources such as contractors etcetera we continue to deal with the marketplace but we also continue to be very disciplined in our capital spending and what commitments we re going to make in the face of uncertainty don marchand executive vice president and chief financial officer hey jeremy it s don here first thing with respect to portfolio management we don t comment on specific rumors or processes running unless they re in the public domain and i wouldn t necessarily tie anything under way right now to kxl directly we look at portfolio management more holistically as something normal course in our dna now in terms of capital recycling in terms of kxl funding specifically we continue to look at funding scenarios that will refine as we get through the regulatory stage gates and closer to an fid and we get better cost and timing certainty if we re actually proceeding on that front as we mentioned before it s likely in all the above strategy probably not a lot of senior debt capacity through construction given our credit metric targets and absence of any cash flow until it would be in service certainly portfolio management continues in the normal course here kxl would bring some hybrid capacity probably 15 of the balance sheet growth would be funded through hybrids we would actively consider joint venture partners in terms of looking at the finance load per share metrics and risk sharing equity probably would be required in some form you could look to the drip the atm discreet issuance of some permutation it s kind of all open ended but we continue to work through cost timing and risk sharing and again on all of the above strategy on the funding side jeremy tonet jp morgan analyst that s helpful thanks for that just turning to the liquid side it seems like you guys have exceeded our estimates once again there and so i was wondering if you could just help us think through the level of kind of ratable earnings granted you guys the best majority of your earnings are stable but there is a component that is you re able to kind of capture spreads out there i m just wondering if you could give any type of sense for how much of that is already locked in this year just trying to better gauge how we think about the earnings potential from that segment don marchand executive vice president and chief financial officer sure let me walk through the components jeremy to your point a good point of the liquids business particularly around the keystone pipeline system is locked in the system itself the pipeline itself is 94 contracted with long term take or pay contracts and then the other 6 that we have for spot is a largely utilized so i would anticipate that portion to see similar results quarter over quarter plus and minus a half a cent the variability you see potentially is on the market link portion of the keystone pipeline system and it s good variability in that we continue to increase the capacity on the southern leg of our system investor day last year i indicated that we would be targeting about mid 700 000 barrel per day range on the southern end and we achieved that in the first quarter and you see that in the quarter over quarter results where probably about 0 02 of that increase is attributable to the higher volume on market length as is our practice as we increase this capacity we look to lock it down by way of long term contracts and we are in the marketplace today trying to lock down that incremental capacity with contracts another component of the variability is the liquids marketing results quarter over quarter you saw similar results and our results can be driven largely by the market differentials particularly the brent ti spread and when you look at where the spread was last quarter versus q1 approximately equal we saw similar results going forward q2 with what we have locked down and where the market s at i would anticipate q2 would be very similar q3 and q4 on the forward curves we see some weakness we will go in and out of the market as we see opportunities but with the forward curves today i would anticipate q3 may be 0 01 0 02 lower than what we saw in q1 and anticipate in q2 and depending on where the market moves and our performance we may see yet another penny decline in q4 but we will go and take advantage of those opportunities in the marketplace as they present themselves jeremy tonet jp morgan analyst that s very helpful thanks for taking my question don marchand executive vice president and chief financial officer you re welcome david moneta vice president of investor relations thanks jeremy operator thank you the next question is from linda ezergailis at td securities please go ahead your line is now open linda ezergailis td securities analyst thank you on page 18 you sight a simple understandable corporate structure and you re substantially there i did notice you were silent in terms of mentioning tc pipelines can you give us a comment on how you think tc pipelines fits into transcanada over the long term and how do you continuously assess the merits of it to remaining an mlp in your strategy don marchand executive vice president and chief financial officer hi linda it s don here yeah these are core assets but also note that versus peers in the industry our lp is a fairly small portion of a 100 billion balance sheet so it s not a pervasive vehicle for holding our assets i would continue to describe the lp as neither a source nor use of capital at this time drop downs are not a viable funding option right now but we continue to monitor the lp but i would say there are no distinct plans at this point to make any strategic move to change things up there linda ezergailis td securities analyst okay thank you for the update and just a question now on the ngtl application i m wondering maybe this is a question for tracy how might this kind of enhance the service offerings you can provide customers and maybe your business objectives are there any contentious aspects given that the regulator has decided to go to a hearing and could we see the mainline rate design and services evolve as well over time is this part of a bigger grander plan and maybe you can just give us an update on how you re thinking about that tracy robinson president of canadian natural gas pipelines sure linda thank you the application that went in on the ngtl was on rate design and it had two purposes really we restructured the design to more accurately reflect how volumes flow now on the ngtl system so there were some changes in tolls and services related to that secondly it took on this issue of how we toll the north montney mainline you will recall that we received some feedback from the board that a full roll in on north montney they felt wasn t appropriate we continue to believe it is appropriate but we took the guidance from the board with surcharge part of that application is a surcharge on the north montney mainline that is the piece that is going to go to a hearing before the board it s very complex it s very large it spans the full scope of the ngtl system and there are different points of view on it there are folks like us who believe montney should be a full roll in and there are others who believe it should not be so the board has decided to have that dialogue through a hearing and they have scheduled that hearing now as it relates to the mainline we are in the process of a very interesting dialogue with our customers right now as you know at the end of 2020 the rate base will separate between the western mainline and the eastern part of that network and that gives us some options some flexibility to think about tolls and services a little bit differently on that line that s dialogue that s under way right now and we would expect it to culminate later this year or earlier next year with an application to the board for the next iteration of the structure for the mainline in all cases what we re looking for are answers that will facilitate the competitive access of the basin s volume to market we have a basin that s prolific got some great wells very competitively priced gas and we want to be helpful in getting into any market linda ezergailis td securities analyst thank you and is this something that we ll get an update on maybe at your investor day this fall or sooner in terms of how it might be evolving or is it still very early tracy robinson president of canadian natural gas pipelines i think it s still very early it depends on how those conversations go so it may be investor day maybe a little bit later depending on it s a very complex topic and lots of different options as we think about the full flexibility that we have before us as an industry so later this year perhaps linda ezergailis td securities analyst thank you david moneta vice president of investor relations thanks linda operator thank you the next question is from rob hope at scotia bank please go ahead your line is now open rob hope scotia bank analyst good afternoon everyone i would like to circle back on your comments on keystone xl specifically how you think the path forward is in terms of the development timeline here will you kind of take your foot off the gas and wait until you get all the legal and regulatory challenges behind you and also how do you think about building a pipeline into the next administration paul miller president of liquids pipelines rob it s paul here i think the best way to describe it is our focus is managing the legal and the regulatory items in front of us because those ultimately have to be resolved before we move forward in consultation with our shipper group we remain disciplined in what resources we commit today to allow us to potentially start construction but we will not make any major capital commitments until we have a clear path to construction and that determination will be made once we have greater clarity around the legal and the regulatory hurdles in front of us rob hope scotia bank analyst all right and then thoughts on building it into the next administration paul miller president of liquids pipelines the next administration is going to be what it is keystone xl is a very important project for our industry and it s a very important project for north america and the construction start and the duration may overlap into the next administration we don t know but ultimately we will move forward with keystone xl when we have all the necessary approvals when we have identified and assessed all the risks and having those regulatory and legal issues behind us provide us with a level of comfort that will ultimately be able to construct this pipeline in normal course rob hope scotia bank analyst all right thank you for that then just switching over to the coastal gaslink when you look at the schedule there are there any key choke points we should be aware of that could push the schedule off there tracy robinson president of canadian natural gas pipelines no rob there aren t at this point we are under construction largely preconstruction activities along numerous points along that pipe path primarily clearing and setting up the camps we ll be into the heart of construction of laying pipe next year in 2020 and as of now i mean it s very early on in the project but as of now we are roughly where we would expect to be a little bit behind in the territory in which we ve had some opposition but we now have full access to the pipe path and remain in constant dialogue with all of our partners including the first nations along the right of way we are where we need to be right now rob hope scotia bank analyst thank you for the color david moneta vice president of investor relations thanks rob operator thank you the next question is from robert catellier at cibc capital markets please go ahead the line is now open robert catellier cibc capital markets analyst all right thank you i think i ll follow up on the coastal gas line as you go through the process here for the jurisdictional challenge are you getting any sense of what transitional provisions if any might be applicable should the jurisdiction change as part of this process in other words do you have the what s your sense of what you need to do if you have to change jurisdiction in terms of project review tracy robinson president of canadian natural gas pipelines robert i would tell you we are in the final stage of that process right now yesterday and today our teams are in front of the neb with the oral submissions which is the final step and i would note that we still we continue to believe that this project is properly positioned within the provincial jurisdiction of british columbia i would note that based on the evidence that s been submitted in the process the attorneys general of canada and of the provinces have all taken the same position we remain optimistic that that will be the outcome there is precedent as you know if the neb were to decide differently and point us toward a federal jurisdiction there is precedent as to how that transition would take place and it would be our expectation that that would be a very orderly transition robert catellier cibc capital markets analyst okay and then i mean other than reducing your ownership of keystone xl are there any other updated thoughts you could share on strategies to mitigate that last mile risk particularly now because it does look like it does go through another administration are there any other risk sharing mechanisms with shippers that are under consideration don marchand executive vice president and chief financial officer well robert we do have today risk sharing mechanisms with shippers on the development cost 50 50 but as we assess the last mile risk again we continue to methodically work the various issues in a very disciplined fashion and the key to the last mile risk is really to plan and prepare and minimize that variability and ultimately asses your efforts to mitigate the last mile risk leading into an fid where we re at today is we continue to identify and mitigate those risks but ultimately it s going to be at fid where we make that ultimate call on how good of a job we ve done robert catellier cibc capital markets analyst okay i guess what i m getting at here have you socialized these with rating agencies and lenders or do you approach your funding strategy differently in the current environment or is it sort of all of the above as you indicated earlier russ girling president and chief executive officer hey robert it s russ that s getting ahead of where we are first of all we have to determine whether we can get the permits and solve the legal issues that are in front of us today at that point we can assess what the risks are and at that point we can assess how we re going to finance it mitigate any risk that s left at the end of that period we re not at that point yet where we can have those conversations with those parties we do continue as paul said to have conversations with our shippers who have all indicated the importance of this project both producers in canada and the united states and refiners and as well you would note that there is a large conversation going on in the media right now on the importance of egress leaving western canada and the importance of that all of those things will be considered at the right time but it s premature to be considering rating agency comments and those kinds of things because at this point in time frankly we don t have anything to put in front of them robert catellier cibc capital markets analyst okay that s very helpful thank you operator thank you the next question is from robert kwan at rbc capital markets please go ahead your line is now open robert kwan rbc capital markets analyst all right good afternoon this is probably a question for stan just turning to the u s gas pipeline side of things and the opportunities that are in front of you there s within this projects under development in this other capacity capital 700 million you also have 500 million under secured i don t know if there s been some movement from the annual but in the projects under development that are new i m just wondering what types of things are you looking at and how does this tie back to what you had at investor day in terms of the eight or so projects that you highlighted stan chapman president of u s natural gas pipelines robert this is stan it is quite consistent with what we showed you at investor day there has been some movement on the capital table and the projects that are under development that you re referring to are projects that are essentially commercially secure but are still subject to fid by our counterparties we moved them over in that respect with respect to what s potentially coming down i would say the fundamentals in the industry particularly in the u s point to growth in terms of increased production they point to lng growth and they point to growth in power gen and as we sit right now we have projects in various stages of origination across virtually all of our pipes in the u s i would expect that perhaps as early as later this year you re going to see another supply push project a gts system which would be done in conjunction with tracy and the canadian gas team i would suggest that you re likely to see a power generation project or two on the columbia assets as we continue to see the need for additional natural gas power generation in that region and then we re going to continue to develop lng exports if you look at the two projects that we have in service right now cameron lng and then the eastern path of wbx plus the two projects that are pending third party fids we have about three bcf of lng export projects in the works right now and i think that there s a likelihood that you could see that number jump up to four bcf in the not too distant future continued growth opportunities and on top of all that we re still seeing growth in the appalachian basin despite what we re hearing from the producers the rig count is up about 10 since the end of december to 77 our production is on pace to grow out of the appalachian basin to the tune of about two to three bcf by the end of the year all of those are bullish on what we said that additional takeaway capacity is going to be needed out of the region perhaps sooner than we thought and our pipeline assets are uniquely situated to do just that robert kwan rbc capital markets analyst that s great color maybe just finishing on funding you ve got the 2 2 billion other kind of bucket that you laid out how does that number move around though from a credit metric perspective as you think about the drip which generally is probably better from a credit perspective than asset sales then as you think about asset sales what the decision making process is it really what sale price you think you can get versus your long term hold value or is there a bias to a stronger upfront valuation given that s a little bit more supportive of the credit metrics during your build out don marchand executive vice president and chief financial officer good question certainly drip is dollar for dollar equity whereas asset sales are releasing equity in some debt capacity there so not every dollar is created equal what s in that bucket is it is not 2 2 billion of pure equity put it that way we think some combination of drip that we have done to date and then we will evaluate drip at the next quarter as well depending on where we are on our projected credit metrics of being in the high fours for 2019 and 15 ffo to debt for this year as well how that weighs in with the cadence of bringing our projects in service we re watching sur de texas we re watching napanee as to when those thing come in service and that will influence our thinking we do have coolidge preparing to close here as i alluded to across the spectrum of asset sales we have stuff at varying stages here we won t get into the specific details of that but again there is stuff moving there in terms of sale versus whole value it s pretty important for us that we achieve at least our whole value on these assets but we are looking at per share metrics here what we re issuing stock at through a drip plan also informs us on that front that s kind of a long way of saying we factor all this in what you should take away from the portfolio management side is the 500 million of contracted ebitda and some reasonable multiple on top of that that number is substantially bigger than the 2 2 billion that s in that box right now so we re comfortable we can backfill that in with portfolio management we ll look at drip again in july and we should be able to track to at least we believe we ll be tracking to those credit metrics for the full year 2019 robert kwan rbc capital markets analyst okay and just on that valuation though it sounds like there is a bias to trying to sell assets that have a stronger upfront multiple don marchand executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah these are all contracted assets so some of them have longer contracts and shorter contracts that weigh into it but without getting into specific ebitda multiples on this stuff there s a bit of a cluster there russ girling president and chief executive officer i would say that on the principle we re probably driven more by value than multiple and we ll look at risk adjusted implied cost of capital that we can sell those assets at and to the extent that we can sell them at a cost of capital that we think is very attractive that s more what the driver is we look at shareholder value in terms of net present as opposed to multiple the multiple differences aren t going to make a large difference on our credit metrics at the end of the day so we re driven by shareholder value more than anything else don marchand executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah the other point to keep in mind here is cash taxes on these sales so the incident of cash taxes influence is the thinking as well robert kwan rbc capital markets analyst that s great thank you very much david moneta vice president of investor relations thanks robert operator thank you the next question is from andrew kuske at credit suisse please go ahead your line is now open andrew kuske credit suisse analyst thank you good afternoon my first question is just about columbia gas and just the year over year difference on what was generated in the quarter i m just curious if you have a breakdown handy on what amount of that was just plants and service versus just weather conditions where you had increased flow stan chapman president of u s natural gas pipelines yeah this is stan most of that is directly related to the phasing of the colombia projects at mountaineer and gulf xpress going into full commercial service as of march 15th there was a minor upside associated with the cold weather that we experienced toward the end of january but think of that predominantly as just the growth projects being placed in service andrew kuske credit suisse analyst okay that s very helpful and then probably a question for don just on the 500 million of ebitda the contracted ebitda that could be sales candidates do you have any kind of color on just the buckets of the business that 500 comes from don marchand executive vice president and chief financial officer no we won t comment on specific assets involved in that andrew kuske credit suisse analyst okay and then maybe just one final question a sort of broader question now that you ve gotten rid of a lot of the power business and you are giving out a lot of higher quality cash flows at this stage in time how has the overall risk management function changed within transcanada don marchand executive vice president and chief financial officer well as you look at the key buckets on the risk management side here i ll look at two specifically here first the counterparty risk as we ve sold off some contracted assets with fairly high quality counterparties it maybe moved marginally it really hasn t had that pervasive of an impact on counterparty risk in terms of market risk when you look at the assets that we ve sold the merchant northeast power business with the whole zone j capacity pricing market yeah the market risk aspects the company has dropped quite dramatically i would say we are 95 plus contracted ebitda now going forward the dissipation of that market risk has been quite pronounced russ girling president and chief executive officer yeah i think the predominant portion of that yield so as a sub 5 of variable ebitda the lion s share of that would be on the liquid side of our business and as paul pointed out our objective is to try to lock down that variability and continue to narrow that amount the portion of that 5 that exists in our power business is fairly small from where it used to be don marchand executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah the remaining price market price risk is really in alberta on our cogens and unregulated gas storage business volumetric flows and pricing and pricing on business would be the other aspect of that as russ mentioned andrew kuske credit suisse analyst okay that s great thank you david moneta vice president of investor relations thanks andrew operator thank you the next question is from shneur gershuni at ubs please go ahead your line is now open shneur gershuni ubs analyst thank you good afternoon guys one of my questions has been asked and answered i just wanted to circle back to the keystone xl question from before just to understand this correctly if you cross the t s and dot the i s on all of the regulatory issues you re not concerned about crossing administrations or are you concerned and could that be a potential delay factor paul miller president of liquids pipelines not concerned this is paul here the regulatory process which is laid out in front of us well defined and as always we ve been following that regulatory process to the t our regulatory process has been disrupted somewhat with some of the litigation that we re facing today the two primary pieces of litigation the challenge to the nebraska route approval by the public service commission that rests today with the nebraska supreme court and we await a decision from that court that is a final non appealable decision the second area of litigation revolves around the presidential president specifically the 2017 presidential permit with the issuance of the 2019 presidential permit it did three things it superseded the 2017 permit it rendered moot the challenges to the 2017 permit and it also clarified that the cross border approval was issued by the president acting under his constitutional authority with the issuance of that 2019 presidential permit we have applied to the us district appeals court to vacate the federal district court of montana s judgment including lifting the injunction with that litigation behind us it brings us back to the regulatory approvals and our construction strategy is to have those regulatory approvals all in place before we proceed on the construction management side the key to managing your last mile risk is to have all of your regulatory approvals have all of your land have all of your resources have all of your crews have all of your material and once we have clarity around our ability to move forward we will go out and secure those resources and then we ll start construction that process that start is not yet known and the duration will be a function of how much preconstruction planning we re able to perform between now and when we start construction and it may overlap into the next administration but with regulatory approvals in hand and the rule of law we feel comfortable constructing in that scenario shneur gershuni ubs analyst that makes sense and thank you for that clarity it s very appreciated maybe as a follow up and sticking on the regulatory front i was wondering if you can talk about the canadian regulatory situation bill c 69 how do you see it potentially impacting tc energy on an ongoing basis if it was to go through does it put anything at risk stan chapman president of u s natural gas pipelines i think on the public record we ve been pretty clear on c 69 that in its current form it s not a bill that we support and do believe that it could have significant negative impacts on both our base business and our ongoing expansion we ve been pretty specific and detailed in our responses to the consultation process and those are all well documented and we continue to work in those consultation processed to hopefully secure changes that would make that bill something that s more workable but in its current form we re not supportive of the bill shneur gershuni ubs analyst if the government changes hands in october would that make everything moot or do all parties support this stan chapman president of u s natural gas pipelines again i think probably similar to our answers on the previous questions with regard to keystone xl we believe that what we re doing is important and that energy demand continues to grow bringing new supply to market on new modern infrastructure is good for the economy job creation energy security national security across the board and i think those fundamentals transcend political parties on both sides of the border and in all political parties in canada there s no question that everybody understands the demand for energy continues to grow and that building modern infrastructure is the safest way to get that product from those who produce it to those who need it in between there there s a whole bunch of stuff noise but those fundamentals exist and that s we continue to be confident in our business but on a daily basis we have to work our way through these processes in our view what we do is fundamental and that hasn t changed over the last number of years shneur gershuni ubs analyst great thank you very much and enjoy the rest of your weekend david moneta vice president of investor relations thanks shneur operator thank you the next question is from jeremy rosenfield at industrial alliance please go ahead your line is now open jeremy rosenfield industrial alliance analyst thank you just a couple of cleanup questions here just on the motiva lateral can you provide any additional details in terms of the size of that potential investment and whether it gets rolled into the keystone system or cost recovery and the return is sort of stand alone there paul miller president of liquids pipelines hi jeremy it s paul here the motiva lateral we haven t disclosed the capital cost but it is included in our capital table under other with what s included in that bucket of 100 million of capital we do have a cost recovery mechanism in place but more importantly what it does do it attached the keystone pipeline system to the largest refinery in north america to the 630 000 barrel per day motiva refinery and this is consistent with some of our past activity over the last couple of years as we ve waited on the various approvals for keystone xl we have extended the reach of the keystone system into houston into texas city over to lake charles and the value of your pipe increases as you increase the liquidity both upstream and downstream the motiva lateral is another example of us extending the reach of the keystone pipeline system jeremy rosenfield industrial alliance analyst thank that was a good lead into my follow on question which was just around extensions of the system and whether you can move forward with some of the extensions of keystone potentially before actually keystone xl could potentially move forward with keystone xl that is what other upstream and downstream options are there that you could envision before kxl paul miller president of liquids pipelines kxl is the pipe section of the keystone system which runs from hardisty alberta down to steele city nebraska our footprint includes opportunities both upstream of that as well as downstream when i look upstream we have in place plans within the intra alberta marketplace we have a lot of opportunities in front of us the heartland pipeline which connects the edmonton market down to the hardisty market is a fully permitted pipeline by the regulator we have the grand rapids system which delivers crude from the production areas down into the edmonton market we had the opportunity to loop that again that loop is fully permitted these opportunities however are waiting for clarity around egress from alberta and with clarity around that egress from alberta the anticipation is you will see additional investment in alberta in the upstream which will necessitate additional infrastructure to move that crew to the market hubs such as edmonton and hardisty and ultimately down pipelines such as keystone and keystone xl on the southern end of the system we have seen increased production of crude oil coming out of the permian that has necessitated infrastructure to move those volumes to the marketplace we saw this increase and we reacted to this increase on our marketlink system which is south of cushing we took the opportunity to increase the capacity which was running at about 450 000 barrels per day a few years ago up to 750 000 barrels per day and as we see more opportunities to increase our capacity and our reach we will look at those opportunities today with the increase in capacity we ve achieved on marketlink we ve gone to the marketplace by way of an open season to see what sort of contract support we can get for both the existing capacity and in the event that we get into an oversubscribed position what additional capital we might deploy on the strength of these additional contracts to increase that capacity even further we re always looking for opportunities around the footprint and the nature of the keystone system footprint which runs right down the mid continent gives us opportunities right along the pipeline because that s where a lot of the emerging basins are jeremy rosenfield industrial alliance analyst when do you expect to have the results back from the open season on that marketlink initiative paul miller president of liquids pipelines we launched the open season mid april and we typically run for about 30 45 days then it typically takes anywhere from 30 to 60 days to work through credit and stuff like that so it could be about 60 65 70 days from now jeremy rosenfield industrial alliance analyst okay great thank you that s it for me paul miller president of liquids pipelines you re welcome david moneta vice president of investor relations thanks jeremy operator thank you the next question is from patrick kenney at national bank please go ahead your line is now open patrick kenney national bank analyst yeah hey guys i m just wondering if you could comment on the ngtl maintenance program for the summer perhaps compare it to last year in terms of not so much the financial impact but the operational impact on customers and if there s been any delay in kicking off the maintenance program here just given this beautiful spring weather out west right now tracy robinson president of canadian natural gas pipelines hi patrick it s tracy when we talk about a maintenance program on the ngtl system it s actually a combination of two things one is the maintenance and the other is the work that we do in the system to expand from a capital perspective we have a program this year that s going to run a fairly significant program but it will run an impact about what it looked like last year we ve done i think a good job in the last number of years of planning the maintenance program relative to the outages relative to the capital expansion work that we re doing and so we ve seen a fairly dramatic reduction in impact on our restrictions of flow in the pipe if you look at 2018 over 2017 our number of days that we restricted flow upstream james river the ability to get onto the pipe up there reduced by about half we re continuing to work to reduce that as we go forward we would expect this year to come in a little bit under that the workload is fairly heavy we have started on time and are on track on it and we expect that to continue over the course of the year but we re continuing to work to minimize the impact of that patrick kenney national bank analyst okay that s great i appreciate that then don i know you can t comment on specific assets for sale but just given the repairs at napanee will take us into late 2019 here and i assume that napanee represents a healthy portion of that 500 million of contracted ebitda it s safe to say that napanee is off the table for at least 2019 don marchand executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah as i mentioned earlier we won t comment on specific assets patrick kenney national bank analyst fair enough maybe just one last one here back to the marketlink open season paul i know also you can t talk specifics around where the system is today from a commercial perspective especially pre kxl but perhaps you can give us a sense as to what the longer term goal is for the system from a contracted versus spot basis just in order to maximize the risk adjusted return on the system paul miller president of liquids pipelines sure but probably again it s a bit of a good news story we typically plan it about 80 contracted on marketlink but there a bit of a lead leg here we increase the capacity and given the differentials we see the value for marketlink is considerable so we typically run full with a good portion of that being spot we go to an open season we contact that up to de risk and then we see the market is still looking for additional capacity so we increase the capacity on the system which increases really the spot component or decreases the contractual component and then we catch up i think a good run rate estimate given this step up is probably 80 in a scenario where we could contract it up 90 100 we would do that but again it s a bit of a good news story we re kind of always chasing the contracts after we increase the capacity we will see the results of the open season here in a couple months and we ll assess the next step or the next phase of capacity increase again depending on what sort of contractual support we achieve and where we think the market fundamentals are going patrick kenney national bank analyst okay that s great thanks everybody david moneta vice president of investor relations okay thanks pat operator thank you the next question is from alex kania at wolfe research please go ahead your line is now open alex kania wolfe research analyst hi there thanks very much these questions are for stan first you mentioned the accelerated need for appalachian takeaway potentially and certainly one thing that s come up recently is really the heightened legal pushback that some of these other takeaway are getting really in the fourth circuit how do you assess that risk and your exposure to that as you consider trying to figure out more takeaway solutions or is this just kind of 20 existing pipes and are there ways for you to potentially step in to help serve the demand in those areas if one or two of these pipes find it difficult to move forward ultimately stan chapman president of u s natural gas pipelines yeah great question and i would say that one thing that distinguishes many of our projects from some of our competitors is the fact that our projects tend to be in corridor expansions as opposed to greenfield bill which significantly de risks some of the environmental concerns that we re dealing with then secondly keep in mind we still have projects like our buckeye xpress which is a project where we re doing some work with respect to liability and integrity issues and rather than putting the same sized pipe in the ground we re going to put a bigger sized pipe in the ground that s going to be ready to go and in service in late 2020 early 21 as this initial production comes online shippers are not necessarily going to need to wait for a process to play out we ll have that capacity ready to go as i pointed out so far in 2019 we re seeing more production out of the basin than we thought with respect to whether or not we could potentially step in and provide an alternative route for some of the other projects out there that are that are facing these challenges in the courts the short answer is we can we have had very cursory discussions with some but obviously those third parties would prefer to build the projects themselves until we get a little bit further down the road where it s more definitive as to whether or not these projects are going to go we ll just keep that in the discussion phase and something that we may be able to pull out to help them at a later date alex kania wolfe research analyst great thanks david moneta vice president of investor relations operator thank you the next question is from michael lapides at goldman sachs please go ahead your line is now open michael lapides goldman sachs analyst hey guys an easy question on mexico and then one on the canadian gas pipeline business i m just curious in mexico when do you think with the pipelines under construction and in development you ll be at a full annual run rate ebitda is that a 2020 timeframe is that a 2021 timeframe or later francois poirier executive vice president of corporate development and strategy hey michael it s francois as i think we mentioned in the quarterly results we plan on bringing texas here into service shortly achieving mechanical completion here later in the month of may and then expect cfe to be declaring in service in the month of june on villa de reyes we plan on bringing that pipeline into service in three phases we have a northern segment a southern segment and then a lateral toward the west and we ve secured interruptible contracts with the cfe to be able to bring those portions into service as interconnections become available and gas is available as we ve indicated one or two of those portions we expect and are planning to put into service here in the second half of 2019 and then the balance in the first half of 2020 tuxpan tula as you know the 90 kilometer middle segment to obligation to conduct consultations we ve indicated that the estimated completion now has been pushed off to the end of 2020 we have achieved mechanical completion of the east and west segments of that pipeline and as with villa de reyes has secured interruptible contracts with the cfe to provide much needed gas supply to their power plants on those segments to answer your question based on those timelines i think you could expect to see a full run rate by the end of 2020 michael lapides goldman sachs analyst got it don marchand executive vice president and chief financial officer michael michael lapides goldman sachs analyst oh go ahead don marchand executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah michael it s don here i ll just remind everyone that we are being paid on all of these pipes through force majeure payments it s just the force majeure payments are not in ebitda they re going to balance sheet michael lapides goldman sachs analyst got it okay that s super helpful actually one small think on the mexico pipe business i noticed that some of the individual pipelines the ones that are already in service and operating actually saw year over year ebitda down in this quarter versus last year it s really small numbers but i was just curious is that the trajectory we should expect going forward should it be relatively flat year over year i m just curious glenn menuz vice president and controller michael it s glenn for the pipelines other than texas this quarter represents a pretty reasonable run rate michael lapides goldman sachs analyst run rate meaning it will decline each year glenn menuz vice president and controller no as in this will be the level going forward michael lapides goldman sachs analyst got it that sounds perfect then finally on the canadian gas pipeline business i noticed that volumes were relatively flat year over year is that due to pipeline restrain issues meaning obviously needing to continue to add capacity was that a weather related issue year over year a production issue meaning just due to less associated gas potentially given the crude production cuts i m just kind of curious on the volumetric side tracy robinson president of canadian natural gas pipelines michael the system actually over the quarter in all the cold weather performed extremely well this year and the pull out of the system on market was very strong we hit a new peak in the intra alberta of just over seven five that s a good news story where we did see we expected more receipts onto the system than we got and it is as you say that cold weather causes some problems on the production side so we had capacity that was not utilized on the receipt side of the business the system is bigger we moved 900 million cubic feet a day last year more through the system than we did the year before and we re continuing to grow it just in the cold weather months we had some issues in bringing those volumes on michael lapides goldman sachs analyst got it thank you guys much appreciated david moneta vice president of investor relations

more revenues to finance the unprecedented p8 4 trillion build build build infrastructure program through the tax reform for acceleration and inclusion or train law that reduced personal income taxes but raised the excise taxes on tobacco alcohol fuel sugar sweetened beverages and automobile the program aims to construct more bridges roads tollways airports seaports and railways including the country s first subway fast tracking our build build build program will bridge the infrastructure gap that has long been one of the major deal breakers for investors we aim to raise infrastructure investments to 7 percentof gross domestic product by 2022 and further improve our absorptive capacity in implementing projects dominguez told manila standard he said infrastructure development and eliminating red tape and corruption hold the key to attracting more foreign direct investments apart from attracting investors infrastructure modernization will also sustain and boost our growth momentum given that infrastructure development has the highest multiplier effects by creating jobs and opening new areas for investments that further stimulate economic activity he said strong economy dominguez said fiscal prudence which made it possible for the government to invest in big ticket projects would result in building a strong economy that the filipino people deserve pursuing the remaining tax reform packages he said would expand the government s revenue base and provide a steady revenue stream for the build build build program and enable the country to secure further credit rating upgrades the train law the first package of the administration s comprehensive tax reform program took effect in january 2018 other tax reform packages include the reduction of the corporate income tax rate to make it closer to the regional average and the rationalization of the fiscal incentives to create an even playing field for businesses the other packages cover reforms in property valuation to make the system more equitable efficient and transparent the rationalization of capital income taxation to address the multiple tax rates and different tax treatments and exemptions on capital income and other financial instruments increasing the excise taxes on tobacco and alcohol products and the government s share from mining revenues and the automatic exchange of tax information and relaxation of bank secrecy laws he said s p global ratings which upgraded the philippines credit rating to bbb on april 30 said the accelerated implementation of the infrastructure program and passage into law of the remaining tax reform packages would help fuel robust sustainable and more inclusive economic growth we will also continue cultivating our young and highly skilled labor force we are looking at every opportunity for economic complementation with our industrialized neighbors with aging populations that will ensure ample opportunities for our very young labor force our law previously ensured free basic education for all filipinos said dominguez now free tuition has been extended to students enrolled in state colleges and universities or sucs increased investment flows over the past years strengthen our faith that we are implementing the right economic strategy at this juncture of our country s history he said with the improving business environment and the relentless campaign against corruption the country in 2017 and 2018 received a total of 20 billion in foreign direct investments or an average of 10 billion a year double the inflows that came in 2015 this is unprecedented the tight spread of our bond offerings demonstrates the confidence of the investment community in our commitment to fiscal discipline thus after the successful issuances of panda and samurai bonds in china and japan respectively the government s economic team is currently on a roadshow in europe this time to float euro bonds in financial capitals such as london paris frankfurt milan and zurich said dominguez more investments dominguez has been very active in informing foreign investors that the philippines is now one of the best places where they can expand their businesses in april 2019 he called on japanese and american companies to invest more in the philippines fast growing economy where higher consumer demand fueled by tax reform and an aggressive infrastructure program along with improving peace and order open wide business opportunities for foreign investors dominguez assured a delegation from the kansai economic federation based in osaka japan that the second package of the duterte administration s tax reform program which aims to cut the corporate income tax rate and rationalize investment incentives would be a game changer that would expand rather than curtail opportunities for them to do business in the philippines meanwhile he told american businessmen in washington d c that now is the best time to invest in the philippines so they could maximize the benefits of participating in a robust economy which is poised to become asia s next economic powerhouse upper middle income dominguez said the philippines strong partnership with multilateral lenders such as the world bank was a key factor in helping the country secure its status as an upper middle income economy in 2019 three years ahead of the targeted schedule the duterte administration had targeted to achieve the upper middle income status by 2022 and become a high income economy by 2040 the government also aimed to bring down poverty incidence from 21 6 percent in 2015 to just 14 percent by the end of president duterte s term it looks like the target for upper middle income status would be achieved this year based on world bank criteria for the fiscal year 2019 an upper middle income country should have a gross national income per capita of 3 896 to 12 055 the philippines is currently classified as a lower middle income country with a gni per capita of 3 700 in 2017 with the resilience it had displayed under an inclusive economy which grew 6 2 percent last year the philippines is poised to reach the upper middle income status ahead of target according to dominguez by striving to make our economy more inclusive and our governance more responsive to the waves of technological change we strive to continue building on our growth momentum he said fight against tax cheats under dominguez s leadership the department of finance made history in 2017 by collecting from mighty corp a total of p30 billion in unpaid taxes the biggest sum on record raised by the government from a tax settlement after the bureau of internal revenue filed three separate criminal complaints before the department of justice against mighty for the alleged widespread use of counterfeit tax stamps the firm offered in july 2017 to shut down its operations and settle its tax liabilities mighty s manufacturing and distribution assets were sold to japan tobacco inc for around 1 billion as a conditionality mighty paid around p30 4 billion roughly equivalent to 600 million in taxes comprising previous tax liabilities and transaction taxes to settle its obligations to the government dominguez also said nobody should be exempt from paying the correct amount of taxes to the government including foreign nationals working in the country enforce the law so we can collect the tax dominguez said in a recent executive committee meeting of the dof avoiding debt trap amid concerns from different sectors dominguez downplayed the idea that the philippines would default on its concessional loans to countries such as china he said these fears were unfounded given that the government had never failed to pay its debt even during the worst of times the philippines has never never defaulted on its loans the philippines has not done it even in the worst time and the worst time was right after marcos dominguez said he said that even when the philippines was cash strapped it had never defaulted on any of its loans recalling that the country even paid its obligations on the 2 2 billion bataan nuclear power plant project which was then considered a white elephant the philippines has no history of defaulting on its loans so why are people saying now that we will default do they have no faith in the philippines i don t know why people are saying there might be a default that means to say those people have no faith in their own country dominguez said dominguez said there was no collateral involved in the loans that the government signed with any country as he invited the public to examine the terms of all the loan accords which are available for viewing at the department of finance website the government s borrowing program dominguez said remained very conservative in the sense that we only borrow to invest in projects that will generate economic gains which are greater than the borrowing cost he said that as of 2018 the government s project debt exposure was only 0 66 percent to china and 9 percent to japan in relation to the total debt by 2022 when most of the financing for the build build build program will have been accessed the country s project debt to china is expected to account for only 4 5 percent while that of japan will be twice as large at 9 5 percent credit goes to government dominguez s accomplishments as finance secretary did not go unnoticed two renowned publications have already distinguished him for a job well done but he refused to accept the awards saying what the government achieved so far was a fruit of concerted efforts of all its members and not by one person alone in december 2017 dominguez declined to accept an award from biznewsasia that cited his exemplary performance as the head of the duterte administration s economic team saying he was just doing his job and what the government achieved so far is a result of a team effort prior to that he also declined to accept an award as finance minister of the year for east asia pacific from a joint publication of the world bank and the international monetary fund in september 2017 after the long anticipated s p global ratings upgrade of the philippines sovereign investment grade rating from bbb to bbb on april 30 dominguez said the credit belongs to president duterte s strong leadership and his 10 point economic program s p global s credit rating upgrade of the philippines by one notch higher is an undeniable tribute to president duterte s unwavering commitment to bold reforms and sound economic policies as embodied in the 10 point socioeconomic agenda of the administration and his strong political will to get these tough initiatives done at the soonest dominguez said the upgrade put the philippines at par with mexico peru thailand and trinidad and tobago it is even higher than the bbb ratings of italy portugal hungary panama and uruguay credit should be given to president duterte s decisive political leadership and commitment to sweeping reforms our president s swift action in delivering on his 10 point socio economic agenda has been recognized by the international financial community as demonstrated anew just recently by s p global s latest upgrade on the philippines credit rating from bbb to bbb with a stable outlook dominguez said dominguez said to further enhance the philippines credit rating and make the country an investment magnet in the region the executive department would be relentless in engaging congress to act on president duterte s proposed reform measures that aim to level the playing field for investors and improve the ease of doing business in the country we will also vigorously implement sectoral and administrative reforms that include the new law further empowering our central bank the rapid adoption of new digital technologies to improve governance through real time payment systems the introduction of a national id system the rice tariffication law and new platforms to minimize the cost of doing business he said

pmis europe april monday the timing of the european may bank holidays last week meant european data has been delayed by a day with uk markets on holiday this monday weâ ll see how well the services sector in europe has performed as q2 gets underway in march we saw an improvement from italy spain and germany however the french economy has struggled no doubt due to the disruption caused by the â

march with france emerging from contraction territory at 49 1 to 50 5 investors will be hoping that the march improvement continues into april â â â occidental q1 results monday occidental has been in the news recently for its attempts to buy anadarko petroleum from under the nose of chevron the main question is whether they are overpaying for the permian basin assets at a time when oil prices are at multi month highs and the focus is moving towards renewables an area that us oil companies donâ t seem interested in with both chevron and exxon mobil reporting a disappointing performance in q1 will occidental follow suit if so it could cause shareholders to question the wisdom of this particular deal given its already high debt levels â marriott international q1 results tuesday marriott appears to be taking the fight to airbnb as it looks to launch a home rental business to try and alleviate the pressure on its margins from revenue per room rates as consumers look to make their us dollars euros and sterling go further recent trends have shown that while revenues are holding up fairly well in the sector profits are getting squeezed as hoteliers increase capacity as well revamping their offerings marriott also recently signed a new multi year deal with expedia to host any last minutes hotel vacancies on the online booking site in return for a lower rate â â â lyft q1 results tuesday it hasnâ t been a great few weeks for lyft given the heavy falls in its share price post ipo in its pre ipo prospectus lyft showed that the company turned over 2 16bn in revenue last year more than double the amount from 2017 which is encouraging in terms of expanding the business profits on the other hand have proved elusive despite a sharp rise in users to 18 6m in the last two to three years losses for last year came in well over 1bn due to a sharp rise in costs and while its rider metrics have improved in terms of how much money it makes from each trip it will have to continue to grow exponentially to reverse the trend of overall losses currently the margin has risen to 26 8 from 23 1 in 2017 this weekâ s q1 update is likely to show an increase in costs due to the ipo with the important numbers likely to focus on margins and the number of users as management try to make inroads into reversing those losses â â rba and rbnz rate decisionsâ tuesday wednesday a surprise deterioration in recent australian economic data has prompted speculation that the reserve bank of australia could cut rates this week from the current 1 5 the latest inflation data which saw a sharp decline in prices due to lower fuel costs saw the australian dollar slide back recent weakness in the chinese economy has also weighed on sentiment in the australian economy a rate cut would seem a rather melodramatic conclusion to what is by and large a good thing for australian consumers lower fuel prices at a time when the australian jobs market appears in decent health certainly isnâ t anything to worry about which suggests that the rba is likely to take a wait and see approach furthermore cutting rates 11 days before a federal election could be seen as a highly political move something the rba would be extremely reluctant to do even in the most difficult circumstances the reserve bank of new zealand is also expected to hold fire on rates even if the bias for a move has shifted to the downside â china trade april â wednesday the most recent china trade data for march was a little bit of a mixed bag after the weakness of the february numbers export numbers improved significantly with a rise of 14 2 well above expectations of 6 5 and a vast improvement on the 20 7 decline in february imports on the other hand were a disappointment declining 7 6 missing expectations of a 5 6 rise while better than the february numbers they remained in the red this weakness in imports is likely to be a concern for chinese authorities as it suggests that internal demand is still weak so weâ ll need to see a significant improvement aprilâ s numbers are likely to determine whether the improvement in march was a post lunar new year rebound or something more pronounced bt group full year resultsâ thursday bt canâ t seem to extricate itself from the accounting scandal in italy after it emerged last month that the decision to misreport profits came from

donald trump and his supporters were out in force on friday ballyhooing the april employment figures which showed that the economy created another two hundred and sixty three thousand jobs last month and the unemployment rate fell to its lowest level in forty nine years the report from the labor department was certainly a strong one but it needs to be placed in the context of a long period of economic expansion that began way back in the summer of 2009 after the bush administration bailed out wall street and the obama administration introduced a big fiscal stimulus the job figures confirmed what we learned from an announcement from the commerce department last week that the gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 3 2 per cent in the first quarter of the year buoyed by low interest rates rising asset prices and the residual effects of the debt fuelled tax and spending stimulus that the trump administration and congress introduced at the end of 2017 the twenty trillion dollar supertanker that is the u s economy has been chugging ahead it should be noted however that neither release was quite as strong as the headlines suggested in the g d p report a good part of that 3 2 per cent represented an accumulation of unsold inventories which government statisticians count as output domestic final sales grew at an annual rate of just 1 4 per cent the lowest in three years in the employment report the fall in the jobless rate from 3 8 per cent to 3 6 per cent resulted from an unexpected drop in the size of the labor force and it may represent a statistical blip the monthly unemployment rate is derived from a survey of households and has a large margin of error attached to it taking the two reports together it appears that the economy is still growing steadily although not as strongly as it was last year when the tax and spending stimulus kicked in a number of democratic leaning economists acknowledged the positive news in the employment report even as they rightly pointed out that healthy job creation is a trend that began and extended for more than seven years under obama jared bernstein a senior fellow at the center on budget and policy priorities who was an economic adviser to joe biden during the obama administration wrote that s a very solid number for this stage in our 10 year old expansion suggesting a virtuous cycle wherein strong labor demand is providing many working families with jobs and wage gains which in turn fuels robust consumer spending looking toward november 2020 a key question is how long this virtuous cycle can last and whether there is anything on the horizon that could send the economy into a pre election tailspin two possibilities that received a lot of attention at the end of last year were the united states importing a slump from abroad or the federal reserve raising interest rates further in the past few months the likelihood of either of these things happening has diminished economic stimulus measures on the part of the government in beijing appear to be having a positive effect on the giant chinese economy and the fed chair jerome powell under attack from trump has sworn off further monetary tightening in a press conference on wednesday powell indicated that he and his colleagues are unlikely to shift interest rates in either direction anytime soon our outlook and my outlook is a positive one is a healthy one for the u s economy for the rest of this year powell said things could change of course a bolt from the blue could hit the stock market which has been on a tear for most of the past decade and is now very highly valued or conceivably the fed could alter course again if wages and prices were to spike up in the coming months it might well feel obliged to ignore trump s protests and raise rates history shows that expansions often end because inflation picks up as unemployment falls and the central bank reacts by raising rates with borrowing costs rising households and businesses curtail their spending before long a recession ensues the reason the current expansion hasn t succumbed to this pattern is that despite the repeated warnings of inflation hawks wages and prices have remained subdued even as the jobless rate has fallen to historic lows that pattern is continuing during the past year indeed the measure of price inflation that the fed tracks most closely has fallen well below its target two per cent the rate of wage inflation is a bit higher 3 2 per cent according to the new employment report but it shows no signs of acceleration either

washington reuters u s job growth surged in april and the unemployment rate dropped to the lowest in nearly half a century pointing to sustained strength in economic activity even as last year s massive stimulus from republican tax cuts and spending increases fades the labor department s closely watched monthly employment report yesterday showed the greater than expected 263 000 new jobs created last month were spread across most industry sectors and the unemployment rate was just 3 6 the lowest since december 1969 still wage gains did not accelerate as expected holding at a reading that is consistent with moderate inflation moreover the decline in the unemployment rate was driven largely by the most people leaving the labor force in a year and a half the report was supportive of the federal reserve s decision on wednesday to keep interest rates unchanged and signal little desire to adjust monetary policy anytime soon fed chairman jerome powell described the economy and job growth as a bit stronger than we anticipated and inflation somewhat weaker employment gains are strong enough to dispel any immediate concerns over the health of the economy while wage gains are not strong enough to force the federal reserve s hand to tighten the policy stance said harm bandholz chief u s economist at unicredit research in new york aside from april s surge in nonfarm payrolls the economy created 16 000 more jobs in february and march than previously reported economists polled by reuters had forecast payrolls rising by 185 000 jobs last month the strong economy especially the labor market could boost president donald trump s re election hopes next year trump who has boasted about the economy being one of the major wins of his first term in office cheered april s robust employment gains jobs jobs jobs trump tweeted the economy will mark 10 years of expansion in july the longest on record job gains are well above the roughly 100 000 needed per month to keep up with growth in the working age population the second month of strong employment growth put to rest concerns about a recession and ironically undercut trump s call for the fed to cut interest rates a brief inversion of the u s treasury yield curve in march had fanned fears of an economic downturn leading markets to price in a rate cut this year it would be awfully hard for the fed to explain a rate cut given the strong job market so forget that said joel naroff chief economist at naroff economic advisors in holland pennsylvania hiring remains strong despite anecdotal evidence of worker shortages in the transportation manufacturing and construction industries suggesting there is still some spare capacity in the labor market steadily rising wages had until recently been keeping workers in the labor force and drawing back some who had dropped out average hourly earnings rose 6 cents or 0 2 in april after rising by the same margin in march that kept the annual increase in wages at 3 2 for a second straight month though wage growth is not strong enough to drive up inflation it is seen sufficient to underpin economic growth as the stimulus from last year s 1 5 trillion tax cut wanes the economy grew at a 3 2 annualized rate in the first quarter driven by a surge in exports and inventories quickening from the october december period s 2 2 pace the dollar fell against a basket of currencies while u s treasury prices rose stocks on wall street were trading higher despite april s robust job gains there are signs the economy slowed early in the second quarter a survey from the institute for supply management ism on friday showed a measure of services industry activity dropped to a 20 month low in april it followed on the heels of another ism survey this week showing factory activity hitting a 2 1 2 year low last month last month s two tenths of a percentage point drop in the unemployment rate from 3 8 in march was because 490 000 people left the labor force in april the most in 18 months it was the fourth straight month of workers dropping out of the labor force and could shrink the pool of available workers the labor force participation rate or the proportion of working age americans who have a job or are looking for one fell to 62 8 in april from 63 0 in march this suggested more slack in the labor market than indicated by the unemployment rate the drop in participation was almost across the board with significant declines among prime age and younger workers the supply side of the economy looks a little less shiny in light of the decline in the participation rate said michael feroli an economist at jpmorgan in new york a broader measure of unemployment which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part time because they cannot find full time employment was unchanged at 7 3 in april economists expect job growth will slow this year as fewer workers become available which will push up wages and lift inflation back to the fed s 2 target an inflation measure tracked by the u s central bank increased 1 6 in the year to march the smallest gain in 14 months employment at construction sites increased by 33 000 jobs in april rising for a second straight month manufacturing sector payrolls rebounded by 4 000 jobs after being unchanged in march the industry is being pressured by layoffs in the automobile sector as assembly plants try to cope with declining sales and an inventory overhang the auto sector shed jobs for a fourth straight month employment increased in the leisure and hospitality professional and business services healthcare transportation and warehousing and financial activities industries but retail payrolls declined for a third straight month temporary help a harbinger for future hiring rebounded last month after dropping in march government payrolls increased by 27 000 in april
u s review the economy is not in danger of stalling anytime soon employers surpassed expectations adding a whopping 263 000 jobs in april the unemployment rate trended lower to 3 6 but that was due entirely to a drop in the labor force participation rate nonetheless the jobs market remains tight following the dip in the core pce deflator the fomc has maintained its pledge to be patient and left rates unchanged this week for a detailed look at inflation and whether the recent softness is as powell characterized it transient we direct you to our topic of the week section on page 7 our main take this week despite the labor market remaining tight with inflation low we still expect the fomc to refrain from raising rates this year the economy is not in danger of stalling anytime soon we wrote last week that the underlying details of economic growth in the first quarter were not as strong as the headline gdp growth rate would suggest while we stand by that deduction data this week confirm our second stated conclusion the economy is not in danger of stalling anytime soon there were two events that captured markets attention this week the fomc policy meeting and the april nonfarm payrolls report the meeting was of particular focus not because of the widely expected outcome for rates to be left unchanged but for any changes in the policy statement and powell s post meeting press conference the notable change to the statement was the downgrade to the inflation assessment which followed the drop in the core pce deflator to 1 6 on a year ago basis in march the lowest level in a year and a half when questioned about the recent weakness in inflation powell emphasized transient factors as the culprit behind the pull back is the recent weakness in inflation exaggerated relative to its trend please see our topic of the week on page 7 for further analysis of this topic here we turn your attention to the other end of the fed s dual mandate employment employers added a whopping 263 000 jobs in april beating the consensus expectation of a 190 000 job gain the unemployment rate fell to 3 6 the lowest in almost 50 years but the underemployment rate which includes those marginally attached to the labor force held steady at 7 3 and average hours worked nudged down to 34 4 hours the drop in unemployment therefore stems entirely from the give back in labor force participation in a recent report we discuss how the recent rebound in participation which has kept wage pressures from building to the point where labor costs would set off higher inflation has provided the fomc another reason it can be patient with additional rate hikes indeed average hourly earnings rose only 0 2 in april from the prior month but given they were likely held down by the timing of the survey week as well as more working days than average last april we expect the upward trend in average hourly earnings to resume over the next couple of months more broadly the first look at the employment cost index in the first quarter suggested employment costs remained in line with the recent trend with the labor market still tight we expect to see labor costs pick up a bit in coming quarters even such the trend is likely to remain fairly tame and not pose much threat to inflation especially given the rebound in productivity indeed productivity leaped 3 6 in the first quarter which was the strongest gain since q3 2014 productivity is expected to moderate in coming quarters but will prevent gains in unit labor costs from driving inflation above the fomc s target so despite the labor market remaining tight with inflation low we still expect the fomc to refrain from raising this year with low inflation and the continued increase in payrolls and wages real consumer spending looks to rebound from the 1 2 rate registered in the first quarter further personal spending surged 0 9 in march the largest one month increase since 2009 perhaps of more consequence the bump in march spending gives pce momentum headed into the second quarter and likely puts to bed any lingering worries of a prolonged retrenchment in spending which was perhaps suggested by the still curious drop in december spending u s outlook jolts tuesday as recently as november of last year the number of job openings was riding high comfortably north of 7 5 million jobs and setting a new record however the number of available jobs has slowed since then with 7 09 million job openings reported in february when march numbers are released on tuesday there are mixed signals for what to expect this week s consumer confidence report showed that consumers impression of jobs being plentiful rose more than 4 percentage points in april after slipping a few points in march the jolts report is for march so it is unclear whether or not we will see the improvement reflected here weekly jobless claims figures have been spotty as well and offer no firm signal the labor market is still historically tight but questions have arisen in recent weeks about a potential loss of momentum the jolts report will provide the latest data points to consider that debate previous 7 09m consensus 7 35m international trade thursday trade added a full percentage point to gdp growth in q1 in four out of the five prior quarters trade was a net drag on the economy the bea has to estimate the march trade numbers in its advance gdp estimate so when the actual trade figures for march print on thursday of next week we will get a sense of how close those estimates came we expect to see a modest widening in the trade deficit for march as the nearby chart shows both import and export growth have been slowing on trend since the expansion of trade tariffs went into effect late last year this has occurred alongside a drying up in global trade that has pulled global export volume growth into negative territory a key factor identified by the imf in its most dour forecast for global gdp growth since the global recession previous 49 4b wells fargo 51 3b consensus 51 2b cpi friday after raising rates four times last year and despite having guided expectations toward further rate hikes in 2019 the fed pivoted and citing a need for patience opted to sit on hold so far this year and has even played down expectation for any rate hike this year the fed s shift can be explained at least in part by the deterioration in the inflation numbers a recent example we learned earlier this week that the pce deflator came in at just 1 5 year over year and the core deflator came in at 1 7 which was below already modest expectations the cpi measure which takes a basket of goods approach as opposed to actual spending has been running a little hotter on friday of next week we get the latest read on cpi inflation and expect to see both headline and core come in at 2 1 year over year previous 1 9 wells fargo 2 1 consensus 2 1 year over year global review ecb and boe likely still on hold eurozone gdp rebounded in q1 with the broader european economy avoiding recession and showing some improvement while u k pmis experienced slight declines despite improved data we believe the eurozone is not out of the woods yet and the ecb is on hold for now while the bank of england may look to hike rates if an orderly brexit materializes chinese pmis experienced a slight decline in april although manufacturing and non manufacturing pmis remain in expansion territory we expect the economy to gradually slow however additional stimulus measures and a potential trade deal with the u s will likely help china avoid a hard landing eurozone economy shows some stability gdp growth in the eurozone outperformed expectations this week with the broader european economy steering away from recession q1 data revealed the eurozone grew 0 4 quarter over quarter higher than consensus forecast of 0 3 this week s data provided markets with some optimism for ongoing growth across europe as italy officially exited technical recession while spanish gdp growth firmed to 0 7 also contributing to the improved sentiment was the final eurozone manufacturing pmi for april which was revised slightly higher while germany spain and italian manufacturing pmis all improved despite improved gdp and sentiment data we still believe it is too early to call for a turn to robust growth for the european economy while the manufacturing pmi recovered in april it still remains in contraction territory we continue to believe the ecb will keep policy rates on hold until a stronger recovery starts to materialize and will eventually look to hike rates starting in q1 2020 u k economy resilient despite brexit headwinds sentiment data in the united kingdom were also released this week with the april manufacturing pmi falling to 53 1 down from 55 1 in march the decline in the manufacturing pmi was largely expected and we believe the u k economy will remain resilient despite the challenges that brexit presents as of now we think the u k economy will grow around 1 3 in 2019 and given our view for a brexit deal to eventually be made and uncertainty to be lifted off the u k economy we see a pickup in growth heading into 2020 the bank of england boe reflected this view at its meeting this week raising its gdp forecasts for this year as well as in 2020 although citing a no deal brexit as still a possibility boe policymakers also suggested that interest rates would likely need to be raised more than markets are currently anticipating if a smooth brexit were to occur as of now markets are currently pricing around one full 25 bps rate hike over the next 24 months we share a similar perspective and maintain our view that the boe will begin to hike rates after a brexit deal is agreed upon likely by q4 of this year with the first rate hike likely to come in early 2020 stimulus measures likely to support china s economy china pmis were weaker than expected in april with the official manufacturing pmi falling to 50 1 while the caixin manufacturing pmi unexpectedly softened to 50 2 the services pmi also declined unexpectedly in april falling to 54 3 however it remains comfortably in expansion territory despite the weaker thanexpected pmis we continue to believe the slowdown in china s economy will be gradual chinese authorities continue to suggest that additional stimulus measures may be introduced into the economy while some economic activity data indicate current stimulus efforts may be starting to have an effect on the economy while the prospects for a long term trade deal between china and the united states remain encouraging overall recent headlines have been slightly mixed a trade deal along with additional stimulus would likely stabilize china s economy and keep gdp growth above 6 for the time being as of now we forecast gdp in china to grow at 6 2 in 2019 and to slow slightly to 6 0 in 2020 global outlook reserve bank of australia tuesday the reserve bank of australia rba will meet next week to make its latest monetary policy assessment australian economic data have been relatively soft as of late with a deteriorating domestic housing market weighing on the country s growth prospects recent cpi inflation data reflect the slowdown as well with the q1 cpi softening to 1 3 year over year much lower than the consensus forecast and a sharp slowdown from q4 the reserve bank of australia has noted the deceleration in the economy with recent commentary more dovish than markets had expected a weaker than expected inflation print will likely result in additional dovish statements from the rba while we will be focused on any indications that downside risks to the outlook are increasing a rate cut at next week s meeting is viewed as likely with markets currently pricing in two policy rate cuts over the next 24 months previous 1 50 consensus 1 25 reserve bank of new zealand wednesday new zealand s economy has underperformed recently with the most recent evidence being this week s softer than expected labor market data despite the q1 jobless rate falling to 4 2 employment data were much weaker than forecast declining 0 2 quarter overquarter while wage growth slowed as well in response to a weaker economic outlook the reserve bank of new zealand rbnz has turned more dovish explicitly stating at its march meeting that the likely direction for the next official cash rate move would probably be down this week s soft labor market data likely reinforce this bias with markets currently expecting the rbnz to eventually ease monetary policy as well as of now markets are implying about two interest rate cuts from the rbnz over the next 12 24 months we view a rate cut at next week s meeting to be likely while the consensus leans toward the central bank moving forward with a rate cut as well previous 1 75 consensus 1 50 mexico cpi inflation friday since early 2018 cpi inflation in mexico has been on a downward trajectory this has primarily been a result of significant policy rate hikes from the central bank of mexico a trendless currency and relatively subdued oil prices the economic conditions that resulted in lower inflation may start to turn however as the central bank is on hold for now and oil prices have moved higher given this we think cpi inflation may finally start to move higher as well in addition the deceleration in mexico s economy should provide the central bank with some scope to start cutting interest rates which might also boost inflation over time we also expect the peso to gradually weaken which should contribute to inflationary pressures while we think geopolitical tensions that should pull some excess oil supply out of the market could potentially boost oil prices further for april we expect cpi inflation to quicken up to around 4 4 year over year previous 4 0 wells fargo 4 4 year over year point of view interest rate watch the fomc is still patient as expected the fomc left the fed funds rate unchanged at its meeting this week the committee appeared less concerned about growth than it did at its march meeting the statement characterized gdp growth as solid once again while

dip in core pce inflation and continued weakness in inflation expectations with inflation still flagging the fomc maintained its pledge to be patient with future adjustments to policy the recent slowdown in inflation has been viewed as a potential reason the fomc may cut rates in upcoming months even as risks surrounding the growth outlook like trade policy and a slowdown abroad had subsided heading into this week s meeting markets had priced in about a 50 50 chance of a rate cut by the fomc s september 18 meeting powell pushed back on the weakness in inflation emphasizing transient factors as the reason for the slowdown we agree to a large extent and discuss those factors in more detail in our topic of the week on the next page with powell indicating that he does not believe the weakness is likely to persist and that we don t see a strong case for a rate move in either direction market expectations for a rate cut have been pared back a 50 50 probability is not priced in until the december 11 meeting now however yet again inflation is missing to the downside of the fomc s symmetric target moreover other committee members have expressed more concern about the persistent shortfall we see low inflation as the key reason the fomc is likely to refrain from raising rates the rest of this year and the first half of 2020 but a rate cut this year continues to look premature in our view not only is recent softness in core pce inflation somewhat exaggerated but financial conditions have eased considerably since the start of year and should continue to support above trend growth credit market insights not that kind of cut at its meeting this week the fomc announced a 5 bps cut to the interest on excess reserves ioer rate yet chair powell made sure to emphasize that this was merely a small technical adjustment that should not imply any monetary policy loosening on behalf of the fomc the ioer which the fed pays to depository institutions on the excess reserves they hold at the central bank had previously functioned as the ceiling of the fed funds target range however the effective fed funds rate or the actual marketdetermined rate on overnight interbank loans has recently drifted up toward the top of the fomc s 25 bps target range for the fed funds rate and has in fact been above the ioer for the past month to bring the effective fed funds rate under greater control within the intended range the fomc has now thrice tweaked the ioer with this week marking the first adjustment without any accompanying change to the fed funds target range by reducing the incentive for banks to park funds at the fed a lower ioer thereby increases the supply of loanable overnight funds easing upward pressure on the effective fed funds rate and helping to keep it within its intended range we view this merely as a technical adjustment that should keep the effective fed funds rate closer to the midpoint of its target range as the fed remains on hold however as we have previously written it further raises the prospect of a reconfiguration of the fed s monetary policy toolkit in a post great recession world topic of the week how transient is the slowdown in inflation the fomc s preferred measure of trend inflation the pce deflator ex food and energy slipped further below the fed s 2 target in march easing to 1 6 on a yearago basis federal reserve chair jerome powell however downplayed the recent easing in core inflation in his post fomc meeting press conference this week powell characterized the recent softness as transient and we agree that the weakness in inflation since the start of the year is exaggerated relative to the trend in january the cost of portfolio management and investment advice tumbled 4 6 which was enough to shave off almost a full tenth from the core index this is an imputed measure tied heavily albeit with a lag to changes in equity markets which are now at fresh highs in addition a new methodology was introduced for collecting prices at department stores in march which contributed to the largest ever one month decline in apparel prices alternative measures show the trend in inflation holding up better powell cited the dallas fed s trimmed mean pce deflator which currently sits at 2 0 in the trimmed mean pce items are sorted based on their monthly price change with items at the tails of the distribution thrown out unlike a traditional core index food and energy can therefore be included if monthly changes are moderate the atlanta fed s sticky cpi has also been steady in recent months the index captures items that do not change prices frequently and therefore helps filter out the noise of recent moves meanwhile the median price change within the cpi has strengthened the resilience of the alternative inflation indexes suggests the slowdown in the core pce deflator overstates recent weakness in inflation nevertheless inflation continues to come up short of the fomc s target although likely to edge back up in the coming months we do not expect the core pce deflator to re visit 2 o this year even as the labor market continues to tighten the pickup in productivity growth has kept inflation pressures muted while historically low inflation expectations point to price changes remaining modest

momentum so now let s move to this quarter s result as joanne mentioned late yesterday we released our first quarter 2019 financial results net sales increased 2 in the first quarter as compared to the prior year due to growth from acquisitions of 5 and healthy average unit price growth of 4 as we benefited from the december 2018 price increases as well as those previously implemented in 2018 soft end markets in north american residential due to a combination of difficult weather and lower housing construction activity led to a 5 decline in base volume net sales were also impacted by a 2 decrease due to foreign exchange the weakening of the british pound and the canadian dollar year on year had both a significant translational and a transactional impact on us which russ will discuss a little further in the financial review both adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin improved year on year and quarter on quarter driven both by price and the positive benefits from the mvantage operating system productivity initiatives undertaken throughout 2018 and in the first quarter of 2019 this is very encouraging to see given the negative impact of lower volume and higher material cost in the quarter additionally foreign exchange with a headwind of almost 3 million in the quarter and excluding that adjusted ebitda would have been up roughly 7 million or 11 for the quarter on our last call we outlined a series of restructuring actions and divestitures being taken to further improve our cost position and drive margin expansion we incurred 22 million in pre tax charges related to those actions in the first quarter which were principally related to noncash items russ will provide more detail on this later these charges were the cause of our year on year decline in net income for the quarter and excluding these charges adjusted to net income was flat moving to the right hand of the slide under business and operations similar to other construction related companies we were impacted by severe weather across north america in the quarter our architectural segment shouldered a brunt of this severe weather impact due to concentrations of facilities in the midwest in addition to record levels of snow the severe cold force curtailments of natural gas to businesses to ensure resources were available to each resident our customers in both architectural and north american residential were equally impacted by this cold weather as flooding in california leading to as well as flooding in california leading to reduce demand external challenges like these reinforce the importance of leveraging the masonite operating system to increase our responsiveness improve manufacturing productivity and increase the engagement and skills to our plant teams we re off to a strong start this year in addition to being on track for a number of lean certification 2019 we also held the record number of kaizen events in the first quarter these events usually take the form of a workshop where a cross section of plant employees identify and then brainstorm ways to remove inefficiencies in their current work processes this approach ensures the engagement of our manufacturing employees and driving a productivity mindset enabling us to better manage cost and help overcome the impact of wage and benefit inflation and our manufacturing employees personally benefit from this improvement through participation in the operations monthly incentive program so it s a great win win we re also progressing as planned with our restructuring actions since our last call we ve executed additional steps in the plant in march we completed the sale of a noncore business in the u k and closed another north american manufacturing facility and i ll go into more detail on our productivity and restructuring in a moment as you might remember our last earnings call was from the international builders show in las vegas during that show we launched a new livingston interior molded door i want to highlight the success of livingston door and how that speaks to the importance of product development in addition to initial customer surveys where we received over 70 preference ratings from professionals and consumers alike the livingston received the best product award from the bimsmith at ibs a truly transitional design the livingston is appealing to a broad array of customers and we re encouraged by the initial demand our focus on designing and launching new products like the livingston is a key element of our strategy to drive higher average unit price now the next slide we summarize the latest residential housing market data for our major geographies as you can see the top left chart u s housing starts continues to decline during the first quarter of 2019 single family starts were down 5 year on year and multi family declines worsened and in the quarter down 20 year on year while completions were up year on year growth of single family completion is relatively modest compared to prior quarter as you ve heard from many of the builders traffic has increased as the spring season selling build and many are expecting a return to growth in the months ahead while we re encouraged by these anecdotes we believe uncertainty remains and we re approaching our business decisions accordingly canadian housing starts continue to soften as well with multi family starts down 9 and single family starts down 33 this marks the third quarter in a row that multi family and single family starts were both negative u k housing completions again turned negative in the first quarter if you recall housing completions the starts were up year on year in the fourth quarter following declines in completions earlier in 2018 until there is more clarity around brexit we anticipate continued lumpiness and soft end markets in the u k now with all that said we still believe there are healthy underlying fundamentals and needs for additional shelter across our markets but in the near term it s difficult to predict when that will translate into consistently stronger market demand as such we ll continue to rely on a multi lever approach to increase the value of our offering while simultaneously cost optimizing our operations through both footprint actions and by leveraging our mvantage operating system on the next slide part of increasing our value offering is understanding market trend and our end customer needs to address this our north american residential business team has done an in depth review of builders most popular floor plans specifically gathering data related to square footage and number of interior doors working with five of our top national builders we selected five recently serviced and then we used three of the most common floor plans in each of those markets the result was a review of 75 floor plans in total with homes ranging from less than 1 400 square feet to almost 3 800 square feet our 2019 survey found that on average the current building plans review utilize an average of 18 doors per home interior doors per home if you look at nahb data from fourth quarter 2018 it shows that the average house size for new starts is a little over 2 500 square feet the base in our data which include different size home and some multi family units that put the average number of doors at about 19 we assumed 21 doors in the past for midsize home so this data would show about a two door shift down from a comparable sized home but it s important to note the variability even for a midsized house where the number of doors can range anywhere from the 13 to 27 again if you look at the scatterplot we prepared with you ll see that there s a clear correlation to the number of interior doors and square footage of home and the related trend line as we slide to the left on the trend line away from the average home size and it s smaller entry level homes we lose one door for roughly every 180 square feet so as builders continue to focus on and build entry level homes that would present a buying headwind for us so all these market trends may present a slight headwind we do believe though we can help mitigate this through continuing to shift our mix toward higher aup and differentiated products now on slide 8 let s take a closer look at operations and our progress with the announced restructuring plans as mentioned earlier the mvantage operating system is the foundation to drive continuous improvement at masonite the three key pillars of the mvantage operating system are training and standards which provide a toolset for our improvement programs pit crews or performance improvement teams deployed through the company to drive rapid improvement projects and finally plant transformations which are 13 week long focused improvement events with multiple teams across a single site addressing entire value streams if you recall last year we completed plant transformations at seven sites and this year we have two nearing completion one at our architectural door plant marshfield wisconsin and one at our residential door plant in monterrey mexico the moderate transformation is in the final stages and we re already seeing the benefits from this team s work with an 18 improvement in productivity and 24 improvement of weekly output we re consistently averaging greater than 50 000 doors per week at that facility up from a little over 31 000 in 2017 we ve discussed this increased capacity in our previous calls and how it has helped drive footprint optimization by reducing the overall cost of manufacturing in north america i already mentioned we re on track for a record year of lean certification and we held a record number of kaizen events in the first quarter of 2019 this is a 14 increase in kaizen events over the same period last year shifting to the middle of the slide in footprint optimization the verdi nevada cut stock plant is progressing as planned all of the key staff positions are filled and the hiring production positions is on schedule the production equipment is in and we began running parts for quality test in the week for april 1 as you may be aware the existing cut back cut stock facility in stockton california experienced a significant fire early last week the fire started at a non masonite property next door and then spread to our facility fortunately none of our employees were injured but the operations were severely impacted and after assessing the damage we ve decided not to restart that facility while the stockton cut stock operations were scheduled to close this year we d anticipated ramping down production later in the second quarter we re now pursuing an accelerated ramp up of the verdi plant and we ll also begin an incremental volume we ll bring in incremental volume from our other cut stock facility in chile as well as third party suppliers we continue to assess any financial impact of these sourcing changes and based on our current plan we believe we can mitigate the supply impact and fully service our customers as planned on our last earnings call we announced the closure of two north american facilities denmark south carolina and largo florida since then we ve announced the closure of our tampa manufacturing location as well this facility is part of a north american residential segment and its operations will be relocated to three existing facilities and prior productivity improvements and throughput and capacity expansion across our manufacturing network is enabling these consolidations during the first quarter we can continue to focus on reducing north american headcount related to sg a and overhead we ve mentioned that after a detailed review of staffing levels given the uncertain market environment we have developed plans to reduce these areas 5 in the first half of 2019 through a combination of attrition and focused restructuring as of the end of the first quarter we have largely achieved that target with sg a and overhead headcount reduced 4 from the year end 2018 moving to right column in portfolio optimization in february we announced that we had exited a noncore product line in the u k and that we plan to exit two other noncore businesses in march we completed the sale of our pds business in the u k this business has a limited product range and opportunities for integration with other parts of u k business were not what we had originally anticipated we plan to divest one additional noncore business from the u k during the second half of 2019 overall these divestitures will streamline our product portfolio without meaningful reductions to our core product offerings and allow us to reduce the number of manufacturing site and associated infrastructure costs the combine 2018 revenue from these three assets was 58 million while we re divesting noncore product lines and business we also continue to invest and launch new offerings in our core product portfolio like the livingston door mentioned earlier that strategic focus on new product introductions has pushed our north american residential vitality index above 11 as of the first quarter 2019 importantly these newly introduced products command a higher average unit price and margins and new products are just one aspect of our margin improvement we ve worked with customers in all the regions to streamline our product offering reduce complexity and rationalize low volume and margin skus ultimately driving higher aup for our customers as well as for masonite in mexico we realigned to put more focus on speciality products and in the process we ve increased aup and shed some business the capacity from that shed business similar to the capacity from the productivity improvements has been redirected to service higher aup and higher margin business i am particularly proud of the team s performance in q1 we re continuing to execute well on our strategic initiatives to enhance our margins as i just shared we re on schedule with our previously announced restructuring and plans for 10 reduction in the total number of manufacturing locations which we will now achieve by the end of 2019 as compared to the second half of 2020 as previously anticipated and so with i ll turn the call over to russ to provide more details on our first quarter financial performance russ russ tiejema executive vice president and chief financial officer all right thanks fred and good morning everyone on slide 10 we have a summary of our consolidated financial results for the quarter we had net sales of 530 million a 2 increase over the first quarter of 2018 as fred mentioned acquisitions and average unit price contributed approximately 5 and 4 respectively to this increase this was partially offset by a 5 decline in base volume due to softer end markets in north american residential and a 2 headwind from foreign currency gross profit and gross margin expansion were driven by the higher aup and net labor productivity partially offset by raw material inflation and the impact of lower production volumes as well as start up costs related to our new cut stock plant in verdi nevada gross profit was up over 6 in the first quarter with gross margin expanding 70 basis points versus the prior year to 21 1 sg a spending was 10 million higher in the first quarter largely driven by acquired businesses and noncash items noncash items increased by 5 million compared to the same period 2019 including higher depreciation and amortization and a 2 5 million charge related to the divestiture of etfs the noncore floor choice product line we exited in the u k in january the impact of sg a on adjusted ebitda was considerably less than on a gaap basis roughly 2 million primarily due to wage and benefit inflation and personal investments to support our architectural quick ship business and the integration of graham and maiman adjusted ebitda increased by almost 7 to 65 5 million while adjusted ebitda margin expanded 50 basis points to 12 4 referring to the adjusted ebitda bridge on the right hand side of the slide you can see the meaningful benefit that price and mix delivered in the quarter helping to overcome material cost increases and the impact of lower volumes on our manufacturing operations it s also worth noting the impact of fx on adjusted ebitda in the quarter which was higher than normal due to more significant transactional fx headwinds relating to weakening of the canadian dollar we also incurred meaningful translational fx in the u k due to the weakening of the british pound had it not been for these fx impacts adjusted ebitda would have been up double digits for the quarter commodity inflation was approximately 2 in the quarter less than anticipated and lower than our full year outlook of approximately 3 in part due to savings projects undertaken by our supply chain team the primary drivers of inflation for us continue to be steel as our contract towers reset higher in the prior quarter we re more in line with the overall higher market prices and chemicals which can fluctuate based on the price of oil chemical inflation moved lower in the first quarter as oil price declines in the second half of last year translated into reduce resin costs realized in our first quarter cost of sales given recent upward moves in oil this trend is likely to reverse in the next two quarters moving to factory cost we see the sizable impact that lower volumes had in the quarter approximately 3 million of the 4 million impact in factory cost relate to reduced overhead absorption on lower volumes we continue to manage cost carefully to address this lower demand environment as fred mentioned we continue to take overhead out of the organization we ve reduced indirect labor by an additional 3 during the first quarter as compared to the end of 2018 direct labor productivity continued to improve and was more than sufficient to offset the impact of wage and benefit inflation during the quarter distribution costs was relatively flat in the quarter as our logistics team continue to effectively offset higher carrier rates and fuel inflation and finally net income for the first quarter was approximately 4 million and diluted earnings per share was 0 15 diluted eps was down 0 58 per share from 0 73 per share in the first quarter of 2018 due to charges related to our previously announced restructuring actions and divestiture of noncore businesses excluding the impact of those pre tax charges of 22 million our adjusted diluted eps was 0 81 in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 0 73 in the comparable period of 2018 included in the 22 million our 4 million related to restructuring 11 million related to asset impairment 5 million for loss on the disposal of subsidiaries and 2 million for loss and disposable disposal of property plant and equipment related to divestitures now let s look at our reportable segments turning to slide 11 we ll start with north american residential net sales decreased by 2 in the first quarter but adjusted ebitda increased by 6 net sales declines were driven by a 9 decrease in base volumes due primarily to the soft end markets in our wholesale business along with the prior year retail line loss the beginning of the second quarter was the anniversary of this retail line loss so this is the last quarter we will see that impact in our year on year comparisons i d like to provide a little more color on how the wholesale business performed in the quarter if you recall we mentioned on our fourth quarter call that our north american residential wholesale business improved year on year for the month of january we subsequently saw the wholesale end market turned down slightly in february and continue to weaken in march a 1 decline from foreign exchange along with a 1 decline from sales of components added to the year on year declines in the first quarter sales declines were partially offset by a 6 improvements in average unit price driven primarily by pricing implemented in december and a 3 increase in volume from our bwi acquisition the integration of which is progressing as planned adjusted ebitda margins increased to 120 basis points in the quarter due to strong aup gains again primarily due to price additionally adjusted ebitda margin in this segment benefited from the labor productivity i noted earlier which fully covered labor inflation despite overhead reductions and an improved factory cost structure we experienced unfavorable absorption due to lower volumes however which partially offset the benefit of improved productivity turning to slide 12 in our europe segment net sales decreased by 3 compared to the first quarter of last year due to a 7 decline from foreign exchange driven by a weaker british pound we also incurred a 1 decline from acquisitions and divestitures reflecting the impact of the divestiture of the timber flooring product line along with a 1 decline from sales components partially offsetting these declines was a 5 increase in base volumes for the quarter given the uncertainty in the u k it s encouraging to see base volumes up year on year if you recall we saw positive starts from out of the u k the back half of last year and it appears this translated to positive demand for our products in the first quarter adjusted ebitda grew in the first quarter by 1 over the comparable period of 2018 adjusted ebitda margin of 11 9 was up year on year by 50 basis points despite higher material cost aided by strong results through dw3 from an operational standpoint the u k successfully completed the consolidation of their customer service and accounting functions in the quarter moving to slide 13 in the architectural segment net sales increased by 28 in the first quarter primarily driven by 21 growth from our graham and maiman acquisition as well as increases in base volume and average unit price up 2 and 5 respectively aup gains were the result of like for like price partially offset by mix while we re pleased with the sales growth in architectural adjusted ebitda margins were heavily impacted by severe weather as fred mentioned the architectural segment was disproportionately hit by the severe weather in the midwest approximately 80 of the total production ships lost across masonite in the first quarter were architectural facilities this coupled with the expected impact of acquisition integration costs for graham and maiman resulted in considerable pressure on margins aside from the weather impact architectural operations are performing well given this quarter s net sales growth along with positive order trends year on year we remain optimistic for 2019 before i hand it back to fred let me review our liquidity profile on slide 15 you can see our total available liquidity including unrestricted cash and accounts receivable purchase agreement and our undrawn abl facility was 254 million or approximately 12 of our trailing 12 month net sales as of march 31 2019 at the end of the first quarter total debt and net debt to trailing 12 month adjusted ebitda were 2 9 times and 2 6 times respectively cash flow from operations was 19 million in the quarter while lower than an exceptionally strong first quarter of 2018 we solidly performed in what is typically a minimal cash flow quarter given the seasonal working capital profile of our business capital expenditures were 20 million in the quarter in line with our expected pace and outlook of 75 million to 80 million for 2019 as fred mentioned the organization is executing well on our key strategic initiatives and this includes the deployment of capital for its strategic projects lastly we continue to execute our share repurchase program in the first quarter purchasing approximately 646 000 shares at an average price of 51 37 per share totaling approximately 33 million in the quarter and with that i ll now turn the call back to fred to summarize today s discussion fred lynch president and chief executive officer great thank you russ so to summarize we delivered higher net sales increased adjusted ebitda and expanded adjusted ebitda margins in the first quarter growth from acquisitions and higher aup primarily due to price more than offset sales declines in north american residential base volume and higher than expected negative foreign exchange while lower volumes and higher material inflation put pressure on adjusted ebitda margins higher aup and our productivity improvements more than offset these impacts we felt some additional pressure on margins from weather but that was fortunately isolated to our architectural segment given our performance in the first quarter we believe we are still positioned for full year adjusted ebitda margin expansion we continue to drive the mvantage operating system across the organization we re off to a strong start having already achieved a record number of kaizen events in the first quarter and are on pace for a record number of lean certifications in 2019 our restructuring is progressing well given our progress to date we now expect to achieve a 10 reduction in the total number of manufacturing locations by the end of 2019 as compared to the second half of 2020 as previously expected as this will be my last quarterly call as ceo i want to thank the investors and analysts on the phone for their support through the years five and a half years ago we took masonite public with the trailing 12 month adjusted ebitda just a tad over 100 million and thanks to the hard work and dedication of our roughly 10 000 employees have grown that to over 270 million at the end of the first quarter while the company is in a solid financial position on all counts there is still more juice to be had and i am confident that howard and the masonite leadership team will continue to build on that positive momentum of q1 and drive toward result outlined in our long term strategic growth framework the best part of this job by far has been the opportunity to serve the 10 000 employees who have a heart and soul of our company our employees have built an incredible culture that emanates from our purpose we help people walk through walls we do this both physically by offering great products and metaphorically through our culture engaging each other and providing our teams with the tools training development and confidence to cross new thresholds and by encouraging people in our communities to be part of our team that s why people come to work at masonite and why they choose to stay and make a career here and i will miss that part terribly but as i always say all good things must come to an end and after 12 years as ceo my time is up howard will have a strong foundation to build upon and a great and talented leadership team ready to support him in serving the 10 000 employees and helping them continue to walk through the walls i very much look forward to reading the next chapter in masonite s history as it nears its 100th birthday in 2025 under the leadership of howard heckes and with that we d like to open the call to questions operator questions answers operator our first question comes from the line of michael rehaut of j p morgan please proceed with your question elad hillman j p morgan analyst it s elad on for mike i wanted to just get a little bit more color on the trend in north america residential wholesale business you mentioned that you re up in january down in february and down more in march just wondering kind of what happened in march and february and what you re seeing in april and then more specifically on customer inventory levels i think after their lack of pre lie in 4q things seem to return to normal in january and so just wondering what those are and if there s still maybe lowering inventory levels thanks russ tiejema executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah elad it s russ i ll kick off and then tony can jump in and add some additional color particularly as it relates to general dynamics and inventory i would describe q1 generally as moderating as we went through the quarter growth in january sliding to just slight softening in february and then down a few percentage points in march those comments are specific to the wholesale business in north america so definitely some moderation over the course of the quarter as we look at april right now if you step back and look at total revenue picture for the company when you strip out fx i would describe performance as flattish so tony you want to add some more color on north america tony hair president of global residential yeah i think certainly we felt the softening of the end markets as we went through we ve seen tough weather in some of the big markets that we do business with from california down through the south and even in the midwest and in april we felt some of that softness still in the marketplace to russ point our customers however are pretty bullish that they believe that building is coming back and that as the weather sides they re going to see a move back in a positive direction and remember we re late in the build cycle in terms of our product category so some of our customers have started to see a rough number of things picking up and we expect to get back in a more positive nature but we are cautious about what that s going to look like as we go forward which is what has driven the restructuring in the plans that we put in place so relative the customer inventory feels really good we know we have some customers who are starting to elevate their inventories in anticipation of some of the return in the market and we re working with them on that but we feel like customer inventories are absolutely in the right spot right now elad hillman j p morgan analyst thank you and also just one more on the mix and the wholesale business and i appreciate the review you gave with shift to entry level homes and the number of doors per home i was also interested in terms of mix and driving the higher aup products and any early feedback from the builders or other consumers specifically from the entry level consumers and how maybe the livingston indoor or some of the other new products that you guys are coming out with how these characteristics could appeal to entry level buyers in particular tony hair president of global residential yeah i think elad that s a great question and i think our new product vitality index demonstrates that even with a move toward more entry level we are seeing both consumers demand for more contemporary styles and more current products and builder s response to that so even if there are fewer doors and we do see the demand for those more on trend styles being represented and that s why we ve seen the heritage product line do so well and why the reception around livingston has been very positive so we think we ll continue to see that positive mix elad hillman j p morgan analyst great thanks guys fred lynch president and chief executive officer thank you russ tiejema executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator our next question comes from the line of tim wojs of robert w baird company please proceed with your question tim wojs robert w baird and company analyst thanks good morning everybody and nice job on the ebitda improvement here and fred i want to wish you well on your retirement here with this being your last call as ceo fred lynch president and chief executive officer thanks tim tim wojs robert w baird and company analyst i guess my first question just on price cost for the year i think both price is a little better than we thought and it sounds like inflation was maybe a little bit better than you thought so i guess if we look through the balances of 2019 any update to kind of what you re expecting from a pricing and a cost inflation type numbers through 19 now russ tiejema executive vice president and chief financial officer hey tim it s russ let me start perhaps talking about the cost of the equation and then i ll circle that back to price cost to overall we did see a little bit less inflation in the quarter than we would have anticipated as i commented earlier about 2 whereas our viewpoint on the year is 3 roughly equivalent across the quarters some of that was due to the impact of a lower resident inflation as i commented in the prepared remarks and there could be some likelihood that that reverses against us as we get into the next couple quarters just given the delay that we see between higher oil prices and how that translates into our chemicals costs which is a significant part of our materials cost to sales basket so overall nothing that suggest at this point that we would move meaningfully off of that viewpoint of 3 costs for the year relative to price cost clearly we had a favorable relationship in the first quarter as you ve heard us say in the past our strategy is always to maintain a neutral to favorable price cost relationship we re pleased with the ability of the business to put the price increasing through that we had announced after the end of the year and you re now seeing that margin improvement as a result of this two dynamics tim wojs robert w baird and company analyst ok ok and then maybe going back to the wholesale discussion a little bit just i think the volumes have run the volume you re talking about a run maybe just a little counter to what we ve heard from some other company so do you feel like your customers may have kept a little more inventory in the channel just to see how the new construction markets developed and then is there a little slower development and so they kind of destock toward the end of the quarter just any more color on just kind of how you would think through the pace for the year because it does run a little counter or the pace of the quarter it did run a little counter relative to what other people have talked about tony hair president of global residential yeah tim this is tony i think certainly as you look across the markets where we had weather impact there were certainly customer organizations that did not meet their own expectations in terms of going out the door so they were they had a little higher inventory i would say that they ve managed that very effectively and so in working with them as we see the market come back we think we ll be in a good spot so i don t think there was anything remarkable about that but certainly a little disappointed in what we saw in the demand and the end market shift throughout the quarter tim wojs robert w baird and company analyst ok and then maybe just the last one from me so the restructuring in terms of the plant take out sounds ahead of schedule any change to how we should think about realizing some of the associated restructuring benefits in kind of that cadence between 2019 and 2020 russ tiejema executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah tim it s russ really no impact in 2019 associated with that we have previously thought that we really wouldn t hit full run rate for those savings until we get closer to the end of 2020 we may see some acceleration of that but no impact on 2019 tim wojs robert w baird and company analyst ok great good luck on the rest of year thanks for the time fred lynch president and chief executive officer thank you russ tiejema executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks tim operator our next question comes from the line of mike eisen of rbc capital markets please proceed with your question mike eisen rbc capital markets analyst thanks guys for taking the questions and fred congratulations on last call and a good tenure i just wanted to see if we can get a little more color on the price volume dynamics in north america specifically how in the quarter this compared to both the marketing and your expectations and then how we should think about the strategy of price and volume as we move forward fred lynch president and chief executive officer yeah so i ll kick that off so this is fred i think that when we look across the business right now we think from a volume perspective we kept up with the market i think it was right in line with what our customers were seeing again i think as both tony and graham can explain what we saw a lot in the different geographies of the country it was really based on some of these weather conditions where i thought that i think the lumpiness even we saw in the quarter was related to whether or not customers can actually take product in so we re looking at it right now from price volume perspective that the plan as we go through the rest of the year is exactly as we anticipated with regards to how the market will continue to the progress mike eisen rbc capital markets analyst got it that s helpful and then thinking about the productivity improvement and some of the initial successes you guys have talked to through kaizen events and then some of these more transformational reviews how should we think about the headwind that we saw from factory and productivity in the first quarter and should we expect that to inflect to tailwind moving forward from these initiatives fred lynch president and chief executive officer yeah i think the answer is yes i mean the factory productivity the factory cost in the first quarter were largely due to lower volumes so if this is really the utilization of our assets we actually were able to offset any a lot of the wage inflation through our productivity programs so i would say that right now we feel like the operations team and the operating programs on that slide that we showed earlier with regards to how we re driving our mvantage program the driving of our footprint optimization and even the overall portfolio optimization as we shed some of the lower margin businesses we ll continue to show demonstrate positive performance on the cost side mike eisen rbc capital markets analyst very helpful and then one more if i can sneak it in it seems like a lot of that is coming through on the architectural segment and the margins have been pressured over the last couple of quarters granted some of it from the lower volumes should we think of it as those weather headwinds a bait that that segment will go back to margin expansion as we move into the second quarter and the back half of the year fred lynch president and chief executive officer that s big yes i m looking at graham too and he s shaking his head graham thayer senior vice president business leader of architectural nodding affirmatively fred lynch president and chief executive officer quite frankly the team did a i think a very good job and given the weather impact on that plant how many plant ships we lost we actually were pleased with the performance while it does didn t demonstrate growth year on year underlying performance was very solid mike eisen rbc capital markets analyst got it thanks for taking the questions fred lynch president and chief executive officer thank you russ tiejema executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator our next question comes from the line of michael wood of nomura instinet please proceed with your question mason marion nomura instinet analyst this is mason marion on for mike you had a relatively easy comp in the u k but we still get to see volume growth there can you talk about the sustainability of this volume growth and then if any high level commentary on the housing market in the u k and whether or not you guys are stealing share russ tiejema executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah good morning mason it s russ i think generally speaking when you step back a look at the u k it s been just a very lumpy market in light of everything that s occurred with brexit we see a lot of volatility even in the statistics we see reported on a quarter to quarter basis with respect to starts and completions so there s nothing that suggests that lumpiness is going to correct itself between now and call it late in the year when hopefully we finally have visibility on what a brexit mechanism looks like for that market i think the biggest point of volatility that we re seeing there is fx and remember we had significant fx declines in the europe segment specifically in u k in the first quarter in fact the pound sterling was down circa 6 5 versus the u s dollar so absent that you would have seen even stronger growth in revenues in the u k general market trends there seem to be recovering our base volume seems to be doing fine in that business again once you strip out fx so we re not feeling bad about that market at all but we are prepared for uncertainty in the balance of the year mason marion nomura instinet analyst great thank you russ tiejema executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator our next question comes from line of kevin hocevar of northcoast research please proceed with your question kevin hocevar northcoast research analyst hey good morning everybody and fred congrats again on the retirement on slide 7 you show how growth queuing toward entry level homes is hurting your volumes in north american residential i m wondering it s helpful to see all that but wondering if you can help quantify how big of a headwind is this you talked about 18 19 or so entry interior doors per kind of floor plan at this point used to be 21 so i mean when you think about how that impacts the industry and your business is it a 1 2 3 how big of a headwind do you see that to volumes on an annual basis fred lynch president and chief executive officer yeah i ll start that one off and i think one of the challenges we have much better and much more discrete data today about exactly what we re seeing in each of these homes as you can see from this scatterplot when we talked to the 21 doors back in the day that was a much more anecdotal i think number based on feedback that we got from our customers we didn t have this level of research and data associated with it as i look as we look at this chart there s really a few things that stand out i think as we mentioned it s about a door for 180 square feet if you just follow the slope of that lifeline and so i d say that as we ll continue to watch the average home size and how that moves right now it s just over 2 500 square feet we don t see that dropping down below rapidly below 2 300 square feet over the next years so but that could have an impact of one door and one doors is roughly 5 the other part of the equation here i think is the variability well this you can see a significant variability from top to bottom in this chart so we know we re going to continue to focus in on that and add to this data set pick up more of a view on multi family homes so that we can then help better understand what that impact will be to us in the long term and more importantly how do we influence that impact as we shared internally there s a lot of little green dots it s well below that line that we like to go back and figure out how we work those homeowners and start to change and those homebuilders i should say and start to change their perspective on why we re using so few doors in those homes kevin hocevar northcoast research analyst gotcha ok and then can you talk to canada specifically i mean obviously starts there have been pretty weak so what are you seeing from a volume perspective in that market and given the weakness seen there how was the competition in that market are you seeing any pricing pressure in total north america residential average unit price looked really really good but just kind of curious if you can give some color on what you re seeing in canada tony hair president of global residential yeah this is tony i think we talked about the third quarter in a row when we saw starts on both ends single family multi family being down that has undoubtedly has significantly impact on overall demand in canada i think from position standpoint we feel good about the partners that we have the product that we brought to bear and they are primed and ready to be able to support building as it plays out there so there hasn t been any undue price pressure or a change as a result of that we monitor that with our partners throughout the business and we haven t seen anything extraordinary there in terms of price differentiation fred lynch president and chief executive officer yeah i would say that in some way the it really does act as a combined north american market and so while you might have regional differences we in some way and at least on a residential side canada s more like a region of north america kevin hocevar northcoast research analyst gotcha ok very helpful thank you very much fred lynch president and chief executive officer thanks kevin operator our next question comes from the line of john baugh of stifel please proceed with your question john baugh stifel financial corp analyst good morning and fred wish you all the best in retirement my question is around aup and i think russ mentioned that it was somewhat more skewed to price than mix but could you help us as we model out the remaining nine months of this year with that sort of price expectation impact aup versus the mix thank you russ tiejema executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah john it s russ well as you know we re very circumspect about talking perspective without price but let me give you a little bit of color about the price and mix dynamics the one thing i d remind you of is recall from an aup perspective the loss of retail business the line review from the second quarter of last year has actually served as a headwind to our aup in the north american residential business and that s been roughly a point worth of headwind the last couple of quarters simply because that business was largely of pre hung doors as opposed to door slabs being sold into the wholesale channel so as our mix of pre hung products has reduced given that loss of a retail business that has had been a headwind we now will lap that in the second quarter and what you ll see going forward would be more representative of balance in price and mix john baugh stifel financial corp analyst ok and the pricing that you perceived both through calendar 18 and the warm the increase at the end of the year has that been balanced across distribution channel i e builders homes centers etc russ tiejema executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so we took pricing across all channels and all product lines john baugh stifel financial corp analyst thank you very much russ tiejema executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks john operator our next question comes from the line of reuben garner of seaport global securities please proceed with your question reuben garner seaport global securities analyst thanks good morning everyone so sg a in the quarter was a little bit higher than we modeled was there anything one time that went on i know you called i think in the presentation some integration expense can you just talk about maybe the cadence for sg a for the rest of the year that s kind of embedded in your outlook russ tiejema executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah sure reuben it s russ as i commented during the prepared remarks if you just look at the pace in the p l there s about a 10 million increase in sg a but all but 2 million of that would have been related to either new businesses that we d acquired and the sg a that came with them or some of the noncash items like higher d a and we did have some charges in there related to disposal of sale of assets associated to restructuring from an ebitda perspective it was only about a 2 million increase and that was reflective of both wage and benefit inflation and some additional investment that we made in resources in the architectural business so specifically the quick ship business and architectural continues to demonstrate strong growth and good margin performance so we re investing in certain areas there and then there are some costs associated with for example services agreement as we wind off the integration of graham and maiman so from a standpoint of how that rolls out through the year some of that cost is going to naturally be embedded in the business as we go forward just because of wage and benefit inflation in some of those investments that we ve made reuben garner seaport global securities analyst ok got it so if you had to quantify maybe what was kind of one time in nature or just specific to q1 is there a dollar amount that you could call out that maybe wouldn t recur going forward or is that not the right way to think about it russ tiejema executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah there was about 2 5 million worth of one time charges just related to disposals our d a was up about 3 million that s probably going to be more of an on going basis just from projects that we ve rolled in and then we also had 4 million of restructuring charges that were dialed out of our adjusted ebitda those would be one time in nature although we ll continue to have some restructuring costs each quarter as we complete the closure of plants again you won t see those in our adjusted figures as we go forward reuben garner seaport global securities analyst ok and then that s very helpful and one clarification for me follow up on the last question the so your comment that aup has seen about a point drag over the last four quarters so in other words you would ve seen about a seven point increase in q1 what i mean i know you don t like to talk about going forward a number but what other items are there to think about pluses and minuses that would impact that level for the remainder of 2019 fred lynch president and chief executive officer yeah just to be clear that was 1 not it s not additive it s cumulative russ tiejema executive vice president and chief financial officer well the point is that with respect to aup we ve had the last several quarters about one point worth of drag in the north american business as a result of lower pre hung business in the retail channel you step back and look at the different pieces of aup price and mix within mix you re going to have a dynamic of channel mix pre hung versus slab and you also have the impact of product mix and so i would just think about it in terms of as we roll out continued new product introductions tony and fred talked about the livingston in particular and the great reception that that s had that should be a tailwind for average unit price in addition to pure price actions reuben garner seaport global securities analyst all right thank you guys operator our next question comes from the line of steven ramsey of thompson research group please proceed with your question brian biros thompson research group analyst hey good morning this is actually brian biros on for steven thank you for taking my questions i think most of them have been answered but i guess you just touched on the north american volumes i know you gave some good insight into the volume decline there across the various factors but is that something you could quantify into like what percentage was weather related what was housing starts channel withdrawals and anything else tony hair president of global residential yeah brian i don t know if we can get that specific or would be able to quantify that really well we know that all of those things had an impact and again we believe that with the optimism in the market that we ll see that some of those subside and be able to play out more favorably going forward brian biros thompson research group analyst ok any guess on whether if that was even ballpark 25 50 or just stop if you want anything you can get to tony hair president of global residential i m not going to guess about that or future weather events so brian biros thompson research group analyst understood and i guess just one last one on the architectural side with the some of the recent acquisitions you guys have had any changes to the strategy or thoughts on those going forward given how q1 shaped up and what the rest of the year looks like graham thayer senior vice president business leader of architectural no i think we re going on as planned it s graham by the way we re continuing to integrate the business and really take advantage of the network we have right now and we re working through some of the purchasing synergies that were part of acquisition so i think we still pretty much going on with the plan that we had put together and we re very happy with the acquisitions and things are moving very smoothly in that direction brian biros thompson research group analyst sounds good thanks fred lynch president and chief executive officer thank you russ tiejema executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator there are no further questions at this point in the conference i would like to turn the conference back over to president and ceo mr fred lynch fred lynch president and chief

the u s is waging a war against venezuela the bolivarian republic the war has already taken a very high toll death of 40 000 people in the country in 2017 2018 due to sanctions the most powerful economy in the world has imposed finds a study it is a genocide columbia university economics professor jeffrey sachs carried out the study the study report economic sanctions as collective punishment the case of venezuela said most of the impact of these sanctions has not been on the government but on the civilian population the report published by washington dc based the centre for economic and policy research cepr examines affect of the sanctions imposed by the u s after august 2017 on the lives of ordinary citizens of venezuela sachs professor of economics and director of the center for sustainable development at columbia university and his co author economist mark weisbrot co director at the center for economic and policy research cepr argue that these sanctions have caused and continue to cause harm and threaten venezuelans lives and well being 40 000 deaths in 2017 18 the report finds that the sanctions have inflicted and increasingly inflict very serious harm to human life and health including an estimated more than 40 000 deaths from 2017 2018 one result of the sanctions as described above is to deprive the venezuelan economy of many billions of dollars of foreign exchange needed to pay for essential and life saving imports the sanctions implemented in 2019 including the recognition of a parallel government accelerated this deprivation and also cut off venezuela from most of the international payments system thus ending much of the country s access to these essential imports including medicine and food even those that could normally be bought with available dollars there is no doubt that all of these sanctions since august 2017 have had severe impacts on human life and health according to the national survey on living conditions encovi by its acronym in spanish an annual survey of living conditions administered by three venezuelan universities there was a 31 percent increase in general mortality from 2017 to 2018 this would imply an increase of more than 40 000 deaths more than 300 000 people were estimated to be at risk because of lack of access to medicines or treatment this includes an estimated 80 000 people with hiv who have not had antiretroviral treatment since 2017 16 000 people who need dialysis 16 000 people with cancer and 4 million with diabetes and hypertension many of whom cannot obtain insulin or cardiovascular medicine these numbers by themselves virtually guarantee that the current sanctions which are much more severe than those implemented before this year are a death sentence for tens of thousands of venezuelans this is especially true if the projected 67 percent drop in oil revenue materializes in 2019 the accelerating economic collapse that current sanctions have locked in assures further impacts on health and premature deaths for example the increasing collapse of export revenue and therefore imports has also created massive public health problems in the areas of water and sanitation the electricity crisis has also affected hospitals and health care food imports have dropped sharply along with overall imports in 2018 they were estimated at just 2 46 billion as compared with 11 2 billion in 2013 they can be expected to plummet further in 2019 along with imports generally contributing to malnutrition and stunting in children the un finds the groups most vulnerable to the accelerating crisis include children and adolescents including many who can no longer attend school people who are in poverty or extreme poverty pregnant and nursing women older persons indigenous people people in need of protection women and adolescent girls at risk people with disabilities and people who identify as lesbian gay bisexual transgender or intersex collective punishment it said these sanctions would fit the definition of collective punishment of the civilian population as described in both the geneva and hague international conventions to which the us is a signatory the study report says the economists stressed that series of u s imposed sanctions have made it very hard for venezuelans to have access to food medicine and medical equipment the sanctions implemented in 2019 including the recognition of a parallel government cut off venezuela from most of the international payments system thus ending much of the country s access to these essential imports including medicine and food even those that could normally be bought with available money there is no doubt that all of these sanctions since august 2017 have had severe impacts on human life and health august 2017 sanctions on the sanctions imposed in august 2017 the report said the report said the us government imposed sanctions since august of 2017 have reduced the public s caloric intake increased disease and mortality for both adults and infants and displaced millions of venezuelans who fled the country as a result of the worsening economic depression and hyperinflation they exacerbated venezuela s economic crisis and made it nearly impossible to stabilize the economy contributing further to excess deaths the report said the sanctions prohibited the venezuelan government from borrowing in us financial markets this prevented the government from restructuring its foreign debt because any debt restructuring requires the issuance of new bonds in exchange for the existing debt thus these sanctions prevented the economy from recovering from a deep recession which had already taken a large toll on the population which along with the economy was more vulnerable to these sanctions and the ones that followed because of the economic crisis real gdp had already declined by about 24 7 percent from 2013 through 2016 and consumer price inflation for january to august 2017 was probably somewhere between 758 percent and 1 350 percent at an annual rate it said it is important to emphasize that nearly all of the foreign exchange that is needed to import medicine food medical equipment spare parts and equipment needed for electricity generation water systems or transportation is received by the venezuelan economy through the government s revenue from the export of oil thus any sanctions that reduce export earnings and therefore government revenue thereby reduce the imports of these essential and in many cases life saving goods the august 2017 sanctions adversely affected oil production in venezuela however following the august 2017 executive order oil production crashed falling at more than three times the rate of the previous twenty months this would be expected from the loss of credit and therefore the ability to cover maintenance and operations and carry out new investments necessary to maintain production levels this acceleration in the rate of decline of oil production would imply a loss of 6 billion in oil revenue over the ensuing year this by itself is an enormous loss of foreign exchange relative to the country s need for essential imports imports of food and medicine for 2018 were just 2 6 billion total imports of goods for 2018 were about 10 billion the loss of so many billions of dollars of foreign exchange and government revenues was very likely the main shock that pushed the economy from its high inflation when the august 2017 sanctions were implemented into the hyperinflation that followed other executive decisions made by the trump administration resulted in the closure of venezuelan accounts in financial institutions loss of access to credit and other financial restrictions that have had severe negative impacts on oil production as well as the economy january 2019 sanctions on the sanctions imposed in 2019 the report said the immediate impact of the january sanctions was to cut off venezuela from its largest oil market the united states which had bought 35 6 percent of venezuela s oil exports in 2018 or about 586 000 barrels per day on average in the week of march 15 us imports of venezuelan oil fell to zero for the first time and they remained at zero for another two weeks before rebounding to a fraction of their 2018 average it said because of these sanctions and other efforts venezuela s oil production declined by 130 000 barrels per day from january to february in the six months prior it was declining by an average of 20 500 barrels per day then in march it fell another 289 000 barrels per day for a total of 431 000 barrels per day this is an economically devastating 36 4 percent plunge in oil production just since the january sanctions this drop if maintained over the next year would cut another 6 8 billion from venezuela s available foreign exchange earnings this is about 21 percent of export earnings from 2018 however oil export revenues in 2019 are projected to fall by a cataclysmic and unprecedented 67 2 percent from 2018 because of the impact of tightening sanctions the january sanctions also froze many billions of dollars of venezuelan assets that could have been sold in order to maintain essential and life saving imports or to stabilize the economy these included most of the government s 9 billion in reserves that are in gold trade credits worth an estimated 3 4 billion and citgo with estimated net assets of 5 2 billion after the january sanctions and the recognition of guaidó as interim president which made him according to the trump administration and other governments recognizing the parallel government the legal owner of any funds transferred or goods bought by the venezuelan government venezuela s access to correspondent banks for international transactions was mostly wiped out this included access to necessary credits for imports of medicine food and other essential goods the sanctions have also contributed substantially to the length and economic damage of power outages including the severe electricity crises in march the report said all of these impacts disproportionately harmed the poorest and most vulnerable venezuelans even more severe and destructive than the broad economic sanctions of august 2017 were the sanctions imposed by executive order on january 28 2019 and subsequent executive orders this year and the recognition of a parallel government created a completely new set of financial and trade sanctions that are even more constricting than the executive orders themselves sanctions are illegal another important aspect highlighted in the report is that the us is breaking international law as well as violating the principles of the un by imposing sanctions they are illegal under international law and treaties which the us has signed and would appear to violate us law as well the economists wrote the report said the sanctions are illegal under international law and treaties which the us has signed and would appear to violate u s law as well the unilateral sanctions imposed by the trump administration are illegal under the charter of the organization of american states oas especially articles 19 and 20 of chapter iv they are also illegal under international human rights law as well as treaties signed by the united states the sanctions also violate us law each executive order since march 2015 declares that the united states is suffering from a national emergency because of the situation in venezuela this is required by us law in order to impose such sanctions and the national emergency is invoked under the 1976 national emergencies act this is the same law that president trump invoked in february 2019 when declaring a national emergency to circumvent congressional appropriation for funds to build a wall along the border with mexico the executive order also states as required by law that venezuela presents an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security of the united states there is no foundation in fact for either of these declarations there are many provisions in the charter that prohibit these sanctions but among the most clear and unambiguous are articles 19 and 20 of chapter iv article 19 says no state or group of states has the right to intervene directly or indirectly for any reason whatever in the internal or external affairs of any other state the foregoing principle prohibits not only armed force but also any other form of interference or attempted threat against the personality of the state or against its political economic and cultural elements article 20 says no state may use or encourage the use of coercive measures of an economic or political character in order to force the sovereign will of another state and obtain from it advantages of any kind the report said thus one of the most important impacts of the sanctions in terms of its effects on human life and health is to lock venezuela into a downward economic spiral for this reason it is important to note that when we look at for example the estimated more than 40 000 excess deaths that occurred just from 2017 to 2018 the counterfactual possibility in the absence of sanctions is not just zero excess deaths but actually a reduction in mortality and other improvements in health indicators that is because an economic recovery could have already begun in the absence of economic sanctions and conversely the death toll going forward this year if the sanctions remain in place is almost certainly going to be vastly higher than anything we have seen previously given the highly accelerated rate of decline of oil production and therefore the availability of essential imports and the accelerated decline of income per person spain to limit lopez s political activity imperialist camp backed venezuelan politician leopold lopez who has sought refuge in the spanish embassy in caracas will have his political activities restricted said spain s acting foreign minister spain will not permit its embassy to be converted in to a center of political activity by mr lopez or anyone else acting foreign minister josep borrell said spain s government acknowledged thursday that lopez who was illegally unlocked from house arrest to assist with an attempted coup d état on the government under president nicolas maduro tuesday cannot request the status of political asylum from venezuela because such a request must be made only within spanish territory lopez has not asked for political asylum because according to our legislation for that you must request it while on spanish territory borrell said adding that while lopez remains at the embassy there would be a limit to his political activity according to the venezuelan government lopez who has sought refuge in the spanish embassy cannot request political asylum as spain was not a signatory of the diplomatic asylum convention of caracas of

comprehensive search process that included numerous strong internal and external candidates we re thrilled to welcome howard to make the masonite team and look forward to his joining the company next month and continuing to build upon masonite solid foundation and strong momentum so now let s move to this quarter s result as joanne mentioned late yesterday we released our first quarter 2019 financial results net sales increased 2 in the first quarter as compared to the prior year due to growth from acquisitions of 5 and healthy average unit price growth of 4 as we benefited from the december 2018 price increases as well as those previously implemented in 2018 soft end markets in north american residential due to a combination of difficult weather and lower housing construction activity led to a 5 decline in base volume net sales were also impacted by a 2 decrease due to foreign exchange the weakening of the british pound and the canadian dollar year on year had both a significant translational and a transactional impact on us which russ will discuss a little further in the financial review both adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin improved year on year and quarter on quarter driven both by price and the positive benefits from the mvantage operating system productivity initiatives undertaken throughout 2018 and in the first quarter of 2019 this is very encouraging to see given the negative impact of lower volume and higher material cost in the quarter additionally foreign exchange with a headwind of almost 3 million in the quarter and excluding that adjusted ebitda would have been up roughly 7 million or 11 for the quarter on our last call we outlined a series of restructuring actions and divestitures being taken to further improve our cost position and drive margin expansion we incurred 22 million in pre tax charges related to those actions in the first quarter which were principally related to noncash items russ will provide more detail on this later these charges were the cause of our year on year decline in net income for the quarter and excluding these charges adjusted to net income was flat moving to the right hand of the slide under business and operations similar to other construction related companies we were impacted by severe weather across north america in the quarter our architectural segment shouldered a brunt of this severe weather impact due to concentrations of facilities in the midwest in addition to record levels of snow the severe cold force curtailments of natural gas to businesses to ensure resources were available to each resident our customers in both architectural and north american residential were equally impacted by this cold weather as flooding in california leading to as well as flooding in california leading to reduce demand external challenges like these reinforce the importance of leveraging the masonite operating system to increase our responsiveness improve manufacturing productivity and increase the engagement and skills to our plant teams we re off to a strong start this year in addition to being on track for a number of lean certification 2019 we also held the record number of kaizen events in the first quarter these events usually take the form of a workshop where a cross section of plant employees identify and then brainstorm ways to remove inefficiencies in their current work processes this approach ensures the engagement of our manufacturing employees and driving a productivity mindset enabling us to better manage cost and help overcome the impact of wage and benefit inflation and our manufacturing employees personally benefit from this improvement through participation in the operations monthly incentive program so it s a great win win we re also progressing as planned with our restructuring actions since our last call we ve executed additional steps in the plant in march we completed the sale of a noncore business in the u k and closed another north american manufacturing facility and i ll go into more detail on our productivity and restructuring in a moment as you might remember our last earnings call was from the international builders show in las vegas during that show we launched a new livingston interior molded door i want to highlight the success of livingston door and how that speaks to the importance of product development in addition to initial customer surveys where we received over 70 preference ratings from professionals and consumers alike the livingston received the best product award from the bimsmith at ibs a truly transitional design the livingston is appealing to a broad array of customers and we re encouraged by the initial demand our focus on designing and launching new products like the livingston is a key element of our strategy to drive higher average unit price now the next slide we summarize the latest residential housing market data for our major geographies as you can see the top left chart u s housing starts continues to decline during the first quarter of 2019 single family starts were down 5 year on year and multi family declines worsened and in the quarter down 20 year on year while completions were up year on year growth of single family completion is relatively modest compared to prior quarter as you ve heard from many of the builders traffic has increased as the spring season selling build and many are expecting a return to growth in the months ahead while we re encouraged by these anecdotes we believe uncertainty remains and we re approaching our business decisions accordingly canadian housing starts continue to soften as well with multi family starts down 9 and single family starts down 33 this marks the third quarter in a row that multi family and single family starts were both negative u k housing completions again turned negative in the first quarter if you recall housing completions the starts were up year on year in the fourth quarter following declines in completions earlier in 2018 until there is more clarity around brexit we anticipate continued lumpiness and soft end markets in the u k now with all that said we still believe there are healthy underlying fundamentals and needs for additional shelter across our markets but in the near term it s difficult to predict when that will translate into consistently stronger market demand as such we ll continue to rely on a multi lever approach to increase the value of our offering while simultaneously cost optimizing our operations through both footprint actions and by leveraging our mvantage operating system on the next slide part of increasing our value offering is understanding market trend and our end customer needs to address this our north american residential business team has done an in depth review of builders most popular floor plans specifically gathering data related to square footage and number of interior doors working with five of our top national builders we selected five recently serviced and then we used three of the most common floor plans in each of those markets the result was a review of 75 floor plans in total with homes ranging from less than 1 400 square feet to almost 3 800 square feet our 2019 survey found that on average the current building plans review utilize an average of 18 doors per home interior doors per home if you look at nahb data from fourth quarter 2018 it shows that the average house size for new starts is a little over 2 500 square feet the base in our data which include different size home and some multi family units that put the average number of doors at about 19 we assumed 21 doors in the past for midsize home so this data would show about a two door shift down from a comparable sized home but it s important to note the variability even for a midsized house where the number of doors can range anywhere from the 13 to 27 again if you look at the scatterplot we prepared with you ll see that there s a clear correlation to the number of interior doors and square footage of home and the related trend line as we slide to the left on the trend line away from the average home size and it s smaller entry level homes we lose one door for roughly every 180 square feet so as builders continue to focus on and build entry level homes that would present a buying headwind for us so all these market trends may present a slight headwind we do believe though we can help mitigate this through continuing to shift our mix toward higher aup and differentiated products now on slide 8 let s take a closer look at operations and our progress with the announced restructuring plans as mentioned earlier the mvantage operating system is the foundation to drive continuous improvement at masonite the three key pillars of the mvantage operating system are training and standards which provide a toolset for our improvement programs pit crews or performance improvement teams deployed through the company to drive rapid improvement projects and finally plant transformations which are 13 week long focused improvement events with multiple teams across a single site addressing entire value streams if you recall last year we completed plant transformations at seven sites and this year we have two nearing completion one at our architectural door plant marshfield wisconsin and one at our residential door plant in monterrey mexico the moderate transformation is in the final stages and we re already seeing the benefits from this team s work with an 18 improvement in productivity and 24 improvement of weekly output we re consistently averaging greater than 50 000 doors per week at that facility up from a little over 31 000 in 2017 we ve discussed this increased capacity in our previous calls and how it has helped drive footprint optimization by reducing the overall cost of manufacturing in north america i already mentioned we re on track for a record year of lean certification and we held a record number of kaizen events in the first quarter of 2019 this is a 14 increase in kaizen events over the same period last year shifting to the middle of the slide in footprint optimization the verdi nevada cut stock plant is progressing as planned all of the key staff positions are filled and the hiring production positions is on schedule the production equipment is in and we began running parts for quality test in the week for april 1 as you may be aware the existing cut back cut stock facility in stockton california experienced a significant fire early last week the fire started at a non masonite property next door and then spread to our facility fortunately none of our employees were injured but the operations were severely impacted and after assessing the damage we ve decided not to restart that facility while the stockton cut stock operations were scheduled to close this year we d anticipated ramping down production later in the second quarter we re now pursuing an accelerated ramp up of the verdi plant and we ll also begin an incremental volume we ll bring in incremental volume from our other cut stock facility in chile as well as third party suppliers we continue to assess any financial impact of these sourcing changes and based on our current plan we believe we can mitigate the supply impact and fully service our customers as planned on our last earnings call we announced the closure of two north american facilities denmark south carolina and largo florida since then we ve announced the closure of our tampa manufacturing location as well this facility is part of a north american residential segment and its operations will be relocated to three existing facilities and prior productivity improvements and throughput and capacity expansion across our manufacturing network is enabling these consolidations during the first quarter we can continue to focus on reducing north american headcount related to sg a and overhead we ve mentioned that after a detailed review of staffing levels given the uncertain market environment we have developed plans to reduce these areas 5 in the first half of 2019 through a combination of attrition and focused restructuring as of the end of the first quarter we have largely achieved that target with sg a and overhead headcount reduced 4 from the year end 2018 moving to right column in portfolio optimization in february we announced that we had exited a noncore product line in the u k and that we plan to exit two other noncore businesses in march we completed the sale of our pds business in the u k this business has a limited product range and opportunities for integration with other parts of u k business were not what we had originally anticipated we plan to divest one additional noncore business from the u k during the second half of 2019 overall these divestitures will streamline our product portfolio without meaningful reductions to our core product offerings and allow us to reduce the number of manufacturing site and associated infrastructure costs the combine 2018 revenue from these three assets was 58 million while we re divesting noncore product lines and business we also continue to invest and launch new offerings in our core product portfolio like the livingston door mentioned earlier that strategic focus on new product introductions has pushed our north american residential vitality index above 11 as of the first quarter 2019 importantly these newly introduced products command a higher average unit price and margins and new products are just one aspect of our margin improvement we ve worked with customers in all the regions to streamline our product offering reduce complexity and rationalize low volume and margin skus ultimately driving higher aup for our customers as well as for masonite in mexico we realigned to put more focus on speciality products and in the process we ve increased aup and shed some business the capacity from that shed business similar to the capacity from the productivity improvements has been redirected to service higher aup and higher margin business i am particularly proud of the team s performance in q1 we re continuing to execute well on our strategic initiatives to enhance our margins as i just shared we re on schedule with our previously announced restructuring and plans for 10 reduction in the total number of manufacturing locations which we will now achieve by the end of 2019 as compared to the second half of 2020 as previously anticipated and so with i ll turn the call over to russ to provide more details on our first quarter financial performance russ russ tiejema executive vice president and chief financial officer all right thanks fred and good morning everyone on slide 10 we have a summary of our consolidated financial results for the quarter we had net sales of 530 million a 2 increase over the first quarter of 2018 as fred mentioned acquisitions and average unit price contributed approximately 5 and 4 respectively to this increase this was partially offset by a 5 decline in base volume due to softer end markets in north american residential and a 2 headwind from foreign currency gross profit and gross margin expansion were driven by the higher aup and net labor productivity partially offset by raw material inflation and the impact of lower production volumes as well as start up costs related to our new cut stock plant in verdi nevada gross profit was up over 6 in the first quarter with gross margin expanding 70 basis points versus the prior year to 21 1 sg a spending was 10 million higher in the first quarter largely driven by acquired businesses and noncash items noncash items increased by 5 million compared to the same period 2019 including higher depreciation and amortization and a 2 5 million charge related to the divestiture of etfs the noncore floor choice product line we exited in the u k in january the impact of sg a on adjusted ebitda was considerably less than on a gaap basis roughly 2 million primarily due to wage and benefit inflation and personal investments to support our architectural quick ship business and the integration of graham and maiman adjusted ebitda increased by almost 7 to 65 5 million while adjusted ebitda margin expanded 50 basis points to 12 4 referring to the adjusted ebitda bridge on the right hand side of the slide you can see the meaningful benefit that price and mix delivered in the quarter helping to overcome material cost increases and the impact of lower volumes on our manufacturing operations it s also worth noting the impact of fx on adjusted ebitda in the quarter which was higher than normal due to more significant transactional fx headwinds relating to weakening of the canadian dollar we also incurred meaningful translational fx in the u k due to the weakening of the british pound had it not been for these fx impacts adjusted ebitda would have been up double digits for the quarter commodity inflation was approximately 2 in the quarter less than anticipated and lower than our full year outlook of approximately 3 in part due to savings projects undertaken by our supply chain team the primary drivers of inflation for us continue to be steel as our contract towers reset higher in the prior quarter we re more in line with the overall higher market prices and chemicals which can fluctuate based on the price of oil chemical inflation moved lower in the first quarter as oil price declines in the second half of last year translated into reduce resin costs realized in our first quarter cost of sales given recent upward moves in oil this trend is likely to reverse in the next two quarters moving to factory cost we see the sizable impact that lower volumes had in the quarter approximately 3 million of the 4 million impact in factory cost relate to reduced overhead absorption on lower volumes we continue to manage cost carefully to address this lower demand environment as fred mentioned we continue to take overhead out of the organization we ve reduced indirect labor by an additional 3 during the first quarter as compared to the end of 2018 direct labor productivity continued to improve and was more than sufficient to offset the impact of wage and benefit inflation during the quarter distribution costs was relatively flat in the quarter as our logistics team continue to effectively offset higher carrier rates and fuel inflation and finally net income for the first quarter was approximately 4 million and diluted earnings per share was 0 15 diluted eps was down 0 58 per share from 0 73 per share in the first quarter of 2018 due to charges related to our previously announced restructuring actions and divestiture of noncore businesses excluding the impact of those pre tax charges of 22 million our adjusted diluted eps was 0 81 in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 0 73 in the comparable period of 2018 included in the 22 million our 4 million related to restructuring 11 million related to asset impairment 5 million for loss on the disposal of subsidiaries and 2 million for loss and disposable disposal of property plant and equipment related to divestitures now let s look at our reportable segments turning to slide 11 we ll start with north american residential net sales decreased by 2 in the first quarter but adjusted ebitda increased by 6 net sales declines were driven by a 9 decrease in base volumes due primarily to the soft end markets in our wholesale business along with the prior year retail line loss the beginning of the second quarter was the anniversary of this retail line loss so this is the last quarter we will see that impact in our year on year comparisons i d like to provide a little more color on how the wholesale business performed in the quarter if you recall we mentioned on our fourth quarter call that our north american residential wholesale business improved year on year for the month of january we subsequently saw the wholesale end market turned down slightly in february and continue to weaken in march a 1 decline from foreign exchange along with a 1 decline from sales of components added to the year on year declines in the first quarter sales declines were partially offset by a 6 improvements in average unit price driven primarily by pricing implemented in december and a 3 increase in volume from our bwi acquisition the integration of which is progressing as planned adjusted ebitda margins increased to 120 basis points in the quarter due to strong aup gains again primarily due to price additionally adjusted ebitda margin in this segment benefited from the labor productivity i noted earlier which fully covered labor inflation despite overhead reductions and an improved factory cost structure we experienced unfavorable absorption due to lower volumes however which partially offset the benefit of improved productivity turning to slide 12 in our europe segment net sales decreased by 3 compared to the first quarter of last year due to a 7 decline from foreign exchange driven by a weaker british pound we also incurred a 1 decline from acquisitions and divestitures reflecting the impact of the divestiture of the timber flooring product line along with a 1 decline from sales components partially offsetting these declines was a 5 increase in base volumes for the quarter given the uncertainty in the u k it s encouraging to see base volumes up year on year if you recall we saw positive starts from out of the u k the back half of last year and it appears this translated to positive demand for our products in the first quarter adjusted ebitda grew in the first quarter by 1 over the comparable period of 2018 adjusted ebitda margin of 11 9 was up year on year by 50 basis points despite higher material cost aided by strong results through dw3 from an operational standpoint the u k successfully completed the consolidation of their customer service and accounting functions in the quarter moving to slide 13 in the architectural segment net sales increased by 28 in the first quarter primarily driven by 21 growth from our graham and maiman acquisition as well as increases in base volume and average unit price up 2 and 5 respectively aup gains were the result of like for like price partially offset by mix while we re pleased with the sales growth in architectural adjusted ebitda margins were heavily impacted by severe weather as fred mentioned the architectural segment was disproportionately hit by the severe weather in the midwest approximately 80 of the total production ships lost across masonite in the first quarter were architectural facilities this coupled with the expected impact of acquisition integration costs for graham and maiman resulted in considerable pressure on margins aside from the weather impact architectural operations are performing well given this quarter s net sales growth along with positive order trends year on year we remain optimistic for 2019 before i hand it back to fred let me review our liquidity profile on slide 15 you can see our total available liquidity including unrestricted cash and accounts receivable purchase agreement and our undrawn abl facility was 254 million or approximately 12 of our trailing 12 month net sales as of march 31 2019 at the end of the first quarter total debt and net debt to trailing 12 month adjusted ebitda were 2 9 times and 2 6 times respectively cash flow from operations was 19 million in the quarter while lower than an exceptionally strong first quarter of 2018 we solidly performed in what is typically a minimal cash flow quarter given the seasonal working capital profile of our business capital expenditures were 20 million in the quarter in line with our expected pace and outlook of 75 million to 80 million for 2019 as fred mentioned the organization is executing well on our key strategic initiatives and this includes the deployment of capital for its strategic projects lastly we continue to execute our share repurchase program in the first quarter purchasing approximately 646 000 shares at an average price of 51 37 per share totaling approximately 33 million in the quarter and with that i ll now turn the call back to fred to summarize today s discussion fred lynch president and chief executive officer great thank you russ so to summarize we delivered higher net sales increased adjusted ebitda and expanded adjusted ebitda margins in the first quarter growth from acquisitions and higher aup primarily due to price more than offset sales declines in north american residential base volume and higher than expected negative foreign exchange while lower volumes and higher material inflation put pressure on adjusted ebitda margins higher aup and our productivity improvements more than offset these impacts we felt some additional pressure on margins from weather but that was fortunately isolated to our architectural segment given our performance in the first quarter we believe we are still positioned for full year adjusted ebitda margin expansion we continue to drive the mvantage operating system across the organization we re off to a strong start having already achieved a record number of kaizen events in the first quarter and are on pace for a record number of lean certifications in 2019 our restructuring is progressing well given our progress to date we now expect to achieve a 10 reduction in the total number of manufacturing locations by the end of 2019 as compared to the second half of 2020 as previously expected as this will be my last quarterly call as ceo i want to thank the investors and analysts on the phone for their support through the years five and a half years ago we took masonite public with the trailing 12 month adjusted ebitda just a tad over 100 million and thanks to the hard work and dedication of our roughly 10 000 employees have grown that to over 270 million at the end of the first quarter while the company is in a solid financial position on all counts there is still more juice to be had and i am confident that howard and the masonite leadership team will continue to build on that positive momentum of q1 and drive toward result outlined in our long term strategic growth framework the best part of this job by far has been the opportunity to serve the 10 000 employees who have a heart and soul of our company our employees have built an incredible culture that emanates from our purpose we help people walk through walls we do this both physically by offering great products and metaphorically through our culture engaging each other and providing our teams with the tools training development and confidence to cross new thresholds and by encouraging people in our communities to be part of our team that s why people come to work at masonite and why they choose to stay and make a career here and i will miss that part terribly but as i always say all good things must come to an end and after 12 years as ceo my time is up howard will have a strong foundation to build upon and a great and talented leadership team ready to support him in serving the 10 000 employees and helping them continue to walk through the walls i very much look forward to reading the next chapter in masonite s history as it nears its 100th birthday in 2025 under the leadership of howard heckes and with that we d like to open the call to questions operator questions answers operator our first question comes from the line of michael rehaut of j p morgan please proceed with your question elad hillman j p morgan analyst it s elad on for mike i wanted to just get a little bit more color on the trend in north america residential wholesale business you mentioned that you re up in january down in february and down more in march just wondering kind of what happened in march and february and what you re seeing in april and then more specifically on customer inventory levels i think after their lack of pre lie in 4q things seem to return to normal in january and so just wondering what those are and if there s still maybe lowering inventory levels thanks russ tiejema executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah elad it s russ i ll kick off and then tony can jump in and add some additional color particularly as it relates to general dynamics and inventory i would describe q1 generally as moderating as we went through the quarter growth in january sliding to just slight softening in february and then down a few percentage points in march those comments are specific to the wholesale business in north america so definitely some moderation over the course of the quarter as we look at april right now if you step back and look at total revenue picture for the company when you strip out fx i would describe performance as flattish so tony you want to add some more color on north america tony hair president of global residential yeah i think certainly we felt the softening of the end markets as we went through we ve seen tough weather in some of the big markets that we do business with from california down through the south and even in the midwest and in april we felt some of that softness still in the marketplace to russ point our customers however are pretty bullish that they believe that building is coming back and that as the weather sides they re going to see a move back in a positive direction and remember we re late in the build cycle in terms of our product category so some of our customers have started to see a rough number of things picking up and we expect to get back in a more positive nature but we are cautious about what that s going to look like as we go forward which is what has driven the restructuring in the plans that we put in place so relative the customer inventory feels really good we know we have some customers who are starting to elevate their inventories in anticipation of some of the return in the market and we re working with them on that but we feel like customer inventories are absolutely in the right spot right now elad hillman j p morgan analyst thank you and also just one more on the mix and the wholesale business and i appreciate the review you gave with shift to entry level homes and the number of doors per home i was also interested in terms of mix and driving the higher aup products and any early feedback from the builders or other consumers specifically from the entry level consumers and how maybe the livingston indoor or some of the other new products that you guys are coming out with how these characteristics could appeal to entry level buyers in particular tony hair president of global residential yeah i think elad that s a great question and i think our new product vitality index demonstrates that even with a move toward more entry level we are seeing both consumers demand for more contemporary styles and more current products and builder s response to that so even if there are fewer doors and we do see the demand for those more on trend styles being represented and that s why we ve seen the heritage product line do so well and why the reception around livingston has been very positive so we think we ll continue to see that positive mix elad hillman j p morgan analyst great thanks guys fred lynch president and chief executive officer thank you russ tiejema executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator our next question comes from the line of tim wojs of robert w baird company please proceed with your question tim wojs robert w baird and company analyst thanks good morning everybody and nice job on the ebitda improvement here and fred i want to wish you well on your retirement here with this being your last call as ceo fred lynch president and chief executive officer thanks tim tim wojs robert w baird and company analyst i guess my first question just on price cost for the year i think both price is a little better than we thought and it sounds like inflation was maybe a little bit better than you thought so i guess if we look through the balances of 2019 any update to kind of what you re expecting from a pricing and a cost inflation type numbers through 19 now russ tiejema executive vice president and chief financial officer hey tim it s russ let me start perhaps talking about the cost of the equation and then i ll circle that back to price cost to overall we did see a little bit less inflation in the quarter than we would have anticipated as i commented earlier about 2 whereas our viewpoint on the year is 3 roughly equivalent across the quarters some of that was due to the impact of a lower resident inflation as i commented in the prepared remarks and there could be some likelihood that that reverses against us as we get into the next couple quarters just given the delay that we see between higher oil prices and how that translates into our chemicals costs which is a significant part of our materials cost to sales basket so overall nothing that suggest at this point that we would move meaningfully off of that viewpoint of 3 costs for the year relative to price cost clearly we had a favorable relationship in the first quarter as you ve heard us say in the past our strategy is always to maintain a neutral to favorable price cost relationship we re pleased with the ability of the business to put the price increasing through that we had announced after the end of the year and you re now seeing that margin improvement as a result of this two dynamics tim wojs robert w baird and company analyst ok ok and then maybe going back to the wholesale discussion a little bit just i think the volumes have run the volume you re talking about a run maybe just a little counter to what we ve heard from some other company so do you feel like your customers may have kept a little more inventory in the channel just to see how the new construction markets developed and then is there a little slower development and so they kind of destock toward the end of the quarter just any more color on just kind of how you would think through the pace for the year because it does run a little counter or the pace of the quarter it did run a little counter relative to what other people have talked about tony hair president of global residential yeah tim this is tony i think certainly as you look across the markets where we had weather impact there were certainly customer organizations that did not meet their own expectations in terms of going out the door so they were they had a little higher inventory i would say that they ve managed that very effectively and so in working with them as we see the market come back we think we ll be in a good spot so i don t think there was anything remarkable about that but certainly a little disappointed in what we saw in the demand and the end market shift throughout the quarter tim wojs robert w baird and company analyst ok and then maybe just the last one from me so the restructuring in terms of the plant take out sounds ahead of schedule any change to how we should think about realizing some of the associated restructuring benefits in kind of that cadence between 2019 and 2020 russ tiejema executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah tim it s russ really no impact in 2019 associated with that we have previously thought that we really wouldn t hit full run rate for those savings until we get closer to the end of 2020 we may see some acceleration of that but no impact on 2019 tim wojs robert w baird and company analyst ok great good luck on the rest of year thanks for the time fred lynch president and chief executive officer thank you russ tiejema executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks tim operator our next question comes from the line of mike eisen of rbc capital markets please proceed with your question mike eisen rbc capital markets analyst thanks guys for taking the questions and fred congratulations on last call and a good tenure i just wanted to see if we can get a little more color on the price volume dynamics in north america specifically how in the quarter this compared to both the marketing and your expectations and then how we should think about the strategy of price and volume as we move forward fred lynch president and chief executive officer yeah so i ll kick that off so this is fred i think that when we look across the business right now we think from a volume perspective we kept up with the market i think it was right in line with what our customers were seeing again i think as both tony and graham can explain what we saw a lot in the different geographies of the country it was really based on some of these weather conditions where i thought that i think the lumpiness even we saw in the quarter was related to whether or not customers can actually take product in so we re looking at it right now from price volume perspective that the plan as we go through the rest of the year is exactly as we anticipated with regards to how the market will continue to the progress mike eisen rbc capital markets analyst got it that s helpful and then thinking about the productivity improvement and some of the initial successes you guys have talked to through kaizen events and then some of these more transformational reviews how should we think about the headwind that we saw from factory and productivity in the first quarter and should we expect that to inflect to tailwind moving forward from these initiatives fred lynch president and chief executive officer yeah i think the answer is yes i mean the factory productivity the factory cost in the first quarter were largely due to lower volumes so if this is really the utilization of our assets we actually were able to offset any a lot of the wage inflation through our productivity programs so i would say that right now we feel like the operations team and the operating programs on that slide that we showed earlier with regards to how we re driving our mvantage program the driving of our footprint optimization and even the overall portfolio optimization as we shed some of the lower margin businesses we ll continue to show demonstrate positive performance on the cost side mike eisen rbc capital markets analyst very helpful and then one more if i can sneak it in it seems like a lot of that is coming through on the architectural segment and the margins have been pressured over the last couple of quarters granted some of it from the lower volumes should we think of it as those weather headwinds a bait that that segment will go back to margin expansion as we move into the second quarter and the back half of the year fred lynch president and chief executive officer that s big yes i m looking at graham too and he s shaking his head graham thayer senior vice president business leader of architectural nodding affirmatively fred lynch president and chief executive officer quite frankly the team did a i think a very good job and given the weather impact on that plant how many plant ships we lost we actually were pleased with the performance while it does didn t demonstrate growth year on year underlying performance was very solid mike eisen rbc capital markets analyst got it thanks for taking the questions fred lynch president and chief executive officer thank you russ tiejema executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator our next question comes from the line of michael wood of nomura instinet please proceed with your question mason marion nomura instinet analyst this is mason marion on for mike you had a relatively easy comp in the u k but we still get to see volume growth there can you talk about the sustainability of this volume growth and then if any high level commentary on the housing market in the u k and whether or not you guys are stealing share russ tiejema executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah good morning mason it s russ i think generally speaking when you step back a look at the u k it s been just a very lumpy market in light of everything that s occurred with brexit we see a lot of volatility even in the statistics we see reported on a quarter to quarter basis with respect to starts and completions so there s nothing that suggests that lumpiness is going to correct itself between now and call it late in the year when hopefully we finally have visibility on what a brexit mechanism looks like for that market i think the biggest point of volatility that we re seeing there is fx and remember we had significant fx declines in the europe segment specifically in u k in the first quarter in fact the pound sterling was down circa 6 5 versus the u s dollar so absent that you would have seen even stronger growth in revenues in the u k general market trends there seem to be recovering our base volume seems to be doing fine in that business again once you strip out fx so we re not feeling bad about that market at all but we are prepared for uncertainty in the balance of the year mason marion nomura instinet analyst great thank you russ tiejema executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator our next question comes from line of kevin hocevar of northcoast research please proceed with your question kevin hocevar northcoast research analyst hey good morning everybody and fred congrats again on the retirement on slide 7 you show how growth queuing toward entry level homes is hurting your volumes in north american residential i m wondering it s helpful to see all that but wondering if you can help quantify how big of a headwind is this you talked about 18 19 or so entry interior doors per kind of floor plan at this point used to be 21 so i mean when you think about how that impacts the industry and your business is it a 1 2 3 how big of a headwind do you see that to volumes on an annual basis fred lynch president and chief executive officer yeah i ll start that one off and i think one of the challenges we have much better and much more discrete data today about exactly what we re seeing in each of these homes as you can see from this scatterplot when we talked to the 21 doors back in the day that was a much more anecdotal i think number based on feedback that we got from our customers we didn t have this level of research and data associated with it as i look as we look at this chart there s really a few things that stand out i think as we mentioned it s about a door for 180 square feet if you just follow the slope of that lifeline and so i d say that as we ll continue to watch the average home size and how that moves right now it s just over 2 500 square feet we don t see that dropping down below rapidly below 2 300 square feet over the next years so but that could have an impact of one door and one doors is roughly 5 the other part of the equation here i think is the variability well this you can see a significant variability from top to bottom in this chart so we know we re going to continue to focus in on that and add to this data set pick up more of a view on multi family homes so that we can then help better understand what that impact will be to us in the long term and more importantly how do we influence that impact as we shared internally there s a lot of little green dots it s well below that line that we like to go back and figure out how we work those homeowners and start to change and those homebuilders i should say and start to change their perspective on why we re using so few doors in those homes kevin hocevar northcoast research analyst gotcha ok and then can you talk to canada specifically i mean obviously starts there have been pretty weak so what are you seeing from a volume perspective in that market and given the weakness seen there how was the competition in that market are you seeing any pricing pressure in total north america residential average unit price looked really really good but just kind of curious if you can give some color on what you re seeing in canada tony hair president of global residential yeah this is tony i think we talked about the third quarter in a row when we saw starts on both ends single family multi family being down that has undoubtedly has significantly impact on overall demand in canada i think from position standpoint we feel good about the partners that we have the product that we brought to bear and they are primed and ready to be able to support building as it plays out there so there hasn t been any undue price pressure or a change as a result of that we monitor that with our partners throughout the business and we haven t seen anything extraordinary there in terms of price differentiation fred lynch president and chief executive officer yeah i would say that in some way the it really does act as a combined north american market and so while you might have regional differences we in some way and at least on a residential side canada s more like a region of north america kevin hocevar northcoast research analyst gotcha ok very helpful thank you very much fred lynch president and chief executive officer thanks kevin operator our next question comes from the line of john baugh of stifel please proceed with your question john baugh stifel financial corp analyst good morning and fred wish you all the best in retirement my question is around aup and i think russ mentioned that it was somewhat more skewed to price than mix but could you help us as we model out the remaining nine months of this year with that sort of price expectation impact aup versus the mix thank you russ tiejema executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah john it s russ well as you know we re very circumspect about talking perspective without price but let me give you a little bit of color about the price and mix dynamics the one thing i d remind you of is recall from an aup perspective the loss of retail business the line review from the second quarter of last year has actually served as a headwind to our aup in the north american residential business and that s been roughly a point worth of headwind the last couple of quarters simply because that business was largely of pre hung doors as opposed to door slabs being sold into the wholesale channel so as our mix of pre hung products has reduced given that loss of a retail business that has had been a headwind we now will lap that in the second quarter and what you ll see going forward would be more representative of balance in price and mix john baugh stifel financial corp analyst ok and the pricing that you perceived both through calendar 18 and the warm the increase at the end of the year has that been balanced across distribution channel i e builders homes centers etc russ tiejema executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so we took pricing across all channels and all product lines john baugh stifel financial corp analyst thank you very much russ tiejema executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks john operator our next question comes from the line of reuben garner of seaport global securities please proceed with your question reuben garner seaport global securities analyst thanks good morning everyone so sg a in the quarter was a little bit higher than we modeled was there anything one time that went on i know you called i think in the presentation some integration expense can you just talk about maybe the cadence for sg a for the rest of the year that s kind of embedded in your outlook russ tiejema executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah sure reuben it s russ as i commented during the prepared remarks if you just look at the pace in the p l there s about a 10 million increase in sg a but all but 2 million of that would have been related to either new businesses that we d acquired and the sg a that came with them or some of the noncash items like higher d a and we did have some charges in there related to disposal of sale of assets associated to restructuring from an ebitda perspective it was only about a 2 million increase and that was reflective of both wage and benefit inflation and some additional investment that we made in resources in the architectural business so specifically the quick ship business and architectural continues to demonstrate strong growth and good margin performance so we re investing in certain areas there and then there are some costs associated with for example services agreement as we wind off the integration of graham and maiman so from a standpoint of how that rolls out through the year some of that cost is going to naturally be embedded in the business as we go forward just because of wage and benefit inflation in some of those investments that we ve made reuben garner seaport global securities analyst ok got it so if you had to quantify maybe what was kind of one time in nature or just specific to q1 is there a dollar amount that you could call out that maybe wouldn t recur going forward or is that not the right way to think about it russ tiejema executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah there was about 2 5 million worth of one time charges just related to disposals our d a was up about 3 million that s probably going to be more of an on going basis just from projects that we ve rolled in and then we also had 4 million of restructuring charges that were dialed out of our adjusted ebitda those would be one time in nature although we ll continue to have some restructuring costs each quarter as we complete the closure of plants again you won t see those in our adjusted figures as we go forward reuben garner seaport global securities analyst ok and then that s very helpful and one clarification for me follow up on the last question the so your comment that aup has seen about a point drag over the last four quarters so in other words you would ve seen about a seven point increase in q1 what i mean i know you don t like to talk about going forward a number but what other items are there to think about pluses and minuses that would impact that level for the remainder of 2019 fred lynch president and chief executive officer yeah just to be clear that was 1 not it s not additive it s cumulative russ tiejema executive vice president and chief financial officer well the point is that with respect to aup we ve had the last several quarters about one point worth of drag in the north american business as a result of lower pre hung business in the retail channel you step back and look at the different pieces of aup price and mix within mix you re going to have a dynamic of channel mix pre hung versus slab and you also have the impact of product mix and so i would just think about it in terms of as we roll out continued new product introductions tony and fred talked about the livingston in particular and the great reception that that s had that should be a tailwind for average unit price in addition to pure price actions reuben garner seaport global securities analyst all right thank you guys operator our next question comes from the line of steven ramsey of thompson research group please proceed with your question brian biros thompson research group analyst hey good morning this is actually brian biros on for steven thank you for taking my questions i think most of them have been answered but i guess you just touched on the north american volumes i know you gave some good insight into the volume decline there across the various factors but is that something you could quantify into like what percentage was weather related what was housing starts channel withdrawals and anything else tony hair president of global residential yeah brian i don t know if we can get that specific or would be able to quantify that really well we know that all of those things had an impact and again we believe that with the optimism in the market that we ll see that some of those subside and be able to play out more favorably going forward brian biros thompson research group analyst ok any guess on whether if that was even ballpark 25 50 or just stop if you want anything you can get to tony hair president of global residential i m not going to guess about that or future weather events so brian biros thompson research group analyst understood and i guess just one last one on the architectural side with the some of the recent acquisitions you guys have had any changes to the strategy or thoughts on those going forward given how q1 shaped up and what the rest of the year looks like graham thayer senior vice president business leader of architectural no i think we re going on as planned it s graham by the way we re continuing to integrate the business and really take advantage of the network we have right now and we re working through some of the purchasing synergies that were part of acquisition so i think we still pretty much going on with the plan that we had put together and we re very happy with the acquisitions and things are moving very smoothly in that direction brian biros thompson research group analyst sounds good thanks fred lynch president and chief executive officer thank you russ tiejema executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator there are no further questions at this point in the conference i would like to turn the conference back over to president and ceo mr fred lynch fred lynch president and chief executive officer ok well thanks everyone for participating in the call today and for your interest in

a new report by the united nations population fund has reiterated the obvious life has become so short in nigeria in its 2019 state of the world report the united nations agency says nigeria s life expectancy is 55 years this ranks the country at number 178 globally it is thus marginally better than only sierra leone 53 years chad and central africa republic both 54 years in the index this ranking is just too low but it re establishes the extremely dire reality that nigeria is a failing state in many respects with a retarded mono product economy decrepit social infrastructure and scary security breaches all the indices are stacked against decent living in nigeria those 65 years and above about 6 million people in all are just three per cent of the population which is dominated by those aged between 15 and 64 54 per cent even war torn afghanistan is doing far better having a life expectancy of 65 years in africa ghana out performs nigeria with 62 74 years life expectancy south africa 62 77 years and ethiopia 65 48 years although it is officially out of recession the national economy is disarticulated unable to compete with its peers the world bank predicts the nigerian economy will grow at a measly 2 1 per cent in 2019 for a population estimated by unfpa at 201 million the misery is palpable with its 91 million wretchedly poor nigeria has overtaken india as the extreme poverty capital of the world the african development bank said regrettably in the misery index 2018 nigeria ranked sixth worst out of 95 countries with a score of 43 0 the index compiled by the johns hopkins university in the united states bases its computation mainly on the unemployment rate inflation and lending rates minus the percentage in real gross domestic product per capita of course nigeria fares woefully in all these areas conversely thailand hungary japan china and switzerland scored top marks in the aforementioned areas undoubtedly the unemployment rate is wretched the national bureau of statistics puts the jobless rate at 23 1 per cent underemployment at 20 21 per cent and youth unemployment at a daunting 55 4 per cent in addition inflation stands at 11 25 per cent which constricts businesses from expanding and creating sorely needed jobs at just about 5 000 megawatts electricity a fundamental requirement for economic growth is inadequate and unreliable prevailing double digit interest rate pushes businesses into the red eventually many fold up not surprisingly there is a yawning infrastructure deficit in every area of national life in december the securities and exchange commission stated that the deficit would hit 878 billion by the year 2040 by that time nigeria s population is projected to be about 327 million or the fourth most populated country in the world for now the country with a gdp of 375 8 billion according to the world bank has the highest number of out of school children in the world at 13 2 million the quality of life is very low only 29 per cent of the population has access to sanitation 31 5 per cent lacks access to potable water says the unfpa the prognosis is gloomy apart from the boko haram islamist insurgency that has claimed about 100 000 lives and displaced two million others in the north east deaths are being recorded daily in fulani herdsmen attacks banditry in the north west kidnapping and armed robbery the acting inspector general of police mohammed adamu said 1 071 nigerians were slaughtered in the first quarter of 2019 zamfara and kaduna states suffered the most the health sector in the country is atrocious poorly funded and under equipped nigerians are dying from a plethora of ailments the country is just one of the three in the world where polio is still endemic its annual 40 000 maternal deaths account for roughly 14 per cent of the global total says the kenya based african population and health research centre one nigerian woman dies every 13 minutes that is 109 women dying each day from preventable causes related to pregnancy and child birth the aphrc lamented in this chaos every nigerian is a potential victim it is not surprising that many are rushing out of the country years of misrule by self centred political elite have come home to roost therefore what is most needed now is a clear head nigerians must stand up and demand good governance they should challenge public officials who live a life of luxury at their expense first governance in nigeria is just too top heavy servicing a few office holders out of the 2018 budget of n9 1 trillion the federal government allocated n3 51 trillion to recurrent non debt spending as against n2 87 trillion for capital renewal this does not make sense in contrast us president donald trump is working on a bipartisan deal that will channel 2 trillion to renew the country s broken infrastructure common sense dictates that governments in nigeria must prioritise capital spending to improve living conditions two the subsisting quasi federal political structure is the antithesis of development the 36 federating units are glorified cost centres they do not deliver development simply because there is no serious production going on at the state level monthly they head for abuja to share the dwindling income from oil many of them could not even pay workers salaries in addition there are 774 local government areas which are mainly parasites elsewhere every layer of government is primed for production without a review of this encumbrance life expectancy is unlikely to improve nigerians led by professionals and the middle class should therefore campaign for the enthronement of decentralisation in this the federating units will become economic centres the transparent privatisation of economic assets like the refineries the ajaokuta steel company the power assets and the liberalisation of the rail aviation and mining sectors will instigate tremendous growth and transform into safe security architecture nigeria s systemic corruption which increases costs and reduces access to services especially health education and justice should be fought to a standstill copyright punch all

results selected business highlights and his thoughts concerning the outlook of the remainder of 2019 and beyond i would now like to turn our conference over to bruce bruce wacha chief financial officer good afternoon thank you for joining us today for our first quarter 2019 earnings call during the quarter we generated 412 7 million in net sales 75 8 million in adjusted ebitda and 0 44 per share in adjusted diluted earnings per share adjusted ebitda as a percentage of net sales was 18 4 for the quarter advertisement advertisement the 19 million decrease in net sales was primarily attributable to our divestiture of pirate brands during the third quarter of 2018 pirate brands had generated net sales of 21 million in the first quarter of 2018 the negative impact on net sales from the pirate brands divestiture was partially offset by an incremental 3 3 million of net sales from mccann s which was acquired during the third quarter of 2018 and therefore not part of our results during the first quarter of 2018 base business net sales which exclude the impact of m a and discontinued brands was 409 5 million essentially flat for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 409 3 million in the prior year quarter more from the motley fool our base business net sales benefited from 7 3 million in net pricing which included the impact of our spring 2018 list price increase as well as improved trade spend utilization we expect to start seeing additional pricing benefits from our 2019 price increase in the second quarter as well as the third and fourth quarters base business volumes were down by 7 1 million in the first quarter largely driven by a drag from the negative elasticity effects of our price increase our base business net sales also had a small negative impact from the shift of easter to late april and from a limited voluntary recall of certain victoria products advertisement advertisement green giant has been a wonderful net sales growth engine for the past couple of years for b g foods helping to drive growth in net sales quarter after quarter first quarter 2019 was no different with net sales of all green giant products in the aggregate including le sueur increasing by 6 9 million or 5 4 versus the year ago quarter the growth in net sales was driven by a second consecutive quarter of growth for both our frozen and our shelf stable green giant products the rest of our portfolio had a series of pluses and minuses with regards to net sales for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 for example net sales of new york style increased by 1 3 million or 16 4 maple grove farms increased by 0 0 9 million or 5 5 net sales of the company s spices and seasonings businesses increased by nearly 1 or 0 7 million for the quarter net sales of back to nature decreased by 3 3 million as we are cycling the lost distribution of certain noncore items victoria decreased by 1 4 million or 11 2 due in part to the recall cream of wheat decreased by 1 million or 5 5 as a result of warmer winter ortega decreased by 0 6 million or 1 6 and net sales of all other brands decreased by 3 3 million or 4 1 for the first quarter of 2019 we generated 75 8 million in adjusted ebitda for the quarter which is down 13 6 million from the year ago quarter and slightly short of our guidance range the primary driver for the decrease in adjusted ebitda was the divestiture of pirate brands which accounted for approximately 8 million of lost ebitda for the quarter inclusive of overhead under absorption we remained comfortable with our full year estimate of a negative adjusted ebitda impact of 21 million from the divestiture of pirate brands but the negative impact was approximately 1 million greater for the first quarter than we had anticipated we also estimate that the victoria recall negatively impacted adjusted ebitda by approximately 1 million for the quarter another factor affecting comparability includes the first quarter of 2018 benefit of approximately 2 million from a mexican peso currency gain we saw net cost increase in our cogs during the first quarter of approximately 7 million inclusive of procurement mix freight and warehousing a portion of which is due to the timing of when certain costs and cost savings flow through our p l we expect to see these benefits to begin to show in our second quarter results and the remainder of the year advertisement advertisement our pricing strategy inclusive of the wraparound benefit of the spring 2018 price increase and improved trade spend utilization benefited adjusted ebitda by 7 3 million which helped to offset the cogs increases this benefit was partially offset by a decrease in base business volumes of 7 1 million resulting in lost profits of approximately 2 7 million largely driven by price elasticity while we continue to see inflationary pressures in our input costs and our freight expense the increases have been more manageable this year and we are actively addressing them after a strong first quarter of pricing with nearly 7 5 million of benefit we expect to continue to see pricing benefits throughout the year earlier this year we communicated another round of price increases to our customers and we should begin to see the benefit of those price increases during the second quarter we therefore remained confident in our ability to achieve our full year target of 15 million to 20 million in pricing consistent with our previous guidance our cost savings initiatives which ken will address in more detail in a few minutes are also on track and we expect to see these benefits accelerate throughout the year as they begin to impact our p l on freight for example as a result of the realignment of our dry and frozen distribution centers we are already seeing favorable costs in our p l from our customary delivery costs versus the prior year some of the freight benefit however was muted and our inbound freight and our transfer costs which are also coming down year over year due to our efficiency efforts impact our p l on a roughly one quarter lag and so we will realize these benefits beginning in the second and third quarters of the year our g a rationalization has also been implemented however due to the timing of the restructuring we only saw the benefits for little less than one month of the quarter as a result of these efforts we are also confident that our cost cutting will deliver a full year 15 million to 20 million in cost savings benefits we generated 0 44 in adjusted diluted earnings per share in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 0 55 per share in the first quarter of 2018 with the decline largely driven by lower adjusted ebitda in the quarter as we just discussed offset in part by a reductions in net interest expense of approximately 5 2 million for the quarter due to reducing our long term debt by approximately 460 million over the past year under our prior stock purchase authorization we repurchased and retired from march 15 2018 through march 15 2019 approximately 1 4 million shares of common stock at an average price per share excluding fees and commissions of 26 41 or 36 9 million in the aggregate this includes 407 000 shares of common stock at an average price per share excluding fees and commissions of 24 55 or 10 million in the aggregate during the first quarter of 2019 advertisement advertisement in march 2019 our board of directors authorized an extension of the stock repurchase program through march 15 2020 in extending the repurchase program the board also reset the repurchase authority up to 50 million our balance sheet remains strong with just 1 6 billion in net debt at the end of the first quarter 2019 compared to 2 billion in net debt at the end of the first quarter 2018 we also continue to manage our inventory more effectively we further reduced our inventory to 375 4 million at the end of the first quarter 2019 compared to 401 4 million at the end of the fourth quarter 2018 and 455 4 million at the end of the first quarter 2018 we generated more than 50 million in net cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of 2019 and we spent a little bit more than 8 5 million in capital expenditures during the quarter more than ample to support our current business and to better position us to pursue our growth through acquisition strategy based on the midpoint of our 2019 financial guidance that i will outline in a moment we expect to be approximately 5 2 times net debt to pro forma adjusted ebitda at the end of the year now as we mentioned a little a while ago in our earnings release we are reaffirming our full year 2019 guidance as a reminder our 2018 results included a little bit more than three quarters of pirate brands net sales of 74 9 million for 2019 we expect net sales to be in the range of 1 635 billion to 1 665 billion or in line with our 0 to 2 long term top line growth model we expect adjusted ebitda of 305 million to 320 million adjusted earnings per share of 1 85 to 2 net interest expense of 87 5 million to 91 5 million including cash interest expense of 84 million to 88 million and interest amortization expense of 3 5 million depreciation expense of approximately 40 million amortization expense of approximately 18 million an effective tax rate of approximately 24 to 25 5 cash taxes excluding the tax effects from the gain on sale of pirate brands to be approximately 5 million or less for the year and finally we anticipate capex to be approximately 45 million to 50 million for 2019 which is in line with last year based on the midpoint of our adjusted ebitda guidance range we expect that our adjusted ebitda less capex cash taxes including tax effects from the gain of the sale of pirates and cash interest will be approximately 175 million to 180 million the pirate brands divestiture resulted in a pre tax gain on sale of 176 4 million during the fourth quarter of 2018 a large majority of the tax payments resulting from that gain on sale will be made during the second quarter 2019 finally from a quarterly modeling perspective i remind folks that the second and third quarters of this year will have a similar drag from the divestiture of pirate brands of about 6 to 7 million of adjusted ebitda per quarter and a limited impact during the fourth quarter given that we only have owned the business for about a month during that period we expect input costs to remain elevated as inflation certainly appears to be here to stay advertisement advertisement but we also expect to see more benefits from our pricing initiatives throughout the remainder of the year with a small benefit in the back half of the second quarter and a more full benefit in the third and the fourth quarter these benefits will be coupled with continued activity on the cost cutting front and now i d turn the call over to ken ken ken romanzi president and chief executive officer thank you bruce and thanks to all of you for joining us on the call today with special thanks to the dedicated team of b g foods who are working so hard in a challenging operating environment to generate these results i m pleased that our first quarter net sales were on the and higher side of our expectations and while we had some discreet timing events negatively impacting our adjusted ebitda we re on a track to meet our full year financial plan and while historically we ve grown through acquisitions the optics of selling a business are sometimes less favorable on the p l however as we have previously stated the sale of pirate brands has left us much better positioned to continue to grow through acquisitions a strategy that has worked so well for our company and our shareholders over the years as i stated in our february call our 2019 plan is rooted in sales growth consistent with our stated long term objective of 0 to 2 growth a broader and more reliable pricing strategy and the ramp up of our multi year cost savings program our first quarter results showed traction in all three of these pillars of our 2019 plan so today i would like to share key highlights from the first quarter advertisement advertisement first and foremost our new executive leadership team is fully in place totally aligned and committed to our company s strategy and is working extremely well together it s a strong complementary combination of fresh blood and long term b g veterans also i m very pleased to report after more than two years of effort we successfully went live with our new oracle jd edwards enterprise resource planning system just last weekend and i m pleased to report that we are fulfilling customer orders and shipping through the system with minimal disruption we are very much looking forward to taking advantage of the many benefits of the system which is expected to streamline operations drive efficiencies to our finance and accounting processes and improve our operational planning and financial forecasting our first quarter base business net sales were basically flat to last year which was encouraging given easter shifted later into april this year consumption across the entire b g foods portfolio grew 1 for the quarter and that included a decline of 1 7 in march due to the easter timing shift january through february consumption grew a solid 2 7 versus year ago our sales performance as bruce mentioned was again led by our largest brand green giant it s a testament to our team s effort that we are reporting the second consecutive quarter of net sales growth for both frozen and shelf stable green giant shelf stable is now benefiting from new distribution growth after a challenging period in the category that coincided with our purchase of green giant green giant frozen continues its strong momentum behind our vision of a making green giant the plant based vegetable food brand of the future fueled by continued success of our new product introductions our vision is to not only introduce new vegetable products in the traditional frozen vegetable category but to help people get more vegetables in their diet by introducing new products made with vegetables we are very encouraged by the successful launch of the latest generation of innovation such as green giant cauliflower pizza crust green giant protein bowls and little green sprout s organics and we are very much looking forward to enhancing our next wave of green giant frozen innovation later this year as we continue to facilitate america s healthy eating habits now while not every brand in our portfolio is positioned for the same innovation led growth that we re driving with green giant we believe there are many exciting things that we can do to drive growth across the portfolio we re excited about our snacking businesses namely new york style bagel chips and back to nature advertisement advertisement new york style showed strong growth in the quarter with net sales up almost 16 5 driven by unique merchandising in the deli perimeter of the grocery store and while we re still rightsizing the product portfolio distribution of back to nature we re enthusiastic about its potential for geographic expansion consumption in back to nature s core product categories of better for you cookies crackers granola and nuts remains solid in both the specialty food channel and several mainstream supermarket retailers and now that our product line is cleaning up of noncore products our plan is to expand this brand to a greater array of customers we re also excited about the potential of victoria pasta sauce despite a soft q1 due to the product recall the brand has performed well over the past two years and we are enthusiastic about the prospects for victoria as we look to take this leader in premium specialty pasta sauce national to build upon its successful position in the northeast united states and throughout the club channel nationally our most recent acquisition mccann s is performing as expected and although it s on the smaller side for us it is exactly what we strive for when considering potential acquisitions mccann s margins are strong and it has proven additive to our cash flows and we believe this little brand has the potential to be a bigger part of our portfolio over time it holds a leadership position in the premium oatmeal category segment and we are excited about the potential to drive new distribution growth as we fill in the still sizable distribution gaps and work to take this on trend better for you brand national over time as bruce mentioned we realized nearly 7 5 million in improved pricing during the quarter driven by last year s actions and we successfully sold into our customers a new round of pricing that is beginning to be implemented during the second quarter as a reminder this pricing action is based on more list pricing rather than trade promotion efficiencies on more brands and in more geography than we took last year as a result we believe we re on track to deliver the 15 million to 20 million in pricing we planned for 2019 our cost savings initiatives also started to deliver benefits in q1 we implemented our g a restructuring program and the new leaner team is intently focused on delivering our 2019 plan advertisement advertisement additionally we continue the work we began in 2018 to realign our dry and frozen distribution networks these efforts are paying off today and helping us to better manage transportation costs in an inflationary environment during q1 as our new dry warehouse configuration was completely in place we reduced our total freight miles during the quarter by approximately 20 below last year s levels helping to offset higher transportation rates we also continued to shift more freight to contract versus higher spot rates and going forward we will begin to see the added benefits of reconfiguring our frozen distribution network which will take place throughout the second quarter further our procurement group has finished contract negotiations for the year and we secured better pricing than we originally forecasted for raw materials while input costs are still elevated versus last year our procurement team is doing a great job lessening the impact and lastly we re on track implementing the product and package weight reductions we discussed in february to secure our savings budget namely rightsizing several of our green giant frozen products all in we re on track to deliver our 2019 plan of 15 million to 20 million in cost savings throughout our procurement logistics manufacturing packaging and sg a spending which we expect will continue to deliver another 20 million to 25 million in savings in 2020 in summary we remained confident in our 2019 guidance that relies on 0 to 2 top line growth while maintaining flat adjusted ebitda margins of approximately 18 5 despite being in an inflationary input cost environment our guidance assumes successful implementation of our price increase as well as our cost productivity initiatives both of which are on track through the completion of the first quarter beyond that we remain committed and ready to add to our business through accretive acquisitions that is what built this great company and that strategy will continue to fuel our growth in the future in addition we will also look to opportunistically repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time as another means in addition to our quarterly dividend to return cash to our shareholders this concludes our remarks today and now we d like to begin the q a portion of our call operator questions answers operator and today our first question is coming from cornell burnette of citi research cornell burnette citi analyst my first question is really just centered around the full year guidance so you missed the first quarter by 2 million or 3 million in ebitda and from the bottom of your range and eps is also lower than the bottom of the range so i just want to know what kind of gives you why did you keep the full year guidance the same i know you talked about victoria having a recall but wouldn t there be some residual issues from that perhaps as you go forward in the year bruce wacha chief financial officer no we don t think so we think the impact should be modest but calling out with the impact was in the quarter was about 1 million that was not factored into our plan and then the other part when you think about just missing at the bottom of the range is the divestiture of pirate s so still think the impact is about 21 million in terms of the loss in ebitda for the full year but just from a timing standpoint about 8 million impacted us in the first quarter and so it was really those two issues where we get a lot of confidence is we truly are seeing as ken mentioned a lot of the cost savings initiatives that we re working on the ability and desire to lower those freight costs we re truly seeing them but we re are seeing some of the benefit in our p l this quarter and we ll continue to see the remainder throughout the rest of the year cornell burnette citi analyst and then i mean i guess this is important so looking that eps being down pretty substantially in the quarter i think to get to the bottom end of your range would imply something like 9 eps growth over remaining three quarters so i m thinking a lot has to change on the margin side i think maybe what you could do for us which would be helpful is if you could just some put numbers around a how many cost savings came through in the quarter and then going forward kind of what s the residual that s left over the remaining three quarters i would suspect that it has to be a pretty big number and that you didn t get much in this quarter kind of given the way margins played out bruce wacha chief financial officer yes when you really think about it from a timing standpoint we did benefit on the delivery portion of our freight costs but not the inbound freight because that will come through when we sell the products and as far as the g a restructuring that we took really only about a month of that benefited so that flows throughout the rest of the year additionally as we said we did get a nice benefit from pricing in the first quarter but a significant amount of that pricing activity will follow through in the remainder of the year as we re implementing another round of price increases cornell burnette citi analyst and that s another thing that was on my mind so it s about 7 million to 7 5 million of pricing that you got in the quarter yet i think the guidance hasn t changed for the full year at like pricing of 15 million to 20 million if that holds true then that would just say that you ve got 8 million to 13 million of pricing over the remaining three quarters which is kind of what you got in q1 despite the fact that you ve got more pricing coming in sometime in 2q and i think you re going to be the intention is to be a little bit more efficient on the trade spending so just wanted to know kind of how that lays out and if ultimately this is upside on the pricing numbers given the way 1q s played out ken romanzi president and chief executive officer yes as we stated in the february call we counted in our model the prices the list price increases but we didn t count in our model trade spend efficiencies because that s elusive they re elusive to get but we did see in the first quarter some trade efficiencies so as we stated in february if we can get our trade spend efficiencies on top of the price increase there may be a little upside but the first quarter when we are overlapping some very large spends on a couple of our brands last year so we saw that so it was nice to see but as we stated if we can continue to see the trade spend efficiencies and get the list price through the way we plan there could be upside to the pricing cornell burnette citi analyst and then the last question from me would just be if you could possibly just talk a little bit maybe about q2 this was very helpful the last time you gave us guidance on q1 just assuming that some of the pricing that you re seeing really doesn t come in till later in 2q is it going to be another how do the margins stack up in q2 was it going to be kind of a similar story as to q1 given that some of the pricing is later in the quarter bruce wacha chief financial officer probably ken romanzi president and chief executive officer and then also as you build your model i would make sure you keep in mind that there ll be some negative drag from pirate s which is baked into our full year guidance operator and our next question is coming from william reuter with bank of america unknown speaker this is mike on for bill just a few questions here first can you talk about if the pricing increases have affected your share of shelf and if retailers are shifting more toward private label products and second can you confirm your leverage target and if any and if you guys have made any changes to your capital allocation strategy ken romanzi president and chief executive officer ok i ll take the first question i think if heard you correctly it was little bit low you were asking if the price increase causes us to lose any share of shelf and anything any bigger shift to private label we haven t experienced any of that there s many retailers who are focused on private label our price increase hasn t shown an acceleration or deceleration of that at all so we quite frankly were pretty encouraged by the elasticities that we saw off of the brands last year and which gave us some confidence to come back again this year and we adjust since we hadn t taken pricing in quite some time we adjusted our pricing increase this year versus last year and took a little bit more on brands that proved to be fairly inelastic and took a little bit less on brands that were elastic so we think we re smarter through this pricing action than we were last year because it had been so long since we had taken pricing and had data to read in markets so this new round is fresh off of last year s experience bruce wacha chief financial officer and then the second half of your question no change from our standard leverage targets which is 4 5 to 5 times net debt to ebitda as far as changing capital allocation strategy no we remained committed to dividend we also are focused on returning cash to shareholders through our share buyback program which is as you noted we recently got reauthorization for and we have been active rebuying shares and then finally from an m a standpoint as ken said we built this company through m a and we continue to view that as an opportunity to create value for shareholders operator our next question comes from karru martin with jefferies karru martinson jefferies analyst how have your competitors reacted to the pricing that you took here through the first quarter and the follow up pricings ken romanzi president and chief executive officer we have so many different competitors right because of the different categories we re in we haven t seen any drastic reaction many people are increasing pricing in some cases we re seeing elevated pricing particularly in the canned vegetable business that s seeing some improved pricing but we haven t seen any outsized changes or oversized reactions to our price increases karru martinson jefferies analyst and the traction that you re getting in green giant on the canned side as well as the frozen it seems sort of reversal from what we had been seeing for quite some time has that market changed or is it just that we ve bottomed out or is there some sort of a new realism in there in terms of what the pricing will be and that it s not a race to the bottom ken romanzi president and chief executive officer well i think there s two things they re two separate businesses almost in the same brand but the frozen segment has been very different than the canned segment the frozen segment has truly been reawakened by b g s efforts to reawaken the green giant and that s all been driven by added value innovation so innovation is what s driving the frozen green giant business as well as many of the competitors now who have followed us with innovation in that area many of them have fairly close copies of our products so innovation is really driving the growth in the frozen vegetable category on the canned side our own experience that you might be referring to is we lost distribution in a major retailer so that was a big drag on our canned business for quite some time but in the fourth quarter of last year we overlapped that lost distribution and the business turned around because outside of that one retailer we were actually up in consumption and now on top of our consumption still being fairly good the positive on the shelf stable side we are also we ve gained some distribution in other retailers so the new distribution is what s helping our canned business plus being more competitive every day at the shelf in the distribution we re in so it s really a tale of two cities same brand name two different sections of the store and two different dynamics in those subsegments in the vegetable category karru martinson jefferies analyst and just lastly given that success that you ve had at green giant frozen i mean do you view that as a platform for acquisitions or where do you see adding businesses to further the growth of the company ken romanzi president and chief executive officer well acquisitions are we re always got we re always open to accretive acquisitions that we can buy with the disciplined purchasing approach that b g takes but on the frozen side and particularly with frozen vegetables in green giant we have an internal pipeline that we see for quite some time that we re very very excited about so the internal pipeline is a very robust to maintain green giant however if there are other kind of vegetable forward businesses out there that we think we can buy in a disciplined manner to add to our business and perhaps the green giant brand name on that package might be even be better applied we will absolutely look at that so frozen businesses in general we d look to places where there would be synergies but really it d have to be a vegetable business that we can make to capture manufacturing synergies if there s something that fits a vegetable forward approach we would certainly be interested in that to bring into the green giant family operator and our next question will come from bryan hunt with wells fargo securities bryan hunt wells fargo analyst continuing on the m a discussion the current leverage on the balance sheet exceeds kind of your stated range of 4 5 million to 5 5 million so if you were to make an acquisition how far above that range are you willing to take the balance sheet in terms of leverage and for how long bruce wacha chief financial officer i think it very much depends on the acquisition we haven t typically gone over six times leverage if you go back to history but like i said earlier on the call estimated net debt to ebitda based on the middle of our guidance is 305 million of ebitda and 320 million gets us to 5 2 times net debt to ebitda so in that range would we go higher we would consider it but we d have to really like the transaction to do so bryan hunt wells fargo analyst great next when you re looking at other challenges in the business in terms of the switch to click and collect and or amazon type of retail how are you positioned to in your opinion capture the click and collect and or the online retail or even some cpgs are going direct with their own brands to consumers do see an opportunity to capture one of those three opportunities and kind of where do you stand ken romanzi president and chief executive officer we are racing quickly to get e commerce ready the place we re really starting which is are the top two food retailers in walmart and kroger in particular i mean they re very large and we do a lot of business with them and others supermarket retailers so we re making sure that we re e commerce ready to do business because we believe that going through our retailers is going to be a much more effective and efficient way than for us to go on our by ourselves and as we get more e commerce ready for our retailers we do a lot of business on we believe we can then transfer that learning to amazon we do very little business through amazon now and a little bit in our supermarket customers but as their business grows through online we will absolutely be ready to grow with them operator and our next question is coming from ken zaslow with bank of montreal ken zaslow bmo capital markets analyst just a couple of clarity questions one is can you talk about the price elasticity where you ve seen the greatest price elasticity and where you ve seen the least amount of price elasticity across your portfolio ken romanzi president and chief executive officer well that could be a very long answer we have 50 brands there s lots of price elasticity in more price sensitive brands and it s not just brands it s product segments so for instance let s take ortega there s is lot of price elasticity in taco shells but not a lot of price elasticity in taco sauce so we might take a little bit more on taco sauce and a little bit less on taco shells and we ve got to make sure that we re still at good promotional price points on taco shells because that seems like a business where people kind of stock up on promotion ac cent for instance we haven t seen any price elasticity and we ve actually crossed over some key price points like 3 for a unit of our smaller size so that s a business that we re going to lean into because we haven t seen much i mean ac cent defines the category of flavor enhances and so that s a business where we ve seen very little less elasticity and a little bit more green giant cans canned vegetable highly elastic customers want to promote that at key holidays for two for 1 and if you re not there for two for 1 you re probably not going to get you re not going the front page ad support you re not going to get secondary displays so the customer actually decides your elasticity even before the consumer gets a chance to decide whether or not they want to pay 0 10 or 0 20 more a can it s really how our customers want to feature and we want to still maintain the key features with our customers for key holiday periods for non holiday periods we think we can be a little bit more forward on pricing because it s not like we re looking for front page ads and big displays and that we can have the base price float up on shelf which wouldn t affect volume all that much you re not talking about the highest volume time of the year anyway but you can raise price on shelf a little bit but come back and make sure you re very very competitive at the key promotional time frames so it is a full range and we ve adjusted our pricing both base shall pricing as well as promotional pricing accordingly depending on the brand and the product promotion group ken zaslow bmo capital markets analyst is there a way for you to think about getting more pricing in certain categories that you ve kind of realized like ac cent is would be one where you would able to do that and are there other categories that have more price elasticity that you would think that you may need do something with innovation to curtail the price elasticity ken romanzi president and chief executive officer and that s what we ve done i mean pricing is separate from innovation obviously we re going to innovate where it makes sense we have a list of brands that we ve prioritized for innovation mainly because of size of brand if you line extend a small brand you re going to have a small business if you line extend a larger brand you ll have a larger new product but pricing we have adjusted based on the different elasticities we ve experienced in the different products and packaging promotional groups and then of course separate from pricing innovation is clearly a lever that we ll be pulling and certainly we ll apply to some of our other brands ken zaslow bmo capital markets analyst ok my last question is when was the last time you ve taken a local brand and gone national and what experience do you have to be able to do that with victoria because i like the idea of this and i think i ve seen it with other companies i think it was new england clam chowder have done it i mean there s examples over the last 15 20 years that i ve seen and it can actually be a real home run but what is your experience and how comfortable are you and how quickly will we see any change on that ken romanzi president and chief executive officer i think we d have to go back in our history but i believe new york style bagel chips is probably a good example of a brand that has expanded distribution over time i don t know the numbers off the top of my head in terms where it started and where it is today but that s up interestingly about victoria it kind of national actually it s actually north americanwide because we have full distribution in the club channel both in u s and canada we also have full distribution in mass merchandisers we re talking about building out geographic supermarket distribution and we re gaining distribution every day but there s still there s a fair amount of white space and we may not get to 100 but every five or 10 points worth of distribution growth is nice sales growth ken zaslow bmo capital markets analyst how much does 5 to 10 add did you say ken romanzi president and chief executive officer i m sorry ken zaslow bmo capital markets analyst how much did you say that every year 500 to 1 000 basis points of incremental distribution add to your top line ken romanzi president and chief executive officer oh i didn t say a number i don t know that number off the top of my head but certainly any distribution growth will certainly add to profitable sales growth ken zaslow bmo capital markets analyst i guess are there other brands that you can do that with ken romanzi president and chief executive officer there s several brands that we think have expansion capabilities one back to victoria is one mccann s certainly is one and back to nature is another one that again has strong presence in the specialty food channel nationally it has strong presence in a regional retailer and a semi national retailer but beyond that it doesn t have a lot of mainstream supermarket presence so we re going to be looking to expand the presence and that s less of an example of a regional brand and more that just has more customer penetration opportunities because it already kind of spans the country it just doesn t expand in all retailers operator and our next question comes from carla casella from jp morgan carla casella j p morgan analyst you have been proactive in the past at refinancing your debt i m just wondering your thoughts or if you ve started thinking about the 2021 bond maturity now that they re callable bruce wacha chief financial officer we re watching the market but obviously we have a fair amount of time and we like the coupon what we have right now so expect us to continue to watch and potentially be opportunistic when we see the right time carla casella j p morgan analyst ok great and then brian asked a little bit about the industry trends i m wondering if there are any specific changes of trends in slotting slotting trends in the industry just given the changes we ve seen in players on both the wholesale and retail side and your thoughts there on slotting for going for last year versus going forward ken romanzi president and chief executive officer well the slotting still exists it s still a cost of doing business yet we do see more and more retailers willing to take that and putting it into promotional support and not just pay an entry into the shelf and there are a handful of customers that don t take it at all and that s the once we prioritize in terms of a rolling early innovation particularly on the frozen green giant front so there s a handful of customers that will again launch innovation will launch early 2020 innovation in the fourth quarter of this year because without a slotting investment we can afford to launch products late in the year and have it be positive to our p l rather than negative to our p l operator and our next question is from eric larson with buckingham research group eric larson buckingham research analyst my first question is when i look at your adjusted gross margins for the quarter i think the comparison adjusted year over year was like 24 5 this quarter versus 27 7 a year ago how much of that decline was kind of a mechanical calculation for pirate s being divested and what would be the other major differences in that first quarter drop in gross profit margin bruce wacha chief financial officer don t have those splits in front of me but you re right there is a mechanical portion of that and like i said we are still we re still selling product under the cost structure from the fourth quarter as we continue to benefit organizationally from some of our cost cutting initiatives the benefits of those will continue to roll out throughout the remainder of the year along with the benefits from the pricing and so it s a little bit of both eric larson buckingham research analyst ok ok and then i noticed in your sg a expenses and this is maybe what i thought might be a partial explanation for your gross margin decline partially obviously the mechanical issues was pirate but your consumer marketing was down fairly sharply in the quarter down 3 3 million so did you see a shift in how we spent your money in the quarter did you have a higher degree of promotional spend on a relative basis that maybe accounted for the decline in consumer marketing spend ken romanzi president and chief executive officer we tightened up marketing spend quite frankly to keep our powder dry for the rest of the year because i do have a new head of all of our marketing and he wanted to go through and peel through every budget so we held in a lot of areas to be able to reapply for the rest of the year and apply under a new direction of a new leader so something i applauded when he took over the reins and it certainly helped a little bit but it s not the way we want that s not really the way we want to make our long term numbers we want to be driving the business and but this is right now more of a shift than anything else eric larson buckingham research analyst ok and then just a final question i think we re all a little we re scratching our head a little bit on your elasticity issues a 7 3 million increase of pricing but elasticity offsets that 7 1 million the question i have is every quarter some of your product lines have seasonality to them where you ll have a higher percentage like canned vegetables is a big fourth quarter item and you need to promote heavily in the fourth quarter was there a product line that has maybe a q1 cadence to it where you may not have been as competitive on promotion and that s why your elasticity was so high in the quarter or is it a timing issue i guess we really want to figure out how that works ken romanzi president and chief executive officer yes so that volume in the base business that you re talking about i mean first of all the big driver of the volume decrease is the divestiture of pirate s and so that just comes off right off the start as far the base business keep in mind there s some elasticity in there but really what drove a lot of that volume decline has to do with the shift in easter was a little bit victoria was a little bit and then also you have something like a cream of wheat where a warmer season those drove some of that volume drop as well and so i don t think you just can simply say pricing up 7 million volume down 7 million therefore 7 million of elasticity eric larson buckingham research analyst ok all right and i noticed that back to nature was particularly weak in the quarter i think you ve fully anniversaried that acquisition i believe you have i d have to go look that up myself bruce wacha chief financial officer yes you don t have to we have eric larson buckingham research analyst ok so that would have been part of that base business volume loss then in the quarter as well correct bruce wacha chief financial officer correct ken romanzi president and chief executive officer and quite frankly some of it a lot of that is self i wouldn t even say inflicted self directed because back to nature core categories are cookies and crackers and then granola and nuts i would say are secondary core but the prior owners got into things like soup and juices and cereals and stuff and really didn t have any strength or strongholds and when we took the business over we identified those as questionable categories to be in as well as our retailers so we literally are cleaning up and getting out of those categories which will depress sales and to focus on the core snacking categories so it s down but it s down for the reasons we understand and self directed and cleaning up the product line and being more focused on the snack part of the business going forward which is where the brand has shown proven ability over time is what we re most intrigued with going forward eric larson buckingham research analyst ok no that s very helpful comments on the back to nature business so will you have sort of negative lack or i guess sku i guess just sku rationalization will that be a negative comp in back to nature for the next quarter or two then or how should we view this ken romanzi president and chief executive officer it will be a drag over the next couple of quarters but we started losing we started cleaning up and losing distribution in the second quarter last year so it will be continue but it should alleviate over the next couple of quarters and by the fourth quarter we think we re pretty much pretty clean and not material and starting to offset that with growth on the remaining pieces of the business operator and our next question is coming from hale holden with barclays hale holden barclays analyst ken you mentioned maybe some potential work on the frozen distribution side and i was wondering if that was baked into your full year guidance for savings or if that would be in addition ken romanzi president and chief executive officer it is it was announced as part of our savings last year we just didn t implement it until this quarter so just like we moved the warehouse on dry and moved much closer to our customers we re moving a warehouse actually this is much closer to the supply of products for mexico and plus closer to customers so we re going to get benefits on both inbound freight on that warehouse and outbound freight but that s been taking place in the first part of this year but it was planned for this year hale holden barclays analyst got it and the second one is on a as a follow up to some of the m a discussion when you think about m a are you still willing to consider sort of more creative options like reverse morris trusts or should we think that there s a ceiling to what you might buy bruce wacha chief financial officer i think unfair for us to comment on that other than we re actively looking for m a ideas as we always have in our past and we evaluate each one individually and at the end of the day the math has to work hale holden barclays analyst great it was worth a try bruce i appreciate it bruce wacha chief financial officer no worries operator and our final question is coming from jon anderson with william blair jon andersen william blair analyst i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the organizational enhancements that you ve made over the past 12 months or so where are you with respect to kind of people process systems the things that can help you steward the business effectively and also kind of execute the blocking and tackling like demand and production planning inventory management just trying to get a sense for where you think you are in terms of having those pieces together and presumably that would give you also a better kind of overall visibility into the business ken romanzi president and chief executive officer well let s talk about people processes people systems and process right so first off from a people standpoint we just implemented our new leadership team i would say new leadership team some people new some people that have been around for long term with new responsibilities and everywhere in between so that s pretty well set i would say from a capability standpoint you mentioned like supply chain or you indicated supply chain versus a couple of years ago a few years ago when the company took over green giant that was a big change for us and we have now got a hold demand supply and demand planning organization that didn t exist two and a half years ago and we didn t just miraculously take down inventory by 100 million last year it was absolutely driven by a new team of people that were bringing in a very very solid sales and ops planning process that was allowing basically the demand side of the house to get together with the supply side of the house and being able to reduce 100 million worth of inventory but increase customer service levels so i would say that our evp of operations bill herbes has done a terrific job hiring best in class people to bring a process that never existed at b g before so in fact when i first came here in december of 2017 i saw that process and that team working on green giant and they were doing a great job and i asked the leader of that group how fast can you get through the rest of the business and after he gulped he said well i probably can do it within the next four or five months i said well we need to do this and by mid last year we had it on every single one of our businesses which is allowing us to improve our customer service while we re reducing inventory in terms of so the people part there s still some areas we want to round out but i wouldn t say there s any big gaping hole ecommerce is an area we want to beef up sales and category management is an area we want to beef up because we do have people that are carrying 51 brands in their bag and we re going to add to that in the future when we do more m a so we re going to want to beef that execution arm up a little bit but i think the biggest breakthrough just happened last weekend and it s been two years in coming we now have our new system and it s not a panacea but it certainly is a tool to get much better at planning of our business executing our business analyzing our business and forecasting our business and our people are very excited about it it s been a long time coming but it clearly gets b g up to the executional snuff it needs to be by handling a business that s a lot more complicated than it was just a few years ago we re not only larger we re more complicated and this system will allow us to manage the business quite frankly the people that have been here a long time welcome it and the people that are here new in the last few years they know how to use this system because they come from best in class companies that have had systems very similar so whether it s a manufacturing person or a finance person or a financial planning and analysis person they re all very excited about it the one system we re going to also implement as an add on to this system over the next year will be a trade promotion management system that s one area that was not done in the initial oracle jd edwards area it is a very large spend and you need a system to better manage it so we ll be putting in a typical trade management system that exists in many of our peer group companies i m sure or things like it to be able to manage that very very large spend to get at those trade promotion efficiencies that we believe are there they re just hard to get at without the system to be able to manage it jon andersen william blair analyst that s very helpful i appreciate it it makes a lot of sense one quick follow up when you talk about the productivity cost saving program in the multi year program have you can you put some guardrails around the duration and the magnitude kind of the cumulative impact that you expect at least from what you ve kind of game planned or planned out at this point i know you said 15 million to 20 million this year i think an incremental 20 million to 25 million next year have you thought beyond that or is that just the too far out at this point ken romanzi president and chief executive officer no well we originally stated a goal and of 50 million and we think that that s kind of over three years but i do also have a new executive vice president of supply chain who i ve worked with many times before and he s got a much larger list than i even initiated i learned a lot of my operational savvy from him over the years so 50 million is kind of our first stop and we re going to be looking to see if we can add to that it s too early to say now but we ve only start just started some of the i wouldn t say it s low hanging fruit we started things that are not structural i mean i would say changing a warehouse is somewhat structural but not that structural but we have to get much more efficient and the plants run as well as perhaps reconsider what we re making where and that gets to a little bit more structural change and we have to put some more pen to paper on what that might be worth but we feel good about the initial goal of 50 million and there s certainly a lot of wind in our sails for this year and next year to offset inflationary costs operator that concludes today s question and answer session mr romanzi at this time

the british hand behind the deep state today lincoln s american system goes global the american system touches the canadian mind the adoption by england for herself of this transcendental principle has all but lost the colonies and her madly attempting to make it the principle of the british empire would entirely alienate the colonies though pretending to unusual intelligence the manchester schools are as a class as void of knowledge of the world as of patriotic principle as a necessary consequence of the legislation of england canada will require england to assent to the establishment of two things 1st an american zollverein 2nd canada to be made neutral territory in time of any war between england and the united states 2 canada is now governed by a junta sitting at london known as the round table with ramifications in toronto in winnipeg in victoria with tories and grits receiving their ideas from london and insidiously forcing them on their respective parties 4 as between the three possibilities of the future 1 closer imperial union 2 union with the u s and 3 independence i believe definitely that no 2 is the real danger i do not think the canadians themselves are aware of it they are wonderfully immature in political reflection on the big issues and hardly realize how powerful the influences are 5 the round table movement new racist breed same racist species this organization has been able to conceal its existence quite successfully and many of its most influential members satisfied to possess the reality rather than the appearance of power are unknown even to close students of british history this is the more surprising when we learn that one of the chief methods by which this group works has been through propaganda it plotted the jameson raid of 1895 it caused the boer war of 1899 1902 it set up and controls the rhodes trust it created the union of south africa in 1906 1910 it established the south african periodical the state in 1908 it founded the british empire periodical the round table in 1910 and this remains the mouthpiece of the group it has been the most powerful single influence in all souls balliol and new colleges at oxford for more than a generation it has controlled the times for more than fifty years with the exception of the three years 1919 1922 it publicized the idea of and the name british commonwealth of nations in the period 1908 1918 it was the chief influence in lloyd george s war administration in 1917 1919 and dominated the british delegation to the peace conference of 1919 it had a great deal to do with the formation and management of the league of nations and of the system of mandates it founded the royal institute of international affairs in 1919 and still controls it it was one of the chief influences on british policy toward ireland palestine and india in the period 1917 1945 it was a very important influence on the policy of appeasement of germany during the years 1920 1940 and it controlled and still controls to a very considerable extent the sources and the writing of the history of british imperial and foreign policy since the boer war 7 1873 1902 empire on the verge of collapse re organize or perish mr rhodes is my man i have just had three hours talk with him he is full of a far more gorgeous idea in connection with the paper than even i have had i cannot tell you his scheme because it is too secret but it involves millions he had no idea that it would cost 250 000 to start a paper but he offered me down as a free gift 20 000 to buy a share in the p m gazette as a beginning his ideas are federation expansion and consolidation of the empire he took to me told me some things he has told no other man save lord rothschild and pressed me to take the 20 000 not to have any return to give no receipt to simply take it and use it to give me a freer hand on the p m g it seems all like a fairy dream 12 let us form the same kind of society a church for the extension of the british empire a society which should have its members in every part of the british empire working with one object and one idea we should have its members placed at our universities and our schools and should watch the english youth passing through their hands just one perhaps in every thousand would have the mind and feelings for such an object he should be tried in every way he should be tested whether he is endurant possessed of eloquence disregardful of the petty details of life and if found to be such then elected and bound by oath to serve for the rest of his life in his country he should then be supported if without means by the society and sent to that part of the empire where it was felt he was needed to and for the establishment promotion and development of a secret society the true aim and object whereof shall be for the extension of british rule throughout the world the colonization by british subjects of all lands where the means of livelihood are attainable by energy labour and enterprise and especially the occupation by british settlers of the entire continent of africa the holy land the valley of the euphrates the islands of cyprus and candia the whole of south america the islands of the pacific not heretofore possessed by great britain the whole of the malay archipelago these aboard of china and japan the ultimate recovery of the united states of america as an integral part of the british empire 13 the milnerite vincent massey and the rebirth of canadian oligarchism i have given a letter of introduction to you to a young man called vincent massey he is about 23 or 24 years of age very well off and full of enthusiasm for the most invaluable assistance in the roundtable and in connection with the junior groups he is going home to balliol for a two year course in history having already taken his degree at the toronto university at the end of his two years he expects to return to canada and take up some kind of serious work either as a professor at the university or at some other non money making pursuit i have become really very attached to him and i hope you will give him an occasional talk i think it so important to get hold of these first rate young canadians and i know what a power you have over young men i should like to feel that he could become definitely by knowledge a milnerite 18 the first attempt fails imperial union 1911 1923 as a brotherhood we have lost interest in the empire and are no longer competent to deal with it i think therefore that if the round table is to go on it should quite definitely change its character remove its subtitle and become what it is much more fitted to become at the present time a publication connected with the royal institute of international affairs all the heart and soul of the round table movement is petering out and i really don t know that we stand for anything in particular nowadays 21 the failure of the second attempt the round table transformed 1923 1930 i am afraid that things in canada are not at present as satisfactory as they are in the united states i even found in places a certain feeling that it was a mistake for returned scholars to avow themselves as rhodes scholars and that the best would be that they should merge themselves in the population and forget their unhappy past 22 mackenzie king s failed personality it is very difficult to make a permanent impression on him for two reasons 1 he is as selfish a man as i have ever known the selfishness disguised by a thick smear of sentimentalism he will therefore sacrifice anyone or anything to his ambition and then sob about it 2 he has a mind as lacking in edge as a jellyfish fortunately for you he has a real fund of dignified though rather windy eloquence and will do little harm if given plenty of speeches to make 24 chatham house comes to canada it would be easier and more self respecting for canada to give up to an international body on which it was represented the decision on which it should go to war than to transfer the right to make that decision from the government in ottawa to the government in washington it would thus appear probable that effective military cooperation between canada and the united states is possible only within the framework of an effective world order of which both canada and the united states are loyal members 29 1932 1935 america s new deal crushes the league of nations it was not a mere coincidence that at the same time the british promoted the nazis in europe in 1934 the synarchist lazard freres and j p morgan financial interests in the united states were staging a similar fascist dictatorial coup against franklin d roosevelt using the same disgruntled veterans of foreign wars groupings with operatives from the french croix de feu deployed to the united states they ultimately failed to capture the leadership of general smedley butler who ended the u s plot by publicly denouncing the conspiracy as the fascist coup that it was 32 1932 the rhodes trust hive in canada shifts gears the laurier liberals rise again 1935 1940 he shared his prime minister s suspicions of britain s political leadership and had never forgotten that following the british blindly into battle in 1914 had nearly destroyed his country skelton became the leader of the isolationist intelligentsia in the east block 35 this distrust was demonstrated in the words of the prime minister who spoke to the canadian population after the imperial conference of 1937 saying those who looked to the conference to devise and formulate a joint imperial policy on foreign affairs defense or trade will find nothing to fulfill their expectations 36 the british are doing their best to have the czechs sacrifice themselves on the altar of european peace apparently the french are softening in resistance the prime minister said in council there seemed almost unanimous recognition of the impossibility of our staying out if britain goes in my 14 years effort here wasted 37 while mackenzie king was bracing his country for the possibility of war the riia s world order preparatory group held its first meeting at chatham house on 17 july 1939 the discussion emphasized the importance of maintaining the rule of law in international relations unlike the ciia which struggled to be heard in ottawa through much of 1941 the riia had already established close links to the government in london its impact was evident in october 1939 when lord lothian the british ambassador in washington alluded publicly to a future global federation his comments foresaw an international order in which regional organizations would police the world under the umbrella of a unifying executive body 38 ironically just as the ciia abandoned its faith in the canadian government norman robertson finally began to mobilize the department of external affairs since wartime restrictions prevented him from hiring the additional staff necessary to pursue an internationalist agenda in the traditional way he sought temporary help from his former academic colleagues himself a university of british columbia graduate robertson first asked the professor of political science and economics henry angus to move to ottawa and assume the position of departmental special assistant angus was a member of the ciia and had studied the versailles settlement in depth he was expected to contribute constructively to postwar discussions george glazebrook known to pearson from the history department of the university of toronto soon joined him glazebrook had sat on the ciia research committee that had been tasked with looking into the shape of the postwar world in all approximately twenty university professors eventually worked for external affairs during the war nearly all of whom had direct or at least indirect ties to the ciia the recruitment of these academics created a planning infrastructure within the canadian civil service that was similar to those already established in great britain and the united states two years after the anglo american process of planning the postwar order had started canada was finally taking its first small step forward 41 part one the rise of the round table movement and the sad case of canada 1864 1945 two systems are before the world the one looks to increasing the proportion of persons and of capital engaged in trade and transportation and therefore to diminishing the proportion engaged in producing commodities with which to trade with necessarily diminished return to the labor of all while the other looks to increasing the proportion engaged in the work of production and diminishing that engaged in trade and transportation with increased return to all giving to the laborer good wages and to the owner of capital good profits one looks towards universal war the other towards universal peace one is the english system the other we may be proud to call the american system for it is the only one ever devised the tendency of which was that of elevating while equalizing the condition of man throughout the world henry c carey lincoln s advisor harmony of interests 1856with the election of donald trump in november 2016 it has become apparent for that america isn t what many thought it was suddenly for the first time since the assassination of john f kennedy in 1963 there was no longer one america but rather two opposing forces within america itself and the question was raised which is the real america and what is it that trump was re activating here was a political leader who wasn t from the technocratic establishment and who campaigned to work with russia and china end regime change wars reverse the nation killing effects of nafta reviving the jfk era space mission and even discussed restoring glass steagall a clue to what he chose to represent can be witnessed in his defense of the american system when he said this is the system our founders wanted our greatest american leaders including george washington hamilton jackson lincoln they all agreed that for america to be a strong nation it must also be a great manufacturing nation soon it became apparent that this deep state structure mobilized to stop the re emergence of the american system was not even american as many had supposed but rather of a purely british imperial pedigree and was even caught working against british nationalists such as jeremy corbyn it finally came to light that the british empire had never gone away after wwii but had evoked a powerful sleight of hand after fdr s untimely death in 1945 how did this happen by what means and motives did this deep state arise was it always there or were there key moments in history that give us clarity into its origins and how it took over both america and other nations alike by approaching history shaped by a battle between british and american systems of social order which represents much more than merely british or american nations per se a master key to unlock the secrets of britain s takeover of america and europe can be found by exploring the strange case of canada what is this strange partly british partly american monarchy of the americas at the best of times it was uplifted by the best constitutional traditions of america cited by donald trump above and at the worst of times it was a platform to spread british intrigues upon the world exemplified by the montreal based assassinations of american system leaders abraham lincoln in 1865 and john f kennedy in 1963 today those intrigues are led by such rhodes scholars as chrystia freeland and the modern round table movement of ben rowswell who have together played leading roles in the overthrow of venezuela the protection of fascists in ukraine and advance of nato against russia and china the time has come to drag some skeletons out of the closet canada s struggle for existence as a sovereign nation has been caught between two opposing views of mankind represented by the british and american system of social organization as the great economist henry c carey laid out while he was advancing the policy of abraham lincoln the american system was designed to become a global system operating amongst sovereign nations for the progress and mutual benefit of each and all by the end of the 19century american system thinking was resonating with statesmen and patriots in all corners of the globe who were fed up with the ancient imperial system of british free trade that had always strived to maintain a world divided and monopolized this view for a post colonial world was exemplified by lincoln ally and first governor of colorado william gilpin who described a world united by railways across all continents centered around the bering strait rail connection this was outlined in his widely read 1890 the cosmopolitan railway although british propagandists had made every attempt to keep the illusion of the sacredness of the british system alive in the minds of its subjects the undeniable increase of quality of life and creative thought expressed by the american system everywhere it was applied become too strong to ignore especially within colonies such as canada that had long suffered a fragmented and underdeveloped identity as the price paid for loyalty to the british empire in germany the american system inspired zollverein customs union had not only unified a divided nation but elevated it to a level of productive power and sovereignty which had outpaced the monopoly power of the british east india company in japan american engineers helped assemble trains funded by a national banking system and protective tariff during the meiji restoration in russia american system follower sergei witte transport minister and close advisor to czar alexander ii revolutionized the russian economy with the american made trains that rolled across the trans siberian railway under the influence of witte and other american system allies czar nicholas ii endorsed the bering strait rail connection in 1905 though a tragic turn of fate sabotaged it from unfolding not even the ottoman empire remained untouched by the inspiration for progress as the berlin to baghdad railway was begun with the intention of unleashing a bold program of modernization of southwest asia in canada admirers of lincoln and henry c carey found their spokesman in the great american system statesman isaac buchanan 1 buchanan rose to his highest position of political office in the dominion of canada when in april 1864 the new macdonald taché ministry appointed him the president of the executive council this put him in firm opposition to the imperial agenda of george brown and the later prime minister john a macdonald of whom he and all patriotic co thinkers counted as bitter enemies to canada s independence and progress the policy which buchanan advocated as he rose to higher prominence was outlined in his december 1863 speech while the customs union modelled on the zollverein program of american system economist friedrich list in germany laid out by buchanan was temporarily defeated during the operation known as the articles of confederation in 1867 the potential for its re emergence returned in 1896 with the election of wilfrid laurier canada s next prime minister by 1911 the customs union policy advanced by laurier who was a devout admirer of abraham lincoln finally came to fruition laurier long recognized that canada s interests did not reside in the anti american program of macdonald which simply tied canada into greater dependence towards the mother country but rather with the interests of its southern neighbour his reciprocity program proposed to lower protective tariffs with the usa primarily on agriculture but with the intention to electrify and industrialize canada a nation which laurier saw as supporting 60 million people within two decades with the collaboration of his close advisors adam shortt oscar skelton and later william lyon mackenzie king laurier navigated the mine field of his british enemies active throughout the canadian landscape in the form of the masonic orange order of ontario and later the insidious round table movement while laurier s attempts to actualize a true reciprocity treaty of 1911 that involved free trade among north american economies united under a protective tariff against british dumping of cheap goods it would not last as every resource available to the british run orange order and round table were activated to ensure the reciprocity s final defeat and the downfall of laurier s liberal government and its replacement by the conservative government of sir robert borden in its stead 3 laurier described the situation in canada after this event two years before laurier uttered this warning the founder of the round table movement lord milner wrote to one of his co conspirators laying out the strategic danger faced by buchanan and laurier s program with america without understanding either the existential struggle between the two opposing systems related above or the creation of the round table movement by a new breed of british imperialist as a response to lincoln s international victory in the face of the total bankruptcy of the british empire at the turn of the last century then no canadian could honestly ever make sense of what has shaped his or her cultural and political landscape it is the purpose of this present report to shed a clear light upon some of the principal actors on this stage of universal history with the hope that the reader s powers of insight may be strengthened such that those necessary powers of judgement required to lead both canada and the world out of our current plunge into a new dark age may yet occur the round table movement served as the intellectual center of the international operations to regain control of the british empire and took on several incarnations over the 20th century it worked in tandem with the coefficients club the fabian society and the rhodes trust all of whom witnessed members moving in and out of each other s ranks the historian carrol quigley of georgetown university wrote of this cabal in his posthumously published anglo american establishment 6 to understand the pedigree of the round table movement as it was officially unveiled in 1910 as the ideological shaper of the policies and paradigm of the new managerial class of international imperialists dedicated to the salvation of the british empire under an imperial federation it would be necessary to go back a few decades prior to 1873 74 it was in this year that a young canadian named george parkin lectured at oxford on the subject imperial union as the sacred duty of all anglo saxons to advance parkin is popularly heralded by oxford historians as the man who shifted the mind of england during this same period a grouping of imperial intellectuals known as the x club f 1865 centering on thomas huxley matthew arnold herbert spencer and joseph hooker were assigned the responsibility to overhaul the british empire s controlling ideological structures that had proven themselves worn out each would specialize on various branches of the sciences and would all promote gradualist interpretations of change to counteract explanations which required creative leaps this program was applied with the intention of 1 saving the collapsing empire and 2 establishing the foundation of a new scientific religion based upon charles darwin s highly materialistic model of natural selection as the explanation for the evolution and differentiation of new species as x club co founder herbert spencer went on to elaborate the system of social darwinism as the logical outgrowth of darwin s system into human affairs the intention behind the propagation of the darwinian program was never the enlightenment liberalism in battle against the ignorant dogmas of religion as it is so often recounted by popular historians of science rather the revolution in science initiated by the x club was merely the re packaging of an idea as old as babylon the control of the masses by a system of oligarchical rule simply under a new type of scientific dictatorship but how when the demonstration of creative reason s power to elevate humanity s conditions of life by encouraging new discoveries and applied technologies as promoted by the american system of political economy would the world now accept the conditions of mental and political enslavement demanded by the imperialist in a fixed system struggle for diminishing returns this was the challenge upon which young oxford men would set their creative energies using the scientific reasoning established by thomas huxley s x club and for the service of the ruling oligarchical families of europe george parkin like all young oxford men at this time was highly influenced by this network s ideas and used them to justify the natural scientific inevitability of the hegemony of the strong over the weak in this case the anglo saxon master race dominating the inferior peoples of the earth this message could be seen in his 1892 work imperial federation nations take long to grow but there are periods when as in the long delayed flowering of certain plants or in the crystallization of chemical solutions new forms are taken with extreme rapidity there are the strongest reasons for believing that the british nation has such a period immediately before it the necessity for the creation of a body of sound public opinion upon the relations to each other of the various parts of the empire is therefore urgent 8 in elaborating upon the danger of the british system s collapse in light of nationalist movements following the american system model parkin went on to ask has our capacity for political organization reached its utmost limit for the british people this is the question of questions in the whole range of possible political variations in the future there is no issue of such far reaching significance not merely for our own people but for the world at large as the question whether the british empire shall remain a political unit or yielding to disintegrating forces shall allow the stream of the national life to be parted into many separate channels 9 one of parkin s oxford contemporaries was alfred milner a character who plays a vicious role in our drama as the catalyzer behind the formation of the round table movement milner credited parkin with giving his life direction from that point on 10 it was during 1876 that another contemporary of milner and parkin named cecil rhodes left oxford in order to make a fortune on a cotton plantation in south africa all three characters were also highly influenced by john ruskin the leader of the artistic branch of british intelligence led by the pre raphaelite society the proceeds of rhodes cotton fortune were multiplied many times by ventures into the diamond industry of south africa allowing him to rise to gargantuan heights of political power and wealth peaking with his appointment as prime minister of cape town and founder of rhodesia the current london centered mineral cartels rio tinto de beers and lonrho now pillaging africa as well as the legacy of apartheid which has stained so much of south africa s history are among two aspects of the scarring legacy rhodes has passed down to present times between 1876 and his becoming high commissioner to south africa in 1897 milner s path slightly diverged from rhodes milner was recruited by the editor of the pall mall gazette william t stead and became associate editor soon thereafter the gazette s function was set out in the pall mall gospel a short mission statement which stead demanded all of his employees abide to the federation of the british empire is the condition of its survival as an empire we must federate or perish the gospel also propagandized for the inevitable destiny that the usa and britain coalesce 11 the role which the pall mall played in coordinating a cohesive vision of empire was the model followed by milner and his minions later as they ran the round table periodicals stead was officially recruited to the grand design in 1889 which was instigated by rhodes and his sponsor lord rothschild it was when stead had been recently released for prison due to his gazette s promotion of organized vice only to find his paper in serious financial trouble when he was first called upon by cecil rhodes a long time follower of his journal in south africa after their first meeting stead ecstatically wrote to his wife quigley demonstrates that both milner and stead had become active members of the agenda laid out by cecil rhodes but what was this agenda in a series of seven wills written between 1879 and 1901 rhodes the unapologetic racist laid out his designs for the re conquering of the world and indoctrinating young elites into his design in another will rhodes described in more detail his intention it was under this specific design to create an indoctrination system of talented young disciples that rhodes dream of stealing the world and reconquering america that the rhodes trust was established upon his death in 1902 some historians have maintained that since rhodes doesn t literally bring up his call for a secret society in his last two wills he must have matured and left those notions behind him yet professor quigley points out that the belief pushed by such authoritative historians is a farce evidenced by george parkin s revealing observation taken from his book the rhodes scholarship published in 1912 it is essential to remember that this final will is consistent with those which had preceded it that it was no late atonement for errors as some have supposed but was the realization of life long dreams persistently pursued 14 upon rhodes death george parkin became the first head of the rhodes scholarship trust in 1902 leaving his post as principal of upper canada college 1895 1902 to fulfill his duty it was under this post that parkin recruited fellow upper canada college professor edward peacock who joined him as a rhodes trustee and promoter of what became the canadian branches of the round table movement while organizing for the ouster of prime minister wilfrid laurier and the defeat of the 1911 reciprocity treaty this group recruited young talented disciples from their college connections along the way the model of the round table involved a central coordinating body in london with branches strategically placed throughout the commonwealth in order to provide one vision and voice to the young and talented upper managerial class of the reformed british empire parkin and peacock were joined by lord alfred milner sir arthur glazebrook w t stead arthur balfour and lord nathan rothschild as co trustees working in tandem with the eugenicists of the fabian society of sidney and beatrice webb balfour had founded the first international eugenics conference in 1912 alongside enthusiastic recruits such as young roundtable member winston churchill charles darwin s cousin and founder of eugenics sir francis galton died mere weeks before being able to keynote the conference the fabian society and its sister organization the co efficients club featured such other prominent eugenicists as bertrand russell halford mackinder h g wells and george bernard shaw and later harold laski and john maynard keynes membership rosters of either organization frequently overlapped 15 much of the dirty work conducted by the original roundtable movement was run primarily by the group of young oxford men who got their start managing imperial affairs under milner during the boer war suppression of the transvaal south african uprising of 1899 to 1902 of this kindergarden philip kerr and lionel curtis were tasked with coordinating the canadian branches from london with parkin and peacock leading from canada while oxford had long been the indoctrination center of young elites for centuries prior now with the rhodes scholarship program in place a new level of standardization had been initiated the new program provided scholarships to young talent primarily throughout the anglo saxon family of nations which rhodes yearned to see re absorbed under one aryan umbrella the fabian society had founded the london school of economics lse for similar purposes both the lse and oxford have worked hand in hand at crafting agents of imperial change throughout the entire 20th century 16 each student upon selection would be provided a scholarship to oxford university a generous stipend and red carpet treatment into the upper echelons of the ruling oligarchical social networks if the student so willed each student was returned to their home country enflamed with a burning desire to fulfill the objectives of the british empire and advance the scientific management of society their talents were expressed either in elected office working in the civil service media law the private sector or in academia in most cases these scholars acted upon the fabian method of permeation theory slowly permeating all levels of society s controlling structures in order to shape perception and shift the invisible structures controlling mass behavior away from a current of progress and love of truth and towards a materialistic struggle for survival each year one scholarship was granted to each of the canadian provinces with the exception of p e i and 32 were granted to the united states to the present date approximately 7000 scholarships have been awarded with increasing openness to the non aryan countries to service the imperial agenda while the canadian experiment has long been trapped by its loyalist anti republican tendencies fueled by such oligarchical systems as the family compact 17 canada has never had a self contained ruling class as witnessed in the case of britain to this present day the london centered oligarchy loyal to babylonian traditions is expressed by the imperial crown as the fount of all honors from which all legal and actual authority across the commonwealth emanates this has been the model upon which different generations of the canadian oligarchy have been shaped similarly the american oligarchy has tended to follow a similar model of organization with families recruited by the crown s agents such as the rockefellers morgans harrimans and duponts who have merely shaped their values and customs of behavior around the system led by the british crown and represent nothing at all intrinsically american all attempts to evaluate history from the bias of an international bankers conspiracy or even american imperialism without this higher understanding of the british empire is thus doomed to failure one of the central figures in the rhodes network in forming the character and structure of the canadian oligarchy as well as the general mass culture of canada is a man named vincent massey massey is the son in law of george parkin who following the darwinian edict of breeding with the best married his four daughters to leading round table and oxford men massey born into the wealthy hart massey family dynasty became an early recruit to the round table working alongside canadian round table co founder arthur glazebrook in setting up a branch in ontario in 1911 glazebrook admired parkin so much that he even named his son george parkin de twenebroker glazebrook himself a rhodes scholar of balliol who went on to help run this group alongside massey by the late 1930s and would head the canadian secret service during world war ii arthur glazebrook wrote a shining letter of recommendation to milner upon massey s departure for studies at oxford s balliol college on aug 11 1911 upon his return to canada massey quickly rose in the ranks of the roundtable becoming crown privy councilor in 1925 then leading a delegation in 1926 at the imperial conference at which point his fellow roundtabler lord balfour passed the balfour declaration as a means of appeasing the nationalist sentiment hot in many colonies striving for independence from the mother country massey then became canada s first minister aka ambassador to the united states 1926 1930 where he coordinated policy with controlling institutions around the intelligence institutions centered around the council on foreign relations during his time in washington massey s official biographer and university of toronto president from 1958 1971 claude bissel points out that he was a frequent guest in the house of truth a stronghold of round table ideas in the united states housing such luminaries as walter lipmann felix frankfurter loring christie eustace percy and featuring such frequent guests as supreme court justice oliver wendell holmes and mcgeorge bundy most of these characters were hardcore eugenicists affiliated with the council on foreign relations the american branch of the royal institute for international affairs advancing the program of a british led anglo american empire oxford men loring christie and hume wrong were both recruited to massey s staff during this period and played important roles in the postwar takeover of canadian foreign policy hume s father george wrong was also an influential executive member of the canadian round table and massey ally massey s washington deployment was followed by a stint as president of the liberal federation of canada 1932 1935 and then canadian high commissioner to london 1935 1946 it was soon after this experience that massey was assigned to unleash the second of a series of royal commissions 1949 1951 dedicated to destroy any lingering sentiments of the american system within the hearts minds political artistic scientific structures or economic behavior of canada and reconstruct the canadian identity based on his own twisted image this operation had the dual effect of relieving responsibility from the rockefeller and carnegie foundations financial responsibility for crafting the canadian identity 19 as a token for a job well done massey then became the first canadian born governor general 1952 1959 during his career massey served as governor for upper canada college and the university of toronto as well as founder of a university modeled on all souls oxford called massey college f 1962 like all souls massey college serves as a central coordinating node for various operations run through the major universities in canada through his various political positions massey pulled every string possible to recruit as many agents of the roundtable movement and rhodes trust networks into prominent positions within the canadian civil service cultural control and academia during this same period in the united states rhodes scholars had swarmed into various influential positions of authority with a special focus on the state department in order to prepare to commandeer roosevelt s new deal program and convert it into a keynesian nightmare at the first available opportunity these operations resulted in a third attempt by the british empire to achieve an agenda that had largely failed in its first two attempts between 1902 and 1933 20 it is proper to briefly go through the first two before continuing with our report the first incarnation of the world government agenda to supersede the principle of sovereignty as the basis for world affairs had been the imperial union thesis around which the roundtable had first been created this involved the creation of a federation of nations united under one empire in which representatives of various colonies could hold representatives within an imperial parliament much like the european union structure chaining nations under the troika today the obvious mission under this structure was the participation of the united states ruled by the economic royalists of whom roosevelt said should have left the nation back in 1776 under parliamentary structures little more than an illusion of democracy exists while its bureaucratic nature permits for optimal control by a ruling oligarchy by the end of world war i forces within the round table were dreading the failure of this program and had resolved to dedicate themselves instead to the league of nations doctrine in its stead whereby essentially the same outcome could be achieved but through different means under this changing of gears it was arranged that the round table be phased out in place of something new two aging controllers of milner s kindergarten writing to each other in 1931 laid this problem squarely on the table and even proposed a solution it was with this failure of its original blueprint in mind that the roundtable movement began a conversion into its new costume with the creation of the royal institute for international affairs riia in 1919 followed immediately thereafter with branches in the united states under the heading of the council on foreign relations cfr and international pacific institute carrol quigley demonstrates that the cfr and ipi featured crossovers of members from the riia ciia while funding was provided through the rockefeller foundation carnegie foundation and riia while possessing nominally american names these organizations and their members were fully british both the riia cfr and ipi were financed through large grants by the rockefeller and carnegie foundations which themselves were set up merely as financial instruments to further the british imperial agenda at the same time the round table movement was unveiled in 1910 these were two of the core foundations which had been used to finance eugenics laws and the statistics based scientific premises justifying their political implementation quigley documents in his works the extensive array of financial support which these philanthropic organizations bestowed upon their london controllers due to the regaining of power of the liberal party now under the leadership of mackenzie king the canadian infiltration was not happening at the pace which some riia operatives would have liked in fact due to the influence of key laurier liberals such as oscar skelton and king s justice minister ernest lapointe in the famous imperial conference of 1923 the last attempt to impose the round table thesis for imperial union was defeated in that form by 1925 roundtable controller philip kerr aka lord lothian wrote of the anti british situation in canada guided by lapointe and skelton in the following terms in 1925 o d skelton laurier s friend and biographer as well as longtime friend and trusted collaborator of prime minister william lyon mackenzie king was made undersecretary of external affairs it was also at this time that resistance to rhodes scholar penetration into guiding positions of national policy was obstinately begun canadian cooperation with british foreign policy largely came undone beginning with the canadian rejection of britain s demands that canada commit its forces to britain s near war with turkey during the chanak crisis of 1922 in subsequent imperial conferences throughout the 1920s the laurier liberals led by skelton and lapointe went on to flank and reject various attempts at binding foreign policy between imperial federation or the league of nations collaboration with leaders of the free irish state against imperial policy was key in the success of the canadian patriots fending off the round table massey s biographers have commonly referenced his own frustration with skelton whom he saw as a barrier between himself and the prime minister a man who he could generally manipulate as long as no one with geostrategic insight was near him 23 king s increasing lack of cooperation with british foreign policy resulted in the following quote by massey brother in law and round table member william grant in 1925 the grant quote is instructive as it provides the reader an insight into the singular character flaw of king which would taint him his entire life that is the pitiful fact of his other directedness such that his tendency to frustrate evil influences who wished to use him for their own nefarious ends was frequently balanced by the frustration of good influences who tried to influence him the other way for good or for ill king was never his own man but was in the end a mother dominated mystic who could never sever his ideological affiliations with the monarchy he may have been a man of deep personal conviction in a higher cause but like the poor venetian prince in schiller s the ghost seer his convictions were never his own after the death of skelton in 1940 king s neurotic insecurity would express itself in his relief to be liberated by skelton s domineering influence i have frequently been thrown off following my own judgement and wisdom in these matters by pressure from skelton and the staff that i made up my mind i would not henceforth yield to anything of the kind 25 in another diary entry a year later king wrote one of the effects of skelton s passing will be to make me express my own views much more strongly 26 king s pro monarchist inclinations permanently schismed his modus operandi from those influences who he otherwise respected evidenced in the following diary recordings of skelton and king during two imperial conferences i defend ultimate independence which he opposes while after another conference king later wrote is at heart against the british empire which i am not i believe in the larger whole with complete independence of the parts united by cooperation in all common ends 27 the canadian branch of the riia aka chatham house was created only in 1928 at the same time as its australian counterpart largely as a response to the anti round table tendencies of the laurier liberals upon king the ciia s first president was none other than former canadian prime minister and masonic orangeman sir robert borden its second president was newton rowell who later became president of the canadian bar association and chaired the failed rowell sirois royal commission of 1935 1937 28 sir joseph flavelle and vincent massey were vice presidents and george parkin de t glazebrook was honorary secretary other founding members were financier and later conservative party cabinet official j m macdonnell carnegie foundation trustee n a m mackenzie ucc president william grant rhodes scholar george raleigh parkin financier edgar tarr journalist j w dafoe and henry angus raleigh parkin grant and macdonnell also had the distinction of being brothers in law with vincent massey and sons in law of george parkin in 1933 through a donation from the massey foundation which served as a mini clone of the rockefeller foundation the ciia hired its first permanent secretary named escott reid reid was a rhodes scholar fanatically governed by a commitment to world government through the league of nations expressed by his following remarks the five years after the ciia was established an affiliate organization was founded called the canadian institute for public affairs cipa by similar networks associated with the ciia in order to shape national internal policy while the ciia focused upon canada s foreign policy original featured speakers were the ciia s norman mackenzie and the eugenicist leader of the newly created ccf party j s woodsworth it would be another 20 years before both organizations began to jointly host conferences together today cipa exists in the form of the couchiching conferences and their regular brainwashing seminars have been broadcast across the canadian broadcasting corporation cbc for over 70 years the cipa was affiliated with the ymca itself a major british run indoctrination asset as it focused spreading its ideology on conferences and workshops the world over it was through this network that a young maurice strong was recruited and rose to the highest echelons of the management of the oligarchy s affairs in later years before fdr came to power in 1932 the united states was brought to its knees after four years of great depression itself induced by the blowout of a housing bubble built up artificially by british wall street agents such as u s treasury secretary andrew mellon it was during this time of fear and want that the american population was at its most gullible largely accepting the propaganda that immigration and bad genes were the cause of the rampant criminality in these painful years the vast majority of the sterilization laws passed and fascist sympathy cultivated occurred during this time of fear as franklin roosevelt rallied the population behind the battle cry there is nothing to fear but fear itself and kicked the money lenders out of the temple through the implementation of glass steagall and the activation of public credit issued through the reconstruction finance corporation the riia running their networks in canada and especially in the united states had to re adjust their programs the renewed faith in the powers of sovereign government in effecting progressive change by the activation of the american system principles were evaporating the belief that world government was the only option for peace to be ensured however change for an empire is not always easy and after decades of investing energy into their reconquest of the united states the british made a violent attempt to crush fdr a startling revelation swept through the press in 1933 with general smedley butler s public unveiling of the wall street backed attempt to run a coup d état against roosevelt using 500 000 legionnaires 30 general butler s unveiling of the plan to install himself as puppet dictator was recounted in butler s famous book war is a racket 31 this attempted coup had occurred mere months after the thwarted masonic run assassination plot to kill fdr which resulted in the killing of mayor cermak of chicago as pierre beaudry reported in his study on the synarchy after having failed miserably in applying aggressive fascism in america as was being done in europe as the solution to the economic woes of the depression orchestrated by agents of the british empire on wall street the rhodes networks decided that the only chance to defeat fdr was through the old fabian method of infiltration and co option every attempt was made to infiltrate new deal institutions at all costs such that their full co opting could occur relatively seamlessly upon the first opportunity of roosevelt s fall from power for this leading fabian society eugenicist john maynard keynes theories were used to first mimic the outward form of roosevelt s program without any of the substance just as roosevelt was coming to power in america in 1932 the rhodes trust networks of canada centering on escott reid frank underhill eugene forsey f r scott and david lewis founded a self described fabian modeled think tank customized for canada known as the league for social reconstruction lsr reid forsey scott and lewis were all rhodes scholars while underhill was an oxford trained fabian who was tutored by harold laski and g b shaw at balliol college the avowed intention of the group was to institute a system of scientific management of society under fabian precepts and expressed itself in the group s selecting of j s woodsworth another oxford trained fabian to head the new cooperative commonwealth federation ccf as an outgrowth of the lsr the ccf called for the complete destruction of capitalism in its regina manifesto of 1933 woodsworth an avowed eugenicist vigorously endorsed the passage of alberta s 1927 sterilization laws to eliminate the unfit 32 following the gospel of his fabian mentors h g wells and g b shaw woodsworth even advocated the abolishment of personal property at its heart the ccf was not your typical socialism but merely fascism with a scientific socialist face knowing that a fearful mob tends to fall into extremes the ciia s creation of a new polarized left and right did not produce the result as it should have under the logic of empire the abysmal failure of the right wing conservative party of prime minister r b bennett 1930 1935 should have created the conditions for a radical left turn by the time the ccf had been formed unemployment was over 25 money tightening policies were choking what little production still existed and bennett s typically anti american tory stance was blocking any potential for increasing trade with the united states but something wasn t working for the empire s agenda while the political seeds for a scientific socialist world government were being planted on pace in canada the cultural fear and despair necessary for such programs to take root willingly by the choice of the masses were no longer in place indeed the canadian population was so inspired by the weekly roosevelt fireside chats broadcast across the border scattered with newspaper reports of inspiring new deal projects that hope for a better future and a national solution to the chaos of the great depression was close enough at hand such that no great polarization could occur as such the blind acceptance of a woodsworth ccf scientific dictatorship run by agents of rhodes s nightmare was avoided fdr s power in the minds of the canadian population forced even the radical anti american blue tory government of r b bennett to eventually adapt to the language of the new deal by trying to copy the u s program in a last ditch effort to save the 1935 election this delphic program was known as bennett s new deal for canada platform the platform was a failure as the program laid out by bennett had two grave errors 1 promoting a vast array of social welfare proposals ie minimum wage health insurance unemployment insurance expanded pension plan minimum hours for the work week but lacking any large scale nation building measures which defined the american success and gave meaning to the welfare measures the bennett knock off simply copied the form without any of the substance of the true new deal the closest approximation to infrastructure programs involved slave labour driven work camps paying 25 cents per day which used and abused young desperate men so that piecemeal roads and patchwork building could occur devoid of any national mission 33 2 the national credit system employed by roosevelt through his understanding of american system thinkers as alexander hamilton and abraham lincoln was entirely absent from the mind of bennett and his civil servants while the creation of the bank of canada modeled on the privatized system of england s central bank was established in 1935 after an extensive royal commission run by lord macmillan begun in 1933 its constitutional and structural mandate was designed to merely centralize control for the management of already existent wealth under the control of monetarist accounting principles not the creation of new wealth this institution was designed as inherently monetarist keynesian not rooseveltian without a proper american styled credit system in place which tied credit to the increase of the productive powers of labour then any large investments even the superficial ones proposed by bennett s new deal were doomed to failure after the conservative party s 1935 decimation at the hands of the liberals bennett soon retired permanently to britain accepting a title of nobility as viscount with a revival of the american system under roosevelt we can see why the canadian culture was not induced to fall into the spider web set by london however we have yet to explain how the ciia rhodes trust networks were prevented from fully taking over control of canada s foreign policy during the remainder of the 1930s on october 1935 the liberals still under the leadership of mackenzie king returned to power in canadian politics attempting to gain a foothold amidst the two british controlled extremes of the left wing ccf and right wing conservatives at this point vincent massey left his three year post as president of the liberal party to occupy his new position as the high commissioner to britain bringing into his staff such oxford protégés as lester b pearson as his personal secretary as well as rhodes scholars george ignatieff and escott reid while most modern historians often affiliated with the ciia such as john english and jack granatstein 34 have held that the influx of oxford men into the department of external affairs dea was catalyzed by o d skelton the evidence demonstrates that none other than vincent massey himself and the ciia networks were the true leaders in this process against the better intention of o d skelton the popular thesis cooked up by granastein and his ilk has merely been a mythology maintained in order to hide canada s true nation building heritage from present generations as the following evidence will demonstrate while the ciia had built up a large array of high level intellectuals which had successfully installed themselves at controlling nodes of all major universities across canada unlike its counterparts in the united states or britain the ciia had been unsuccessful at permeating the department of external affairs dea this was caused in large measure by the return of oscar skelton as undersecretary of the dea working alongside the minister of external affairs mackenzie king king was the only prime minister to occupy both posts simultaneously in canadian history historian adam chapnick describes the suspicions of king and skelton to ciia infiltration in the following terms as chaos began to spread and the echos of war could be heard cracks began to appear in skelton s policy of keeping the ciia nest from taking over canadian foreign policy in a diary entry of may 20 1938 skelton wrote the following ominous words chapnick describes the irony of the riia s success in coordinating post war planning through the british foreign office as early as 1939 yet was unable to make any headway for similar planning in their canadian branch historian denis stairs relates philip kerr s frustration with skelton s influence on mackenzie king when he wrote that kerr once pointedly observed to vincent massey that it would be better if skelton did not regard co operation with anyone as a confession of inferiority massey reported later in his memoirs that he agreed with the assessment 39 massey an enemy of skelton since the 1923 imperial conference referred to skelton in his diaries as herr doktor skelton upon the mysterious deaths of o d skelton and ernest lapointe in 1941 40 the gates holding back the ciia s hordes began to be lifted as massey s young recruit norman robertson a rhodes scholar was quickly installed as skelton s replacement as undersecretary of external affairs with this veritable coup things quickly changed for the ciia s role in shaping canada s foreign policy chapnick describes the situation in the following terms with the takeover of canada s foreign policy making apparatus in the department of external affairs by the ciia canada s new program of the third way was set in place by the likes of escott reid lester pearson and later pierre elliot trudeau under this program canada s role in the post war world served as a counterweight to the bipolar cold war dynamic of mutually assured annihilation wherever possible canada would disrupt america by befriending communist countries while britain s delphic foreign policy became one of closely mimicking the usa the third way was described later by pierre trudeau when asked of his foreign policy approach as the creation of counter weights all this was done not for interests of canada a nation whose birth had become tragically aborted but in the service of the british empire to be continued next week bio matthew j l ehret is a journalist lecturer and founder of the canadian patriot review he is an author with the duran

incarnation of canada s local oligarchy whose currents are still felt through the oligarchical structures of canada was named the family compact formed officially during the war of 1812 by loyalist cliques who both left america pre existent loyalists from the war of 1776 and british aristocrats newly landed in canada its legacy involved the creation of instruments for the imperial indoctrination of young elites such as king s college f 1827 and upper canada college f 1829 along with the bank of upper canada all of which were run by the compact s leader and bishop for the church of england in canada john strachan ucc was designed explicitly to be a feeder school to king s college which was to take over full control of ucc in 1837 and later became re named to the university of toronto the compact would be forced to re organize itself after the 1837 rebellions of upper and lower canada led by william lyon mackenzie and louis joseph papineau mackenzie s grandson was prime minister william lyon mackenzie king the re organization of the family compact would result in the fraudulent union of upper and lower canada in 1840 and the promotion of the slavish belief in responsible government instead of true independence it was from this current that george parkin would arise 18 carrol quigley roundtable group in canada canadian historical review sept 1962 p 213 19 rockefeller carnegie and canada american philanthropy and the arts and letters in canada 2005 by jeffrey brison demonstrates in detail the ironic role which american philanthropic foundations served in cultivating a largely anti american identity for canadians the responsibility to fund the arts and humanities fell fully under the authority of the canadian government by 1957 with the creation of the canada council a centralized cultural control center catalyzed by the royal commission on national development in the arts letters and science 1949 1951 chaired by vincent massey the first ciia run commission was the newton sirois royal commission of 1935 1937 led by ciia president newton and was a complete failure 20 it is of note that this time frame is also bookended by the death of the last american system president and lincoln follower william mckinley and the emergence into power of american system and lincoln follower franklin delano roosevelt in the interim 3 decades every single president barring president harding who died under a mysterious case of food poisoning in office were demonstrated to have been anglophile puppets of the british empire 21 sir edward grigg to hitchens 15 december 1931 cited in the round table movement and imperial union by kendle p 284 22 cited in canada and the british world by philip buckner ubc press 2007 p 266 23 william mackenzie king himself has always been a paradoxical character in canadian history living under the domineering shadow of his mother s eye even long after her death king was literally possessed by a drive to bring honor back to his family after his grandfather william lyon mackenzie had led the thwarted upper canada rebellion of 1838 king had the admirable quality of being a man possessed of a principled will and sense of divine mission on earth yet sadly an irrational tendency to speak to his friends and family long after they had died it was this irrationally mystical profile that was capitalized on while king had lived in london visiting the prolific parapsychology operations and affiliated mediums run by roundtable leaders as w t stead king s penchant for bad judgement was manifest throughout his life especially seen as he was hired by the rockefeller foundation from 1914 1918 to help john d rockefeller jr resolve problems with striking miners in the usa it was through king s mediation that the farcical policy of the company union was created skelton s particular frustration with king s flaky character was evidenced in a letter to his wife during the 1926 imperial conference when skelton wrote the fact that certain other people give all their time to dining and talking with lord this or lady that and to diary writing and 5 minutes a day to prepare for conference matters makes everything pretty hard 24 w grant to sir maurice hankey oct 1925 w l grant archives vol 5 citation from claude bissel s the imperial canadian vol 1 william grant was also president of upper canada

federalizing of provincial debts and obligations was among the various proposals which attempted to mimic the outward form of fdr s american system policies but without any of the substance due in large measure to the resistance by quebec alberta and b c this commission failed completely at achieving its agenda 29 citation from reid bio 30 general smedly darlington butler war is a racket

canadian province to pass sterilization laws in 1927 the other being british columbia which did the same in 1932 these provinces followed the 32 american states which had done the same beginning with indiana in 1909 the promotion of their passage the financing of the statistical based science promoting them was funded by the two biggest philanthropic organizations in the world the carnegie foundation and the rockefeller corporation neither organization was truly american however and were merely doing the bidding of their london masters later another lse trained fabian named tommy douglas replaced woodsworth as the leader of the ccf tommy douglas the father of canadian universal healthcare was a devout eugenicist writing his 1933 masters thesis on problems of the sub normal family while studying at the fabian run london school of economics most defenders of douglas applaud him for having dropped his pro eugenics philosophy after visiting nazi germany in 1936 and evidenced by the fact that premier douglas did not implement proposed 1944 sterilization laws in saskatchewan when the opportunity arose this defense is ill founded as eugenics was already deemed too hot to push publicly evidenced by the pro eugenics blueprint which julian huxley s 1946 founding document of unesco lays out the universal healthcare reform carried out by douglas has a much darker intention which must be re evaluated under this new light more on this subject can be found in a race of our own eugenics and canada 1894 1946 and in the appendix to this report 34 see rick sander s

completely unrestricted and available for either dividends or buybacks we expect to transfer the majority of this builder basket from our operating companies to our holding company early in the second quarter leaving approximately 65 million of cash in the operating company we continue to remain confident in the growth of our business and its cash flow generating capabilities as a result of that as indicated in our press release we announced yet another 0 02 sequential increase in our regular quarterly dividend from 0 58 a share per quarter to 0 60 per quarter this represents the 27th

performance our corporate business which represents 67 of our total revenues in the quarter grew year over year by 11 2 which is better than the long term growth of our entire business which is targeted to be 10 however our net centric business has underperformed and declined by 8 from the first quarter of 2018 the impact of foreign currency which primarily impacts the net centric business was responsible for a significant portion of this decline on a constant currency basis our net centric business however did also decline by 3 from the first quarter of 2018 that was essentially flat sequentially our long term ebitda annual margin expansion guidance calls for approximately 200 basis points of margin expansion for the first quarter of 2019 we achieved year over year quarterly margin expansion of 120 basis points our quarterly cash flow as defined by ebitda minus capital expenditures minus principal payments on our capital leases grew by 16 2 from the first quarter of 2018 this is due to the excellent operating leverage of our business and we expect cash flow growth to continue at similar rates our revenue and ebitda guidance targets are meant to be multiyear not specifically quarterly or annual guidance for a specific short term period now i d like to turn the call back to tad for some additional details on the quarter tad weed chief financial officer thanks dave and again good morning to everyone and i d also like to thank and congratulate our entire cogent team for the results this quarter continued hard work during another very productive and busy quarter for the company some comments on corporate and net centric revenue we analyzed our revenues based upon network type which is on net off net and noncore and we also analyzed our revenues based upon customer type and we classify all of our customers into two types net centric customers and corporate customers our net centric customers buy large amounts of bandwidth from us in carrier neutral data centers and our corporate customers buy bandwidth from us in large multi tenant office buildings revenue from our corporate customers for the quarter grew sequentially by 2 6 to 90 2 million and grew year over year as dave said by 11 2 we had 47 257 corporate customer connections on the network at quarter end which was an annual increase of 20 6 over the first quarter of last year quarterly revenue from our net centric customers declined sequentially by 0 4 to 44 million and declined year over year by 7 6 on a constant currency basis our quarterly revenue from our net centric customers was flat sequentially and declined year over year again as dave said by 3 we had 35 265 net centric customer connections on our network at quarter end which was an increase of 1 5 over the first quarter of 2018 our net centric revenue growth experienced significantly more volatility than our corporate revenues due to the impact of foreign exchange also due to customer size and certain seasonal factors revenue and customer connections by network type our on net revenue was 97 2 million for the quarter which was a sequential quarterly increase of 1 9 and a year over year increase of 5 2 our on net customer connections growth accelerated this quarter and increased by 3 3 sequentially and 12 2 year over year we ended the quarter with 71 066 on net customer connections on our network in our 20 706 total on net multi tenant office buildings and carrier neutral data center buildings our off net revenue was 36 8 million for the quarter which was a sequential quarterly increase of 0 8 and a year over year increase of 1 9 our off net customer connections increased sequentially by 1 5 and 8 8 year over year and we ended the quarter serving 11 138 off net customer connections and over 6 640 off net buildings and these off net buildings are primarily in north america some comments on pricing consistent with historical trends the average price per megabit of our installed base decreased for the quarter however the average price per megabit for our new customer contracts was relatively stable the average price per megabit of our install base declined sequentially by 6 9 to 0 68 and declined by 24 4 from the first quarter of last year the average price per megabit for our new customer contracts for the quarter was relatively flat sequentially and relatively flat year over year and declined by 3 from both periods to 0 39 some comments on arpu our on net arpu and our off net arpu both decreased sequentially for the quarter our on net arpu which includes both corporate and net centric customers was 463 for the quarter which was a decrease of 0 8 our off net arpu which is comprised predominantly of corporate customers was 1 111 for the quarter which was a sequential decrease of 1 2 some comments on churn our on net churn rate improved during the quarter and our off net generate increased slightly our on net unit churn rate was less than 1 at 0 9 for the quarter which was an improvement from 1 last quarter and our off net churn rate was 1 1 this quarter a slight increase from 1 last quarter we offer discounts related to contract term to all of our corporate and net centric customers we also offer volume commitment discounts to our net centric customers during the quarter certain net centric customers took advantage of our volume contract term discounts and entered into long term contracts for over 2 300 customer connections which increased their revenue commitment to cogent by over 19 7 million some more detail on ebitda and ebitda as adjusted our ebitda and our ebitda as adjusted are both reconciled to our cash flow from operations and all of our quarterly earnings press releases seasonal factors that typically impact our sg a expenses and consequently our ebitda and ebitda as adjusted include the resetting of payroll taxes in the united states at the beginning of each year annual cost of living or cpi increases related to salaries the timing and level of our audit and tax services which are higher in the first quarter the timing and amount of gains in our equipment transactions and our annual sales meeting costs and benefit plan cost increases these seasonal factors typically increase our sg a expenses in our first quarter from our fourth quarter our quarterly ebitda was flat sequentially at 47 6 million really excellent results given our seasonality increases in sg a than we experienced in the quarter and our ebitda increased year over year by 3 5 million or 7 9 our quarterly ebitda margin decreased by 50 basis points sequentially to 35 5 but increased year over year by 120 basis points our ebitda as adjusted which includes gains in our equipment transactions our equipment gains were 536 000 for the quarter which was an increase from 117 000 for the first quarter of last year and 92 000 last quarter our quarterly ebitda as adjusted increased by 426 000 or by 0 9 sequentially to 48 1 million and increased year over year by 3 9 million or by 8 8 our quarterly ebitda as adjusted margin decreased sequentially by 20 basis points to 35 9 but increased 160 basis points year over year some comments on earnings per share our basic and diluted income per share was 0 20 for the quarter which was a 25 increase from 0 16 last quarter and a 33 increase from the first quarter of 2018 which was 0 15 some further details on foreign currency our revenue reported in u s dollars and earned outside of the united states was about 22 of our total revenues consistent with prior quarters about 17 of our revenues this quarter were based in europe and the remaining 5 of our international revenues were related to our canadian mexican asia pacific and latin american operations continued volatility in foreign exchange rates can materially impact our quarterly revenue results and our overall financial results the foreign exchange impact on our reported quarterly sequential revenue was a negative 135 000 and the year over year foreign exchange impact on our reported quarterly revenue was much more material and was 2 1 million our quarterly revenue growth rate on a constant currency basis were 1 7 sequentially and 5 8 year over year and the impact of foreign exchange primarily impacts our net centric revenues the average euro to u s dollar rate so far this quarter is 1 13 and the average canadian dollar exchange rate is 0 75 should these average foreign exchange rates remain at these levels for the remainder of our second quarter we estimate that the fx impact on our sequentially quarterly revenues for the second quarter will be a negative about 200 000 and the year over year foreign exchange impact will be a negative 1 5 million we believe that our revenue and customer base is not highly concentrated our top 25 customers represented less than 6 point 6 of our revenues this quarter on capex our capex was 13 3 million this quarter compared to 14 9 million for the first quarter of last year and 10 9 million for the fourth quarter of last year capital leases and capital lease payments our capital lease iru obligations are for long term dark fiber leases and typically have initial terms of 15 to 20 years or longer and often include multiple renewal options after the initial term our capital lease iru fiber lease obligations were 164 8 million at quarter end and at quarter end we had iru contracts with a total of 240 different dark fiber suppliers our capital lease principal payments under these irus were 3 million for the quarter and if you combine capital lease payments with our capital expenditures that total was 16 3 million this quarter compared to 13 1 million in the fourth quarter and 17 2 million for the first quarter of last year at the end of the quarter our cash and cash equivalents totaled 259 1 million and for the quarter our cash decreased by 17 million as a result of returning 38 5 million of capital to our stakeholders during the quarter we paid 26 6 million for our regular quarterly dividend payment and 12 million was spent on a semi annual interest payment on our debt obligation our quarterly operating cash flow this quarter was 28 6 million some comments on ratios and bad debt our total gross debt at par which includes capital leases was 811 3 million at quarter end and our net debt was 552 2 million our total gross debt to trailing last 12 months ebitda as adjusted ratio was 4 28 at quarter end and our net debt ratio was 2 92 our bad debt expense improved this quarter and was only 0 5 of our revenues for the quarter and our day sales also improved and was only 23 days at quarter end and again i want to thank and recognize our worldwide billing and collection team members for continuing to do a fantastic job in serving and collecting from all of our customers and with that i will turn the call back to dave dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer hey thanks tad a few comments on the scope and scale of our network at the end of the quarter we had over 949 million square feet of multi tenant office space connected directly to our network in north america our network consists of over 33 600 metro fiber miles and 57 400 intercity route miles of fiber the cogent network remains the most interconnected network in the world and we connect directly to over 6 660 networks less than 30 of these are settlement free peers and the remaining 6 630 networks are cogent customers purchasing transit services from us we are currently utilizing approximately 28 of the linked capacity in our network we routinely augment capacity as portions of our network reach higher utilization rates to maintain these aggregate low utilization rates for the quarter we achieved sequential traffic growth of 7 over the fourth quarter of 2018 and 43 over the full year period from 2018 we operate 52 cogent data centers with 587 000 square feet of raised floor space and we re today utilizing approximately 32 of that data center capacity our rep turnover rate was 5 1 in the quarter which is better than our long term average rep turnover rate of 5 7 our quarterly sales rep productivity was 5 1 per full time equivalent rep per month the productivity rate that is consistent with our long term average of 5 1 install orders per full time equivalent rep per month we ended the quarter with over 500 reps selling our service 501 a significant increase from the 487 reps that we had at the end of 2018 and this is the largest our sales force has been in our history cogent remains the low cost provider of internet transit services and our value proposition remained unmatched in the industry our business remains completely focused on the internet ip connectivity and data center colocation services which all are necessary utilities for of our customers our multi year constant currency long term growth target of 10 and our long term ebitda margin expansion of approximately 200 basis points should be met over the next several years our board of directors has approved yet another increase on our regular quarterly dividend of 0 02 a share increasing our quarterly dividend to 0 60 our dividend increase continues to demonstrate the optimism we have and the strength of our business the underlying growth and the improving cash flow capabilities in a sector that continues to see most of our competitors experiencing declining revenues and declining margins we will be opportunistic about the use of our balance sheet we ll be opportunistic about the timing and purchase of common stock at quarter s end we still had 34 9 million remaining under our current buyback authorization which continues to year end we remain committed to returning increasing amounts of capital to our shareholders on a regular basis with that i d like to open it up for questions questions answers operator and our first question comes from philip cusick with j p morgan please proceed philip cusick j p morgan analyst hey guys thanks so dave two if i can first can you expand on what sounds like pressure on the net centric side and then second full time and total reps are running at new highs and up a lot and productivity continues lower i recognize there s a relationship here but is there an intention to trend lower productivity per rep that we should be thinking about thanks dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer sure hey thanks phil for the questions so first of all on net centric our business has experienced a slowdown in traffic several years ago due to violations of net neutrality and now traffic has rebounded to close to historical growth rates however the majority of that incremental traffic that 43 year over year growth has come from our largest customers which get the lowest pricing so while the average price per megabit continues to decline at rates consistent with our long term averages of about 23 it was 24 4 this quarter the volume weighted decline has been greater resulting in flat sequential revenues on a constant currency basis and a 3 year over year decline in light of traffic growth we expect to see a more normalized pattern of traffic growth from a broader base of customers and with that we believe that our net centric revenue growth will return to its historical averages which are about 9 5 year over year as opposed to the 3 decline that we had this quarter obviously the corporate business continues to perform strongly and has really been unimpacted by these trends now to the full time equivalent rep and total rep size and productivity question two points first of all we are committed to increasing the size of our sales force at between 7 and 10 per year we achieved that last year we expect to achieve that this year in the quarter we increased the number of total reps by 14 but actually our full time equivalent reps went up by 28 therefore meaning a lot of reps that were hired toward the end of last year reached their third month and are now counted as full time equivalents as we have commented on in the past rep productivity actually consistently increases from month one to about month 30 when it plateaus so the decline in rep productivity was really as a result of the average tenure of the reps coming down due to the fact that we have 28 reps that are in their fourth or fifth month not fully productive yet but still counted in the base we achieved aggregate productivity in line with our long term average it is correct that this declined from the last several quarters but it s because of the step function increase in the number of ftes in the quarter we expect that to normalize over the course of the year we believe the training programs market segmentation and management initiatives that we put in place will allow our rep productivity over time to continue to trend up we also in the quarter lost some additional time we had our annual sales meeting normally that meeting is three days in length this year it was actually expanded to eight days to give us greater ability to train reps and for our corporate reps that is highly impactful because their call volume and just number of days in the office is directly proportional to their selling so we effectively lost an additional half a week of selling in the quarter which also had a drag on rep productivity because it s only based on installed orders i think you ll see a rebound in the next quarter philip cusick j p morgan analyst can i expand that a little bit the growth in reps is that mostly corporate or is the net centric rep growth pretty strong as well dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer so there is growth in both segments but we re roughly 74 5 of corporate and about 25 5 netcentric so the aggregate number of reps that increased are far more corporate than netcentric and that ratio has been relatively consistent philip cusick j p morgan analyst and is your your assumption of netcentric sort of broadening of traffic growth is that reliant on the expansion of reps there or is there something else going on that your other customers will start ramping up dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer it s not really dependent on number of customers it s really dependent on change in traffic patterns so what we saw is some of our largest customers as their direct connect agreements that they were forced to sign under the net neutrality violations have begun to lapse they have shifted more of that traffic back to transit and much of that has come to cogent also we have seen a trend in the past few years where 10 or so large content companies are growing much faster than the average base of content companies we think those trends are somewhat transitory our net centric sales force is about 130 or so reps spread out around the world and the fact that we sell to 6 630 access network shows you how broad their reach is and we sold to over 4 200 content companies so i don t think it s necessarily a result of needing more reps it s really that those smaller customers just need to achieve the same kinds of traffic growth rates as the largest customers are doing philip cusick j p morgan analyst thanks dave see you in a couple weeks dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer ok phil thanks operator thank you and our next question comes from walter piecyk with btig please proceed walter piecyk btig analyst thanks hey dave you just mentioned that your ftes full time employees increased by 28 reps as the explanation for that drop in productivity in q1 of 2017 they rose by 32 and in q1 of 2016 they rose by 22 and in those quarters your productivity remained flat at 6 1 versus 6 1 in the prior quarter and at 6 3 versus 6 3 in the prior quarter so what was how does that play a role in this quarter as opposed to not playing a role with similar circumstances in those two years dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer so it is just an arithmetic fact that whenever you hire new reps those reps increase in productivity for a much longer period than we count them as full time equivalents and the reason for the full time equivalency cutoff is that is the period of time in which cogent is paying a guaranteed commission on the variable portion of the rep s compensation at the end of that period that bridge or that guaranteed variable goes away and the rep is just left with their base salary and then the variable component is totally driven by their performance and we do see that performance increasing in terms walter piecyk btig analyst but that has not been a factor in the past three years dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer no i heard you on the in the past periods maybe some of the training programs that we have rolled out had a bigger impact there s also just some lumpiness in sales we did lose an additional four days of selling time this quarter which does impact the corporate reps it doesn t really impact the net centric reps very much but that did have an impact as well and some of it s just the lumpiness i can t account for the difference in the past years what i can tell you is that the long term trend line in our rep productivity has continued to improve it is not a perfect straight line and the step back that we had this quarter was really just to the long term average and as i stated earlier i fully expect that rep productivity to rebound and continue at above historical rates walter piecyk btig analyst got it so let s approach this from a different angle then if you look at the sequential growth in your corporate business we go back to the improvements that were made in the sales force back in 2014 i mean it wasn t down dramatically this quarter but this is the lowest sequential growth you put up in corporate since 2013 so is your expectation that now you have these 28 new full time employees that s going to ramp but you can get your sequentials back to 2 7 or at least sustained at a 2 7 2 8 range going forward dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer so the answer is yes we should continue to see corporate growth be particularly strong and to your point of the historical inflection in corporate growth much of that came from the introduction of our vpls product which we ve spoken about on a number of occasions and the fact that roughly 25 of our corporate sales are for vpn services either vpls or sd wan and that will continue we feel very comfortable that we should be able to achieve consistent corporate growth in that 11 12 13 range and as i stated we did lose an additional four days of selling time in the quarter which is not insignificant in a highly transaction driven model where a number of outbound calls is directly correlated to sales and installs in that quarter walter piecyk btig analyst got it and then just one last one on netcentric again you mentioned this 9 target i mean you haven t topped 9 in net centric since 2013 so when you define this as a long term growth rate i mean which years are you talking about and when what type of time line can we expect it to ever get back to that type of growth rate because it just i mean is it like five years now dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer and that s a fair point i commented on it extensively on the last call and it was part of the reason why we took the aggregate target down for our long term growth rate when we look at netcentric there are really two drivers the first driver is traffic growth and again our long term traffic growth is approximately 50 it had decelerated to the low 20s it s back at 43 that s an important prerequisite to be able to get our net centric revenue growth to accelerate the second thing is the average price per megabit and while the average price per connection sold is very similar what we have seen though is most of the growth coming from our largest customers therefore the effective price per megabit has declined much more rapidly over the past 12 to 18 months as those direct connections shift back to using transit as a preferred way to connect to the internet we think that is a transitory phenomena those contracts were between three and five years in term they are lapsing at this point all of our counterparty peers are honoring net neutrality rules with the exception of deutsche telekom which we ve commented on historically and we do expect walter piecyk btig analyst have you given up the fight there because you didn t book any net neutrality fees this quarter dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer well we didn t have to spend anything it doesn t mean we gave up but we have a pending case still in front of the german appeals court it s a 3 judge tribunal and it is a very lengthy process if you think the wheels are just just turns slow in the u s they turn slower in the eu so this is going to be a protractive fight and listen we re not happy that we re doing it on their turf but that s where walter piecyk btig analyst but i mean dave i just think investors will be more interested in knowing when it s not going to or when it s going to stop declining as opposed to talking about getting to a 9 number that you haven t hit in five years dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer well then let me couch it a different way the rate of decline improved it became less negative this quarter than it was the previous quarter so there isn t an inflection the second derivative is positive and things are improving but i do believe they will improve through getting to flat and actually get to a point of positive revenue growth walter piecyk btig analyst got it thank you dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer thanks walt operator thank you and our next question comes from matthew niknam with deutsche bank please proceed matthew niknam deutsche bank analyst hey dave thank you for taking the questions just two if i could one on gross margin so pretty big improvement year on year can you talk about what drove this and the sequential decline in network operation expense this quarter just wondering if this is sort of recurring or if there any onetimers in the quarter and then secondly on shareholder returns you talked about having access to the builder basket with leverage below the gross leverage below the four and a quarter is that sort of a precursor or should we expect an uptick in terms of the rate of dividend growth or total shareholder return as a result dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer yes so first of all two very good questions thanks matt in terms of gross margin we have had consistent long term improvement over the past couple of years it s averaged about 100 basis points a year it was steeper this year i think that is in part because of the operating leverage in our business and the fact that roughly three fourth of all sales are on net which carry on 100 gross margin contribution in terms of the sequential improvement we do have certain maintenance fees that are paid some quarterly some semi annual and some annually we did have an annual fee that hit last quarter so that was part of the sequential but that also hit the year before as well in general investors should expect for the next several years on average about a 100 basis points a year of gross margin improvement due to the operating leverage of the business with regard to shareholder returns we are absolutely committed to using our balance sheet effectively we have reduced our leverage below the indenture test to be able to move all of the available builder basket 88 million to the holding company which we ll do bringing cash then at the holding company to 194 million and we have under our indentures probably about another 150 million of borrowing capacity at the operating company level and no restriction on borrowing at the holding company level we will explore the debt market and possibly put additional debt on at the operating company level based on current market conditions seeming to be fairly favorable we don t have an exact timing for that but it is something that we are going to explore and then with regard to now returning that 194 million to shareholders we are very committed to growing our dividend 27 consecutive quarters of sequential growth i think proved that the fact that our dividend grew at nearly 16 year over year and we interjected opportunistically buybacks i think if we see a period of market volatility you ll see us reenter the market and use our buybacks if we are in a prolonged period of no market volatility i think the board will consider using that excess cash in bigger dividends but i don t think that decision has been yet made and we re going to be patient in our long term return but i think what investors should expect is we will continue to increase the amount of cash we return to them and we ve been prudent about not over levering we ve been measured in the pacing of that return and i think you should expect that going forward matthew niknam deutsche bank analyst thanks dave and if i could just follow up real quick on the maintenance fee that you talked about that was present in 4q was seemingly not present in 1q can you quantify that amount if it s meaningful dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer it was not insignificant that particular contract is covered by an nda but it was meaningful enough that it showed up in the numbers i ll just leave it at that matthew niknam deutsche bank analyst ok thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from tim horan with oppenheimer please proceed tim horan oppenheimer analyst thanks dave sort of pounding on netcentric here but you sound very confident on growth kind of coming back and your peers or the industry is talking about better volume growth they re seeing like this year or this quarter the cable industry s a lot more over the top video kind of occurring but it sounds like you think you were going to get or you re starting to see growth coming from other locations but can you just give us a little bit of color on maybe the timing when you might see a little bit more diversification on the traffic growth or maybe a lot of it just coming even from the largest companies and related to that how much can these large net centric customers save by using you for transit instead of going direct connected to carriers roughly dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer yeah so two very different questions first of all clearly the aggregate growth in traffic not only that we are seeing but the rest of the industry is seeing is a leading indicator to an improvement in the net centric market and we have historically grown at about double the market rate and that s what we re doing today and i think it s a clear indication we are gaining market share i do think there is a broadening of applications that are very bandwidth intensive and some of these are earlier stage some of them being more augmented reality gaming type applications that will diversify growth away from some of the biggest names in video distribution but they remain strong as well and we expect growth to come from both segments we also benefit from the fact that we have 6 630 access networks buying from us so they re kind of the counterparty to that traffic growth meaning their customers are pulling down more content we don t pick winners and losers we sell to everyone we have a very transparent pricing model in terms of discounts to competitors and volume and term discounts we think this simplicity has helped us when our customers confidence and shows that we continue to gain market share so for all of those reasons i feel pretty confident that we are going to see a broadening of base and what i don t have perfect visibility to is how might direct connect still exists and how much can be converted back now to the question of savings we have had some customer who have built their own networks for their own proprietary needs usually they will link their own data centers and transfer information between those centers we ve also had customers who have previously built networks and abandoned those networks using transit as a lower cost more flexible technology i actually met with a very large content producing company that had build out a global network and pointed out to them that if they had just used cogent with our volume discounting they can literally be saving hundreds of millions of dollars in capital expenditures per year by just using the efficiency of our network now they may have other requirements that i m not seeing but just on their network there would be massive savings some of these companies view it as strategic and that s their decision and as long as their models remain profitable enough to allow them to be not efficient in the purchase of bandwidth so be it but we are convinced that for every net centric customer we provide the very best cost alternative and the scale and cost structure of our network is far better than trying to build it yourself tim horan oppenheimer analyst and then just a follow up on pricing your new sales price now has been kind of flat for a year or a little bit longer basically should that indicate better revenue growth going forward because your discount on the average price to the new sales price is kind of you know relatively low at this point dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer i do think that is one of the leading indicators that are helping us get comfortable with the idea that net centric revenue growth will resume tim horan oppenheimer analyst and any idea why the new sales price has been relatively flat here and is that kind of remaining the case do you think for the next couple of quarters dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer well i think it s that precursor of broadening the base so again the big guys have already bought they re filling up the pipes that they have and we are going out and seeding a next generation of business models that are buying lots of small ports and what has always been a key to our net centric growth is when one or more of those newer businesses become the next dominant traffic generator tim horan oppenheimer analyst thank you very much dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer thanks operator thank you and our next question comes from nick del deo with moffettnathanson please proceed nick del deo moffettnathanson analyst hey good morning you know off net growth has decelerated pretty materially over the last several quarters to what degree is that tied to lower prices from your off net vendors versus the rate of vpn sales versus other factors dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer hey nick i would say it s two things one average contract length continuing to increase both for on net and off net but for off net it s much more a result of lower loop prices so we today from 90 different vendors have fiber off net availability in 1 030 000 buildings that is a big footprint and in most of those cases we re actually saying two alternatives usually an incumbent and some competitive carrier and in many cases that s the cable provider as they ve aggressively overbuilt in large part to facilitate 5g and small cell deployment so with that fiber plant so whether it s at t with project vip or verizon with its new 5g overbuild not fios but their own fiber buildout and then whether it s spectrum or comcast we ve seen very aggressive fiber building which has driven down our price for loops our off net business is a derivative of our on net corporate business it all starts with an on net corporate sale and then if the customer needs us in multiple locations either for vpn or internet access or both then we get the very best loop price that we can and we ve seen those loop prices falling fairly precipitously and we re passing a lot of that savings on to our customers actually the loop prices are falling faster than our arpu is falling in large part because a lot of our customers are under long term contracts and won t be able to avail themselves of those lower prices till their initial term expires nick del deo moffettnathanson analyst got it and then turning to sd wan recognizing that it s still early days in that product can you talk about the traction you re getting with customers anything you ve learned about the sales process or sticking points dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer yes so i think three points first of all i would acknowledge sd wan sales for us and for other vendors have movably been slower than we would have been initially expected two i think sd wan has paralyzed the mpls market and is really created a customer dynamic where no customer will expand or modify their mpls network so i think it s the third point which is most of our sd wan discussions have actually resulted an incremental vpls sales for cogent and that is because when you outline the pluses and minuses of each of the technologies the vpls solution is more mature it more closely fits the customer requirement so we repeatedly have discussions with customers who want to move off of mpls to an sd wan product we outline our sd wan offering we compare it to competitors and we compare it to our vpls and increasingly what we have seen is the customers continuing to choose the vpls product even though they came in asking for sd wan they walked out the door with vpls nick del deo moffettnathanson analyst got it that s interesting thanks for the color dave dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer ok thanks nick operator thank you and our next question comes from colby synesael with cowen and company please proceed colby synesael cowen and company analyst great thank you i guess two questions one just sticking on off net historically going back many years ago that was thought to be a t1 oriented business where you d effectively purchase t1s from the verizons and at ts of this world and sell them to your customers and i know that over last year s that the conversation has shifted more to fiber oriented solutions but i m curious how much of off net revenue corporate off net revenue at this point is coming from t1s and how much of that slowdown in growth that we ve seen the last several quarters might actually be a function of churn and more specifically t1 churn and then secondly equipment gains again something we ve talked about for many years now i think there was a time where we thought that was going to slow and we seeing it kind of come back and it ebbs and flows each quarter where are your expectations for equipment sales in 2019 and what is the updated view on how that looks over the next few years dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer sure let me take the t1 that was a super easy question we have 0 t1s and have had 0 t1s t3s or any tdm based off net product for three years 100 of our off net sales are fiber based no coax no fixed wireless no adsl only fiber and only ethernet so it means that cogent can serve 55 of the business locations in north america 10 on net for footprint 45 from the 90 different vendors that we can buy from and it also means 45 of locations are no bid for cogent so we have no churn coming from tdm or t1 services and have not for our 3 5 years since we ve been able to phase all those out we have seen significant price declines however on those ethernet based fiber delivered services and the competitive tension is what s driving down cost we also had previously been willing to sell lower speeds than 100 mb and now virtually all of our off net sales are 100 mb or greater via fiber we still have some limited 50 mb services but increasingly we re trying to steer our customers to 100 mb off net as a minimum product and then to the equipment sale question colby we have significant inventory of gear that we re constantly rotating out of our network that is not efficient and has been replaced by newer technology however there s not always buyers available for it it s not our primary business we don t recognize those sales and revenue but because there is usually no basis in that equipment those gains have to be reflected in our reporting of cash flow and ebitda but not in revenue i would suspect equipment sales for this year will be similar to last year i think the uptick that we experienced this quarter was a bit of a one off in that we were able to sell some gear that we just found a customer for but it s not something that we can predict with any kind of certainty colby synesael cowen and company analyst great thank you dave operator thank you and our next question comes from michael rollins with citi please proceed michael rollins citi analyst hi good morning dave i was wondering if you could unpack a bit the unit volume you had and the revenue by the different products that you re selling between your bandwidth and some of the additional products like the vpn the data center and then as you move forward how are you thinking about product mix and your interest in additional products to the menu dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer sure so i ll start with the second question first which is one that new hires always ask when are we going to sell something new and the answer to that is probably not i think our key success and i think it s even more accentuated today vis a vis our competitors than it ever has been is the simplicity off of our product portfolio and we expect that to continue so there s really three product categories some form of internet access which is about 81 82 of revenues some flavor of vpn which is either sd wan or vpls which in total revenues is generally about 17 of revenues and then finally our colocation space and power which is traditionally a couple of percent of revenues now to the bandwidth products for corporate customers the flagship or the standard product has been and continues to be a 100 mb connection although we are increasingly selling either fractional gigs or full gig interfaces in corporate buildings as most corporate customers in their land refresh cycle are able to now accept a full gig handoff ironically we deliver to the customer a fiber gig interface but we rate limit it down and convert it to copper because that s what the customer could take in the handoff i do think over the next several years the gigabit product for corporate customers will become the de facto standard i do think eventually it ll be priced at identical prices to the fast e product it s not there today we do charge a premium for it but i think as it becomes the standard it will become our product at the same price points and ironically it will actually improve our cost of delivery because we don t have to buy that piece of equipment it s about 300 that we place in the customer s suite to convert it from fiber to copper we can do a direct fiber handoff and it eliminates one point of failure as well and it will also help us lower our installation cost for customers because traditionally we charge the customer for that piece of customer prem equipment michael rollins citi analyst and just following up on the corporate point in the past you talked about the low utilization of bits by the corporate customers on that 100 mb connection can you help us visualize where the growth of that corporate traffic is growing and what you re seeing trend line wise dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer sure actually this last quarter our average corporate growth or traffic utilization at peak was about 14 7 of those connections and part of the reason it s drifted down a little bit is because some customers are taking gigabit connections even though they don t need them and i think where that traffic is going is really two primary drivers as businesses move computing off site into remote location or cloud that is requiring more bandwidth and a greater percentage utilization of the port the second is as businesses migrate software away from licensed premise based software to saas that also requires more bandwidth but remember most business users are only in their offices 40 50 hours a week so while i m giving you the peak number if you look at corporate utilization on an average basis it s a fraction of 1 on a 24 7 basis which is an extremely different use pattern than a net centric customer that tends to utilize its ports at 70 or 80 but 24 7 michael rollins citi analyst thank you dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer thanks operator thank you and our next question comes from mike mccormack with guggenheim partners please proceed mike mccormack guggenheim securities analyst hey guys thanks i guess just one thing on the margin side if you could just talk about the puts and takes that you mentioned for q1 obviously there s some seasonality there maybe the magnitude as you step into 2q or the step down in cost if you can sort of try to frame that and then secondly i know dave you mentioned cable with respect to the sort of enabling 5g and access cost coming down what about cable as far as a threat on the corporate customer side for you guys are you seeing anything sort of looming on that front dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer yeah sure mike two different questions so first of all on the margin side we in this quarter experienced a couple of extra q1 experienced a couple of significant extra sg a costs the first is our sales meeting this year it was longer and actually ran over 1 million which is not insignificant at a company of cogent s scale we also have the payroll reset and healthcare generally goes up as well as cola increases pass through in the first quarter our sg a as a percentage of revenue went from about 22 to about 24 of revenue sequentially you should expect it to drift down over the course of the year in terms of gross margin just the three fourth of all sales are on net that will continue to drive improved gross margin and that s how we get to the roughly 200 basis points a year roughly half of it coming from gross margin uplift half of it coming from sg a now to your cable competition question in off net locations cable competition is very real however we don t go out to sell in that location the only time we go to that location is when we have a customer that has an on net location with us we don t see cable having the on net footprint in multi tenant skyscrapers or the scale that we re in in central business districts they haven t prewired the billings they haven t built out a full distribution system making installation lengthy and also expensive also for multi site customers cable footprints can be somewhat limited and our footprint being global just gives us some real advantages mike mccormack guggenheim securities analyst great thanks guys dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer hey thanks mike operator thank you and our next question comes from michael funk with bank of america please proceed michael funk bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey good morning dave how you doin dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer hey great mike good to hear from you it s been a while michael funk bank of america merrill lynch analyst yeah yeah i m always here you know quickly just back to the net centric growth i appreciate your optimism on turning the revenue growth trend i heard your comments about thinking that maybe some of the traffic losers might actually pick up some traffic growth and the help you could be getting there really it relates to the return of capital though given that i guess continued return of capital seems to be predicated on turning the net centric revenue growth higher right given the high margin aspect of that business i m just wondering to what degree return of capital in the future is predicated on getting back to that 10 plus growth and how much you the board consider maybe a suboptimal outcome when thinking about returning capital not wanting to be in the box of hitting up against the leverage targets given that you re already paying out more than 100 of your free cash flow with the dividend and certainly your valuation at this point is probably solving i guess for the dividend yield and some of the examples we ve seen in the rlec space where similarly management teams are optimistic about turning the top line it just didn t happen and ended up in a box where the payout became sustainable so i guess the question is do you even open to consideration that revenue may not get back to where you want it to be and does that inform your decision about incremental returns of capital or keeping that cash in the balance sheet dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer sure a very good question mike so a couple of points first of all we have grown our dividend throughout the period in which netcentric has underperformed to walt s point it s been five years since netcentric has performed well and during that 5 year period we have 20 consecutive increases to our dividend second we are very different than an rlec we do not have an aggregate business that s in decline our top line growth continues strong our addressable markets have plenty of additional opportunity available to us and we continue to gain market share in those markets the products we sell are in demand it is not like residential landline services that are being eliminated and substituted away with broadband or with a mobile connection so i think the board has taken a very measured approach we ve had calls from investors to increase the pacing at which we are increasing our dividend in fact our cash flow grew year over year 16 2 and our dividend only grew 15 8 so we acknowledge that we are using the balance sheet efficiently but we remain far less levered than any other company in our sector and with our top line growth even with underperformance in the net centric business so i think the rate of dividend growth that we have now should continue and is not predicated on a belief that we have a rapid turn in net centric revenue if we see that net centric revenue starting to inflect faster and again as i answered earlier the rate of decline has slowed it is not yet positive but it is improving as it improves that gives us further ability to increase their pacing of our revenue growth and therefore the pacing of our growth in dividend but i think we have demonstrated in a tough pricing environment a tough macro environment for our sector our ability to consistently grow aggregate revenues and expand cash flow our cash flow is growing at like 20 per year roughly over the past several years and with that having dividend growth the way we have delivered is in no way putting our balance sheet at risk or putting investors in any area where they would have to assume that they would be susceptible to dividend elimination listen if you ve got negative top line growth you can t cost cut your way to a fix you have to eventually cut your dividend and that may not be enough to save the business we don t have that problem what you re focused on is the incremental benefit from one third of our business growing at a faster rate but the underlying strength of our cash flow growth is unmuted michael funk bank of america merrill lynch analyst even for just the time today dave maybe one more if i could you mentioned that the data center is 30 occupied i get that maybe that it s strategic for a portion of the business but seemingly maybe underutilized assets there very strong valuations we re seeing in data center sales recently cap rates anywhere from 4 to 8 in the sales have you considered giving any kind of thought to monetizing that asset maybe to strengthen the balance sheet even more dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer you know we have looked at that mike but two things first of all they re completely integrated to the cogent network meaning we typically have sales offices there we have our hubs co located so they serve multiple functions could they be segregated sure but it would take some work and the second you actually just criticized me for trading at too high of a multiple and the reality is my multiple is comparable to many of the data centers but actually on a cash flow and growth adjusted cash flow multiple we trade at a significant discount to the data centers michael funk bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thank you again dave operator thank you and our next question comes from brett feldman please proceed brett feldman chief executive officer thanks for squeezing me in so as you were noting before your outlook for improved net centric growth is based not just on an improvement in the rate of growth of traffic as new applications come to the internet but that it s a broader base and so maybe for context the improvement in traffic growth you have seen recently it seems like that s been predominantly driven by video but if it s more nuanced that context would be helpful and then second what are some of these new uses that you think are going to drive faster growth in data traffic and what gives you confidence that the sources of those are going to be different than the tech heavyweight that i suspect are behind the growth you ve seen recently thanks dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer sure thanks brett for the questions so first of all the internet remains a very dynamic ecosystem and every time there s a belief that all the things that people are going to use are out there someone comes up with a new model and we have traditionally been the service provider of choice for start ups and smaller companies that experiment secondly today and probably for the foreseeable future most growth is going to continue to come from linear video substitution moving to over the top that will continue to drive growth and that business has been dominated by a handful of companies and i think that s probably going to continue there may be some broadening of that base we re seeing for example disney launch its own product we re seeing new models like qui vid come out yeah there is an attempt to have a broader set of consumer choices and packages and i think that will be helpful but i think when we think about new business models it will be things that are probably more interactive meaning suited only to the internet you know while massive online multiplayer gaming remains a significant subset of the market it is still not yet completely mainstream also virtual reality and augmented reality products are i think in their infancy and if i was smart enough to pick which business would be the winner i wouldn t be on this call i d be investing in that company and sitting on a beach somewhere but what i do know is consumers are fickle the battle is for eyeball time and there will be new products coming out that are more immersive than those that we have today more flexible and yes we will someday reach saturation of internet traffic growth but i think we have a long way to go and it s not clear to cogent that those large fang type names are the only innovators on the internet now they may buy up those innovators but right now there s a broad base of new models being tried out brett feldman chief executive officer thanks for the time dave dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer and thanks operator thank you and our next question comes from with brandon nispel keybanc capital market please proceed brandon nispel keybanc capital markets analyst ok great real quick just want to touch on the maintenance fee again can you maybe remind us when it hit last year so we can sort of rightsize our model from a sequential impact to gross margins and then maybe for tad was there any impact from the lease accounting standard to the income statement or was it just a balance sheet presentation change thanks tad weed chief financial officer sure on the new lease accounting standard that we had to adopt this quarter and record that january 1st we did not retroactively adjust our financials and there is no income statement impact at all the accounting for these expense is identical this quarter as it has been historically it s purely a balance sheet transaction and the total aggregate present value of the leases that we had to record which were largely related to our facilities was 97 million but it s purely a balance sheet transaction dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer and then brandon in terms of the maintenance fee while i didn t disclosed the exact amount you know it is material you know we do have these quarterly semi annual and annual ones and there are a very few monthly ones and it was just material enough that it did impact the sequential but i think kind of on a recurring model basis you should expect some additional maintenance fees in the fourth quarter of this year but in aggregate we expect it to lever about 100 basis points of gross margin expansion per year for the next several years operator ok thank you and with that this concludes our q a session for today i would like to turn the call back over to dave schaeffer for closing remarks dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer well i ll keep it short because we

sequential basis our traffic grew by 7 over the fourth quarter of 2018 during the first quarter we returned 26 6 million to our shareholders through our regular dividend we did not purchase any stock

number of historical metrics that give investors i think a great deal of insight into our business now for some additional clarity on our performance our corporate business which represents 67 of our total revenues in the quarter grew year over year by 11 2 which is better than the long term growth of our entire business which is targeted to be 10 however our net centric business has underperformed and declined by 8 from the first quarter of 2018 the impact of foreign currency which primarily impacts the net centric business was responsible for a significant portion of this decline on a constant currency basis our net centric business however did also decline by 3 from the first quarter of 2018 that was essentially flat sequentially our long term ebitda annual margin expansion guidance calls for approximately 200 basis points of margin expansion for the first quarter of 2019 we achieved year over year quarterly margin expansion of 120 basis points our quarterly cash flow as defined by ebitda minus capital expenditures minus principal payments on our capital leases grew by 16 2 from the first quarter of 2018 this is due to the excellent operating leverage of our business and we expect cash flow growth to continue at similar rates our revenue and ebitda guidance targets are meant to be multiyear not specifically quarterly or annual guidance for a specific short term period now i d like to turn the call back to tad for some additional details on the quarter tad weed chief financial officer thanks dave and again good morning to everyone and i d also like to thank and congratulate our entire cogent team for the results this quarter continued hard work during another very productive and busy quarter for the company some comments on corporate and net centric revenue we analyzed our revenues based upon network type which is on net off net and noncore and we also analyzed our revenues based upon customer type and we classify all of our customers into two types net centric customers and corporate customers our net centric customers buy large amounts of bandwidth from us in carrier neutral data centers and our corporate customers buy bandwidth from us in large multi tenant office buildings revenue from our corporate customers for the quarter grew sequentially by 2 6 to 90 2 million and grew year over year as dave said by 11 2 we had 47 257 corporate customer connections on the network at quarter end which was an annual increase of 20 6 over the first quarter of last year quarterly revenue from our net centric customers declined sequentially by 0 4 to 44 million and declined year over year by 7 6 on a constant currency basis our quarterly revenue from our net centric customers was flat sequentially and declined year over year again as dave said by 3 we had 35 265 net centric customer connections on our network at quarter end which was an increase of 1 5 over the first quarter of 2018 our net centric revenue growth experienced significantly more volatility than our corporate revenues due to the impact of foreign exchange also due to customer size and certain seasonal factors revenue and customer connections by network type our on net revenue was 97 2 million for the quarter which was a sequential quarterly increase of 1 9 and a year over year increase of 5 2 our on net customer connections growth accelerated this quarter and increased by 3 3 sequentially and 12 2 year over year we ended the quarter with 71 066 on net customer connections on our network in our 20 706 total on net multi tenant office buildings and carrier neutral data center buildings our off net revenue was 36 8 million for the quarter which was a sequential quarterly increase of 0 8 and a year over year increase of 1 9 our off net customer connections increased sequentially by 1 5 and 8 8 year over year and we ended the quarter serving 11 138 off net customer connections and over 6 640 off net buildings and these off net buildings are primarily in north america some comments on pricing consistent with historical trends the average price per megabit of our installed base decreased for the quarter however the average price per megabit for our new customer contracts was relatively stable the average price per megabit of our install base declined sequentially by 6 9 to 0 68 and declined by 24 4 from the first quarter of last year the average price per megabit for our new customer contracts for the quarter was relatively flat sequentially and relatively flat year over year and declined by 3 from both periods to 0 39 some comments on arpu our on net arpu and our off net arpu both decreased sequentially for the quarter our on net arpu which includes both corporate and net centric customers was 463 for the quarter which was a decrease of 0 8 our off net arpu which is comprised predominantly of corporate customers was 1 111 for the quarter which was a sequential decrease of 1 2 some comments on churn our on net churn rate improved during the quarter and our off net generate increased slightly our on net unit churn rate was less than 1 at 0 9 for the quarter which was an improvement from 1 last quarter and our off net churn rate was 1 1 this quarter a slight increase from 1 last quarter we offer discounts related to contract term to all of our corporate and net centric customers we also offer volume commitment discounts to our net centric customers during the quarter certain net centric customers took advantage of our volume contract term discounts and entered into long term contracts for over 2 300 customer connections which increased their revenue commitment to cogent by over 19 7 million some more detail on ebitda and ebitda as adjusted our ebitda and our ebitda as adjusted are both reconciled to our cash flow from operations and all of our quarterly earnings press releases seasonal factors that typically impact our sg a expenses and consequently our ebitda and ebitda as adjusted include the resetting of payroll taxes in the united states at the beginning of each year annual cost of living or cpi increases related to salaries the timing and level of our audit and tax services which are higher in the first quarter the timing and amount of gains in our equipment transactions and our annual sales meeting costs and benefit plan cost increases these seasonal factors typically increase our sg a expenses in our first quarter from our fourth quarter our quarterly ebitda was flat sequentially at 47 6 million really excellent results given our seasonality increases in sg a than we experienced in the quarter and our ebitda increased year over year by 3 5 million or 7 9 our quarterly ebitda margin decreased by 50 basis points sequentially to 35 5 but increased year over year by 120 basis points our ebitda as adjusted which includes gains in our equipment transactions our equipment gains were 536 000 for the quarter which was an increase from 117 000 for the first quarter of last year and 92 000 last quarter our quarterly ebitda as adjusted increased by 426 000 or by 0 9 sequentially to 48 1 million and increased year over year by 3 9 million or by 8 8 our quarterly ebitda as adjusted margin decreased sequentially by 20 basis points to 35 9 but increased 160 basis points year over year some comments on earnings per share our basic and diluted income per share was 0 20 for the quarter which was a 25 increase from 0 16 last quarter and a 33 increase from the first quarter of 2018 which was 0 15 some further details on foreign currency our revenue reported in u s dollars and earned outside of the united states was about 22 of our total revenues consistent with prior quarters about 17 of our revenues this quarter were based in europe and the remaining 5 of our international revenues were related to our canadian mexican asia pacific and latin american operations continued volatility in foreign exchange rates can materially impact our quarterly revenue results and our overall financial results the foreign exchange impact on our reported quarterly sequential revenue was a negative 135 000 and the year over year foreign exchange impact on our reported quarterly revenue was much more material and was 2 1 million our quarterly revenue growth rate on a constant currency basis were 1 7 sequentially and 5 8 year over year and the impact of foreign exchange primarily impacts our net centric revenues the average euro to u s dollar rate so far this quarter is 1 13 and the average canadian dollar exchange rate is 0 75 should these average foreign exchange rates remain at these levels for the remainder of our second quarter we estimate that the fx impact on our sequentially quarterly revenues for the second quarter will be a negative about 200 000 and the year over year foreign exchange impact will be a negative 1 5 million we believe that our revenue and customer base is not highly concentrated our top 25 customers represented less than 6 point 6 of our revenues this quarter on capex our capex was 13 3 million this quarter compared to 14 9 million for the first quarter of last year and 10 9 million for the fourth quarter of last year capital leases and capital lease payments our capital lease iru obligations are for long term dark fiber leases and typically have initial terms of 15 to 20 years or longer and often include multiple renewal options after the initial term our capital lease iru fiber lease obligations were 164 8 million at quarter end and at quarter end we had iru contracts with a total of 240 different dark fiber suppliers our capital lease principal payments under these irus were 3 million for the quarter and if you combine capital lease payments with our capital expenditures that total was 16 3 million this quarter compared to 13 1 million in the fourth quarter and 17 2 million for the first quarter of last year at the end of the quarter our cash and cash equivalents totaled 259 1 million and for the quarter our cash decreased by 17 million as a result of returning 38 5 million of capital to our stakeholders during the quarter we paid 26 6 million for our regular quarterly dividend payment and 12 million was spent on a semi annual interest payment on our debt obligation our quarterly operating cash flow this quarter was 28 6 million some comments on ratios and bad debt our total gross debt at par which includes capital leases was 811 3 million at quarter end and our net debt was 552 2 million our total gross debt to trailing last 12 months ebitda as adjusted ratio was 4 28 at quarter end and our net debt ratio was 2 92 our bad debt expense improved this quarter and was only 0 5 of our revenues for the quarter and our day sales also improved and was only 23 days at quarter end and again i want to thank and recognize our worldwide billing and collection team members for continuing to do a fantastic job in serving and collecting from all of our customers and with that i will turn the call back to dave dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer hey thanks tad a few comments on the scope and scale of our network at the end of the quarter we had over 949 million square feet of multi tenant office space connected directly to our network in north america our network consists of over 33 600 metro fiber miles and 57 400 intercity route miles of fiber the cogent network remains the most interconnected network in the world and we connect directly to over 6 660 networks less than 30 of these are settlement free peers and the remaining 6 630 networks are cogent customers purchasing transit services from us we are currently utilizing approximately 28 of the linked capacity in our network we routinely augment capacity as portions of our network reach higher utilization rates to maintain these aggregate low utilization rates for the quarter we achieved sequential traffic growth of 7 over the fourth quarter of 2018 and 43 over the full year period from 2018 we operate 52 cogent data centers with 587 000 square feet of raised floor space and we re today utilizing approximately 32 of that data center capacity our rep turnover rate was 5 1 in the quarter which is better than our long term average rep turnover rate of 5 7 our quarterly sales rep productivity was 5 1 per full time equivalent rep per month the productivity rate that is consistent with our long term average of 5 1 install orders per full time equivalent rep per month we ended the quarter with over 500 reps selling our service 501 a significant increase from the 487 reps that we had at the end of 2018 and this is the largest our sales force has been in our history cogent remains the low cost provider of internet transit services and our value proposition remained unmatched in the industry our business remains completely focused on the internet ip connectivity and data center colocation services which all are necessary utilities for of our customers our multi year constant currency long term growth target of 10 and our long term ebitda margin expansion of approximately 200 basis points should be met over the next several years our board of directors has approved yet another increase on our regular quarterly dividend of 0 02 a share increasing our quarterly dividend to 0 60 our dividend increase continues to demonstrate the optimism we have and the strength of our business the underlying growth and the improving cash flow capabilities in a sector that continues to see most of our competitors experiencing declining revenues and declining margins we will be opportunistic about the use of our balance sheet we ll be opportunistic about the timing and purchase of common stock at quarter s end we still had 34 9 million remaining under our current buyback authorization which continues to year end we remain committed to returning increasing amounts of capital to our shareholders on a regular basis with that i d like to open it up for questions questions answers operator and our first question comes from philip cusick with j p morgan please proceed philip cusick j p morgan analyst hey guys thanks so dave two if i can first can you expand on what sounds like pressure on the net centric side and then second full time and total reps are running at new highs and up a lot and productivity continues lower i recognize there s a relationship here but is there an intention to trend lower productivity per rep that we should be thinking about thanks dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer sure hey thanks phil for the questions so first of all on net centric our business has experienced a slowdown in traffic several years ago due to violations of net neutrality and now traffic has rebounded to close to historical growth rates however the majority of that incremental traffic that 43 year over year growth has come from our largest customers which get the lowest pricing so while the average price per megabit continues to decline at rates consistent with our long term averages of about 23 it was 24 4 this quarter the volume weighted decline has been greater resulting in flat sequential revenues on a constant currency basis and a 3 year over year decline in light of traffic growth we expect to see a more normalized pattern of traffic growth from a broader base of customers and with that we believe that our net centric revenue growth will return to its historical averages which are about 9 5 year over year as opposed to the 3 decline that we had this quarter obviously the corporate business continues to perform strongly and has really been unimpacted by these trends now to the full time equivalent rep and total rep size and productivity question two points first of all we are committed to increasing the size of our sales force at between 7 and 10 per year we achieved that last year we expect to achieve that this year in the quarter we increased the number of total reps by 14 but actually our full time equivalent reps went up by 28 therefore meaning a lot of reps that were hired toward the end of last year reached their third month and are now counted as full time equivalents as we have commented on in the past rep productivity actually consistently increases from month one to about month 30 when it plateaus so the decline in rep productivity was really as a result of the average tenure of the reps coming down due to the fact that we have 28 reps that are in their fourth or fifth month not fully productive yet but still counted in the base we achieved aggregate productivity in line with our long term average it is correct that this declined from the last several quarters but it s because of the step function increase in the number of ftes in the quarter we expect that to normalize over the course of the year we believe the training programs market segmentation and management initiatives that we put in place will allow our rep productivity over time to continue to trend up we also in the quarter lost some additional time we had our annual sales meeting normally that meeting is three days in length this year it was actually expanded to eight days to give us greater ability to train reps and for our corporate reps that is highly impactful because their call volume and just number of days in the office is directly proportional to their selling so we effectively lost an additional half a week of selling in the quarter which also had a drag on rep productivity because it s only based on installed orders i think you ll see a rebound in the next quarter philip cusick j p morgan analyst can i expand that a little bit the growth in reps is that mostly corporate or is the net centric rep growth pretty strong as well dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer so there is growth in both segments but we re roughly 74 5 of corporate and about 25 5 netcentric so the aggregate number of reps that increased are far more corporate than netcentric and that ratio has been relatively consistent philip cusick j p morgan analyst and is your your assumption of netcentric sort of broadening of traffic growth is that reliant on the expansion of reps there or is there something else going on that your other customers will start ramping up dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer it s not really dependent on number of customers it s really dependent on change in traffic patterns so what we saw is some of our largest customers as their direct connect agreements that they were forced to sign under the net neutrality violations have begun to lapse they have shifted more of that traffic back to transit and much of that has come to cogent also we have seen a trend in the past few years where 10 or so large content companies are growing much faster than the average base of content companies we think those trends are somewhat transitory our net centric sales force is about 130 or so reps spread out around the world and the fact that we sell to 6 630 access network shows you how broad their reach is and we sold to over 4 200 content companies so i don t think it s necessarily a result of needing more reps it s really that those smaller customers just need to achieve the same kinds of traffic growth rates as the largest customers are doing philip cusick j p morgan analyst thanks dave see you in a couple weeks dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer ok phil thanks operator thank you and our next question comes from walter piecyk with btig please proceed walter piecyk btig analyst thanks hey dave you just mentioned that your ftes full time employees increased by 28 reps as the explanation for that drop in productivity in q1 of 2017 they rose by 32 and in q1 of 2016 they rose by 22 and in those quarters your productivity remained flat at 6 1 versus 6 1 in the prior quarter and at 6 3 versus 6 3 in the prior quarter so what was how does that play a role in this quarter as opposed to not playing a role with similar circumstances in those two years dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer so it is just an arithmetic fact that whenever you hire new reps those reps increase in productivity for a much longer period than we count them as full time equivalents and the reason for the full time equivalency cutoff is that is the period of time in which cogent is paying a guaranteed commission on the variable portion of the rep s compensation at the end of that period that bridge or that guaranteed variable goes away and the rep is just left with their base salary and then the variable component is totally driven by their performance and we do see that performance increasing in terms walter piecyk btig analyst but that has not been a factor in the past three years dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer no i heard you on the in the past periods maybe some of the training programs that we have rolled out had a bigger impact there s also just some lumpiness in sales we did lose an additional four days of selling time this quarter which does impact the corporate reps it doesn t really impact the net centric reps very much but that did have an impact as well and some of it s just the lumpiness i can t account for the difference in the past years what i can tell you is that the long term trend line in our rep productivity has continued to improve it is not a perfect straight line and the step back that we had this quarter was really just to the long term average and as i stated earlier i fully expect that rep productivity to rebound and continue at above historical rates walter piecyk btig analyst got it so let s approach this from a different angle then if you look at the sequential growth in your corporate business we go back to the improvements that were made in the sales force back in 2014 i mean it wasn t down dramatically this quarter but this is the lowest sequential growth you put up in corporate since 2013 so is your expectation that now you have these 28 new full time employees that s going to ramp but you can get your sequentials back to 2 7 or at least sustained at a 2 7 2 8 range going forward dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer so the answer is yes we should continue to see corporate growth be particularly strong and to your point of the historical inflection in corporate growth much of that came from the introduction of our vpls product which we ve spoken about on a number of occasions and the fact that roughly 25 of our corporate sales are for vpn services either vpls or sd wan and that will continue we feel very comfortable that we should be able to achieve consistent corporate growth in that 11 12 13 range and as i stated we did lose an additional four days of selling time in the quarter which is not insignificant in a highly transaction driven model where a number of outbound calls is directly correlated to sales and installs in that quarter walter piecyk btig analyst got it and then just one last one on netcentric again you mentioned this 9 target i mean you haven t topped 9 in net centric since 2013 so when you define this as a long term growth rate i mean which years are you talking about and when what type of time line can we expect it to ever get back to that type of growth rate because it just i mean is it like five years now dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer and that s a fair point i commented on it extensively on the last call and it was part of the reason why we took the aggregate target down for our long term growth rate when we look at netcentric there are really two drivers the first driver is traffic growth and again our long term traffic growth is approximately 50 it had decelerated to the low 20s it s back at 43 that s an important prerequisite to be able to get our net centric revenue growth to accelerate the second thing is the average price per megabit and while the average price per connection sold is very similar what we have seen though is most of the growth coming from our largest customers therefore the effective price per megabit has declined much more rapidly over the past 12 to 18 months as those direct connections shift back to using transit as a preferred way to connect to the internet we think that is a transitory phenomena those contracts were between three and five years in term they are lapsing at this point all of our counterparty peers are honoring net neutrality rules with the exception of deutsche telekom which we ve commented on historically and we do expect walter piecyk btig analyst have you given up the fight there because you didn t book any net neutrality fees this quarter dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer well we didn t have to spend anything it doesn t mean we gave up but we have a pending case still in front of the german appeals court it s a 3 judge tribunal and it is a very lengthy process if you think the wheels are just just turns slow in the u s they turn slower in the eu so this is going to be a protractive fight and listen we re not happy that we re doing it on their turf but that s where walter piecyk btig analyst but i mean dave i just think investors will be more interested in knowing when it s not going to or when it s going to stop declining as opposed to talking about getting to a 9 number that you haven t hit in five years dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer well then let me couch it a different way the rate of decline improved it became less negative this quarter than it was the previous quarter so there isn t an inflection the second derivative is positive and things are improving but i do believe they will improve through getting to flat and actually get to a point of positive revenue growth walter piecyk btig analyst got it thank you dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer thanks walt operator thank you and our next question comes from matthew niknam with deutsche bank please proceed matthew niknam deutsche bank analyst hey dave thank you for taking the questions just two if i could one on gross margin so pretty big improvement year on year can you talk about what drove this and the sequential decline in network operation expense this quarter just wondering if this is sort of recurring or if there any onetimers in the quarter and then secondly on shareholder returns you talked about having access to the builder basket with leverage below the gross leverage below the four and a quarter is that sort of a precursor or should we expect an uptick in terms of the rate of dividend growth or total shareholder return as a result dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer yes so first of all two very good questions thanks matt in terms of gross margin we have had consistent long term improvement over the past couple of years it s averaged about 100 basis points a year it was steeper this year i think that is in part because of the operating leverage in our business and the fact that roughly three fourth of all sales are on net which carry on 100 gross margin contribution in terms of the sequential improvement we do have certain maintenance fees that are paid some quarterly some semi annual and some annually we did have an annual fee that hit last quarter so that was part of the sequential but that also hit the year before as well in general investors should expect for the next several years on average about a 100 basis points a year of gross margin improvement due to the operating leverage of the business with regard to shareholder returns we are absolutely committed to using our balance sheet effectively we have reduced our leverage below the indenture test to be able to move all of the available builder basket 88 million to the holding company which we ll do bringing cash then at the holding company to 194 million and we have under our indentures probably about another 150 million of borrowing capacity at the operating company level and no restriction on borrowing at the holding company level we will explore the debt market and possibly put additional debt on at the operating company level based on current market conditions seeming to be fairly favorable we don t have an exact timing for that but it is something that we are going to explore and then with regard to now returning that 194 million to shareholders we are very committed to growing our dividend 27 consecutive quarters of sequential growth i think proved that the fact that our dividend grew at nearly 16 year over year and we interjected opportunistically buybacks i think if we see a period of market volatility you ll see us reenter the market and use our buybacks if we are in a prolonged period of no market volatility i think the board will consider using that excess cash in bigger dividends but i don t think that decision has been yet made and we re going to be patient in our long term return but i think what investors should expect is we will continue to increase the amount of cash we return to them and we ve been prudent about not over levering we ve been measured in the pacing of that return and i think you should expect that going forward matthew niknam deutsche bank analyst thanks dave and if i could just follow up real quick on the maintenance fee that you talked about that was present in 4q was seemingly not present in 1q can you quantify that amount if it s meaningful dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer it was not insignificant that particular contract is covered by an nda but it was meaningful enough that it showed up in the numbers i ll just leave it at that matthew niknam deutsche bank analyst ok thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from tim horan with oppenheimer please proceed tim horan oppenheimer analyst thanks dave sort of pounding on netcentric here but you sound very confident on growth kind of coming back and your peers or the industry is talking about better volume growth they re seeing like this year or this quarter the cable industry s a lot more over the top video kind of occurring but it sounds like you think you were going to get or you re starting to see growth coming from other locations but can you just give us a little bit of color on maybe the timing when you might see a little bit more diversification on the traffic growth or maybe a lot of it just coming even from the largest companies and related to that how much can these large net centric customers save by using you for transit instead of going direct connected to carriers roughly dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer yeah so two very different questions first of all clearly the aggregate growth in traffic not only that we are seeing but the rest of the industry is seeing is a leading indicator to an improvement in the net centric market and we have historically grown at about double the market rate and that s what we re doing today and i think it s a clear indication we are gaining market share i do think there is a broadening of applications that are very bandwidth intensive and some of these are earlier stage some of them being more augmented reality gaming type applications that will diversify growth away from some of the biggest names in video distribution but they remain strong as well and we expect growth to come from both segments we also benefit from the fact that we have 6 630 access networks buying from us so they re kind of the counterparty to that traffic growth meaning their customers are pulling down more content we don t pick winners and losers we sell to everyone we have a very transparent pricing model in terms of discounts to competitors and volume and term discounts we think this simplicity has helped us when our customers confidence and shows that we continue to gain market share so for all of those reasons i feel pretty confident that we are going to see a broadening of base and what i don t have perfect visibility to is how might direct connect still exists and how much can be converted back now to the question of savings we have had some customer who have built their own networks for their own proprietary needs usually they will link their own data centers and transfer information between those centers we ve also had customers who have previously built networks and abandoned those networks using transit as a lower cost more flexible technology i actually met with a very large content producing company that had build out a global network and pointed out to them that if they had just used cogent with our volume discounting they can literally be saving hundreds of millions of dollars in capital expenditures per year by just using the efficiency of our network now they may have other requirements that i m not seeing but just on their network there would be massive savings some of these companies view it as strategic and that s their decision and as long as their models remain profitable enough to allow them to be not efficient in the purchase of bandwidth so be it but we are convinced that for every net centric customer we provide the very best cost alternative and the scale and cost structure of our network is far better than trying to build it yourself tim horan oppenheimer analyst and then just a follow up on pricing your new sales price now has been kind of flat for a year or a little bit longer basically should that indicate better revenue growth going forward because your discount on the average price to the new sales price is kind of you know relatively low at this point dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer i do think that is one of the leading indicators that are helping us get comfortable with the idea that net centric revenue growth will resume tim horan oppenheimer analyst and any idea why the new sales price has been relatively flat here and is that kind of remaining the case do you think for the next couple of quarters dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer well i think it s that precursor of broadening the base so again the big guys have already bought they re filling up the pipes that they have and we are going out and seeding a next generation of business models that are buying lots of small ports and what has always been a key to our net centric growth is when one or more of those newer businesses become the next dominant traffic generator tim horan oppenheimer analyst thank you very much dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer thanks operator thank you and our next question comes from nick del deo with moffettnathanson please proceed nick del deo moffettnathanson analyst hey good morning you know off net growth has decelerated pretty materially over the last several quarters to what degree is that tied to lower prices from your off net vendors versus the rate of vpn sales versus other factors dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer hey nick i would say it s two things one average contract length continuing to increase both for on net and off net but for off net it s much more a result of lower loop prices so we today from 90 different vendors have fiber off net availability in 1 030 000 buildings that is a big footprint and in most of those cases we re actually saying two alternatives usually an incumbent and some competitive carrier and in many cases that s the cable provider as they ve aggressively overbuilt in large part to facilitate 5g and small cell deployment so with that fiber plant so whether it s at t with project vip or verizon with its new 5g overbuild not fios but their own fiber buildout and then whether it s spectrum or comcast we ve seen very aggressive fiber building which has driven down our price for loops our off net business is a derivative of our on net corporate business it all starts with an on net corporate sale and then if the customer needs us in multiple locations either for vpn or internet access or both then we get the very best loop price that we can and we ve seen those loop prices falling fairly precipitously and we re passing a lot of that savings on to our customers actually the loop prices are falling faster than our arpu is falling in large part because a lot of our customers are under long term contracts and won t be able to avail themselves of those lower prices till their initial term expires nick del deo moffettnathanson analyst got it and then turning to sd wan recognizing that it s still early days in that product can you talk about the traction you re getting with customers anything you ve learned about the sales process or sticking points dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer yes so i think three points first of all i would acknowledge sd wan sales for us and for other vendors have movably been slower than we would have been initially expected two i think sd wan has paralyzed the mpls market and is really created a customer dynamic where no customer will expand or modify their mpls network so i think it s the third point which is most of our sd wan discussions have actually resulted an incremental vpls sales for cogent and that is because when you outline the pluses and minuses of each of the technologies the vpls solution is more mature it more closely fits the customer requirement so we repeatedly have discussions with customers who want to move off of mpls to an sd wan product we outline our sd wan offering we compare it to competitors and we compare it to our vpls and increasingly what we have seen is the customers continuing to choose the vpls product even though they came in asking for sd wan they walked out the door with vpls nick del deo moffettnathanson analyst got it that s interesting thanks for the color dave dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer ok thanks nick operator thank you and our next question comes from colby synesael with cowen and company please proceed colby synesael cowen and company analyst great thank you i guess two questions one just sticking on off net historically going back many years ago that was thought to be a t1 oriented business where you d effectively purchase t1s from the verizons and at ts of this world and sell them to your customers and i know that over last year s that the conversation has shifted more to fiber oriented solutions but i m curious how much of off net revenue corporate off net revenue at this point is coming from t1s and how much of that slowdown in growth that we ve seen the last several quarters might actually be a function of churn and more specifically t1 churn and then secondly equipment gains again something we ve talked about for many years now i think there was a time where we thought that was going to slow and we seeing it kind of come back and it ebbs and flows each quarter where are your expectations for equipment sales in 2019 and what is the updated view on how that looks over the next few years dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer sure let me take the t1 that was a super easy question we have 0 t1s and have had 0 t1s t3s or any tdm based off net product for three years 100 of our off net sales are fiber based no coax no fixed wireless no adsl only fiber and only ethernet so it means that cogent can serve 55 of the business locations in north america 10 on net for footprint 45 from the 90 different vendors that we can buy from and it also means 45 of locations are no bid for cogent so we have no churn coming from tdm or t1 services and have not for our 3 5 years since we ve been able to phase all those out we have seen significant price declines however on those ethernet based fiber delivered services and the competitive tension is what s driving down cost we also had previously been willing to sell lower speeds than 100 mb and now virtually all of our off net sales are 100 mb or greater via fiber we still have some limited 50 mb services but increasingly we re trying to steer our customers to 100 mb off net as a minimum product and then to the equipment sale question colby we have significant inventory of gear that we re constantly rotating out of our network that is not efficient and has been replaced by newer technology however there s not always buyers available for it it s not our primary business we don t recognize those sales and revenue but because there is usually no basis in that equipment those gains have to be reflected in our reporting of cash flow and ebitda but not in revenue i would suspect equipment sales for this year will be similar to last year i think the uptick that we experienced this quarter was a bit of a one off in that we were able to sell some gear that we just found a customer for but it s not something that we can predict with any kind of certainty colby synesael cowen and company analyst great thank you dave operator thank you and our next question comes from michael rollins with citi please proceed michael rollins citi analyst hi good morning dave i was wondering if you could unpack a bit the unit volume you had and the revenue by the different products that you re selling between your bandwidth and some of the additional products like the vpn the data center and then as you move forward how are you thinking about product mix and your interest in additional products to the menu dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer sure so i ll start with the second question first which is one that new hires always ask when are we going to sell something new and the answer to that is probably not i think our key success and i think it s even more accentuated today vis a vis our competitors than it ever has been is the simplicity off of our product portfolio and we expect that to continue so there s really three product categories some form of internet access which is about 81 82 of revenues some flavor of vpn which is either sd wan or vpls which in total revenues is generally about 17 of revenues and then finally our colocation space and power which is traditionally a couple of percent of revenues now to the bandwidth products for corporate customers the flagship or the standard product has been and continues to be a 100 mb connection although we are increasingly selling either fractional gigs or full gig interfaces in corporate buildings as most corporate customers in their land refresh cycle are able to now accept a full gig handoff ironically we deliver to the customer a fiber gig interface but we rate limit it down and convert it to copper because that s what the customer could take in the handoff i do think over the next several years the gigabit product for corporate customers will become the de facto standard i do think eventually it ll be priced at identical prices to the fast e product it s not there today we do charge a premium for it but i think as it becomes the standard it will become our product at the same price points and ironically it will actually improve our cost of delivery because we don t have to buy that piece of equipment it s about 300 that we place in the customer s suite to convert it from fiber to copper we can do a direct fiber handoff and it eliminates one point of failure as well and it will also help us lower our installation cost for customers because traditionally we charge the customer for that piece of customer prem equipment michael rollins citi analyst and just following up on the corporate point in the past you talked about the low utilization of bits by the corporate customers on that 100 mb connection can you help us visualize where the growth of that corporate traffic is growing and what you re seeing trend line wise dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer sure actually this last quarter our average corporate growth or traffic utilization at peak was about 14 7 of those connections and part of the reason it s drifted down a little bit is because some customers are taking gigabit connections even though they don t need them and i think where that traffic is going is really two primary drivers as businesses move computing off site into remote location or cloud that is requiring more bandwidth and a greater percentage utilization of the port the second is as businesses migrate software away from licensed premise based software to saas that also requires more bandwidth but remember most business users are only in their offices 40 50 hours a week so while i m giving you the peak number if you look at corporate utilization on an average basis it s a fraction of 1 on a 24 7 basis which is an extremely different use pattern than a net centric customer that tends to utilize its ports at 70 or 80 but 24 7 michael rollins citi analyst thank you dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer thanks operator thank you and our next question comes from mike mccormack with guggenheim partners please proceed mike mccormack guggenheim securities analyst hey guys thanks i guess just one thing on the margin side if you could just talk about the puts and takes that you mentioned for q1 obviously there s some seasonality there maybe the magnitude as you step into 2q or the step down in cost if you can sort of try to frame that and then secondly i know dave you mentioned cable with respect to the sort of enabling 5g and access cost coming down what about cable as far as a threat on the corporate customer side for you guys are you seeing anything sort of looming on that front dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer yeah sure mike two different questions so first of all on the margin side we in this quarter experienced a couple of extra q1 experienced a couple of significant extra sg a costs the first is our sales meeting this year it was longer and actually ran over 1 million which is not insignificant at a company of cogent s scale we also have the payroll reset and healthcare generally goes up as well as cola increases pass through in the first quarter our sg a as a percentage of revenue went from about 22 to about 24 of revenue sequentially you should expect it to drift down over the course of the year in terms of gross margin just the three fourth of all sales are on net that will continue to drive improved gross margin and that s how we get to the roughly 200 basis points a year roughly half of it coming from gross margin uplift half of it coming from sg a now to your cable competition question in off net locations cable competition is very real however we don t go out to sell in that location the only time we go to that location is when we have a customer that has an on net location with us we don t see cable having the on net footprint in multi tenant skyscrapers or the scale that we re in in central business districts they haven t prewired the billings they haven t built out a full distribution system making installation lengthy and also expensive also for multi site customers cable footprints can be somewhat limited and our footprint being global just gives us some real advantages mike mccormack guggenheim securities analyst great thanks guys dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer hey thanks mike operator thank you and our next question comes from michael funk with bank of america please proceed michael funk bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey good morning dave how you doin dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer hey great mike good to hear from you it s been a while michael funk bank of america merrill lynch analyst yeah yeah i m always here you know quickly just back to the net centric growth i appreciate your optimism on turning the revenue growth trend i heard your comments about thinking that maybe some of the traffic losers might actually pick up some traffic growth and the help you could be getting there really it relates to the return of capital though given that i guess continued return of capital seems to be predicated on turning the net centric revenue growth higher right given the high margin aspect of that business i m just wondering to what degree return of capital in the future is predicated on getting back to that 10 plus growth and how much you the board consider maybe a suboptimal outcome when thinking about returning capital not wanting to be in the box of hitting up against the leverage targets given that you re already paying out more than 100 of your free cash flow with the dividend and certainly your valuation at this point is probably solving i guess for the dividend yield and some of the examples we ve seen in the rlec space where similarly management teams are optimistic about turning the top line it just didn t happen and ended up in a box where the payout became sustainable so i guess the question is do you even open to consideration that revenue may not get back to where you want it to be and does that inform your decision about incremental returns of capital or keeping that cash in the balance sheet dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer sure a very good question mike so a couple of points first of all we have grown our dividend throughout the period in which netcentric has underperformed to walt s point it s been five years since netcentric has performed well and during that 5 year period we have 20 consecutive increases to our dividend second we are very different than an rlec we do not have an aggregate business that s in decline our top line growth continues strong our addressable markets have plenty of additional opportunity available to us and we continue to gain market share in those markets the products we sell are in demand it is not like residential landline services that are being eliminated and substituted away with broadband or with a mobile connection so i think the board has taken a very measured approach we ve had calls from investors to increase the pacing at which we are increasing our dividend in fact our cash flow grew year over year 16 2 and our dividend only grew 15 8 so we acknowledge that we are using the balance sheet efficiently but we remain far less levered than any other company in our sector and with our top line growth even with underperformance in the net centric business so i think the rate of dividend growth that we have now should continue and is not predicated on a belief that we have a rapid turn in net centric revenue if we see that net centric revenue starting to inflect faster and again as i answered earlier the rate of decline has slowed it is not yet positive but it is improving as it improves that gives us further ability to increase their pacing of our revenue growth and therefore the pacing of our growth in dividend but i think we have demonstrated in a tough pricing environment a tough macro environment for our sector our ability to consistently grow aggregate revenues and expand cash flow our cash flow is growing at like 20 per year roughly over the past several years and with that having dividend growth the way we have delivered is in no way putting our balance sheet at risk or putting investors in any area where they would have to assume that they would be susceptible to dividend elimination listen if you ve got negative top line growth you can t cost cut your way to a fix you have to eventually cut your dividend and that may not be enough to save the business we don t have that problem what you re focused on is the incremental benefit from one third of our business growing at a faster rate but the underlying strength of our cash flow growth is unmuted michael funk bank of america merrill lynch analyst even for just the time today dave maybe one more if i could you mentioned that the data center is 30 occupied i get that maybe that it s strategic for a portion of the business but seemingly maybe underutilized assets there very strong valuations we re seeing in data center sales recently cap rates anywhere from 4 to 8 in the sales have you considered giving any kind of thought to monetizing that asset maybe to strengthen the balance sheet even more dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer you know we have looked at that mike but two things first of all they re completely integrated to the cogent network meaning we typically have sales offices there we have our hubs co located so they serve multiple functions could they be segregated sure but it would take some work and the second you actually just criticized me for trading at too high of a multiple and the reality is my multiple is comparable to many of the data centers but actually on a cash flow and growth adjusted cash flow multiple we trade at a significant discount to the data centers michael funk bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thank you again dave operator thank you and our next question comes from brett feldman please proceed brett feldman chief executive officer thanks for squeezing me in so as you were noting before your outlook for improved net centric growth is based not just on an improvement in the rate of growth of traffic as new applications come to the internet but that it s a broader base and so maybe for context the improvement in traffic growth you have seen recently it seems like that s been predominantly driven by video but if it s more nuanced that context would be helpful and then second what are some of these new uses that you think are going to drive faster growth in data traffic and what gives you confidence that the sources of those are going to be different than the tech heavyweight that i suspect are behind the growth you ve seen recently thanks dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer sure thanks brett for the questions so first of all the internet remains a very dynamic ecosystem and every time there s a belief that all the things that people are going to use are out there someone comes up with a new model and we have traditionally been the service provider of choice for start ups and smaller companies that experiment secondly today and probably for the foreseeable future most growth is going to continue to come from linear video substitution moving to over the top that will continue to drive growth and that business has been dominated by a handful of companies and i think that s probably going to continue there may be some broadening of that base we re seeing for example disney launch its own product we re seeing new models like qui vid come out yeah there is an attempt to have a broader set of consumer choices and packages and i think that will be helpful but i think when we think about new business models it will be things that are probably more interactive meaning suited only to the internet you know while massive online multiplayer gaming remains a significant subset of the market it is still not yet completely mainstream also virtual reality and augmented reality products are i think in their infancy and if i was smart enough to pick which business would be the winner i wouldn t be on this call i d be investing in that company and sitting on a beach somewhere but what i do know is consumers are fickle the battle is for eyeball time and there will be new products coming out that are more immersive than those that we have today more flexible and yes we will someday reach saturation of internet traffic growth but i think we have a long way to go and it s not clear to cogent that those large fang type names are the only innovators on the internet now they may buy up those innovators but right now there s a broad base of new models being tried out brett feldman chief executive officer thanks for the time dave dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer and thanks operator thank you and our next question comes from with brandon nispel keybanc capital market please proceed brandon nispel keybanc capital markets analyst ok great real quick just want to touch on the maintenance fee again can you maybe remind us when it hit last year so we can sort of rightsize our model from a sequential impact to gross margins and then maybe for tad was there any impact from the lease accounting standard to the income statement or was it just a balance sheet presentation change thanks tad weed chief financial officer sure on the new lease accounting standard that we had to adopt this quarter and record that january 1st we did not retroactively adjust our financials and there is no income statement impact at all the accounting for these expense is identical this quarter as it has been historically it s purely a balance sheet transaction and the total aggregate present value of the leases that we had to record which were largely related to our facilities was 97 million but it s purely a balance sheet transaction dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer and then brandon in terms of the maintenance fee while i didn t disclosed the exact amount you know it is material you know we do have these quarterly semi annual and annual ones and there are a very few monthly ones and it was just material enough that it did impact the sequential but i think kind of on a recurring model basis you should expect some additional maintenance fees in the fourth quarter of this year but in aggregate we expect it to lever about 100 basis points of gross margin expansion per year for the next several years operator ok thank you and with that this concludes our q a session for today i would like to turn the call back over to dave schaeffer for closing remarks dave schaeffer chairman and chief executive officer well i ll keep it short because we did have a lot of

the smartest insight and analysis from all perspectives rounded up from around the web the u s economy blew past expectations in the first months of 2019 in a burst of growth that feels like the 1990s said heather long at the washington post last week the government reported a 3 2 percent annualized gdp growth rate in the first quarter energizing supporters of president trump and his economic policies most of the growth was driven by an unusually low trade deficit and a surge in inventories with companies beefing up their supplies after depleting them last year in addition unemployment and inflation remain low wages are rising and the stock market has been on a bullish ride that s reminiscent of the dot com boom 20 years ago tax cuts gave the economy what looked like a sugar high said jon hilsenrath at the wall street journal but now productivity and labor force gains suggest that faster growth might well be sustained though trump officials credit tax cuts and deregulation for the economy s advance other factors such as productivity gains from technology are also in play regardless of where credit should go the economy s newfound energy is a great development for americans if it continues because it would mean more income growth in the long run with less inflation eating away at those income gains the economy might be doing even better if it weren t for trump s trade wars said shawn donnan at bloomberg investment in agricultural equipment for instance dropped considerably as farmers continued to deal with the fallout of tariffs that have hurt exports of products such as soybeans to china analysts say uncertainty over trade has made companies slow to invest in new equipment potentially a drag on long term growth the tariffs trump has imposed are an unnecessary tax on americans said sen chuck grassley r iowa at the wall street journal it s time for the tariffs to go a levy on steel and aluminum imports provoked retaliatory tariffs on u s products by canada and mexico that have hurt farmers mexican tariffs on u s pork for example have lowered the value of live hogs by 12 an animal that impacts jobs and wages especially in rural communities subscribe to the week escape your echo chamber get the facts behind the news plus analysis from multiple perspectives subscribe save sign up for the week s free newsletters from our morning news briefing to a weekly good news newsletter get the best of the week delivered directly to your inbox from our morning news briefing to a weekly good news newsletter get the best of the week delivered directly to your inbox sign up the economy is booming but who s really benefiting asked juan williams at the hill what about the middle class wages remain stagnant trump s trade wars are hurting farmers coal mines keep closing teachers in several states have been on strike housing prices are up prescription drug prices and health care costs are up gas prices are up and student debt is soaring this isn t what an economic boom should look like that s likely what democrats will be saying in 2020 said david siders at politico but unless there s a slowdown it will be hard to make that message stick one recent cnn poll found 71 percent of americans rate the nation s economic conditions favorably the health of the u s economy has generally been a good predictor for elections although experts disagree about the impact of economic anxiety in 2016 democrats now find themselves in a position much like trump s at the end of the obama years needing to convince voters that despite broad gains the indicators fail to fully depict the state of the economy this article was first published in the latest issue of the week magazine if you want to read more like it you can try 8 issues for only 1 here

source xinhua 2019 05 04 02 29 56 editor mu xuequan video player close tehran may 3 xinhua the 180 day waivers from nov 4 last year for some importers of iran s oil formally expired on thursday announced by the white house before which ratcheted up impacts of tough pressures on iran whose economy was strongly relying on energy sector last may u s president donald trump announced that the united states was withdrawing from jcpoa the iran nuclear deal signed in 2015 which lifted wide ranging sanctions on the iranian economy and tehran in return agreed to accept limits on its nuclear technology program and allow inspections of its nuclear installations following the withdrawal trump s administration launched the sanctions on iran s oil export in november but leaving eight countries and regions as waivers they are the biggest buyers of iran oil but a dozen of other nations have entirely stopped buying iranian crude shrinking iranian oil exports by about 1 million barrels per day and depriving the regime of roughly 2 5 billion u s dollars in revenue despite the widespread international criticism the u s still insists on its policy that iran either does a 180 degree turn from its course of action and act like a normal country or it can see its economy crumble with time going on the sanctions on the islamic republic from u s side are getting tougher new round of punishing sanctions on iran s energy banking and shipping sectors went into force targeting hundreds of entities including individuals banks aircraft and vessels after naming the islamic revolution guards corps as a terrorist group on april 9 offering rewards on information about money laundry linked to iran the decision of totally blocking the opec s third largest crude producer and the world s seventh largest oil exporter from the international market is beyond many expectations even if mike pompeo the state secretary of the u s promised on april 22 that u s middle east allies and other main oil producers would release more production capabilities to fill iran s absence oil prices fluctuate worldwide in the past several days and are likely to surge in the near future the end of waivers seemed ominously as a bugle call but it is still too early to say a new middle east war is coming the recent series of actions adopted by the u s should be elaborated as the succession of extreme pressure by using all measures except war to submit iran but the damages caused by the current sanctions could not meet trump s expectations high unemployment rising inflation and currency weakening have long inflicted iranian government and its people and got even worse after the imposition of the u s sanctions since last year nevertheless iran has always kept stable trump has prioritized three goals as his middle east policy involving the annihilation of is the solidity of greenback s dominance in oil trade and containing a rival challenging its hegemony in the region said diao daming the assistant professor of renmin university in beijing all the three goals are far from achievement diao said adding that referring to the expiration of waivers it is implausible for any company to continue oil transaction with iran theoretically because of their reliance on international banking system in which the u s dollar plays a leading role the new round of sanctions has throttled iran s economy even before its implementation the exchange rate of iranian rial slumped again in this late april and early may the european union which opposes trump s unilateral withdrawal from the 2015 iran nuclear deal is seeking to preserve the accord and protect the continent s companies from the sanctions however many european firms have cut off ties with iran rather than risk losing access to the massive u s financial and economic systems adidas specialty stores and some other european brands almost ended up their business in tehran oil market price will a little more than double very soon iranian government has been out of their efforts to obsolete the pressures mounted by the united states it has tightened the diplomatic relationship with iraq and turkey both who denied sanctions on iran publicly promising more economic cooperation conversely including linking their banks with iran iranian president hassan rouhani noted that his country will keep pushing its oil barrels into the market downplaying the impact of the u s decision to cut iran s oil exports to zero while the united states is busy blocking one path for exports iran will still have multiple other methods at its disposal for crude oil sales of which the americans are unaware he pointed out iranian minister of petroleum bijan namdar zanganeh also vowed that iran will exert maximum effort to break the u s sanctions he criticized that the u s attempts to wage sanctions as an aggressive economic war against iran srikanth kondapalli professor of iran s jawaharlal nehru university hailed remarks of rouhani and zanganeh giving suggestion to work out a new oil trading currency system against dollar in a bid to give importers a unified power to be reckoned with by oil producers although current sanction pressure on iran makes the country face mounting financial isolation and economic stagnation some analysts saw the country s economic condition will not come into intolerance so quickly lu jin an expert in iran study from chinese academy of social sciences expressed her confidence in iran said that u s sanctions system would be full of bugs if iran s neighbors turned a blind eye on the enforcement while the sanctions have piled pressure iran is less likely to come into collapse she added iran is rich in various natural resources and tilled land which ensure it to survive any sanctions said hua liming former chinese ambassador to iran the real challenge for iran is domestic problems but not america sanctions iranians lives were much more pinched during its war with iraq than now but no turmoil hua noted adding that the 1970s is the peak of iran s development with a big income gap which the islamic revolution followed in the country
do you remember the great inflation scare of 2010 2011 the u s economy remained deeply depressed from the aftereffects of the burst housing bubble and the 2008 financial crisis unemployment was still above 9 percent wage growth had slowed to a crawl and measures of underlying inflation were well below the federal reserve s targets so the fed was doing what it could to boost the economy keeping short term interest rates as low as possible and buying long term bonds in the hope of getting some extra traction but republicans were up in arms warning that the fed s policies would lead to runaway inflation a congressman named mike pence introduced a bill that would prohibit the fed from even considering the state of the labor market in its actions a who s who of republicans signed an open letter to ben bernanke demanding that he stop his monetary efforts which they claimed would risk currency debasement and inflation and supposedly respectable republicans engaged in conspiracy theorizing suggesting that the fed was secretly in league with the obama administration paul ryan and the economist john taylor declared that the fed s policy looks an awful lot like an attempt to bail out fiscal policy and such attempts call the fed s independence into question of course all these warnings were totally wrong inflation never took off although almost none of the people who waxed hysterical over inflation have so much as acknowledged having been wrong bernanke fed economists and keynesians in general were proved right printing money isn t inflationary in a depressed economy
anucha sirivisansuwan getty images the drumbeat of warnings about a looming worldwide recession is growing ever louder by dr eswar s prasad tolani senior professor of trade policy cornell university faced with an increasingly synchronized global slowdown policymakers must use a judicious mix of monetary and fiscal measures and recommit to broader reforms of product labor and financial markets how well they respond to these challenges will shape the course of the world economy for years to come the drumbeat of warnings about a looming worldwide recession is growing ever louder according to the latest brookings financial times tiger indexes which track the global economic recovery growth momentum is declining in virtually all of the world s major economies and what this portends in the longer term is ominous especially given the limited macroeconomic policy options for stimulating growth the current slowdown is mainly the result of weak business and consumer sentiment geopolitical uncertainties and trade tensions these factors have dampened corporate investment and could hurt future growth prospects too if the downturn persists current high levels of public debt and low interest rates will limit the ability of policymakers in large advanced economies to provide significant fiscal or monetary stimulus other less conventional monetary policy measures meanwhile would come with significant risks and uncertain payoffs in the united states economic expansion has moderated as the effects of fiscal stimulus fade and employment and retail sales weaken forward looking business and consumer confidence indicators and a yield curve that remains relatively flat despite the likelihood of larger budget deficits suggest further problems ahead with wage and inflationary pressures still muted the federal reserve has put its rate tightening plans on hold the talk now is of possible rate cuts and a halt to the unwinding of the fed s balance sheet growth is also deteriorating in europe the main locomotive germany is visibly losing steam and weaknesses are emerging in the eurozone s core and periphery economies business and consumer sentiment seem to have soured across the board which could keep growth low meanwhile brexit related uncertainties are coming to a head in the united kingdom which has weak equity markets and stagnant credit growth but despite a contraction in business investment the real economy has so far held up better than expected in japan financial conditions are weakening deflationary risks persist and global trade tensions threaten to derail exports and growth china s gdp growth has seemingly held up well but other indicators such as retail sales fixed asset investment and industrial output paint a less sanguine picture exports and imports are both lower than a year ago reflecting subdued global demand and lagging growth at home the government s efforts to mitigate this weakening growth trajectory have yielded some improvements in forward looking indicators such as the purchasing managers index and with bank credit flowing more freely again there are signs that investment is beginning to pick up but continued credit misallocation is increasing financial system risks and also jeopardizing long term productivity and output growth especially given china s unfavorable demographics india is still growing robustly helped by modest fiscal stimulus ahead of impending national elections as well as interest rate cuts by the reserve bank of india most recently on april 4 furthermore the prospect of continued low us interest rates and weak oil prices has alleviated short term pressures on inflation the budget and the current account deficit but sluggish private investment and a sharp contraction in trade volumes point to troubles ahead any relief that emerging market economies such as indonesia might experience from a more accommodative fed policy has been outweighed by slower chinese growth which has hurt exports brazil though is showing signs of resilience in its trade volumes and labor markets brazil mexico and russia could each grow by about 2 in 2019 but all are highly vulnerable to potential shocks to global demand and commodity prices turkey meanwhile has fallen into recession led by a plunge in industrial output and dismal consumer sentiment slower growth in international trade could add to the world s immediate economic woes making it harder still to restore broader growth the uncertainty caused by trade tensions could also have an adverse long term impact by undermining business confidence and depressing private investment this in turn will hurt productivity growth which has been weak during the recovery from the 2008 global financial crisis and will become even more crucial for maintaining gdp growth as populations age faced with an increasingly synchronized global slowdown policymakers must use a judicious mix of monetary and fiscal measures to support growth at the same time they must recommit to broader reforms of product labor and financial markets a vast and unfinished task how well they respond to this challenge will shape the course of the world economy for years to come originally published by project syndicate 04 08 2019 republished with permission for educational non commercial purposes

welcome ladies and gentlemen and thank you for taking the time to join us today overall housing demand across our markets has demonstrated signs of recovery from the market pause that occurred in the back half of 2018 as interest rates have receded and consumer demand has rebounded against the backdrop of ongoing strong employment and wage growth in a broader u s economy heading into this year our operating teams made certain pricing adjustments as well as used targeted incentives to find the right balance to capitalize on the more favorable market conditions as we discussed on last quarter s conference call we sold and closed fewer spec homes during the fourth quarter of 2018 than we had anticipated our teams took advantage of this higher spec inventory during the first quarter of this year strategically targeting these homes for sale and converting these sales into closings yielding better than anticipated closings and cash flows for the company we delivered 949 homes during the quarter which is up 28 year over year and generated 454 million of home sales revenue which is up 22 from the prior year both records for our first quarter our pre tax net income for the quarter was 20 million and our after tax net income was 8 1 million or 0 21 per diluted share we ended the quarter with a william lyon homes stockholders equity of approximately 872 million and a total equity of north of 1 billion equating to an overall booked value per share as of march 31 2019 of 23 05 and a tangible book value per share of 19 62 during the first quarter we experienced improving demand as the quarter progressed which is typical for a spring selling season overall our net new home orders of 1 103 homes were flat compared with the prior year and reflected an order pace that was closer to historical averages than last year s outsized first quarter pace we continue to see strength in the entry level and first time move up buyer segments which combined represented 83 of both our q1 closings and backlog as of the end of the quarter these needs based consumers are responding well to our communities that offer a tangible housing at or below market median prices in summary we re encouraged by the start of our year and remain focused on delivering on our growth plans and other strategic objectives all with a view toward generating attractive returns to our shareholders in 2019 and beyond with that i will now turn the call over to matt for additional commentary on our first quarter operations matt matt zaist president and chief executive officer thanks bill the first quarter of 2019 played out generally as we had expected and reflected a nice rebound from the volatility experienced late last year net new home orders for the first quarter were flat compared to last year s very strong first quarter and the order cadence accelerated each month as the quarter progressed january s 2 4 sales per community were a bit light relative to historical figures but it did reflect the sequential improvement over the 2 2 sales per community per month in december of 2018 the absorption pace was incrementally better in february at 2 9 sales per month and that picked up meaningfully in march to 4 1 sales per month bringing us back in line with historical norms similar to our increase in absorption rates we experienced a decrease in our month over month cancellation rate with a 21 cancellation rate in january decreasing to 14 in february and further decreasing to 13 in march for an overall cancellation rate for the quarter of 16 from a demand perspective our top performing markets during the quarter were colorado arizona and texas all of which experienced absorption rates well in excess of the company average much of our success in these markets can be attributed to our focus on the entry level buyer segment where we are seeing tremendous consumer response to our high quality and competitively priced product colorado was our strongest performer in the quarter in terms of year over year performance recording 172 net new home orders which is a 19 improvement over last year while selling for four fewer communities our monthly sales pace in colorado during the first quarter increased 63 year over year to 5 2 sales per community the changes we have made in products and strategic focus in that market continue to pay dividends specifically our introduction of townhome and small lot detached homes selling at prices well below the median sales price of new homes in the denver msa arizona continues to perform very well as it generated a first quarter absorption rate of 4 1 sales per community per month which was driven by attractively positioned new community openings including both market rate and active adult products sales pace at our entry level price points in arizona for the first quarter was 6 2 sales per community per month our meridian master plan community continues to lead the way for that division with healthy sales activity at all price points and accounted for 80 of our division s orders we continue to be pleased with our performance in central texas which we view as one of the best new home markets in the country and where we have quickly grown into a top five builder in austin in texas we offer a range of affordable new detached homes targeting predominantly the entry level buyer during the first quarter our central texas operations led the company with 264 net new home orders which translated into a monthly absorption pace of 3 7 sales per community breaking out austin specifically we experienced a monthly absorption pace of 4 3 in washington we experienced a reasonably healthy absorption pace during the first quarter picking up from the low levels realized in the back half of 2018 last year the economic engine that drives seattle caused the housing market to become a bit overheated and affordability concerns grew alongside significant price appreciation and the rise in interest rates our team made certain price reductions that we have now seen consumer demand improve with a lower rate environment and the appropriate pricing levels on our communities overall the sales pace in washington was 3 2 sales per community per month in the first quarter of 19 the fastest pace in several quarters in southern california one of our biggest challenges last quarter was the increase in cancellation rates in the inland empire during the first quarter the inland empire s cancellation rate returned to a more normal level decreasing 600 basis points from the fourth quarter of last year and our monthly absorption rate in the ie was 2 8 sales per community turning to the coastal southern california market our monthly absorption rate was 2 7 sales per community we continue to see strong performance out of our ovation active adult project in orange county which had a monthly sales rate significantly higher than the socal average looking forward we remain extremely excited about our seven new communities in our novel park master plan opening in the second quarter and expect these projects to be a meaningful contributor to the company over the coming year in northern california we experienced a monthly sales pace of 2 7 homes per community during the quarter we were closing out several communities as we prepare to transition from our very successful bayshores project into our new sohay master plan sohay will represent three new entry level and first time move up communities which will also open for sale in q2 on last quarter s call we mentioned we are closely watching the portland and las vegas markets and i d say these continue to be our two most challenging divisions from a demand standpoint in oregon for us it s a tale of two buyer segments the entry level and first time move up consumers continue to drive the market at a combined absorption level of 3 3 sales per community per month above the 2 4 monthly sales pace for the market as a whole across all of our price points the higher price point offerings had encountered more resistance based on affordability constraints we ve also been a bit gapped out recently on our more affordable small lot detached offerings in this market we are focused on bringing additional product to the market to address this need the data remains somewhat of a challenge from a sales perspective as we have not seen the same rebound that we ve experienced in some of our other markets we are repositioning our products in certain of our projects to offer better affordability we re also focusing our sales and marketing spend in the division on driving the right traffic to these projects our dollar value of orders for the first quarter of 2019 was approximately 500 million which is down 17 year over year the year over year decline is driven primarily by a lower asp of orders due to mix including a full quarter of operations on our central texas division and our continued focus on the entry level buyer segment in addition certain of our higher asp divisions such as coastal southern california and northern california produced fewer orders on a relative basis because of gapping up and timing of bringing on new communities our backlog conversion rate for the quarter was a very strong 91 the highest backlog conversion rate we ve achieved in several years we sold and closed nearly double the amount of specs compared to last year and those sales represented 41 of all homes closed during the quarter our average community count for the first quarter was 118 up from the 84 average communities during the prior year we continue to expect to be selling out approximately 125 new home communities by the end of the second quarter for a discussion on our financial results i ll turn the call over to colin before wrapping up with some commentary on our outlook for the remainder of 2019 colin severn senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you matthew total homebuilding revenue for the first quarter of 2019 was 454 million as compared to 372 million in the year ago period an increase of 22 the increase in home sales revenue was primarily due to a 28 increase in the number of homes delivered partially offset by a 5 decline in asp during the first quarter our homebuilding gross profit increased to 73 million up 12 compared to the first quarter of 2018 and our adjusted homebuilding gross profit also increased 10 to 93 million gaap gross margins for the first quarter were 16 compared to 17 5 in the year ago period the year over year decline in gross margins was due primarily to the increased incentives that we ve mentioned previously incentives as a percentage of revenue per homes closed during the first quarter were 3 3 compared to 2 2 last year our adjusted homebuilding gross margin percentage was 20 5 during the first quarter and 22 7 in the year ago period our sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 5 6 of homebuilding revenue as compared to 6 1 in the year ago quarter the 50 basis point improvement was primarily due to improved leverage on the higher revenue as well as a decrease in advertising and model operations expense general and administrative expenses were 6 4 of homebuilding revenue compared to 6 6 in the first quarter of 2018 these combined for a total sg a expense of 12 for the quarter a 70 basis point improvement over the year ago period and 100 basis points better than our expectations income from our unconsolidated mortgage joint ventures was approximately 1 million consistent with the first quarter of 2018 on last quarter s call we mentioned that we are on track to have a full suite of financial services available to our homebuyers on a wholly owned basis later this year we ve continued to make progress on this strategic initiative year to date under our recently launched closingmark financial group brand we launched our title agency business in texas during q1 and expect to launch title and settlement services operations in our other markets through the next two quarters in april we also closed on the acquisition of a small mortgage platform for a relatively de minimis amount of net cash the operation is currently licensed in all of our existing markets and has all of the gse seller servicer approvals as well as ginnie mae authorization we anticipate integrating our existing mortgage joint venture operations and loan pipeline into this platform under the closingmark brand over the next over the course of the next two quarters turning back to the quarter pretax income for q1 was 20 million up from the 15 4 million in the year ago quarter our provision for income taxes during the first quarter was 4 9 million or an effective tax rate of approximately 24 driven by onetime discrete items related to stock compensation expense that impacted the provision during the quarter by approximately 700 000 we would anticipate our income tax rate to be approximately 21 in q2 and blend to an all in rate of 21 to 22 for the full year income attributable to noncontrolling interest was 7 million during the quarter up from 4 3 million in the year ago period the higher than expected minority interest figure was driven primarily by an additional phase of deliveries in a joint venture project in southern california not previously expected to close in q1 net income available to common stockholders during the first quarter was 8 1 million or 0 21 per diluted share based on 38 8 million fully diluted shares our land acquisition spend for the first quarter was 71 million including land acquisition and horizontal development costs we expect to continue to moderate our land spend at a level consistent with our long term leverage goals while also strategically allocating capital to our markets as of the end of the quarter our total lot count of owned and controlled lots was 28 842 option lots accounted for 38 of our total lot inventory as is typical we expect cash flow generation to be more significant in the back half of the year we intend to drive balance sheet improvement through accretion of earnings as well as reduction in the principal amount of our indebtedness and expect to see meaningful improvement in our leverage metrics this year now turning to our balance sheet we ended the quarter with 2 6 billion in real estate inventories 2 9 billion in total assets and total equity of 1 billion we ended the quarter with total liquidity of approximately 290 million including our cash balance and the availability under our revolving credit facility our total debt to book capitalization was 57 4 at the end of the quarter and our net debt to net book capitalization was 56 6 we remain focused on achieving our leverage goals and we anticipate continuing to drive leverage down over the course of the next two years now i ll turn it back to matt matt zaist president and chief executive officer thanks colin before we open up the call to your questions i d like to provide some additional information regarding our near term outlook for the second quarter of 2019 we are expecting new home deliveries of between 1 000 and 1 050 which would represent a backlog conversion rate of 84 to 88 we expect asp per delivery during the second quarter to be between 455 000 and 465 000 we expect the gaap gross margins for the second quarter to be flat compared to the first quarter we had previously forecasted a sequential improvement in gross margins based on incentives trending lower for a majority of our projects and a majority of our operating divisions the sequential improvement is holding true however based on the current variability in our division margins as well as the timing of certain project closings this is how we see the second quarter mix playing out we do continue to expect to see improvement in divisional margins as we move through the subsequent quarters our expected sg a percentage for the second quarter is expected to be 11 7 between 11 7 and 12 and we anticipate income attributable to our noncontrolling interest of approximately 3 million to 3 5 million during q2 for the full year we remain focused on delivering as many homes as we can we experienced a fair amount of volatility in the back half of last year as well as the beginning of this year while we re encouraged by the better start to the spring selling season we d like to get through the balance of the season before providing any full year guidance metrics consistent with our comments on the year end conference call we intend to moderate land spend and generate positive cash flow this year to improve our balance sheet metrics including lowering overall indebtedness in addition to accreting earnings throughout the year i d now like to open up the call to your questions operator we re ready for the first question questions answers operator our first question comes from the line of alan ratner with zelman associates your line is now open alan ratner zelman and associates analyst so first question just on the activity through the quarter good to see the sales pace accelerating nicely through march just hoping you could talk a little bit about what were you doing on the pricing front as those absorptions were improving were you able to pull back at all on those incentives that you were offering earlier on maybe even raise price in some communities and did that momentum continue into april matt zaist president and chief executive officer yes good question alan so first yes i would say that as we look at incentives in backlog and expected incentives and closings we are seeing that number on a percentage basis come down and as i mentioned part of q2 a little bit is mixed but six of our nine operating divisions are all seeing sequential improvement in margins we got one that s flat and a couple that are down as i mentioned we ve got a couple of divisions that have been a bit harder to reenergize and we ve got to make sure that we re priced appropriately in those couple of markets and look as we ve stated january was still below our expectations while it was incrementally better from december i d say as we move into the back half of february and obviously march feeling much better about the consumers mentality from a pricing power perspective look we re seeing the ability to get some net gains in central texas austin in particular phoenix continues to be a market where we re seeing incremental pricing power definitely denver i d also say on a positive front coastal california continues to be significantly better certainly compared to the back half of last year our southern california coastal markets our q1 backlog was about 750 000 the new home median when you combine l a orange and san diego counties are in excess of that and we ve got in orange county fha loan limit and coastal loan limit of 726 000 so markets where we ve got availability of good financing options and we find that sweet spot of being below kind of that new home median or where we re really trying to see and encouraged to see some pretty favorable dynamics looking at april again we go through an audit process of orders so i don t want to give a specific number yet but overall april was pretty solid for us certainly march had the benefit of 31 days and five full weekends april we closed our sales offices for both good friday and easter sunday and then we had the passover holiday in between there so we ended up with 28 sales days in april kind of adjusting for kind of those types of differences april had a very similar feel to march so look encouraged and again this is a period of time when we should be feeling optimistic about our business i think we want to make sure we get through the selling season and continue to feel so and in which time we ll give you guys a bit more guidance relative to how we see the full year alan ratner zelman and associates analyst that s very helpful matt really appreciate that and then second question if i could maybe this is for bill or matt if you want to chime in just the announcement this morning regarding the limited waiver to pursue a possible business combo just curious what the thinking what the story there is if you can offer any color and the stock is up a lot year to date but still below book value so i m sure the valuation is playing a role in that to some extent matt zaist president and chief executive officer alan it s matt i ll maybe just start it and then i ll take it to bill for any comments that he might have first as we noted in our earnings release this morning the company s board of directors granted bill s request for a limited section 203 waiver the board felt that granting this waiver provides bill and his family with the flexibility to engage with other potential co investors and potentially make a proposal back to our board that may be in the best interest of the company and all of its stockholders that s kind of how we re viewing it from the company s perspective but i ll let bill chime in on any commentary that he might have bill lyon executive chairman and chairman of the board yes so this is bill from the family s perspective i would say we ve been pretty disappointed in the way the market has valued the company at a discount to both book and tangible book values for the last several quarters especially in light of some strong revenue results and a record year last year and the family wanted to have the optionality to explore alternatives consistent with our long term investment goals there s nothing imminent i m not actively engaged in any transaction with the company but circumstances may arise which would cause me to consider doing so from time to time third party financing sources or potential partners have inquired whether i might be interested in exploring a go private transaction and removing the 203 impediment provides me and the family the best optionality to explore any opportunities which might arise matt zaist president and chief executive officer and you know alan i think i would just maybe close by look i think at this point in time from the company s perspective is that s pretty clear as to what we ve granted to bill and then i think for any more information beyond kind of bill s statement there i d just refer people to bill s 13 d filing which is available on the sec s website alan ratner zelman and associates analyst thanks for that guys i appreciate it good luck operator our next question comes from the line of michael rehaut with jp morgan your line is now open mike rehaut j p morgan analyst thanks good morning everyone first question just a little bit more on the gross margin trajectory matt you kind of mentioned that 2q being flat instead of looking for it to be up a little bit or up some amount i don t know if you said a little bit but first quarter also just came a little bit shy of guidance you said that i guess six out of nine divisions are still experiencing sequential improvement but so it sounded like the flat sequential guidance was more due to mix so just want to make sure if i m understanding that right and secondly on a full year basis how should we be thinking i know obviously you haven t given guidance for the back half but we were previously expecting a step up into the 17 mid to high 17 type of range given the current incentive backdrop i just was curious if you had any thoughts around the ability to achieve that type of range matt zaist president and chief executive officer well a couple of things one as i can t give any guidance for full year so i guess i said we ll come back to you as we move through the balance of the selling season on that point look it s purely mix driven as we look at kind of the flat guide and it s look we went through an acquisition last year where what we ve burned through the purchase accounting step up on the whip we do mark all the land and there s step up that is applied to every asset when you buy a company and i would say right now texas and the inland empire is lower than company average and look they ve been selling really well and as we re moving through assets that were stepped up and as we re bringing on new assets in particular in texas we see the gross margin trajectory in those divisions moving higher as we move through the year the good news is sales are really strong in both of those divisions and we re going to deliver some pretty significant volume out of texas and the inland empire in q2 as we also did in q1 and so that can move things around a little bit as it relates to the back half of the year mike northern california which we know for a couple of years had our bayshores project which you know that that division had the highest gross margins in the company we re closing out the final few literally handful of units this quarter sohay is opening this quarter but that s going to deliver units in the back half of this year as well as some very positive things coming out of southern california as we move through the back half of this year too relative to current company average gross margins so i m not going to give you a full year run rate mike but i think the mix for us is again pretty easy for us to kind of understand the why that s candidly a couple of divisions are selling better than we thought at some lower margins but turning good cash flow q1 look we also there too had some outstanding specs as bill mentioned in his prepared comments we went into this year with a higher spec count we sold a lot more specs than we had anticipated given our q1 backlog conversion guide and look standing inventory is going to have a higher incentive on it than something that s in process for a dirt sale so that little kind of led into that 20 basis point differential in q1 s results mike rehaut j p morgan analyst so just so i understand your answer mark matt i m sorry before i ask my second question i mean and again i appreciate not having the full year guidance or the back half guidance but given the different moving pieces that you alluded to do you still expect at a basic level some sequential improvement second half versus first half matt zaist president and chief executive officer yes mike rehaut j p morgan analyst ok just also second question just kind of clarification on the announcement with regard to the limited waiver and bill i appreciate your comments there giving a little bit further clarity you mentioned that this would give the ability to enter into arrangements with unaffiliated co investors that you kind of pointed toward i guess one avenue as a go private transaction that you said over periods of time you ve been approached around that possibility just wanted to understand and maybe it s more just in terms of the legal or the language around the announcement does the limited waiver just allow for a go private transaction or is it also allowed for a broader range of transactions in other words selling public to public m a or acquired through a private builder other types of combinations so to speak matt zaist president and chief executive officer mike it s matt first look i think bill gave his kind of prepared comments in the prior question relative to your add on question look i would say this look bill made a 13d filing and we made a waiver under certain delaware statute i know for a fact that the big bank that you work for has got a few attorneys that work for and i would just suggest bill and i are not lawyers so we re not going to go through what the ins and outs of that means so i would just potentially direct you to somebody who can give you the ins and outs of the statute that we waived mike rehaut j p morgan analyst thank you operator our next question comes from the line of scott schrier with citi your line is now open scott schrier citi analyst hi good morning gentlemen so closings came in well above guidance and we ve been hearing that from some other builders there s been a lot of spec inventory on the ground so you people are trying to move it and my original question was going to be does this imply some kind of pull forward in what you re originally planning in 2q but it seems like from your numbers that you give that you expect for 2q relative to where consensus expectations are it seems like there s a lot of momentum there and i m curious in your thought process is if you could kind of delineate maybe what s coming from spec versus what s coming from backlog sales in that 2q number matt zaist president and chief executive officer well i think we and again obviously we ve got the benefit of kind of what we ve been experiencing in april but scott look what you said is correct i mean look we sold better than expected in q1 i think our backlog conversion rate for q2 is expected to also be solid and that s because of the sales activity we saw in march and as i ve mentioned april saw a good healthy sales activity it s pretty balanced between what s in backlog and then obviously at the end of q1 what we sold thus far in april to close and look our expectations are we ll continue to sell houses in may that will be part of that full backlog conversion guide we ve got a different spec strategy in obviously every market that we operate in but those markets that have a higher percentage of entry level products are going to have more product on the ground available to sell in shorter escrows scott schrier citi analyst got it and then on the sg a front can you talk a little bit about maybe some of the trends that you re expecting are we going to see more leverage or do you when you look you at areas where that you mentioned such as texas with your new acquisition and strategy there and some of the things in the inland empire do you need to invest more in the sg a front there or do we expect we re at a point where we re going to continue to get an sg a leverage matt zaist president and chief executive officer yes good question maybe i ll take that to colin colin severn senior vice president and chief financial officer yes so relative to the guidance we gave for q2 we re seeing trends similar to previous years where sg a is a little bit higher in the beginning of the year then trending down as we move through so the way we think about it is from a cadence perspective we d expect that trend this year in 2019 to be similar to 2018 scott schrier citi analyst great thanks for that i appreciate it operator our next question comes from the line of jay mccanless with wedbush your line is now open jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst hey good morning was going to ask of the 1 000 to 1 050 closings for 2q 19 what percentage of those do you expect to sell and close during the quarter matt zaist president and chief executive officer jay i don t know that there s a kind of a net impact right we ve got i d say roughly it s about 30 there s some ins and outs associated with that but we ve got our going in backlog that s always expected to close we always have certain construction delays that kind of push some units there s some amount of cancellation and then there s specs that are sold to close during the course of the quarter but net net i d say somewhere in the high 20s to 30 would be our expectation jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst yes that s more positive because that s one of the things i ve been wondering this earning season is how much of this closing momentum in 2q is actually coming just from more aggressive spec sales versus what seems from your answer to be a little bit better demand on the ground than what we saw during the back half of the year my other question is on matt zaist president and chief executive officer jay maybe just to add on to that i mean look i think one of the things that we saw in the back half of last year is if you think through the lens of that entry level buyer that obviously saw price appreciation in a number of markets but as rates rose that really did freeze them out pushed them to the sidelines and i think as rates have abated this year the attractiveness on that spec inventory for that first time buyer is hey i can now afford that house that i wanted to buy last year that i just physically was unable to do so or was concerned about based on about the monthly payments so all in all i think that the change in the backdrop of the rate environment as well as consumer confidence i think definitely played a role in that it s not just aggressive pricing on standing inventory or spec homes jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst the second question that i had is around pricing power and if you express it as a percentage of total communities where right now do you think you re getting net pricing power where your base price increases are bigger than the incentives you have to throw out there matt zaist president and chief executive officer i would say austin denver phoenix recent openings in orange county and selectively starting to see that in seattle again which is encouraging jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst and then just my last one very quickly is are you seeing any land price discounts are some of these land sellers especially in markets like portland where we ve seen median prices coming down in california or median prices have started to flatten out are you seeing some land sellers maybe break the price a little bit and try to generate some of their own volume matt zaist president and chief executive officer yes i think it s what i think markets where we ve seen home prices reset look land is really kind of the fungible components of home price appreciation or depreciation and so look i think we ve seen some deals in seattle that have definitely reset portland is a market where we re seeing some land reset the inland empire we re definitely seeing some reset there coastally in california look even though the bay area has seen a pullback look there s not a bunch of for us the bay area is very specific to the south bay and east bay markets it s not like there s a bunch of available land sitting on the ground and it is highly competitive it s very tight the same would hold true for l a orange and san diego counties we just i think land sellers are willing to be patient and allow for market conditions to settle and we haven t really seen any reset in those markets las vegas is a market where look i think it depends on the buyer segment for sure and as a company we ve been at the one market where we ve been probably more exposed to the move up markets as opposed to the core entry level markets and i think we re seeing some reset in the move up markets in the greater las vegas region jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst great thanks for taking my questions operator our next question comes from the line of alex barron with housing research center you line is now open alex barron housing research center analyst i wanted to talk about the margins so i think i heard you correct that you expect flat margins for next quarter is that correct matt zaist president and chief executive officer yes that s correct alex barron housing research center analyst ok what about any guidance you can give toward the back half but it sounded like these guys are using incentives to drive some of the sales so would you expect the back half to be somewhat similar or would you expect maybe a bit of a pickup for some other product mix reason or anything like that matt zaist president and chief executive officer yes alex i think mike rehaut asked that same question a couple of analysts ago look i d go back and reference what i previously stated to him but we again the flatness in q2 is mix related divisional mix related relative to contributions we say that six of our nine divisions are showing sequential improvement in gross margins quarter over quarter we have a period of time where we gapped out in our northern california division which is a high gross margin market for us and we expect it to continue to do so and we ve got community openings here in the second quarter that will produce deliveries primarily late in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter so we would expect to see back half lift in gms but we re not going to give specific s guide on what that is at this point in time alex barron housing research center analyst ok and when you mentioned that the land spend might be a little bit less is that just due to waiting for land cost to go down or because you feel you have enough at this point matt zaist president and chief executive officer no look i think consistent with the statements we ve made in the past look i think we view with our land book we ve got good accessibility to lots that are going to allow us to continue to grow within our existing footprints and so our expectation by moderating land spend is based on what we have available we ve done a good job of increasing the percentage of lots controlled or optioned versus owned and look we want to continue to make meaningful improvement on our balance sheet metrics and as colin said in his prepared remarks we anticipate lowering overall indebtedness as we move through this quarter or throughout this year and through less debt and increasing of earnings we want to improve the debt to cap metrics definitely operator and that concludes today s question and answer session i d like to turn the call back to matt zaist for closing remarks matt zaist president and chief executive officer all right well i d like to thank you all for joining us today we look forward to speaking with you next quarter have a great day operator

expansion activities these efforts are in full swing and are beginning to show progress they are a central component of our new strategic plan that as we mentioned on our last call we intend to share with you in more detail later this year during our first quarter tennant posted mixed results but results that began to reflect a more intense focus on profitable growth looking at sales performance tennant posted a decline in net sales during the first quarter which was a combination of negative organic sales and negative impact due to currency our organic results primarily reflect a couple of factors the first is a challenging sales comparison due to the large level of strategic account sales in the prior period industry market softness was also a contributing factor specifically in the united kingdom looking at earnings performance as i previously noted our focus on ebitda expansion is playing a more significant role in our decision making at tennant increasingly we are focused on prioritizing sales efforts where our value proposition is strongest optimizing our operations and supply chain and mitigating external factors impacting our margins our early efforts positively impacted both our gross margin and ebitda performance this quarter gross margin in the 2019 first quarter jumped 120 basis points year over year like many industrial companies we continue to face macro driven factors including tariffs tight skilled labor markets material inflation and higher freight costs our gross margin performance in the quarter benefited from tennant s positive impact from pricing actions favorable channel mix and our efforts to mitigate those prevailing headwinds as a result our gross margin performance along with disciplined expense management we improved ebitda by 17 or 200 basis points over last year all in all we are pleased with the progress we made this quarter on profitability improvement and fully intend to build on this momentum as you may know tennant has built its reputation on innovation and finding creative ways to bring new compelling solutions to our customers earlier this month tennant announced an agreement to supply our autonomous t7 amr solution to walmart this is just one example of tennant s position as a leader developing innovations that can help all our customers and in this case a large strategic customer with sophisticated needs run their businesses more safely efficiently and profitably the application of robotic cleaning technology is a promising emerging trend and the advantages for our customers will be substantial this relationship with walmart represents an important first step towards broader adoption of autonomous cleaning equipment in the marketplace we are pleased by how our t7 amrs are being received and we are very excited by the promising role robotics will play in our future we believe we have the first mover advantage at large scale commercialization of this technology and we intend to fully capitalize on it during the first quarter we also announced our decision to relocate our corporate headquarters to neighboring eden prairie minnesota this move will give tennant several advantages by allowing us to repurpose our current headquarters to optimize our manufacturing operations and drive efficiencies at this location adding space to accommodate additional growth helping attract and retain talent and allowing for better collaboration by bringing together the roughly 500 employees who are currently spread among separate buildings around our current headquarters location ultimately this move underscores our commitment to strengthening tennant for the future we intend to complete the move in the first half of 2020 now i ll ask keith to take you through tennant s first quarter financial results keith keith woodward thank you chris in my comments today references to earnings per share both gaap and non gaap are on a fully diluted basis as chris stated we are committed to building strength across our entire enterprise with a particular emphasis on ebitda dollar growth and expansion our performance in the first quarter illustrates progress along these lines as well as some challenges most of those challenges took the form of tougher sales comparisons as we lacked strong growth in strategic accounts last year for the first quarter of 2019 tennant reported net sales of 262 5 million that was down 3 8 which included a 3 4 reduction from currency translation a reduction of 0 8 on an organic basis and a positive plus 0 4 impact from our gaomei acquisition turning to the bottom line our first quarter 2019 reported net earnings grew 64 to 5 4 million or 0 29 per share on an adjusted basis net earnings grew 82 to 9 1 million or 0 49 per share as i will explain more in a moment we are encouraged by our margin and ebitda improvement in the quarter and continue to strive for more progress now let s examine our sales results we group sales into three geographies the americas which includes all of north america and latin america emea which covers europe the middle east and africa and asia pacific which includes china japan australia and other asian markets sales in the americas region declined 1 1 but actually increased 0 3 on an organic basis the increase reflects strong latin america sales with strength in mexico and was partially offset by a challenging comparison to last year s strong strategic account activity in the region it s important to note sales contributions from our recently announced partnership with walmart for our autonomous cleaners did not contribute significantly to the quarter we expect this contribution to gradually ramp up over the course of the year and into 2020 onto emea reported sales in this region were down 12 or 5 organically and were primarily impacted by two factors the first like the americas emea sales also reflected the comparison to last year s strong strategic account and distributed channel activity and secondly emea sales during the period also reflect some general industry market softness in the united kingdom looking at the asia pacific region we are pleased with the sales performance in this geography during q1 reported sales were up 10 3 or 8 4 organically reflecting broad strength across the region we were also happy to finalize the closing of the acquisition of gaomei this january and look forward to them becoming a solid contributor to this region as we move forward now turning to margins and expenses as chris pointed out our focus on ebitda growth in addition to renovation is increasingly guiding our decision making and we are pursuing broad based initiatives designed to address this while we still have more progress to make we are encouraged by our gross margin and ebitda improvements during the 2019 first quarter gross margin improved to 41 2 up 120 basis points year over year the improvement was led by a favorable channel mix and positive pricing actions as well as our ongoing efforts to mitigate the impacts of prevailing macro headwinds such as tariffs raw material price inflations and higher freight costs taking a look at r d and s a expense levels r d spend as a percentage of sales decreased 20 basis points year over year as we ve stated before we are committed to investing in r d at levels that allow us to remain competitive meet our customer needs and sustain our leadership position as a top innovator in the industry we also continued our practice of proactive s a discipline during the quarter adjusted s a expenses were down 3 7 on an absolute basis and roughly flat as a percentage of sales ebitda remains an important profitability measure for tennant we are pleased with our ebitda dollar growth and expansion during the quarter growing 17 or up 200 basis points to 11 2 this reflects our holistic focus on the entire p l and balancing top line initiatives while managing costs with strategic growth investments as we look ahead we will continue to focus on the activities that can help us improve our ebitda performance including expanding organic revenue driving operational cost leverage working to offset macro headwinds such as inflation tariffs and other cost of goods pressures and tightly managing controllable expense turning now to cash flow capital allocation and balance sheet items tennant used 11 6 million in cash for operations for the first quarter primarily for inventory expansion to support future sales and employee compensation and benefit related payments during the quarter the company paid down an additional 8 million in outstanding debt and paid another 4 million in cash dividends to shareholders as stated in today s earnings announcement we are reaffirming our 2019 guidance which is as follows net sales of 1 15 billion to 1 17 billion with organic sales growth in the range of 2 to 3 full year reported gaap earnings of 2 05 to 2 25 per diluted share adjusted eps of 2 30 to 2 50 per diluted share adjusted ebitda of 129 million to 133 million capital expenditures of approximately 40 million to 45 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 20 with that we will open the call to your questions question and answer session operator your first question comes from the line of chris moore from cjs securities your line is open chris moore hey good morning guys thanks for taking some questions good morning maybe just kind of bigger picture obviously when you think of tennant you think of first thing you think of is equipment sales but that said it seems like kind of a service model approach is becoming increasingly important can you talk to that a little bit and kind of how that model s evolving chris killingstad i can talk to that no i mean service i d actually refer to service as our secret sauce i mean if you look at a market like north america where we really have the only national both direct sales and service footprint it is an important competitive advantage and i think it s one of the reasons that we actually won the walmart business as well so service and then and the p c business collectively have always been around 30 of sales they hover in that direction but i think as we go forward with a new strategic plan one of the emphasis areas is going to be to see how we can further leverage our service model to drive more equipment business but also to drive more parts and consumables business as we ve said the margins on the service labor are not all that interesting but the margins on our p c business are extremely attractive and today we re not getting our fair share that s our judgment and we re going to strive to grow that much more aggressively as we go forward chris moore helpful does the on the autonomous scrubber side of things does that change anything is that the kind of service component of that is that more important less important or maybe talk to that kind of whole revenue model a bit more chris killingstad right well i think with walmart it s still evolving but i our judgment is that it s going to become increasingly more important because not only are we having to service the machine and all the cleaning components but you have all the robotic component as well and the software updating that used to take place on a regular basis and so the coordination between us and brain which is our partner on that front is going to be crucial as part of our service model so i would say that service in the autonomous space is an even more important component of our value proposition going forward chris moore got it thank you gross margins were obviously quite strong this quarter you talked about the different pieces that were driving that so looking at it from more of a perhaps a fiscal 19 perspective is that the new normal or is it likely to especially with that strategic accounts become more important up and down is it is that 41 2 likely to slide back a little bit keith woodward chris this is keith i would say it s likely to slide back a little bit what we ve said about autonomous cleaning and the autonomous t7 is that it s slightly below from a gross margin standpoint versus our company average but it s accretive from an ebitda percentage so as we start to ramp that up here in the back half we would expect to see a little bit of pressure there as well as just the ongoing tariffs and inflation that we expect to hit us so probably we ll slide back a bit chris moore got it last question just maybe talk about ipc a little bit i mean the acquisition was almost two years ago it still feels like there is some integration taking place is that accurate and if it is kind of which areas are still a bit of work in process chris killingstad yes i mean i think as we ve said the ipc acquisition has and continues to exceed our expectations but we re in the middle of doing a lot of the heavy lifting on the integration of the key countries the u k germany france and spain bringing the two teams together the tennant team and the ipc team together and basically creating a new operating model so i would say here over the last three four five months maybe we ve been a little bit more internally focused as we have tried to get that right but we are kind of at the later stages of all that effort and our belief is that once in place and we turn outward again the benefits of the integration are going to be significant operator your next question come from the line of marco rodriguez from stonegate capital marco rodriguez i was wondering if maybe you could talk a little bit more about the organic growth expectations obviously you have the guidance of 2 to 3 for fiscal 19 maybe if you could just talk a little bit about how you kind of expect that organic growth to fold out through the remaining three quarters just kind of given the fact that you had real strong strategic account growth last year chris killingstad yes no we re lapping very strong strategic account growth one of the strongest year over year we ve ever had so that s a challenge but the fact is we re sticking to our revenue guidance a little bit behind in the first quarter but if you look at our backlog and you look at the visibility we have to the pipeline going forward we re confident that we can get to those numbers and we will be accretive on the base business without walmart amr keith woodward i d also add to that marco just to say we re going to be very focused on getting out the profitability that makes sense for us and the returns that we want so we re just going to be disciplined about that as we go forward and managing it accordingly so you ll see us just continue and that s incorporated in our 2 to 3 guidance marco rodriguez got you okay and then if you could talk a little bit here about your expectations just on the geographies and your expectations in terms of the organic growth rates there chris killingstad well we said we should have organic growth in all three geographies again this year that is our expectation good news is that asia pacific is which we ve struggled with that part of the business for a while had extremely strong results in the first quarter i m not sure we can maintain it at quite that level but we should have robust organic growth there for the rest of the year if you look at emea we ve grown in the mid single digits in the last 2 years expect to maintain that kind of growth in emea and the north america has been our growth engine for many many years now so it s a pretty consistent track record of delivering decent organic sales growth and that is our expectation going forward keith woodward the other thing i d add to that too marco is north america keep in mind the ramp up of walmart amr is coming in the second third and fourth quarter so that will help us as well as we go forward in the americas region marco rodriguez got you then kind of shifting gears here to the operating expense side i heard the commentary you had on r d the growth rate has been kind of on the downside here for the last couple of years and you ve had a pretty significant year over year decline can you maybe just help frame a little bit more the r d it seems to be a bit of a change in strategic direction i understand obviously you want to spend to make sure that you re competitive consistently in the marketplace but just kind of help us understand a little bit more as far as where that sort of kind of levels out chris killingstad the first thing that we look at is how robust is our new product pipeline in terms of meeting the greatest needs in the marketplace and right now we find that we basically are able to fully fund all the major programs including amr with the budget that we have in place yes i mean as a percent of sales it s been under 3 on a number of occasions but also remember that we re a much bigger business now so the number of dollars we re spending against r d are higher as a percent of sales when you re a 1 1 billion 1 2 billion business i think that over time they gradually decline little bit but we as the innovation leader are single mindedly focused on this and we will never allow our innovation agenda our r d agenda to be anything less than optimal to serve the needs of our customers and drive our growth keith woodward and i would build on it marco as well to say we re just getting smarter about our spend we re much more focused on where we re really addressing operator needs and spending on those areas versus maybe exploring areas where it s not truly differentiated innovation and to chris point the absolute level of our r d spending has been fairly consistent we peaked in 2016 and that was largely behind a lot of the automation with robotics and when we partnered with brain that basically took us back down to that 30 million 31 million 32 million level from kind of that 34 million 35 million level so we feel good about where we re at and the team is very focused on the right spending and getting the right returns marco rodriguez got you and then on the sg a line the adjusted number around 88 million or so in change so you obviously that there was restructuring charge as well there that stripped out just kind of want to get a better feel is that 88 5 million is that kind of a new run rate or should we be expecting additional restructuring type costs in the next couple of quarters keith woodward we have a little bit more restructuring to come for the rest of the year marco but attention is focused on 2 markets that are the biggest it s china and australia we have placed new management teams in both of those geographies over the last year or so they re kind of getting their feet on the ground and starting to operate to our expectations and the results are reflecting that the other thing we re doing is that in china for example most of our sales were driven through our distribution network and that was a little more volatile and so we ve begun to shift more and more of our effort to a direct model especially in the major metropolitan centers because that again is where we are advantaged in geographies like europe and the u s and that s also helping us drive sales and you re going to see more of that as we go forward keith woodward and then gaomei is such a critical strategic play for us too in figuring out how we continue to grow that in the mid tier piece of that market so we re excited about that chris killingstad yes so it s not material to our results yet but remember what we re trying to do with gaomei in china is what we are doing with ipc in emea right we have not traditionally had access to the mid tier markets either in emea or in china and in china it s by far the biggest part of the market so the opportunity through gaomei and china is very significant operator since there are no further questions at this time i would like to turn the call over to management for closing remarks chris killingstad all right well before we conclude i again want to thank our global tennant team members who are pushing forward on initiatives to deliver innovation to our customers and value to our shareholders we are excited as we move further into 2019 and are committed to delivering on our guidance and driving shareholder value thank you for your time today and for your questions take care everybody operator that concludes today s conference call you may now disconnect
justin s note are billionaires bad many americans on the left are asking themselves this question and alexandria ocasio cortez the democrats new rising star is certainly no exception just look at what aoc said in a recent interview it s not to say someone like bill gates for example or warren buffett are immoral people i do not believe that i do think a system that allows billionaires to exist when there are parts of alabama where people are still getting ringworm because they don t have access to public health is wrong aoc of course isn t alone two weeks ago the huffington post published a piece titled should billionaires even exist the new york times followed up a few days later when it ran a similar piece titled abolish billionaires in short class warfare is no longer just a radical leftist idea it s gone mainstream to figure out what s behind this i got doug casey on the phone below is a transcript of that conversation right on the money casey doug best price 7 46 buy new 13 68 as of 07 45 utc details justin doug class warfare is heating up in the united states and billionaires are getting the worst of it so far what do you make of this are billionaires as bad as the left says should they be allowed to exist or is that a policy failure doug well i ve said for years that the time to eat the rich would come that is of course a very bad thing here s a fact most people who are rich got that way because they re smart productive hard working and virtuous most people who are poor suffer from stupidity sloth and bad habits yes i know saying that is extremely un pc and smacks of calvinism i m very aware that some rich people are swine who stole their wealth and in today s world where the government is involved in everything and is expected to be a cornucopia increasing numbers got it by being cronies i m also very aware that there are some righteous poor who suffer from bad luck nor can everyone be helen keller or the who s tommy the deaf dumb and blind kid who nevertheless played a mean pinball that said bad luck tends to afflict the unprepared but that s another discussion the intense hostility towards the rich combined with the visceral hatred between red and blue parts of the country tells me that we re moving into a time similar to that before the french revolution or the war between the states or maybe the russian revolution and this trend is accelerating it s going to be very tumultuous for reasons i ve spelt out in past interviews it s said there are about 2 200 billionaires in the world about a quarter of them in the u s but i m sure there are many more that keep themselves under the radar certainly those who made a killing in drugs politics or other criminal activity politicians and the rich have always feathered each other s nests since government today is far far more powerful and intrusive than ever before the rich are more inclined than ever to curry favor with politicians and politicians are equally anxious to cozy up with the rich it s much easier to get a few checks with lots of zeroes after the dollar sign than cadging nickels and dimes from the unwashed many billionaires are wealthy largely because they re cronies all of them have benefited from being connected to the firehose of money created by the fed they receive favors from the government they re granted government contracts licenses monopolies and the like frankly they deserve to be eaten but those are exactly the ones who are safest the rich can make massive campaign contributions to politicians in the present and it s understood that they ll assist in paying huge speaking fees consulting fees book deals directorships seven figure employment sweetheart investment deals and the like after the pol is out of office in our interview on aoc i said she was already well on her way to her hundred million dollars she ll get that but not the traditional way with briefcases stuffed with 100 bills that no longer works in the u s because of onerous bank regulations money laundering laws and the decreasing utility of cash in addition the u s is still a relatively high trust society government officials are reasonably comfortable waiting a few years for a fat payoff it s different in the third world where trust is very limited and payoffs tend to be in cash on the barrelhead justin sure but not every billionaire exists because of government handouts right doug of course many billionaires are wealthy because they ve created immense wealth for the common man the average human should worship creative billionaires for vastly increasing his standard of living instead they prefer to apotheosize political figures and actors who throughout history have been classed with prostitutes con men and professional liars mass media and the leisure economy have inverted many traditional values the problem is that humans are essentially chimpanzees and i don t mean the gentle bonobo either as individuals they can be quite rational but they immediately fall to the lowest common denominator if you put them together it s easy to get them to hooting and panting anxious to tear apart some real or imagined enemy and a lot of that has to do with envy a much nastier vice than simple jealousy or covetousness jealousy says you have it i want it i ll take it from you that s understandable it s how the world has worked for at least 500 million years since animal life arose envy however says you have it i want it i ll not only take it from you but i ll hurt you for having it and if i can t have it i ll destroy it so you can t have it either one chimpanzee has a bunch of fat appetizing grubs and the other chimpanzees well represented by all the democrats running for president are chock full of envy i m afraid that s just the way things are on planet earth today not just with chimps but even more so with humans it s well known that earth s twenty or whatever richest people control about half of the planet s wealth and half of the people on earth have approximately nothing that doesn t seem fair an extremely dangerous word when we re talking politics so it s perfectly natural for the poor chimpanzees to try and take it away from the rich chimps they ll use the time tested method of violence in some places but the political process is a much lower risk way to get what you want if you re incapable of creating something and trading they ll vote for someone who promises to give them free stuff and even things out make things more fair that s what happened in venezuela it s what happened in zimbabwe it happens constantly in africa although sometimes things get a bit out of control as they did in rwanda twenty years ago where you ll recall a million folks were hacked up with machetes it s happened in scores of countries in just the last century it can happen anywhere the united states is no exception in fact it s starting to happen here right now justin yeah all this hate directed at billionaires and support for things like wealth taxes tells me the u s is moving closer to full blown socialism with each passing day doug well this term socialism is bandied around constantly however very few people know what it actually means let s define a few words if you can t define a word precisely then you can t really understand what you re talking about i m afraid that s true of 90 of people add to that the fact that they don t actually think they feel no wonder tempers run high when either politics or economics are discussed we revert to mimicking our cousins the chimps karl marx defined socialism as a system where the means of production farms mines schools hospitals factories and the like are owned by the people which is to say by the state socialism is supposed to be a temporary stage on the way to communism communism is a system where not only the means of production are owned by the state but where consumer goods are also common property under socialism consumer goods like cars houses retail stores handicrafts are still privately owned this ties into what fascism is another term often used descriptively but never defined fascism has nothing to do with jackboots and black uniforms those can be a part of any statist system again if you don t define words properly and precisely it means that you don t know what you re talking about let me define fascism it s an economic system where both the means of production and consumer goods are privately owned but very important they re totally regulated by the state in today s world the only real socialist countries are north korea and cuba every other country in the world is fascist in the sense that both the means of production and consumer goods are privately owned but are all regulated controlled by the state justin so you don t think there are any capitalist countries in the world doug no capitalism is a system where everything is not only privately owned but it s totally privately controlled in other words the state has no intervention or influence in the economy at all capitalism doesn t exist anywhere in the world today justin and yet people blame capitalism for all of today s problems i don t just mean some people distaste for capitalism has gone mainstream at this point there s no doubt in my mind that the democrats will rally around eating the rich during the next presidential race doug no question about it we re on the cusp of a cultural revolution not dissimilar to what china went through between the mid sixties and the mid seventies and it could totally overthrow america s most important traditions the u s has been mutating on its way to becoming another country for a long time it used to be unique and exceptional now it s just another nation state like the 200 others covering the face of the globe like a skin disease it s a major trend and cultural civilizational trends usually accelerate until they reach a crisis the thing is that most people have no understanding of economics why because economics is an intellectual matter and people are not interested in intellectual arguments they re only interested in emotional arguments justin in what sense doug the key is the difference between think and feel those words are used interchangeably which is absolutely wrong and part of the problem people don t think which means using logic reason and solid fact what they do is feel using emotion stray anecdotes and gut impressions they dramatize their buried psychological aberrations they have very nebulous undefined notions of right and wrong one thing that s for sure though they re interested in feeling like they re the good guys they want to be on the right side the moral side of issues everybody likes to feel god s on his side it doesn t matter whether it s yahweh jesus allah krishna odin or crom here s the critical thing the socialists have positioned themselves as the good guys the ones doing the moral thing and nobody with the exception of ayn rand and libertarians has ever defended capitalism on a moral basis which is actually the way it should be defended but their arguments are intellectual not emotional so they re totally lost on the average chimp the republicans are completely worthless less than worthless in this battle they re an active liability at best they make a weak effort to defend the free market based on the fact that it s productive and efficient but that s not going to cut it no wonder they re viewed correctly in my view as weak kneed sellouts hypocrites and moral cripples the average person is going to go for what he thinks is socialism because he wants to feel that he s doing the right thing i m afraid the battle is completely lost at this point the only way to change course is through intellectual arguments that s supposed to happen in school but perversely that s where arguments for socialism are made instead the average person just gets the bottom line socialist values are good and right i ll tell you what they want they want free housing free medical care free schooling free food and if it s not completely free then it should at least be subsidized they want to be taken care of what they really want is a fascist welfare state why so they can still own stocks and maybe get wealthy socialism is just kind of a buzzword for free stuff for the fascist welfare state people don t really care who owns the means of production they think stuff is produced magically justin yeah it is quite remarkable how people pin so much blame on capitalism while ignoring the fact that socialism has destroyed entire economies countless times doug and it will happen again it will ultimately result in the collapse of the economy producers will decide to hell with it i m not going to bother it s not worth it i don t want to be a milk cow for a considerable number of people it s going to be more trouble than it s worth to produce when you account for all the aggravation the risks and hard work that goes into being an entrepreneur anyway it s kind of fun having a guaranteed annual income and binging on a tv series all day is a new dark age possible of course anything is possible on both the upside and the downside there are of course some reasons for optimism one is that the average person notwithstanding socialist rhetoric and welfare state benefits is wired like a squirrel to produce more than he consumes and save the rest which creates capital another is technology which believe it or not has been advancing at the rate of moore s law for about 200 000 years it s possible that technology in the form of artificial intelligence nanotech biotech and such can advance quickly enough to create new wealth faster than stupid ideas can destroy it perhaps only a generation or two from now robots will produce everything that people need that s possible though unlikely in the short term what s more likely is that stupid ideas which also seem to be gaining ground at an exponential rate will destroy immense amounts of capital perhaps enough that there won t be sufficient pools of capital to conduct science and build new technology these things are highly capital intensive today we need large pools of capital to keep advancing the kind of pools that hated billionaires shepherd and make grow if socialists succeed in making it impossible or perhaps just unpalatable and apparently anti social to become a billionaire you re not going to have the pools of capital to keep science and technology advancing the economy and society will fall apart that s what destroyed the ussr and mao s china it s possible that we could be facing either the singularity or a new dark age i don t know which it will be it s a toss up maybe both in different areas but the best predictor isn t going to be think tanks it will be science fiction against the state an rockwell jr llewelly best price 5 02 buy new 5 52 as of 11 35 utc details there will be political ramifications i fully expect the republican party to break up into at least two but that s a subject for a different discussion however the most degraded ignorant misguided and unintelligent people are those rising to the top in the democratic party which incidentally is also going to break into at least two pieces just wait until the u s economy collapses later this year now i know i ve been very premature on this call but i m convinced it s imminent when that happens people will start losing their houses they re going to have their cars repossessed even if they don t lose their jobs they ll be unable to service all their debts they re going to go wild things will get ugly could we have a real civil war as you know i m prone to look at the bright side since half of the country is on prozac ritalin xanax and 50 other psychiatric drugs and the other half is glued to their video screens maybe people will give fighting a pass justin i hope i m outside of the states when that happens like you i d much rather watch this play out on the television preferably in a country where things are more stable doug yeah but joe louis was right you can run but you can t hide justin thanks for speaking with me today doug doug

welcome ladies and gentlemen and thank you for taking the time to join us today overall housing demand across our markets has demonstrated signs of recovery from the market pause that occurred in the back half of 2018 as interest rates have receded and consumer demand has rebounded against the backdrop of ongoing strong employment and wage growth in a broader u s economy heading into this year our operating teams made certain pricing adjustments as well as used targeted incentives to find the right balance to capitalize on the more favorable market conditions as we discussed on last quarter s conference call we sold and closed fewer spec homes during the fourth quarter of 2018 than we had anticipated our teams took advantage of this higher spec inventory during the first quarter of this year strategically targeting these homes for sale and converting these sales into closings yielding better than anticipated closings and cash flows for the company we delivered 949 homes during the quarter which is up 28 year over year and generated 454 million of home sales revenue which is up 22 from the prior year both records for our first quarter our pre tax net income for the quarter was 20 million and our after tax net income was 8 1 million or 0 21 per diluted share we ended the quarter with a william lyon homes stockholders equity of approximately 872 million and a total equity of north of 1 billion equating to an overall booked value per share as of march 31 2019 of 23 05 and a tangible book value per share of 19 62 during the first quarter we experienced improving demand as the quarter progressed which is typical for a spring selling season overall our net new home orders of 1 103 homes were flat compared with the prior year and reflected an order pace that was closer to historical averages than last year s outsized first quarter pace we continue to see strength in the entry level and first time move up buyer segments which combined represented 83 of both our q1 closings and backlog as of the end of the quarter advertisement advertisement these needs based consumers are responding well to our communities that offer a tangible housing at or below market median prices in summary we re encouraged by the start of our year and remain focused on delivering on our growth plans and other strategic objectives all with a view toward generating attractive returns to our shareholders in 2019 and beyond with that i will now turn the call over to matt for additional commentary on our first quarter operations matt matt zaist president and chief executive officer thanks bill the first quarter of 2019 played out generally as we had expected and reflected a nice rebound from the volatility experienced late last year net new home orders for the first quarter were flat compared to last year s very strong first quarter and the order cadence accelerated each month as the quarter progressed january s 2 4 sales per community were a bit light relative to historical figures but it did reflect the sequential improvement over the 2 2 sales per community per month in december of 2018 the absorption pace was incrementally better in february at 2 9 sales per month and that picked up meaningfully in march to 4 1 sales per month bringing us back in line with historical norms similar to our increase in absorption rates we experienced a decrease in our month over month cancellation rate with a 21 cancellation rate in january decreasing to 14 in february and further decreasing to 13 in march for an overall cancellation rate for the quarter of 16 from a demand perspective our top performing markets during the quarter were colorado arizona and texas all of which experienced absorption rates well in excess of the company average much of our success in these markets can be attributed to our focus on the entry level buyer segment where we are seeing tremendous consumer response to our high quality and competitively priced product advertisement advertisement colorado was our strongest performer in the quarter in terms of year over year performance recording 172 net new home orders which is a 19 improvement over last year while selling for four fewer communities our monthly sales pace in colorado during the first quarter increased 63 year over year to 5 2 sales per community the changes we have made in products and strategic focus in that market continue to pay dividends specifically our introduction of townhome and small lot detached homes selling at prices well below the median sales price of new homes in the denver msa arizona continues to perform very well as it generated a first quarter absorption rate of 4 1 sales per community per month which was driven by attractively positioned new community openings including both market rate and active adult products sales pace at our entry level price points in arizona for the first quarter was 6 2 sales per community per month our meridian master plan community continues to lead the way for that division with healthy sales activity at all price points and accounted for 80 of our division s orders we continue to be pleased with our performance in central texas which we view as one of the best new home markets in the country and where we have quickly grown into a top five builder in austin in texas we offer a range of affordable new detached homes targeting predominantly the entry level buyer during the first quarter our central texas operations led the company with 264 net new home orders which translated into a monthly absorption pace of 3 7 sales per community breaking out austin specifically we experienced a monthly absorption pace of 4 3 in washington we experienced a reasonably healthy absorption pace during the first quarter picking up from the low levels realized in the back half of 2018 last year the economic engine that drives seattle caused the housing market to become a bit overheated and affordability concerns grew alongside significant price appreciation and the rise in interest rates our team made certain price reductions that we have now seen consumer demand improve with a lower rate environment and the appropriate pricing levels on our communities overall the sales pace in washington was 3 2 sales per community per month in the first quarter of 19 the fastest pace in several quarters in southern california one of our biggest challenges last quarter was the increase in cancellation rates in the inland empire during the first quarter the inland empire s cancellation rate returned to a more normal level decreasing 600 basis points from the fourth quarter of last year and our monthly absorption rate in the ie was 2 8 sales per community advertisement advertisement turning to the coastal southern california market our monthly absorption rate was 2 7 sales per community we continue to see strong performance out of our ovation active adult project in orange county which had a monthly sales rate significantly higher than the socal average looking forward we remain extremely excited about our seven new communities in our novel park master plan opening in the second quarter and expect these projects to be a meaningful contributor to the company over the coming year in northern california we experienced a monthly sales pace of 2 7 homes per community during the quarter we were closing out several communities as we prepare to transition from our very successful bayshores project into our new sohay master plan sohay will represent three new entry level and first time move up communities which will also open for sale in q2 on last quarter s call we mentioned we are closely watching the portland and las vegas markets and i d say these continue to be our two most challenging divisions from a demand standpoint in oregon for us it s a tale of two buyer segments the entry level and first time move up consumers continue to drive the market at a combined absorption level of 3 3 sales per community per month above the 2 4 monthly sales pace for the market as a whole across all of our price points the higher price point offerings had encountered more resistance based on affordability constraints we ve also been a bit gapped out recently on our more affordable small lot detached offerings in this market we are focused on bringing additional product to the market to address this need the data remains somewhat of a challenge from a sales perspective as we have not seen the same rebound that we ve experienced in some of our other markets we are repositioning our products in certain of our projects to offer better affordability we re also focusing our sales and marketing spend in the division on driving the right traffic to these projects our dollar value of orders for the first quarter of 2019 was approximately 500 million which is down 17 year over year advertisement advertisement the year over year decline is driven primarily by a lower asp of orders due to mix including a full quarter of operations on our central texas division and our continued focus on the entry level buyer segment in addition certain of our higher asp divisions such as coastal southern california and northern california produced fewer orders on a relative basis because of gapping up and timing of bringing on new communities our backlog conversion rate for the quarter was a very strong 91 the highest backlog conversion rate we ve achieved in several years we sold and closed nearly double the amount of specs compared to last year and those sales represented 41 of all homes closed during the quarter our average community count for the first quarter was 118 up from the 84 average communities during the prior year we continue to expect to be selling out approximately 125 new home communities by the end of the second quarter for a discussion on our financial results i ll turn the call over to colin before wrapping up with some commentary on our outlook for the remainder of 2019 colin severn senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you matthew total homebuilding revenue for the first quarter of 2019 was 454 million as compared to 372 million in the year ago period an increase of 22 the increase in home sales revenue was primarily due to a 28 increase in the number of homes delivered partially offset by a 5 decline in asp during the first quarter our homebuilding gross profit increased to 73 million up 12 compared to the first quarter of 2018 and our adjusted homebuilding gross profit also increased 10 to 93 million advertisement advertisement gaap gross margins for the first quarter were 16 compared to 17 5 in the year ago period the year over year decline in gross margins was due primarily to the increased incentives that we ve mentioned previously incentives as a percentage of revenue per homes closed during the first quarter were 3 3 compared to 2 2 last year our adjusted homebuilding gross margin percentage was 20 5 during the first quarter and 22 7 in the year ago period our sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 5 6 of homebuilding revenue as compared to 6 1 in the year ago quarter the 50 basis point improvement was primarily due to improved leverage on the higher revenue as well as a decrease in advertising and model operations expense general and administrative expenses were 6 4 of homebuilding revenue compared to 6 6 in the first quarter of 2018 these combined for a total sg a expense of 12 for the quarter a 70 basis point improvement over the year ago period and 100 basis points better than our expectations income from our unconsolidated mortgage joint ventures was approximately 1 million consistent with the first quarter of 2018 on last quarter s call we mentioned that we are on track to have a full suite of financial services available to our homebuyers on a wholly owned basis later this year we ve continued to make progress on this strategic initiative year to date under our recently launched closingmark financial group brand we launched our title agency business in texas during q1 and expect to launch title and settlement services operations in our other markets through the next two quarters in april we also closed on the acquisition of a small mortgage platform for a relatively de minimis amount of net cash the operation is currently licensed in all of our existing markets and has all of the gse seller servicer approvals as well as ginnie mae authorization we anticipate integrating our existing mortgage joint venture operations and loan pipeline into this platform under the closingmark brand over the next over the course of the next two quarters turning back to the quarter advertisement advertisement pretax income for q1 was 20 million up from the 15 4 million in the year ago quarter our provision for income taxes during the first quarter was 4 9 million or an effective tax rate of approximately 24 driven by onetime discrete items related to stock compensation expense that impacted the provision during the quarter by approximately 700 000 we would anticipate our income tax rate to be approximately 21 in q2 and blend to an all in rate of 21 to 22 for the full year income attributable to noncontrolling interest was 7 million during the quarter up from 4 3 million in the year ago period the higher than expected minority interest figure was driven primarily by an additional phase of deliveries in a joint venture project in southern california not previously expected to close in q1 net income available to common stockholders during the first quarter was 8 1 million or 0 21 per diluted share based on 38 8 million fully diluted shares our land acquisition spend for the first quarter was 71 million including land acquisition and horizontal development costs we expect to continue to moderate our land spend at a level consistent with our long term leverage goals while also strategically allocating capital to our markets as of the end of the quarter our total lot count of owned and controlled lots was 28 842 option lots accounted for 38 of our total lot inventory as is typical we expect cash flow generation to be more significant in the back half of the year we intend to drive balance sheet improvement through accretion of earnings as well as reduction in the principal amount of our indebtedness and expect to see meaningful improvement in our leverage metrics this year now turning to our balance sheet we ended the quarter with 2 6 billion in real estate inventories 2 9 billion in total assets and total equity of 1 billion we ended the quarter with total liquidity of approximately 290 million including our cash balance and the availability under our revolving credit facility our total debt to book capitalization was 57 4 at the end of the quarter and our net debt to net book capitalization was 56 6 we remain focused on achieving our leverage goals and we anticipate continuing to drive leverage down over the course of the next two years now i ll turn it back to matt matt zaist president and chief executive officer thanks colin before we open up the call to your questions i d like to provide some additional information regarding our near term outlook for the second quarter of 2019 we are expecting new home deliveries of between 1 000 and 1 050 which would represent a backlog conversion rate of 84 to 88 we expect asp per delivery during the second quarter to be between 455 000 and 465 000 we expect the gaap gross margins for the second quarter to be flat compared to the first quarter we had previously forecasted a sequential improvement in gross margins based on incentives trending lower for a majority of our projects and a majority of our operating divisions the sequential improvement is holding true however based on the current variability in our division margins as well as the timing of certain project closings this is how we see the second quarter mix playing out we do continue to expect to see improvement in divisional margins as we move through the subsequent quarters our expected sg a percentage for the second quarter is expected to be 11 7 between 11 7 and 12 and we anticipate income attributable to our noncontrolling interest of approximately 3 million to 3 5 million during q2 for the full year we remain focused on delivering as many homes as we can we experienced a fair amount of volatility in the back half of last year as well as the beginning of this year while we re encouraged by the better start to the spring selling season we d like to get through the balance of the season before providing any full year guidance metrics consistent with our comments on the year end conference call we intend to moderate land spend and generate positive cash flow this year to improve our balance sheet metrics including lowering overall indebtedness in addition to accreting earnings throughout the year i d now like to open up the call to your questions operator we re ready for the first question questions answers operator our first question comes from the line of alan ratner with zelman associates your line is now open alan ratner zelman and associates analyst so first question just on the activity through the quarter good to see the sales pace accelerating nicely through march just hoping you could talk a little bit about what were you doing on the pricing front as those absorptions were improving were you able to pull back at all on those incentives that you were offering earlier on maybe even raise price in some communities and did that momentum continue into april matt zaist president and chief executive officer yes good question alan so first yes i would say that as we look at incentives in backlog and expected incentives and closings we are seeing that number on a percentage basis come down and as i mentioned part of q2 a little bit is mixed but six of our nine operating divisions are all seeing sequential improvement in margins we got one that s flat and a couple that are down as i mentioned we ve got a couple of divisions that have been a bit harder to reenergize and we ve got to make sure that we re priced appropriately in those couple of markets and look as we ve stated january was still below our expectations while it was incrementally better from december i d say as we move into the back half of february and obviously march feeling much better about the consumers mentality from a pricing power perspective look we re seeing the ability to get some net gains in central texas austin in particular phoenix continues to be a market where we re seeing incremental pricing power definitely denver i d also say on a positive front coastal california continues to be significantly better certainly compared to the back half of last year our southern california coastal markets our q1 backlog was about 750 000 the new home median when you combine l a orange and san diego counties are in excess of that and we ve got in orange county fha loan limit and coastal loan limit of 726 000 so markets where we ve got availability of good financing options and we find that sweet spot of being below kind of that new home median or where we re really trying to see and encouraged to see some pretty favorable dynamics looking at april again we go through an audit process of orders so i don t want to give a specific number yet but overall april was pretty solid for us certainly march had the benefit of 31 days and five full weekends april we closed our sales offices for both good friday and easter sunday and then we had the passover holiday in between there so we ended up with 28 sales days in april kind of adjusting for kind of those types of differences april had a very similar feel to march so look encouraged and again this is a period of time when we should be feeling optimistic about our business i think we want to make sure we get through the selling season and continue to feel so and in which time we ll give you guys a bit more guidance relative to how we see the full year alan ratner zelman and associates analyst that s very helpful matt really appreciate that and then second question if i could maybe this is for bill or matt if you want to chime in just the announcement this morning regarding the limited waiver to pursue a possible business combo just curious what the thinking what the story there is if you can offer any color and the stock is up a lot year to date but still below book value so i m sure the valuation is playing a role in that to some extent matt zaist president and chief executive officer alan it s matt i ll maybe just start it and then i ll take it to bill for any comments that he might have first as we noted in our earnings release this morning the company s board of directors granted bill s request for a limited section 203 waiver the board felt that granting this waiver provides bill and his family with the flexibility to engage with other potential co investors and potentially make a proposal back to our board that may be in the best interest of the company and all of its stockholders that s kind of how we re viewing it from the company s perspective but i ll let bill chime in on any commentary that he might have bill lyon executive chairman and chairman of the board yes so this is bill from the family s perspective i would say we ve been pretty disappointed in the way the market has valued the company at a discount to both book and tangible book values for the last several quarters especially in light of some strong revenue results and a record year last year and the family wanted to have the optionality to explore alternatives consistent with our long term investment goals there s nothing imminent i m not actively engaged in any transaction with the company but circumstances may arise which would cause me to consider doing so from time to time third party financing sources or potential partners have inquired whether i might be interested in exploring a go private transaction and removing the 203 impediment provides me and the family the best optionality to explore any opportunities which might arise matt zaist president and chief executive officer and you know alan i think i would just maybe close by look i think at this point in time from the company s perspective is that s pretty clear as to what we ve granted to bill and then i think for any more information beyond kind of bill s statement there i d just refer people to bill s 13 d filing which is available on the sec s website alan ratner zelman and associates analyst thanks for that guys i appreciate it good luck operator our next question comes from the line of michael rehaut with jp morgan your line is now open mike rehaut j p morgan analyst thanks good morning everyone first question just a little bit more on the gross margin trajectory matt you kind of mentioned that 2q being flat instead of looking for it to be up a little bit or up some amount i don t know if you said a little bit but first quarter also just came a little bit shy of guidance you said that i guess six out of nine divisions are still experiencing sequential improvement but so it sounded like the flat sequential guidance was more due to mix so just want to make sure if i m understanding that right and secondly on a full year basis how should we be thinking i know obviously you haven t given guidance for the back half but we were previously expecting a step up into the 17 mid to high 17 type of range given the current incentive backdrop i just was curious if you had any thoughts around the ability to achieve that type of range matt zaist president and chief executive officer well a couple of things one as i can t give any guidance for full year so i guess i said we ll come back to you as we move through the balance of the selling season on that point look it s purely mix driven as we look at kind of the flat guide and it s look we went through an acquisition last year where what we ve burned through the purchase accounting step up on the whip we do mark all the land and there s step up that is applied to every asset when you buy a company and i would say right now texas and the inland empire is lower than company average and look they ve been selling really well and as we re moving through assets that were stepped up and as we re bringing on new assets in particular in texas we see the gross margin trajectory in those divisions moving higher as we move through the year the good news is sales are really strong in both of those divisions and we re going to deliver some pretty significant volume out of texas and the inland empire in q2 as we also did in q1 and so that can move things around a little bit as it relates to the back half of the year mike northern california which we know for a couple of years had our bayshores project which you know that that division had the highest gross margins in the company we re closing out the final few literally handful of units this quarter sohay is opening this quarter but that s going to deliver units in the back half of this year as well as some very positive things coming out of southern california as we move through the back half of this year too relative to current company average gross margins so i m not going to give you a full year run rate mike but i think the mix for us is again pretty easy for us to kind of understand the why that s candidly a couple of divisions are selling better than we thought at some lower margins but turning good cash flow q1 look we also there too had some outstanding specs as bill mentioned in his prepared comments we went into this year with a higher spec count we sold a lot more specs than we had anticipated given our q1 backlog conversion guide and look standing inventory is going to have a higher incentive on it than something that s in process for a dirt sale so that little kind of led into that 20 basis point differential in q1 s results mike rehaut j p morgan analyst so just so i understand your answer mark matt i m sorry before i ask my second question i mean and again i appreciate not having the full year guidance or the back half guidance but given the different moving pieces that you alluded to do you still expect at a basic level some sequential improvement second half versus first half matt zaist president and chief executive officer yes mike rehaut j p morgan analyst ok just also second question just kind of clarification on the announcement with regard to the limited waiver and bill i appreciate your comments there giving a little bit further clarity you mentioned that this would give the ability to enter into arrangements with unaffiliated co investors that you kind of pointed toward i guess one avenue as a go private transaction that you said over periods of time you ve been approached around that possibility just wanted to understand and maybe it s more just in terms of the legal or the language around the announcement does the limited waiver just allow for a go private transaction or is it also allowed for a broader range of transactions in other words selling public to public m a or acquired through a private builder other types of combinations so to speak matt zaist president and chief executive officer mike it s matt first look i think bill gave his kind of prepared comments in the prior question relative to your add on question look i would say this look bill made a 13d filing and we made a waiver under certain delaware statute i know for a fact that the big bank that you work for has got a few attorneys that work for and i would just suggest bill and i are not lawyers so we re not going to go through what the ins and outs of that means so i would just potentially direct you to somebody who can give you the ins and outs of the statute that we waived mike rehaut j p morgan analyst thank you operator our next question comes from the line of scott schrier with citi your line is now open scott schrier citi analyst hi good morning gentlemen so closings came in well above guidance and we ve been hearing that from some other builders there s been a lot of spec inventory on the ground so you people are trying to move it and my original question was going to be does this imply some kind of pull forward in what you re originally planning in 2q but it seems like from your numbers that you give that you expect for 2q relative to where consensus expectations are it seems like there s a lot of momentum there and i m curious in your thought process is if you could kind of delineate maybe what s coming from spec versus what s coming from backlog sales in that 2q number matt zaist president and chief executive officer well i think we and again obviously we ve got the benefit of kind of what we ve been experiencing in april but scott look what you said is correct i mean look we sold better than expected in q1 i think our backlog conversion rate for q2 is expected to also be solid and that s because of the sales activity we saw in march and as i ve mentioned april saw a good healthy sales activity it s pretty balanced between what s in backlog and then obviously at the end of q1 what we sold thus far in april to close and look our expectations are we ll continue to sell houses in may that will be part of that full backlog conversion guide we ve got a different spec strategy in obviously every market that we operate in but those markets that have a higher percentage of entry level products are going to have more product on the ground available to sell in shorter escrows scott schrier citi analyst got it and then on the sg a front can you talk a little bit about maybe some of the trends that you re expecting are we going to see more leverage or do you when you look you at areas where that you mentioned such as texas with your new acquisition and strategy there and some of the things in the inland empire do you need to invest more in the sg a front there or do we expect we re at a point where we re going to continue to get an sg a leverage matt zaist president and chief executive officer yes good question maybe i ll take that to colin colin severn senior vice president and chief financial officer yes so relative to the guidance we gave for q2 we re seeing trends similar to previous years where sg a is a little bit higher in the beginning of the year then trending down as we move through so the way we think about it is from a cadence perspective we d expect that trend this year in 2019 to be similar to 2018 scott schrier citi analyst great thanks for that i appreciate it operator our next question comes from the line of jay mccanless with wedbush your line is now open jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst hey good morning was going to ask of the 1 000 to 1 050 closings for 2q 19 what percentage of those do you expect to sell and close during the quarter matt zaist president and chief executive officer jay i don t know that there s a kind of a net impact right we ve got i d say roughly it s about 30 there s some ins and outs associated with that but we ve got our going in backlog that s always expected to close we always have certain construction delays that kind of push some units there s some amount of cancellation and then there s specs that are sold to close during the course of the quarter but net net i d say somewhere in the high 20s to 30 would be our expectation jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst yes that s more positive because that s one of the things i ve been wondering this earning season is how much of this closing momentum in 2q is actually coming just from more aggressive spec sales versus what seems from your answer to be a little bit better demand on the ground than what we saw during the back half of the year my other question is on matt zaist president and chief executive officer jay maybe just to add on to that i mean look i think one of the things that we saw in the back half of last year is if you think through the lens of that entry level buyer that obviously saw price appreciation in a number of markets but as rates rose that really did freeze them out pushed them to the sidelines and i think as rates have abated this year the attractiveness on that spec inventory for that first time buyer is hey i can now afford that house that i wanted to buy last year that i just physically was unable to do so or was concerned about based on about the monthly payments so all in all i think that the change in the backdrop of the rate environment as well as consumer confidence i think definitely played a role in that it s not just aggressive pricing on standing inventory or spec homes jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst the second question that i had is around pricing power and if you express it as a percentage of total communities where right now do you think you re getting net pricing power where your base price increases are bigger than the incentives you have to throw out there matt zaist president and chief executive officer i would say austin denver phoenix recent openings in orange county and selectively starting to see that in seattle again which is encouraging jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst and then just my last one very quickly is are you seeing any land price discounts are some of these land sellers especially in markets like portland where we ve seen median prices coming down in california or median prices have started to flatten out are you seeing some land sellers maybe break the price a little bit and try to generate some of their own volume matt zaist president and chief executive officer yes i think it s what i think markets where we ve seen home prices reset look land is really kind of the fungible components of home price appreciation or depreciation and so look i think we ve seen some deals in seattle that have definitely reset portland is a market where we re seeing some land reset the inland empire we re definitely seeing some reset there coastally in california look even though the bay area has seen a pullback look there s not a bunch of for us the bay area is very specific to the south bay and east bay markets it s not like there s a bunch of available land sitting on the ground and it is highly competitive it s very tight the same would hold true for l a orange and san diego counties we just i think land sellers are willing to be patient and allow for market conditions to settle and we haven t really seen any reset in those markets las vegas is a market where look i think it depends on the buyer segment for sure and as a company we ve been at the one market where we ve been probably more exposed to the move up markets as opposed to the core entry level markets and i think we re seeing some reset in the move up markets in the greater las vegas region jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst great thanks for taking my questions operator our next question comes from the line of alex barron with housing research center you line is now open alex barron housing research center analyst i wanted to talk about the margins so i think i heard you correct that you expect flat margins for next quarter is that correct matt zaist president and chief executive officer yes that s correct alex barron housing research center analyst ok what about any guidance you can give toward the back half but it sounded like these guys are using incentives to drive some of the sales so would you expect the back half to be somewhat similar or would you expect maybe a bit of a pickup for some other product mix reason or anything like that matt zaist president and chief executive officer yes alex i think mike rehaut asked that same question a couple of analysts ago look i d go back and reference what i previously stated to him but we again the flatness in q2 is mix related divisional mix related relative to contributions we say that six of our nine divisions are showing sequential improvement in gross margins quarter over quarter we have a period of time where we gapped out in our northern california division which is a high gross margin market for us and we expect it to continue to do so and we ve got community openings here in the second quarter that will produce deliveries primarily late in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter so we would expect to see back half lift in gms but we re not going to give specific s guide on what that is at this point in time alex barron housing research center analyst ok and when you mentioned that the land spend might be a little bit less is that just due to waiting for land cost to go down or because you feel you have enough at this point matt zaist president and chief executive officer no look i think consistent with the statements we ve made in the past look i think we view with our land book we ve got good accessibility to lots that are going to allow us to continue to grow within our existing footprints and so our expectation by moderating land spend is based on what we have available we ve done a good job of increasing the percentage of lots controlled or optioned versus owned and look we want to continue to make meaningful improvement on our balance sheet metrics and as colin said in his prepared remarks we anticipate lowering overall indebtedness as we move through this quarter or throughout this year and through less debt and increasing of earnings we want to improve the debt to cap metrics definitely operator and that concludes today s question and answer session i d like to turn the call back to matt zaist for closing remarks matt zaist president and chief executive officer all right

including a number of factors that impacted our results both positively and negatively i ll then take some time to provide an overview of our operating environment and the current state of our end markets as well as the trends we re seeing after that i ll turn it over to matt to review our financials the first quarter of every year is usually our most volatile and this one was no exception i ll characterize the quarter as a productive one for us marked by our team s solid performance navigating through several market and operating challenges on the market side we experienced a slow start to 2019 most notably in china and europe as well as in the building and construction markets in north america while these factors were most pervasive in the first two months conditions improved for us in march when we saw a noticeable uptick in business activity as demand picked up across our markets and geographies we executed on several strategic fronts during the quarter specifically we delivered solid geographic growth increased volumes through new capacity expansions and generated sales from recently introduced value added products that gained traction with customers additionally we extended our large larger global position in pet care through sivomatic s strong performance in europe from a financial perspective total sales in the quarter increased 1 over last year to 438 million and were up 4 on a constant currency basis we generated 62 million of operating income with double digit margins across all segments and delivered earnings per share of 1 11 as we ve done in previous quarters we ve tightly managed our expenses as well as our overall cost structure drove productivity improvements and implemented measures to adjust to the market conditions seen early in the quarter continued pricing actions which increased revenue by about 10 million over last year more than offset persistent inflationary cost pressures extending the trend from the second half of last year now let me take you through some of the quarter highlights for each segment in performance materials household personal care sales increased 54 driven by the acquisition of sivomatic and 25 growth in our pet care products in north america where we re benefiting from strong private label pet care demand and healthy customer pull for our new product formulations such as lightweight cat litter scented and non scented scoopable litters as well as our new fragrance boosters additionally environmental products sales grew 25 driven by a large remediation project in the middle east as well as strong pull for our innovative environmental and wastewater remediation technologies while overall sales in metalcasting were lower north america remained relatively strong with sales increasing 3 lower activity in china during january and february weighed on our metalcasting sales for the quarter but we benefited from an improving demand environment there in march on a positive note demand for and penetration of our higher value pre blended greensand bond products remained strong building materials with sales down 19 compared to last year was the product line most impacted this quarter from weather related construction project delays in north america our largest market in our specialty minerals businesses sales were impacted by lower paper pcc volumes in north america primarily due to the year over year impact of paper machine closures that occurred last year our pcc expansion in asia continues to build momentum during the quarter we finalized the construction of our new 125 000 ton pcc plant in indonesia which came online in april and we expect to break ground on our 150 000 ton plant in china in the next few months our specialty pcc business had a strong quarter with sales up 6 driven by increased customer demand for our newest products which were supported by the capacity expansion that came online at our uk facility in our refractory segment we continue to benefit from improving steel market conditions in the us where utilization rates averaged 82 for the quarter up from 77 last year however we did experience some market weakness and lower demand in european steel markets energy services delivered a much stronger quarter compared to 2018 with sales up 6 and operating income up nearly 1 million we re beginning to see increased customer demand for our services in the gulf of mexico as offshore activity picks up our innovation pipeline a key source of organic growth is robust we continue to strengthen our efforts in terms of increasing the number of products being commercialized and improving the speed with which we bring them to market to size our new product pipeline for you we have a total portfolio of over 280 products from early stage development through commercialization representing over 600 million of revenue at full potential there are between 40 and 50 of these products in the final stage before commercialization specific to the quarter we made solid progress in product development across all of our businesses highlighted by several of our newest pcc technologies including enhanced variations of our new yield and high filler solutions that moved closer to commercialization we ve adapted our innovation pipeline to meet evolving demands from our customers who require products geared toward environmental and recycling issues in addition to cost reduction solutions acquisitions are also an important component of how we intend to grow we continue to analyze and evaluate potential acquisitions and we have an active pipeline of opportunities to recap the quarter we navigated through a couple of challenging months but maintain positive momentum in several growth areas as we move into our strongest period of the year as i mentioned eps for the quarter was at a similar level to last year reflecting the slower start we experienced in several of our markets however we saw demand pick up significantly in march which continued into april and we expect these improved market conditions to remain throughout the second quarter so let me take you a little deeper into what s happening across our end markets and geographies i thought it d be helpful to give some additional context around the second quarter and what we re seeing through the second half of the year i ll also outline the key projects for 2019 that will drive growth at mti irrespective of the market and demand conditions i ll begin with metalcasting our largest business in performance materials overall greensand bond demand in north america from foundries supplying the agriculture machinery heavy truck and automotive markets remained relatively stable and we expect these conditions to continue for the balance of the year we also see solid demand and an opportunity to continue our growth in india and southeast asia where we ve delivered double digit sales increases over the past several quarters in china we believe the foundry market will be stronger in the second half of the year compared to the first half based on conversations with our customers around the potential impact of several government stimulus programs focused on the automotive and transportation markets given the solid demand we saw for our blended products during the first quarter we remain confident that the value proposition of our blended greensand bonds will continue to drive penetration into the foundry market for the full year we anticipate continued sales and volume growth in china likely in the mid single digit range we have a very positive outlook for our global pet care business as the trends in our key markets and geographies remain strong private label package demand is robust our new fragrance formulations and packaging options are seeing increased customer pull and our premium bentonite based litter products in europe are trending upward in addition the investments we ve made in both our fabric care and bleaching earth products are also driving sales and profit growth and we expect this performance trend to continue for the remainder of the year we have a stable outlook on construction markets in north america which we serve through our building materials talc and gcc product lines overall we anticipate base volumes in these products to improve as we enter our seasonally stronger part of the year going a little deeper our talc and gcc products are sold into paints coatings and general construction materials in the residential construction market and we see these volumes improving after a slow start to the year we also expect to realize increased sales in our building materials product line from commercial construction projects that shifted out of the first quarter in our environmental products business we expect the positive sales trend in the first quarter to continue into the second we have a very strong pipeline of higher margin remediation projects where we can deploy our resistex and fluoro sorb products and we look to capitalize on these opportunities over the course of the year turning to paper pcc paper markets are relatively healthy with operating rates in north america and europe at around 90 for the first three months of 2019 which is a similar level to the past several quarters we expect our asia pcc volume to pick up in the second half of 2019 and into early 2020 as 300 000 tons of additional capacity will come online from the two new satellite plants as well as through satellite expansions in addition we have an active pipeline of more than 20 opportunities for new pcc satellites and for the application of our new high value technologies in specialty pcc after a strong start to the year we see an opportunity to build on the solid demand for our current and new high performance sealant products our capacity expansion in the united kingdom continues to ramp up and we will be bringing on an expansion at our adams massachusetts plant in the second half of the year to support growing customer demand for our refractory segment we expect to continue to benefit from stable steel market conditions in the us while the slower demand environment in europe will likely persist we anticipate a strong year of laser equipment sales similar to last year along with robust demand for our hybrid refractory products globally and in total we see another positive year for this segment and in our energy services business increased global demand for our services should remain for the rest of the year and we ve secured several large well testing and filtration projects that will take place over the next three quarters our produced water analytics offering is gaining traction with an expanded customer base which will result in additional service contracts we re also beginning to see signs of pricing recovery that should help improve the segment s profitability later this year to sum it all up after a slower start to the year demand trends turned positive in march and april and many of our key market end markets are heading in a more favorable direction these market trends combined with our new technology launches new capacity additions ongoing pricing actions and continued strong operating performance positions mti for another solid year now i ll turn it over to matt to go through the details of the quarter and our outlook for the second quarter matt matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury chief financial officer thanks doug and hello everyone i ll review our first quarter results the performance of our four segments and also provide you with our outlook for the second quarter sales grew 1 in the first quarter or 4 on a constant currency basis despite a slower start to the year in several of our markets and regions we experienced a notable increase in activity late in the first quarter and we delivered solid growth across several of our product lines gross margin was 25 1 in the first quarter lower than the prior year driven by an unfavorable product mix due to project delays in building materials lower sales of drilling products and reduced north american pcc volumes we managed expenses tightly and reduced sg a by 2 8 million versus last year resulting in an 80 basis point reduction in sg a as a percent of sales operating income for the quarter was 62 million versus 63 million in the prior year excluding the impact of foreign exchange operating income was essentially flat compared to the prior year pricing actions we are taking delivered 9 7 million in the first quarter which more than offset 8 2 million of raw materials freight and energy inflation total business performance includes the impact of product mix and the north american pcc volumes earnings per share were 1 11 2 lower than the prior year primarily due to the change in operating income our effective tax rate was 18 9 equal to the first quarter of last year and now let s review the segments in more detail starting with performance materials performance materials sales increased 6 led by hpc and environmental products segment sales grew 8 on a constant currency basis as doug highlighted we delivered 54 growth in hpc driven by the sivomatic acquisition but also a 25 increase in our north american pet care business where we are capturing increased demand for our private label pet care products environmental product sales grew 25 driven by a large bauxite and red mud remediation project in saudi arabia as well as strong pull for our innovative new products from customers who are seeking environmental and recycling solutions our growth in these two product lines was partially offset by decreased sales in building materials basic minerals and metalcasting building materials sales were 19 lower due to weather related project delays in the united states and basic minerals sales were 28 lower on weaker demand for drilling products particularly in the permian basin of the united states metalcasting sales were impacted by weaker market demand in china particularly in the first two months of the quarter and mainly within the specialty sands portion of the product line sales of our value added pre blended greensand bond formulations in china were less affected and returned to prior levels in march and we also see continued growth from our penetration strategy going forward in addition our global greensand bond business continued to show strength outside china with north america india and southeast asia sales all growing this quarter operating margin for the segment was 13 2 in the quarter and was impacted by an unfavorable product mix from delayed projects in building materials and lower sales of basic minerals products i d also like to highlight that pricing actions more than offset the inflationary costs we are facing we will continue to raise prices to recapture the cumulative inflationary cost increases that this business has absorbed and drive operational excellence to increase productivity gains segment operating income was 26 3 million up slightly from the prior year and now looking to the second quarter we expect operating income to be higher by 4 million to 5 million as we are in the seasonally stronger period for building materials and environmental products we should also benefit from the building materials projects that were delayed in the first quarter we see continued strength in pet care and we expect to build on our late first quarter momentum in greensand bonds globally now let s turn to specialty minerals overall sales in this segment were 3 lower than the prior year primarily due to the north american paper mill shutdowns and a slow start for paper pcc in china sales in this segment were flat on a constant currency basis specialty pcc sales grew 6 on strong demand for our innovative ultraflex and thixocarb sealant products in north america and from our capacity expansion in the uk which started ramping up in the first quarter sales of gcc were down slightly demand on the east coast was higher while severe rain in southern california delayed construction projects and pushed some of our sales on the west coast out of the first quarter talc sales were 5 lower due to weaker volumes of our residential construction projects that support our paints and coatings customers operating income was 22 million versus 24 1 million in the prior year this was the segment that was most impacted by foreign exchange and it contributed roughly half of the decline in segment operating income the north american paper machine shutdowns drove the remainder of the operating income reduction i d also like to point out that pricing actions are more than offsetting inflationary costs paper pcc contractual price increases are offsetting higher lime costs and in performance minerals we are raising prices to overcome higher energy prices and looking to the second quarter we expect to offset the impact of paper machine shutdowns in north america with volume growth from our new indonesian satellite and higher volumes from our existing facilities in china india and brazil we are entering a seasonally stronger period for sales of talc and gcc and we expect spcc sales to remain strong overall for the segment we expect operating income to be higher by 2 million to 3 million sequentially now let s turn to the refractory segment refractory segment sales were 2 lower than the prior year primarily due to lower sales of metallurgical products refractory products growth in the us was offset by lower steel demand in europe primarily in turkey and germany operating margin was strong at 16 4 operating income was 12 1 million 5 lower than the prior year primarily due to the lower sales and higher raw material costs note that these higher raw material costs will be passed through to customers in pricing beginning in july as we look to the second quarter continued weakness in europe will be fully offset by strength in north america we re also introducing hybrid products in europe which provide enhanced value to our customers and have proven very successful in north america overall for this segment we expect operating income to be similar to the first quarter turning to energy services energy services sales grew 6 as the increase in offshore activity continued from the fourth quarter of 2018 into the first quarter of 2019 we saw growth in global well testing wastewater and custom engineered equipment sales operating income was up 900 000 versus the prior year on increased international activity going forward we expect similar levels of activity to the first quarter and a similar level of operating income in the second quarter now let s take a look at our liquidity and debt highlights cash from operations was 31 million in the first quarter and we deployed 18 million of capital as you can see on the chart cash flows are typically lower in the first quarter than they are in the other quarters of the year as i ve discussed previously we expect strong cash flow generation to continue in 2019 in the first quarter we repaid 15 million of debt and over the past year we have repaid nearly 90 million maintaining our net leverage ratio at 2 2 times ebitda our total debt is 1 billion and is evenly split between fixed and variable rate debt interest expense in this quarter was up 700 000 year over year on higher interest rates on the variable portion of our debt and a slightly higher debt level we will continue to pay down debt toward our goal of achieving a net leverage ratio of 2 times ebitda company s financial position is strong with 207 million of cash and equivalents and 200 million of availability on our revolving credit facility for a total of 407 million of liquidity so now let me summarize what we are seeing for the second quarter which is typically our seasonally strongest quarter of the year in performance materials we expect operating income to increase 15 to 20 sequentially or 4 million to 5 million in specialty minerals we expect operating income to increase 10 to 15 sequentially or 2 million to 3 million we expect both refractories and energy services to deliver similar levels of operating income sequentially and as i turn to our eps guidance let me note that at current foreign exchange rates we are not expecting the same benefit to our below the line earnings as last year and in total we expect second quarter earnings per share to be between 1 20 and 1 25 with the momentum we had in march and april the market dynamics that doug outlined and the incremental growth from our expansions and innovations we expect to grow both sales and operating income in the second quarter by 10 sequentially and 4 to 5 year over year with that let s open the call up to questions questions and answers operator operator instructions and we will take our first question from daniel moore with cjs securities please go ahead daniel moore cjs securities analyst good morning doug good morning matt thanks for taking the questions a couple things as far as household and personal maybe i think you said north america was up 25 what was organic growth in that segment and what kind of organic growth do you think is reasonable as we lap the sivomatic acquisition matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury chief financial officer yes dan the 25 in north america was organic growth driven by so of the 54 i m trying to even split there but 25 it s our largest business is north america well it s not equal to europe and that was both driven by volume and pricing daniel moore cjs securities analyst helpful and on the environmental services how much longer does that middle east project last and i think you said felt pretty good about the pipeline there i guess is this sort of a lumpy project or do we see continued growth as we look out to the back half year douglas t dietrich chief executive officer yes let me let me start off and then i ll let jon talk a little bit about both actually he has comments on pet care as well yes that s a again in this product line we get some very large projects and then there s some small remediation based gcl products this is one of those high value resistex types projects it s for a red mud pond that for a customer in saudi arabia it s actually the second phase of what we ve done we did the last one i believe with this customer several years three years ago or so so it s a large one it will extend into the second quarter but beyond that and so we re very positive about that and that growth beyond that we have a large pipeline i mentioned in some remediation projects similar types around the world these are for the higher value products resistex and starting to see some interest in and demand in our fluoro sorb product if you remember that s a new product we ve developed which takes ppfas out of water and we know if you ve seen in the news that that s been a big issue with water remediation around the united states in particular and so we ve qualified that product with a number in a number of places and we see that that s going to grow some demand throughout the year so we re pretty positive on our environmental products business and it is one of the the base gcls are one of the lower margin products i mean not low but below average i guess for the segment which is why matt highlighted when you sell when we re selling more of this right now that it does have a dilutive effect on the margins but these projects i m talking about going forward are the higher margin type and we think that that s going to be very accretive to margins as we go throughout the year jon anything you want to on the type of projects you want to add to that jonathan j hastings group president performance materials yes just a couple of comments hi dan the like doug said we are pretty bullish on environmental products right now the projects that we see in queue we do have several large projects they are resistex oriented they are in different parts of the world and the timing is staggered and sequenced over the course of the next year or so as far as starting up the benefit of the technology is certainly being recognized and the value proposition is there so again we re pretty bullish on environmental products from the resistex side with fluoro sorb last quarter we got the nsf certification for the four products that we have in our product line right now again that s a testament to the value of the products and the capabilities they have it certainly positions us very well to satisfy the customer requirements so again something that we re looking forward to as we continue launching that product line and executing projects going forward i did want to just follow up on the pet care question as well i wanted add i thought you asked also about the organic growth over in europe that s been about 5 per year and we continue to see that going forward with our premium and customized pet liter products that we sell in europe douglas t dietrich chief executive officer and dan a little bit more on the north america i was looking at something when you asked the question that in my comments that was really that really is organic growth it s driven by volume expansion in our packaged pet care products we ve come up with a number of different formulations for customers customer driven formulations in fragrance packages with a new product called fragrance booster it s not necessarily a cat litter itself but it s actually something that s that seems to be trending very well with customer demand where you actually kind of like a salt shaker sprinkling fragrance into the box and so we provide that as kind of a tangential add on product to our pet litter so got a number of new things customer pull new product innovations packaging and i think private label demand just in general has been increasing over the past several quarters and so we re seeing both volume growth and that with some of these new products that s driving up some of the pricing as well so we see we re really positive on the pet care product and as jon mentioned sivomatic in europe is trending very favorably and especially in some of that premium bentonite category so we see a good year for pet care going forward daniel moore cjs securities analyst that s helpful is the overall organic and i ve got enough of the picture last one for me and apologize maybe a couple of parts but in terms of the q2 guide really nice to see the improvement and reacceleration on the topline expected still fighting some cost headwinds and not a ton of operating leverage so as you look out to h2 is more significant margin expansion reasonable to expect in light of the inflationary pressures doug and what levers can you pull either in terms of pricing or more significant cost reductions to start maybe translating the topline growth into a little faster bottom line thanks douglas t dietrich chief executive officer yes i appreciate that dan we are getting the leverage has been a bit challenging given that we continue to see persistent inflation i d say the cost pressures are tailing a little bit in different places some are accelerating even further and some are tailing matt mentioned we had about 8 million year over year this quarter where we saw for the past three almost 10 million year over year so it s slowing but not tremendously we are though i ll say getting ahead of that in price so this is the second third quarter in a row where pricing has outpaced those cost inflation so that is helping the underlying margins so in many of our product lines margins are boosting you didn t see it this quarter just because of the mix of what happened i don t like talking about mix but that is the reality this quarter so we do see margin expansion and getting further leverage as we go our target has always been to get to 16 op income margins i do think that 15 is a near term reality i think our highest we saw in 2017 was about 15 5 and i think within this year we can start getting back to 15 albeit i ll couch that with inflation we lag in some of our pricing formulaic but also on pricing to customers and so as these cost pressures continue we re going to continue to lag it once they start to tail over i think we ll get back to normalized pricing and you ll see that 15 margin and then further with the products that i m talking about the new formulations in pricing in pet care pricing across the board in performance minerals and also the environmental products and some new paper pcc technologies those are above average margins that s our strategy with our new technologies that s what s going to get us through 2020 into the 16 range or the upper 15 s okay so i m very bullish on the margins there is more room to go on cost reduction we are focused as you can see this quarter on overheads and total fixed we made some good strides this quarter in making sure that we kept our costs in control productivity continues to improve but there s more to go on costs and i think that will also help get to those margins quicker so more to come on that one daniel moore cjs securities analyst got it thanks again for the color operator and we will take our next question from rosemarie morbelli from g research please go ahead rosemarie j morbelli gabelli company analyst thank you good morning everyone so just looking at refectories is that margin sustainable was that part of the mix and we should not expect it to be at the to remain at this particular first quarter level for the balance of the year douglas t dietrich chief executive officer well let me take it and then i m going to pass it over to brett argirakis who s the president of that business yes i think those margins are largely sustainable rosemarie i think if you remember you probably remember when margins in the business were about 6 right rosemarie j morbelli gabelli company analyst unfortunately i do douglas t dietrich chief executive officer you do so we ve taken that business and through brett s leadership to a different level new products et cetera but yes i do think they re sustainable i m going to let brett take you through kind of what he s seen over the past couple of years running the business and the changes he s made to make that kind of margin sustainable going forward brett argirakis vice president and managing director minteq international inc hi rosemarie thanks for the question unfortunately i remember those margins when they were 6 as well this business has always provided very good service equipment and products and after the last financial crisis we resized this business to the right levels that i think are very sustainable we focused on business fundamentals oe safety expense control productivity was focused on very heavily as well and customer requirements and we looked at our research and development group and they did a really good job of focusing on value added products just in every category refractories for instance doug pointed out the hybrid product last year this was rolled out very well and we launched about 17 000 tons of the new hybrid product in north america alone these products were developed for the customer for to be faster to apply easier and to give them a lower cost solution and they really caught on very well the good news is we re in the process in europe and asia right now mainly europe doing a very good job and we have a lot of trial activity there so we anticipate doing the same things in europe this year ferrotron same thing we we looked at the value of our laser which is the fastest in the world this we launched a new lacam explorer technology this last year sold our first unit that will allow us to utilize a laser and read the measurements of refractory in a very hot environment this new laser will be able to detect the smallest issues in the refractory lining and really create a much safer and more efficient operation for the customer and lastly really what we ve done with that ferrotron engineering group is tied them into equipment in multiple product lines so they ve helped us with optimizing our equipment in lasers refractory and also our calcium wire equipment so it s been a long road and look i m very proud of what this team has done and we re on track for another very solid year in 2019 rosemarie j morbelli gabelli company analyst thank you cindi buckwalter head of investor relations some of that rosemarie i think we re we are benefiting from some strong conditions in north america as i mentioned we saw some weakness but we think through the balance of the year and we re at a different level of margin in this business now given kind of products that we re selling the value we re bringing to the customer and ability to maintain those margins through inflationary periods so a little bit different business now than it was back when i talked about it you remember rosemarie j morbelli gabelli company analyst yes thank you no that was very helpful looking at the greensands so automotive production has slowed down in china but your strategy is that it s one of substitution so i was wondering if during the slowdown there were more trials going on and we could see quite a jump in demand when the production improves maybe in the second half douglas t dietrich chief executive officer yes we ve always talked about how demand for our products is based on substituting a base play or our current customers their own formulation and so we continue to conduct trials automotive production especially and greensand bond demand was lower in january and february but after the chinese new year picked up considerably we did see trial activity we continue to see strong demand for our greensand bond product and those were in my comments we see that as a testament to our ability to continue the penetration in that market furthermore it s not only automotive that we sell into the foundry market supplies heavy truck industrial equipment and those fared a little bit differently than automotive in china so they were a little bit stronger so jon anything to add to that jonathan j hastings group president performance materials sure just talk about the segments auto sales in china were down 11 but as doug highlighted the compressor market was flat and heavy engineering actually grew about 24 what we also see is as there s more and more pressure on the casting industry in china there are new lines coming on and those new lines are heavily automated they re using western technologies and as a consequence they re demanding the high value blended products so while we did see some decline overall in our sales especially around that chinese new year time in february we ve responded the market s responded very nicely in both march and april and the greensand bonds the blended products continue to be very robust and we continue to see demand for our specific product line and also growth going forward so again another part of the business that with the blended products we continue see the value of our proposition going forward rosemarie j morbelli gabelli company analyst thank you and if i may on the pet care you did not mention asia what are you seeing there particularly in china where according to my view there are going to be many many cats in households douglas t dietrich chief executive officer clearly we still see continued growth in pet care in asia we have highlighted it before i think it was kind of overshadowed by some of our growth here in north america obviously north america and europe are a bigger base i think our average pet care sales have grown mid double digits i think we were at one point about 100 but as that base gets bigger year over year we ve been growing in the 40 50 range per year albeit from a small base but yes we re continuing that trend we ve got a number of different lightweight litter that we introduced there last year we ve got a number of different fragrance formulations as well so smaller base rosemarie but still we note the trend in terms of domesticated cats in asia that is something that s going to continue and we intend to continue to look to capture on that market rosemarie j morbelli gabelli company analyst thank you i ll get back into queue operator and our next question will come silke kueck from jp morgan please go ahead silke kueck valdes jp morgan chase co analyst good morning how are you douglas t dietrich chief executive officer good morning silke kueck valdes jp morgan chase co analyst my first question is like sales analysis so on slide 8 what you say is that your sales growth excluding currencies was up 18 million and you said price was up like 10 million and the acquisitions probably contributed like 20 million your volumes were down 12 million or 3 is that the right way to look at it matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury chief financial officer yes so your mix silke you have overall sales were 1 fx as we told you would have been about an 11 impact so when you remove that that gets you to that 4 sivomatic like you said gets you into that mid 20 s range which it s been trending but going higher as jon told you from when we purchased it you have pricing which doug outlined to you which is about 2 and the rest there would be volume silke kueck valdes jp morgan chase co analyst so sivomatic is like in the mid 20 million per quarter attributed to sales matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury chief financial officer in dollars silke kueck valdes jp morgan chase co analyst okay that s helpful in the metalcasting business what you said is that you think that the business is stabilizing and by stabilizing do you mean it s going to be flat year over year or it s actually growing year over year douglas t dietrich chief executive officer so there s two parts let me take that one silke there s two parts to the metalcasting business we don t talk about one of it it s a smaller part of it it s called specialty sands but we have what s called greensand bonds those are the ones we talk about in terms of clay blended products north america asia growth and then the specialty sands specialty sands goes into stainless steel castings it has a raw material in it chrome based raw material that it s market driven in terms of pricing the biggest impact this year this past quarter was on that specialty sands piece i think pricing was off almost 40 over last year and volumes were down a similar amount due to the weakness and most of that goes into china the greensand portion of it was relatively strong and we saw the growth throughout southeast asia north america et cetera so we see in total for metalcasting we see and specialty sands is about 15 of that product line so we see continued growth in metalcasting this year we think with the flat kind of flat to slightly down north america automotive market we see a growing a better second half in asia in terms of not just automotive but in total industrial output which will help our greensand bond volumes there the thing is that we have a pretty large decline in terms of revenue from that specialty sands and that s going to that s going to probably temper that growth a little bit this year globally so we still see a positive year but it s going to be lower growth due to that specialty sands now that specialty sands like i said is a small portion of our business and really the profitability of the margins are driven going to be driven this year from that greensand bond program silke kueck valdes jp morgan chase co analyst right so your expectation says including everything and considering what your currency headwinds may be you think your metalcasting sales will be up year over year or up a little bit douglas t dietrich chief executive officer yes i mean i can predict currency i think currency in china was one of the biggest headwinds we were down i think we were down 15 in sales in china our volumes in greensand bonds single digits but our volumes in specialty sands double digits they were threefold what and that was really driven by that commodity pricing so we saw pricing drop 40 year over year and that s going to affect the that s going to affect the sales in the segment i will say though that those specialty sands are priced on conversion so when you re talking about income and cash no different we don t talk about it much because it s such a small portion of the segment but when you re off 40 in price in one quarter it had an impact on the topline silke kueck valdes jp morgan chase co analyst yes ok then i have a question about your comment you made about that margin expansion so your operating margin last year was 14 4 and what you said is like all of these headwinds that you re managing very well with all of those cost controls you re putting in place but in the first quarter your margins are still down 40 basis points so when you say we think 15 operating margin is possible do you mean that s for the year or maybe in one quarter or do you just like round it and maybe you think you re going to get the 14 6 because 15 seems a stretch just given all the headwinds that are out there douglas t dietrich chief executive officer yes no look i think getting this full year up to 15 starting out at 14 2 you re right is going to be a challenge what i m saying is that i think we can start to see run rate margins getting back to the 15 by the end of the year kind of on an annualized basis so i don t want to take the calendar year but the reason i m bullish about that is because 14 2 over 14 4 i think you mentioned last year comes with a very weak mix of our products we re selling some fortunately we re selling a lot of good environmental and pet care products but that mix is a little bit different and we think some of that is temporary we see both those building products which are accretive to the average margins in the segment performance materials segment coming back in the second quarter so we think that that s a temporary and without that base margins in the business year over year have grown now we re still overcoming continued inflationary pressures that s going to that s making it difficult to get ourselves back to average pricing as we lag but we re starting to see some of those prices playing over and we will catch up i ve always said we ll get back to our pricing but we ve got to get through kind of these inflationary pressures the margins in this business back in average pricing and with our mix should be in the 15 range i think like i said 16 is possible over the next couple of years getting back to where we were in 17 with some of these higher margin products in addition it s the other thing they re positive cash to the company these paper pcc contracts we always talk about how dollar per ton of revenue is a little bit lower because they are in china so as we grow in asia the ebitda that comes from those contracts is the same however the margins because of the brand new capital when you put in something in indonesia and lose something in port hudson does affect your margins it doesn t affect the cash flow doesn t affect your ebidta but it will change your margins a little bit so there s some of that going on silke but nonetheless even with that and with constant focus on our expenses and costs and i think there s still some room to go there i m bullish on getting ourselves back to and i ll give you the run rate of 15 into next year into the end of this year into next year silke kueck valdes jp morgan chase co analyst and like a last set of questions for matt if i may i was hoping you could tell me like what your total d a was in the quarter first matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury chief financial officer yes d a in the quarter was 24 5 million and i know where you re going with this silke so let me try and answer that string for you that should continue so total d a for the year will be around 95 million to 100 million from a capex perspective we re looking at about 70 million to 80 million that s going to be fairly evenly split between sustaining and roi return type capex and within that sustaining just note that we also put about 10 million toward environmental health and safety projects so continuing to do that as well this year when you look at the overall cash flow generation for the company what we ve told you before is we re targeting about 150 million there are working capital elements that we are working on to get there you probably saw that working capital in the first quarter was a little bit of a use versus what you ve seen previously we did have as we told you the sales ramp up in march so those sales will be collected in the second quarter but that was an overhang of about 5 million that moved from the first quarter to the second quarter so if that was held equal you would have seen the first quarter this year look pretty equal to last year and so as we move through the rest of the year the opportunities and the growth that doug was just talking about and how we deliver those to the bottom line along with working capital is going to help us grow working capital year over year sorry free cash flow year over year silke kueck valdes jp morgan chase co analyst that s very helpful thanks for the comprehensive answer i appreciate that douglas t dietrich chief executive officer thanks operator and our next question will come from steve schwartz with first analysis please go ahead steven k schwartz first analysis securities analyst good morning everyone douglas t dietrich chief executive officer hi steve steven k schwartz first analysis securities analyst i ll echo that thanks from silke i have one question on quarterly d a he took out about four of my questions but with that there s still a few more and these are i think relatively simple so i think you re seeing very nice utilization of this uk expansion and i d like to hear a little more about that just the planning for it what you expected how it s and how it s come to fruition with sales and then with adams mass i mean that s a domestic expansion that s under way right so can we expect the same kind of thing douglas t dietrich chief executive officer yes let me start off by kind of how we look at expansions in general hopefully and thanks for the question steve we look before we make any expansion in the company or add capital to something we look at oee which is overall equipment effectiveness and it s really a measure that says what are we getting out of that have we squeezed everything possible out of the existing asset before we move it and the oee is a combination of percent uptime the productivity to nameplate times to quality off of that thing so we will not expand a piece of equipment unless that oee is up to kind of world class levels in the mid 80s upper 80s and so what we have done over the past years as demand has increased for products as we ve introduced new products that require capacity we just have put in kaizen events waste reduction opportunities that really look at taking out bottlenecks as much as possible then you get to a point where you got to make a step change because demand is going and in these two cases in specialty pcc really these are the kind of first expenses we made some small tweaks over the past couple years these are the first expansion at adams massachusetts and the second one in lifford in birmingham sorry england in the past several years and we did that through product demand and some new products so let me let d j monagle talk to you about some of that demand and those new products and what s driving at least the requirement for more capacity d j monagle iii group president specialty minerals and refractories yes thanks for the question steve so as doug mentioned we ve been pretty much sold out so there s two things that are going on first one is we are seeing in general increased demand in the major drivers on both the auto industry and the building and construction industry is the use of higher technology sealants and by applying our pcc in those sealants we are able to help our customers deliver a better product so in general we re seeing that demand grow the other part that we re that we ve been working on doug mentioned that this aspect of oee another way of saying it is we have been flat sold out and i can t ask the operations group to do a much better job on maintaining things the problem is breaking into that production cycle to get our new products launched and so we ve got some new products that are able to even drive our performance higher so these expansions are letting us do two things first one is address what we re going to see as inherent growth but even more importantly for us positioning us for future years address with higher performing products that will increase our margins and further solidify our leadership positions so this 6 that matt mentioned for the quarter maybe that goes up or down in a given quarter but for the year i think that s a reasonable expectation based on what we re seeing right now and the pull that we re getting from these customers steven k schwartz first analysis securities analyst okay thanks d j and it s nice to see the expansions like this and the idea that you can simply pull mineral out of the ground and place it so well like this d j monagle iii group president specialty minerals and refractories i wish it was that simple it s a little bit more work than that steve steven k schwartz first analysis securities analyst it s been a long time since i ve done chemical engineering anyway but just and then just with respect to the environmental projects i might have asked this in the past but i want to make sure i have a clear picture of what your pipeline and current project activity is like what s the average size of a project in that business and it sounds like when you talk about the middle east project and how big it is is there some way that on a public call you can just kind of scale that for us jonathan j hastings group president performance materials yes the average project this is jon the average project in our portfolio can range anywhere from 50 000 to 100 000 all the way up to a large project like this which is a 10 million project when we look at our portfolio it s balanced we have a lot of small projects that we fill our pipeline with and we execute on day in and day out and then we also position ourselves very strongly to tackle the bigger projects based on when they come up so we re always working with potential customers trying to identify timing and sequencing and where they are in their cycle of installing either a new bond or a new retention basin or a landfill or whatever it may be so again a very robust pipeline active in the markets that we participate in always trying to determine what s next and what s coming and like i said they can range from pretty small to very large douglas t dietrich chief executive officer steve i d say the average steven k schwartz first analysis securities analyst multiple speakers like where it s a 16 million quarter i mean that s you re talking about maybe 150 projects outside of like a middle east project so it s pretty well diversified douglas t dietrich chief executive officer those projects will span the projects that size that s a unique kind of project now they re all not all 10 million 9 million 10 million i d say average for a large kind of specialized product is in the 1 million to 2 million you can see smaller in the hundreds of thousands for a large municipal waste site which more commodity based gcl so they are they do range around we do have a nice pipeline of i d say maybe one or two in the 10 million but they re out there they don t happen all the time we usually get one of those a year but we we ve got a good pipeline of the 1 million to 2 million to 3 million ranges and those are for those specialty projects that s why i kind of get back to silke s question we re seeing as we move into these higher margin products especially away from those kind of what we call commodity gcls in this product line we see those margins have been improved and we ve seen that improve over the past year so that s going to help continue to drive margin expansion across this segment and mti steven k schwartz first analysis securities analyst that s great well thank you all for the color have a great weekend douglas t dietrich chief executive officer thanks steve jonathan j hastings group president performance materials thanks steve operator and our final question will be a follow up from rosemarie morbelli please go ahead rosemarie j morbelli gabelli company analyst thank you i was just wondering doug you mentioned that the potential from your innovation pipeline was about 600 million and that you had about 40 to 50 ready to be commercialized could you give us the potential of those 40 to 50 and then the timing of when they could generate that douglas t dietrich chief executive officer no i didn t give you that but i can i will give you i ll give you some broad numbers so last year just to give you a perspective last year we commercialized about 35 projects new products and the potential of those products were about 100 million we have about 40 as i mentioned 40 to 50 in the pipeline i don t think all of those will be commercialized this year i would say of the ones we ll commercialize this year we see right now there may be a couple more or less but probably in the 70 million to 90 million range of potential value that could come out this year sort of a similar pace to last year i will highlight that though it s at a similar pace we re moving products out of the pipeline faster 2018 over 2016 i think we moved and by the way that s an annualized value i m getting signals here that that s not all going to happen this year rosemarie that s at a full potential annualized rate the 70 million to 90 million so we re moving things through our pipeline 20 faster than we were and so our thought is we focus in on the projects with the strongest customer pull we move them fast we fail fast and then we get them commercialized and then we repeat and so moving that innovation engine and getting those 70 million to 100 million of annualized opportunities out faster is what s driving some of our revenue growth over the past four quarters five quarters so those are the kind of numbers that we think we see this year rosemarie j morbelli gabelli company analyst okay thanks and when you were talking i know they were having a heart attack there but when you are talking about the 70 the 70 million potential annualized do we start out with something like 5 million in one year and how long before it gets to that full potential douglas t dietrich chief executive officer yes our products some of our products ramp up very quickly i guess it s hard to characterize one product we ve had i think we look at some of these things as a potential over five years to generate sales over a five year period so every year we re launching products that i can give you round numbers that have a potential value of 100 million over five years but you keep doing that and you move that faster and that s what we think yields that type of run rate every year we have been behind we ve been moving up that speed curve and up that value curve over the past two years that s what i m trying to draw a picture of so over some product like i said some of our new sealant products that we re just launching now have been developed with customers i mean thixo these have been probably three years in kind of product testing especially with automotive it takes a long time to get things qualified on new build so some are very quick our new high filler technology that i just mentioned was developed over probably the past two years and we took several trials and we think that one could ramp up quicker because it s an add on to an existing known technology so some very quickly and some take a little bit longer depending on the market rosemarie j morbelli gabelli company analyst thank you that is very helpful operator at this time i d like to turn the call back to ms buckwalter for any closing remarks cindi buckwalter head of investor relations thank

answer any questions you may have after steve and darryl provide updates on slide 4 we present our quarterly financial results idacorp s 2019 first quarter earnings per diluted share were 0 84 an increase of 0 12 per share over last year s first quarter today we also affirm our full year 2019 earnings guidance estimate in the range of 4 30 and 4 45 per diluted share i will now turn the call over to steve steve keen senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thanks justin and welcome everyone customer growth has accelerated in idaho power service area with an annual growth rate of 2 4 over the last 12 months this growth along with colder winter weather and higher transmission wheeling related revenues combined to open 2019 with a strong first quarter for idacorp turning to slide 5 a reconciliation of the changes from the first quarter of 2018 to the first quarter this year begin with customer growth which added 4 1 million to operating income in the quarter overall usage per customer increased operating income by an additional 1 9 million however this higher per customer usage was largely related to residential customers as a result of colder temperatures than last year s first quarter you ll also note an offsetting decrease of 2 3 million in fixed costs adjustment revenues further down the table overall heating degree days during the first three months of 2019 were relatively close to normal though higher than last year the comparatively colder weather also increased the proportion of residential sales in higher rate categories under idaho power s tiered rate structure and was the primary reason for the 3 7 million increase in retail revenues per megawatt hour that is next on the reconciliation table these revenue items net to a 7 4 million benefit to operating income idaho power also benefited from a 4 million increase from higher transmission wheeling related revenues this is the fourth quarter in a row that we have seen higher wheeling revenues related to regional wholesale market activity as you may have heard on other earnings calls the enbridge pipeline situation and the resulting efforts to increase maintenance on pipeline infrastructure have impacted market dynamics in a way that we believe contributed to a portion of these higher transmission related revenues predicting the duration of that pipeline response is difficult but we expect some moderation to occur going forward however we believe at least some of the regional transmission market conditions maybe ongoing due to more general market dynamics the increase in volume for the quarter was slightly offset by a 10 decrease in open access transmission tariff rate that became effective last october wheeling rates reset annually to align with actual costs and revenue impact other operating and maintenance expenses were 2 7 million higher in the first quarter o m related to thermal generation increased 1 5 million due primarily to increased generation at the north valmy coal fired plant for which a corresponding amount was recorded as revenues the remaining increase was primarily due to various inflationary impacts for our full year we still expect o m expenses to fall in the range of 350 million to 360 million the results of all of these items led to an increase in operating income of 7 6 million over the last year s first quarter earnings of equity method investments that largely consist of earnings from bridger coal company returned to a more normal level compared with the prior year s first quarter which was driven by abnormally high coal prices in that period this change resulted in 1 9 million decrease in this line item for the quarter for the full year our expectations remain in line with prior years a higher pre tax income led to slightly higher income tax during the first quarter in addition during the first quarter of 2018 we recorded 0 5 million of additional accumulated deferred investment tax credits or aditc in anticipation of needing some amount of additional credits to support full year 2018 earnings that accrual was reversed in the second quarter last year this year we did not record any additional aditc as we no longer anticipate needing to utilize any additional credits under our idaho regulatory stipulation overall idaho power s and idacorp s net income were 5 7 million and 6 6 million higher than the first quarter of last year respectively idacorp and idaho power continue to maintain strong balance sheets including investment grade credit ratings with sound liquidity enabling us to fund ongoing capital expenditures and dividend payments as a reminder we expect to recommend to the board of directors future annual dividend increases of 5 or more to be near the upper end of the target payout range of between 50 and 60 of sustainable idacorp earnings over the past several years the board has approved increases in the dividend in september for a total increase of 110 in the annualized dividend since 2011 on slide 6 we show idacorp s operating cash flows along with our liquidity position as of the end of march 2019 cash flow from operations was approximately 35 million lower than the first three months of 2018 mostly related to the timing of working capital receipts and payments the liquidity available under idacorp s and idaho power s credit facility is shown on the bottom of slide 6 at this time we do not anticipate issuing additional equity in 2019 other than relatively nominal amounts under compensation plans slide 7 shows our firm s full year 2019 earnings guidance and our updated key financial and operating metrics estimates we continue to expect idacorp s 2019 earnings to be in the range of 4 30 to 4 45 per diluted share our strong first quarter results allow us to expect no use of additional aditc under our idaho regulatory stipulation in 2019 again preserving the full 45 million for future years as mentioned earlier we have no change to our expected o m range we also affirm our expectation that capital expenditures will be between 280 million and 290 million strong winter snowpack and current reservoir storage conditions combined with the current forecast suggest that hydroelectric generation should now be in the range of 7 million to 9 million megawatt hours as always our guidance assumptions reflect normal weather conditions going forward looking forward to the remainder of the year i want to remind you that we have several recent second quarters where nonrecurring items impacted the result while we don t provide quarterly guidance keep in mind that we are not currently expecting any such nonrecurring items to hit this year s second quarter with that i ll turn the presentation over to darrel darrel anderson president and chief executive officer thanks steve and thanks again for everyone joining us on today s call as steve noted the first quarter was a very successful quarter for idacorp and idaho power this is the best first quarter financial performance in the history of idaho power company and i believe is primarily attributable to the operations of the core business in addition during the quarter we introduced our 100 clean energy goal that highlights the path we have been traveling for many years to provide safe reliable clean energy to our customers at a fair price while focusing on generating long term competitive returns for our shareholders i will talk more about that a little later on slide 9 and as steve noted you ll see that customer growth remains robust and is up 2 4 over the past 12 months this is the highest number we have seen since before the great recession up from 2 3 last quarter as new residential and business customers continue to move to our service area and existing customers expand our company benefits from increased energy sales and further business development opportunities at the same time we believe and research from the milken institute and others supports that the reliable affordable clean energy idaho power provides is one of the key contributors for continued economic growth in our region several notable large load projects came online this quarter in idaho power service area these include simplot grower solutions a new fertilizer plant in eastern idaho capitol distributing s new distribution center at the sky ranch industrial park in southwestern idaho and premier technology s new welding and fabrication center also in the eastern part of our service area we expect additional projects to begin taking service throughout the year and we continue to receive new large load requests while construction activities of both large and small projects continuing to move forward moody s latest forecast of gross domestic product in idaho power service area predicts growth at 3 8 in 2019 and 3 4 in 2020 showing that a positive growth trend continues in the near term employment within our region also remains on an upward trend compared to this time last year employment within idaho power service area has grown 2 8 now 532 000 people employed another new record unemployment in idaho power service area into the first quarter was 2 7 compared to 3 8 nationally turning to slide 10 just last month we reached a pair of important and related milestones on hells canyon complex relicensing the state of idaho and oregon finalized the settlement that we helped negotiate related to reintroduction of steelhead and spring chinook salmon into the snake river above hells canyon as part of the settlement our company committed to spend an additional 20 million over the term of the license for hatchery expansion research water quality and habitat improvement the state also approved our broader proposal to achieve our water quality obligations under section 401 of the federal clean water act these agreements should remove significant obstacles toward achieving a new long term federal license for our three hydroelectric dams in hells canyon several governmental approvals are still required so we still do not expect to receive a new federal license from the federal energy regulatory commission or fer until 2022 however this is very positive step forward once the license is issued by the fer the company will begin operating under new compliance requirements those requirements are expected to increase both o m expenses and capital expenditures given the uncertainty regarding the timing of the new license these expected increases in capital costs have not been included in our most recent capital expenditure projections as estimates are updated to reflect new compliance requirements we expect to begin showing the increased level of the capital expenditures in our projections as noted on slide 11 idaho power made an important announcement in march setting a goal to provide 100 clean energy by 2045 our clean today cleaner tomorrow message has been met with positive feedback from our customers from regional national and even international media and from peers across the energy industry in considering and launching this goal the company believed it was an effective way to highlight idaho power s long standing position as a leader in clean energy as we look forward we believe advances in technology could allow idaho power to continue integrating additional clean sources into its energy mix as we move along our path away from coal fired generation and further down the road other carbon emitting resources we expect the 2019 integrated resource plan set to be filed in june to provide further clarity on economical end of life scenarios for the jim bridger power plant we have agreements in place already for ceasing operations at the other two jointly owned coal fired plants and regulatory orders for most aspects of the closures joining the western energy imbalance market and constructing the boardman to hemingway and gateway west transmission line projects will also help us move clean energy throughout the northwest and make progress toward our clean energy goal this 100 clean energy goal will not come at the expense of reliability or affordability for customers as we will look for prudent ways for shareholders to benefit i stated in february that we did not plan to file a general rate case in idaho or oregon in the next 12 months that remains true today as we look at the upcoming 12 months very low growth combined with increases in our customer base constructive regulatory outcomes and effective management of operating expenses all play significant roles as we look at the need and timing of our next general rate case i will close with a look at weather on slide 12 current projections from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration suggests a 40 to 50 chance of above normal precipitation level and a 50 to 60 chance of above normal temperatures for much of the summer thanks to our cool wet spring heavy snowfall and carryover water for back to back strong water years our snowpack and reservoir levels should provide favorable conditions for hydro generation agricultural needs as well as recreational activities as a reminder our power cost adjustment mechanisms in idaho and oregon significantly reduce earnings volatility related to changes in our resource mix and associated power supply costs with that steve and i and others on the call look forward to answering questions you may have questions answers operator the first question comes from julien dumoulin smith of bank of america merrill lynch alex morgan bank of america merrill lynch analyst good afternoon this is alex morgan calling in for julien i was wondering if there s anything that you can provide to help gauge generally what costs of relicensing might look like darrel anderson president and chief executive officer alex this is darrel one of the things that we will be looking to do is begin enhancing that disclosure in the near term as some things solidify around the relicensing side of things i think one of the things you probably already know and we talk about it in the 10 q is that we have over 300 million to date that we have spent so far that we re receiving some recovery on some of those expenses now a modest amount but we would be looking to seek recovery of those expenses as well as then the additional mitigation and compliance costs post license so we ll talk about those when we refresh our estimates for those with you but they re pretty significant over the life again if anything you have to think about it over the life which is about another 50 about what we re hoping to get is a 50 year license so you think of you have to look at those costs in the context of 50 years steve keen senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer alex this is steve i d just say i do believe that s a great question because i think as we ve talked through these long life projects as we get closer to the end then we have positive milestone that s what brings that additional capital spend closer into the picture and we had a great step this year with improved with the water quality and more to come on that so i would say stay tuned but it is a significant number that we haven t talked about a lot because we ve been focused on the relicensing itself of getting to the license but once we get the license then we will do a lot of things that really will help the river and further many of those capital projects that we ll be glad to talk about here in the near future darrel anderson president and chief executive officer alex the other thing i ll just add if you look in our the capital requirements of our 10 q and you look at the estimates that we have in there today those do not include any of those costs just as a reminder so where we show the range is out to 2023 those do not include any estimates for relicensing or for that matter also does not include any of the construction costs related to our boardman to hemingway transmission line where we also continue to see ongoing successes in attaining milestones and just as it relates boardman to hemingway you didn t ask about that but we do expect a decision or some information coming out of oregon this year which we think that we know today should be positive and so that s another piece of information to kind of focus on as you look forward as to what our capital costs will be looking at going forward alex morgan bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok thank you so much and i know you mentioned just one more quick follow up i know that you ve mentioned we might see some capex updates in sometime the rest of this year but i was wondering if there s going to be any potential eps trajectory updates considering the hells canyon relicensing the valmy plant agreement potential resolution around bridger plant and then also the transmission projects darrel anderson president and chief executive officer well we re certainly be looking at updates on our current year eps and if you think you re talking about guidance on further on out and that is something we ve discussed i think we need to do a little more just seeing what is what the potential might be to show there but i do believe there s a trajectory you guys have heard us talk about our plan that we ve we feel very fortunate to have the growth that we have you look at our growth in revenues this year we actually lowered rates from last year to this year and revenues went up significantly that s a great thing but we ve always said there s a plan after this as well and we look every year at the plan that would be filing based on growing rate base and we look at the plan of how much growth is going to come and how will that deliver us and this has been the best story currently but we ve always had our eye on that future and i think i don t know how growth that is setting records can lead us anywhere except to growing company as well and we re fortunate that we ve had some excess capacity we ve been taking advantage of right now but the long term picture for that should look a lot like others that you see that have significant capex out there so more to come and i do think we ve heard your request and i think helping you guys with that trajectory is something we re going to work on this year operator the next question comes from chris ellinghaus of williams capital chris ellinghaus williams capital group analyst if i recall correctly last year we sort of had good conditions as well for irrigation and it looks like just looking at your noaa slide that the conditions might be developing to have similar good irrigation season is that sort of what your thought processes is at this point darrel anderson president and chief executive officer chris this is darrel i think we re geared up for a good irrigation season we have i think good resources available and i think the good news is the ag community also was i think projecting a good water situation so the emphasis around more water intensive crops wasn t going to be necessary an issue like it may have been in past years so i think all those things we believe stacks up to be positive but we don t know until all the crops are in the field and they get on with it they do and they re in the middle of planting now so that s the good news and we ve got a steady again we our meteorologists tell me i can t look out more than 7 to 10 days so i don t try to do that but when i look at the next 7 to 10 days weather conditions are very conducive for the ag guys to get in the field and get on to what they re doing so it s dry and it s mid 70s to 80s so it s a really good weather so i can give you that 7 to 10 days sort of look chris ellinghaus williams capital group analyst ok how would you characterize reservoir levels you talked a little bit about snowpack but what do the reservoirs look like darrel anderson president and chief executive officer so we re going we will ask chris we have tess park who heads up our power supplier we re going to ask her to kind of comment on the reservoir side tess park vice president power supply chris this is tess on the reservoir levels the upper snake reservoirs are nearly full they re still doing their flood control but expected to refill and we re in the process of flood control the brownie reservoir will be released from flood control the end of april and start our refill trajectory but we are expected to refill chris ellinghaus williams capital group analyst one last thing i guess this dovetails into what you re saying about capex but would it be fair to say that with the new kind of we re saying clean energy plan and whatever you re going to say about bridger and irp the boardman to hemingway transmission line that was your resource plan before if bridger s retired does the boardman to hemingway line fully provide you with replacement resource darrel anderson president and chief executive officer chris this is darrel i m going to answer a little bit then we ve got mitch colburn who s here with us today who is actually help managing our irp process i think it s good for you to hear from him but i ll just tell you obviously it s a fluid process as we look at the irp right now we re right in the middle of it like we ve said we ll likely publish that in june and so we ve been looking at series of scenarios around with the bridger facilities going away different timing on what the bridger facilities winding down and so i think that boardman to hemingway continues to be an integral part of our resource opportunities i m going to let mitch kind of talk to you a little bit about it because he s the guy on the ground who is working with that so i think it would be good to hear from mitch mitch colburn manager transmission and distribution strategic projects hi chris this is mitch so given your irp as darrel mentioned boardman to hemingway is a critical element of our future and obviously a critical element of our clean energy plans as we see it we have signed a contract for solar additions in early 2020s preliminary analysis shows additional resource additions you know what we re seeing today potentially natural gas more solar there s some battery storage in our preliminary 20 year look but i d say in general as we look at potential early exits of bridger units it will drive additional resource additions steve keen senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer and chris this is steve i might just mention that while the what we have when we made the clean announcement was reference to a ppa that asset in particular is one that we ll be looking at hard to see if it is better structured as an asset we own or as a ppa and those are things that we look at as well so i do believe what you re looking at is is it possible that there s other changes to your portfolio beside boardman to hemingway and i think the answer to that is yes and relative is going to be dealing with the dynamic change that s ongoing and we don t know what technology might bring or what growth might bring so i think it ll be exciting time for us darrel anderson president and chief executive officer chris as you can imagine you take off a baseload resource you can t necessarily just replace that with intermittent resources so the combination of some type of storage devices in some form we believe is going to also be integral to the future success of this clean energy plans so one of the things we will continue to watch there is that technology evolution you ve seen some of that some of those projects in the northwest already that where folks have entered into those those types of storage and intermittent resource combinations those will be things that again in this window that we look at will absolutely be evaluated chris ellinghaus williams capital group analyst and you had this string of strong growth in your transmission system usage is there are you seeing any reason for additional transmission investment from what you ve been seeing in recent behavioral changes darrel anderson president and chief executive officer chris i think it s possible i think that s one of the things as we with boardman to hemingway we all targeted kind of pieces that we might take initially but we ll be looking very closely at that to see if the piece we originally bought is the right size or if it may make more sense because it does feel like there s some market dynamics adjustment going on and we kind of fit between a lot of things and maybe we should be taking advantage of that steve keen senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer chris the other piece of that is and we talked a little bit about it in the q is that our gateway project we ve got a couple of segments there that have permit and sighted and for us it s a matter of looking at when the needs for those are to enhance capacity across our system and so those are costs that we would look at and those costs are not in these costs that you re looking at either as it relates to the out years from a capex perspective so these are all we have given you a baseline capex but all the most of things we ve been talking about today are things that that would be added to that capex plan operator that concludes the question and answer session for today mr anderson i will turn the conference back to you darrel anderson president and chief executive officer thank you daniel thank you again for all of you who participated on our call we know you guys have had a

the federal reserve held interest rates steady on wednesday for the third time this year ignoring calls from president donald trump to slash rates by as much as one full percentage point in order to further boost the economy we have the potential to go up like a rocket if we did some lowering of rates like one point tweeted trump on tuesday with our wonderfully low inflation we could be setting major records china is adding great stimulus to its economy while at the same time keeping interest rates low our federal reserve has incessantly lifted interest rates even though inflation is very low and instituted a very big dose of quantitative tightening we have the potential to go donald j trump realdonaldtrump april 30 2019 the last time the fed cut its benchmark lending rate by one point was in december 2008 when the nation was in the grip of a financial crisis today with gdp at 3 2 percent annual growth unemployment at a near historic low of 3 8 percent and the stock market chalking up record highs the economy is far from recession era levels however economic growth in the u s is expected to slow this year as the wider global economy cools and the impact of trump s 1 5 trillion fiscal stimulus plan begins to fade a monthslong trade war between the u s and china continues to weigh on global economic growth while the fed has continually emphasized its independence it has faced increasing pressure from trump he has repeatedly and publicly criticized the central bank and its leadership despite nominating jerome powell a republican multimillionaire and former hedge fund investor to be chairman in december the fed raised rates for the fourth time in a year and said it would recommend two rate hikes this year markets plunged and trump blamed powell for the sell off a rebuke that roiled markets and even prompted an 11th hour call to the nation s top banks from treasury secretary steven mnuchin to confirm that markets can continue to function properly at its march meeting the fed sharply changed course indicating no hikes at all for 2019 the major stock market indexes are currently up by around 22 percent since their december lows the fed s stated goal as assigned by congress is to promote maximum employment and price stability through monetary policy yet powell has found he must walk a fine line between pleasing markets and the white house while maintaining the agency s independence in the face of political pressure i think the fed has shown over the last several years to be very equity market dependent andrew thrasher founder of thrasher analytics told nbc news their actions have often followed large moves within the u s stock market creating a third unofficial mandate for the federal reserve of volatility management increased politicization around future policy makers at the fed has also come into focus trump s most recent picks for two spots on the fed s board of governors have faltered before any official nomination process could begin herman cain withdrew last month after losing senate support for his possible nomination after repeatedly criticizing the central bank and weathering a series of sexual harassment allegations in withdrawing his name from consideration for the fed position cain cited the strict ethical restrictions that would have limited his income while serving on the fed board the potential nomination of stephen moore has also met with controversy in addition to questions related to his nonpayment of thousands of dollars of alimony and child support to his ex wife the economics commentator has long expressed disdain for the central bank in a recent write up moore called for powell to resign and criticized the fed s crackerjack logic and tone deaf monetary policy the white house said this week that it would be reviewing moore s writings in view of his suitability for the position when we have an update on that front we ll let you know white house press secretary sarah sanders told reporters on monday the fed s current interbank lending rate ranges from 2 25 percent to 2 5 percent it is used by financial institutions to determine interest on consumer debt such as credit cards car loans and home equity loans

representatives available to help answer any questions you may have after steve and darryl provide updates on slide 4 we present our quarterly financial results idacorp s 2019 first quarter earnings per diluted share were 0 84 an increase of 0 12 per share over last year s first quarter today we also affirm our full year 2019 earnings guidance estimate in the range of 4 30 and 4 45 per diluted share i will now turn the call over to steve steve keen senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thanks justin and welcome everyone customer growth has accelerated in idaho power service area with an annual growth rate of 2 4 over the last 12 months this growth along with colder winter weather and higher transmission wheeling related revenues combined to open 2019 with a strong first quarter for idacorp turning to slide 5 a reconciliation of the changes from the first quarter of 2018 to the first quarter this year begin with customer growth which added 4 1 million to operating income in the quarter overall usage per customer increased operating income by an additional 1 9 million however this higher per customer usage was largely related to residential customers as a result of colder temperatures than last year s first quarter you ll also note an offsetting decrease of 2 3 million in fixed costs adjustment revenues further down the table overall heating degree days during the first three months of 2019 were relatively close to normal though higher than last year the comparatively colder weather also increased the proportion of residential sales in higher rate categories under idaho power s tiered rate structure and was the primary reason for the 3 7 million increase in retail revenues per megawatt hour that is next on the reconciliation table these revenue items net to a 7 4 million benefit to operating income idaho power also benefited from a 4 million increase from higher transmission wheeling related revenues this is the fourth quarter in a row that we have seen higher wheeling revenues related to regional wholesale market activity as you may have heard on other earnings calls the enbridge pipeline situation and the resulting efforts to increase maintenance on pipeline infrastructure have impacted market dynamics in a way that we believe contributed to a portion of these higher transmission related revenues predicting the duration of that pipeline response is difficult but we expect some moderation to occur going forward however we believe at least some of the regional transmission market conditions maybe ongoing due to more general market dynamics the increase in volume for the quarter was slightly offset by a 10 decrease in open access transmission tariff rate that became effective last october wheeling rates reset annually to align with actual costs and revenue impact other operating and maintenance expenses were 2 7 million higher in the first quarter o m related to thermal generation increased 1 5 million due primarily to increased generation at the north valmy coal fired plant for which a corresponding amount was recorded as revenues the remaining increase was primarily due to various inflationary impacts for our full year we still expect o m expenses to fall in the range of 350 million to 360 million the results of all of these items led to an increase in operating income of 7 6 million over the last year s first quarter earnings of equity method investments that largely consist of earnings from bridger coal company returned to a more normal level compared with the prior year s first quarter which was driven by abnormally high coal prices in that period this change resulted in 1 9 million decrease in this line item for the quarter for the full year our expectations remain in line with prior years a higher pre tax income led to slightly higher income tax during the first quarter in addition during the first quarter of 2018 we recorded 0 5 million of additional accumulated deferred investment tax credits or aditc in anticipation of needing some amount of additional credits to support full year 2018 earnings that accrual was reversed in the second quarter last year this year we did not record any additional aditc as we no longer anticipate needing to utilize any additional credits under our idaho regulatory stipulation overall idaho power s and idacorp s net income were 5 7 million and 6 6 million higher than the first quarter of last year respectively idacorp and idaho power continue to maintain strong balance sheets including investment grade credit ratings with sound liquidity enabling us to fund ongoing capital expenditures and dividend payments as a reminder we expect to recommend to the board of directors future annual dividend increases of 5 or more to be near the upper end of the target payout range of between 50 and 60 of sustainable idacorp earnings over the past several years the board has approved increases in the dividend in september for a total increase of 110 in the annualized dividend since 2011 on slide 6 we show idacorp s operating cash flows along with our liquidity position as of the end of march 2019 cash flow from operations was approximately 35 million lower than the first three months of 2018 mostly related to the timing of working capital receipts and payments the liquidity available under idacorp s and idaho power s credit facility is shown on the bottom of slide 6 at this time we do not anticipate issuing additional equity in 2019 other than relatively nominal amounts under compensation plans slide 7 shows our firm s full year 2019 earnings guidance and our updated key financial and operating metrics estimates we continue to expect idacorp s 2019 earnings to be in the range of 4 30 to 4 45 per diluted share our strong first quarter results allow us to expect no use of additional aditc under our idaho regulatory stipulation in 2019 again preserving the full 45 million for future years as mentioned earlier we have no change to our expected o m range we also affirm our expectation that capital expenditures will be between 280 million and 290 million strong winter snowpack and current reservoir storage conditions combined with the current forecast suggest that hydroelectric generation should now be in the range of 7 million to 9 million megawatt hours as always our guidance assumptions reflect normal weather conditions going forward looking forward to the remainder of the year i want to remind you that we have several recent second quarters where nonrecurring items impacted the result while we don t provide quarterly guidance keep in mind that we are not currently expecting any such nonrecurring items to hit this year s second quarter with that i ll turn the presentation over to darrel darrel anderson president and chief executive officer thanks steve and thanks again for everyone joining us on today s call as steve noted the first quarter was a very successful quarter for idacorp and idaho power this is the best first quarter financial performance in the history of idaho power company and i believe is primarily attributable to the operations of the core business in addition during the quarter we introduced our 100 clean energy goal that highlights the path we have been traveling for many years to provide safe reliable clean energy to our customers at a fair price while focusing on generating long term competitive returns for our shareholders i will talk more about that a little later on slide 9 and as steve noted you ll see that customer growth remains robust and is up 2 4 over the past 12 months this is the highest number we have seen since before the great recession up from 2 3 last quarter as new residential and business customers continue to move to our service area and existing customers expand our company benefits from increased energy sales and further business development opportunities at the same time we believe and research from the milken institute and others supports that the reliable affordable clean energy idaho power provides is one of the key contributors for continued economic growth in our region several notable large load projects came online this quarter in idaho power service area these include simplot grower solutions a new fertilizer plant in eastern idaho capitol distributing s new distribution center at the sky ranch industrial park in southwestern idaho and premier technology s new welding and fabrication center also in the eastern part of our service area we expect additional projects to begin taking service throughout the year and we continue to receive new large load requests while construction activities of both large and small projects continuing to move forward moody s latest forecast of gross domestic product in idaho power service area predicts growth at 3 8 in 2019 and 3 4 in 2020 showing that a positive growth trend continues in the near term employment within our region also remains on an upward trend compared to this time last year employment within idaho power service area has grown 2 8 now 532 000 people employed another new record unemployment in idaho power service area into the first quarter was 2 7 compared to 3 8 nationally turning to slide 10 just last month we reached a pair of important and related milestones on hells canyon complex relicensing the state of idaho and oregon finalized the settlement that we helped negotiate related to reintroduction of steelhead and spring chinook salmon into the snake river above hells canyon as part of the settlement our company committed to spend an additional 20 million over the term of the license for hatchery expansion research water quality and habitat improvement the state also approved our broader proposal to achieve our water quality obligations under section 401 of the federal clean water act these agreements should remove significant obstacles toward achieving a new long term federal license for our three hydroelectric dams in hells canyon several governmental approvals are still required so we still do not expect to receive a new federal license from the federal energy regulatory commission or fer until 2022 however this is very positive step forward once the license is issued by the fer the company will begin operating under new compliance requirements those requirements are expected to increase both o m expenses and capital expenditures given the uncertainty regarding the timing of the new license these expected increases in capital costs have not been included in our most recent capital expenditure projections as estimates are updated to reflect new compliance requirements we expect to begin showing the increased level of the capital expenditures in our projections as noted on slide 11 idaho power made an important announcement in march setting a goal to provide 100 clean energy by 2045 our clean today cleaner tomorrow message has been met with positive feedback from our customers from regional national and even international media and from peers across the energy industry in considering and launching this goal the company believed it was an effective way to highlight idaho power s long standing position as a leader in clean energy as we look forward we believe advances in technology could allow idaho power to continue integrating additional clean sources into its energy mix as we move along our path away from coal fired generation and further down the road other carbon emitting resources we expect the 2019 integrated resource plan set to be filed in june to provide further clarity on economical end of life scenarios for the jim bridger power plant we have agreements in place already for ceasing operations at the other two jointly owned coal fired plants and regulatory orders for most aspects of the closures joining the western energy imbalance market and constructing the boardman to hemingway and gateway west transmission line projects will also help us move clean energy throughout the northwest and make progress toward our clean energy goal this 100 clean energy goal will not come at the expense of reliability or affordability for customers as we will look for prudent ways for shareholders to benefit i stated in february that we did not plan to file a general rate case in idaho or oregon in the next 12 months that remains true today as we look at the upcoming 12 months very low growth combined with increases in our customer base constructive regulatory outcomes and effective management of operating expenses all play significant roles as we look at the need and timing of our next general rate case i will close with a look at weather on slide 12 current projections from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration suggests a 40 to 50 chance of above normal precipitation level and a 50 to 60 chance of above normal temperatures for much of the summer thanks to our cool wet spring heavy snowfall and carryover water for back to back strong water years our snowpack and reservoir levels should provide favorable conditions for hydro generation agricultural needs as well as recreational activities as a reminder our power cost adjustment mechanisms in idaho and oregon significantly reduce earnings volatility related to changes in our resource mix and associated power supply costs with that steve and i and others on the call look forward to answering questions you may have questions answers operator the first question comes from julien dumoulin smith of bank of america merrill lynch alex morgan bank of america merrill lynch analyst good afternoon this is alex morgan calling in for julien i was wondering if there s anything that you can provide to help gauge generally what costs of relicensing might look like darrel anderson president and chief executive officer alex this is darrel one of the things that we will be looking to do is begin enhancing that disclosure in the near term as some things solidify around the relicensing side of things i think one of the things you probably already know and we talk about it in the 10 q is that we have over 300 million to date that we have spent so far that we re receiving some recovery on some of those expenses now a modest amount but we would be looking to seek recovery of those expenses as well as then the additional mitigation and compliance costs post license so we ll talk about those when we refresh our estimates for those with you but they re pretty significant over the life again if anything you have to think about it over the life which is about another 50 about what we re hoping to get is a 50 year license so you think of you have to look at those costs in the context of 50 years steve keen senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer alex this is steve i d just say i do believe that s a great question because i think as we ve talked through these long life projects as we get closer to the end then we have positive milestone that s what brings that additional capital spend closer into the picture and we had a great step this year with improved with the water quality and more to come on that so i would say stay tuned but it is a significant number that we haven t talked about a lot because we ve been focused on the relicensing itself of getting to the license but once we get the license then we will do a lot of things that really will help the river and further many of those capital projects that we ll be glad to talk about here in the near future darrel anderson president and chief executive officer alex the other thing i ll just add if you look in our the capital requirements of our 10 q and you look at the estimates that we have in there today those do not include any of those costs just as a reminder so where we show the range is out to 2023 those do not include any estimates for relicensing or for that matter also does not include any of the construction costs related to our boardman to hemingway transmission line where we also continue to see ongoing successes in attaining milestones and just as it relates boardman to hemingway you didn t ask about that but we do expect a decision or some information coming out of oregon this year which we think that we know today should be positive and so that s another piece of information to kind of focus on as you look forward as to what our capital costs will be looking at going forward alex morgan bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok thank you so much and i know you mentioned just one more quick follow up i know that you ve mentioned we might see some capex updates in sometime the rest of this year but i was wondering if there s going to be any potential eps trajectory updates considering the hells canyon relicensing the valmy plant agreement potential resolution around bridger plant and then also the transmission projects darrel anderson president and chief executive officer well we re certainly be looking at updates on our current year eps and if you think you re talking about guidance on further on out and that is something we ve discussed i think we need to do a little more just seeing what is what the potential might be to show there but i do believe there s a trajectory you guys have heard us talk about our plan that we ve we feel very fortunate to have the growth that we have you look at our growth in revenues this year we actually lowered rates from last year to this year and revenues went up significantly that s a great thing but we ve always said there s a plan after this as well and we look every year at the plan that would be filing based on growing rate base and we look at the plan of how much growth is going to come and how will that deliver us and this has been the best story currently but we ve always had our eye on that future and i think i don t know how growth that is setting records can lead us anywhere except to growing company as well and we re fortunate that we ve had some excess capacity we ve been taking advantage of right now but the long term picture for that should look a lot like others that you see that have significant capex out there so more to come and i do think we ve heard your request and i think helping you guys with that trajectory is something we re going to work on this year operator the next question comes from chris ellinghaus of williams capital chris ellinghaus williams capital group analyst if i recall correctly last year we sort of had good conditions as well for irrigation and it looks like just looking at your noaa slide that the conditions might be developing to have similar good irrigation season is that sort of what your thought processes is at this point darrel anderson president and chief executive officer chris this is darrel i think we re geared up for a good irrigation season we have i think good resources available and i think the good news is the ag community also was i think projecting a good water situation so the emphasis around more water intensive crops wasn t going to be necessary an issue like it may have been in past years so i think all those things we believe stacks up to be positive but we don t know until all the crops are in the field and they get on with it they do and they re in the middle of planting now so that s the good news and we ve got a steady again we our meteorologists tell me i can t look out more than 7 to 10 days so i don t try to do that but when i look at the next 7 to 10 days weather conditions are very conducive for the ag guys to get in the field and get on to what they re doing so it s dry and it s mid 70s to 80s so it s a really good weather so i can give you that 7 to 10 days sort of look chris ellinghaus williams capital group analyst ok how would you characterize reservoir levels you talked a little bit about snowpack but what do the reservoirs look like darrel anderson president and chief executive officer so we re going we will ask chris we have tess park who heads up our power supplier we re going to ask her to kind of comment on the reservoir side tess park vice president power supply chris this is tess on the reservoir levels the upper snake reservoirs are nearly full they re still doing their flood control but expected to refill and we re in the process of flood control the brownie reservoir will be released from flood control the end of april and start our refill trajectory but we are expected to refill chris ellinghaus williams capital group analyst one last thing i guess this dovetails into what you re saying about capex but would it be fair to say that with the new kind of we re saying clean energy plan and whatever you re going to say about bridger and irp the boardman to hemingway transmission line that was your resource plan before if bridger s retired does the boardman to hemingway line fully provide you with replacement resource darrel anderson president and chief executive officer chris this is darrel i m going to answer a little bit then we ve got mitch colburn who s here with us today who is actually help managing our irp process i think it s good for you to hear from him but i ll just tell you obviously it s a fluid process as we look at the irp right now we re right in the middle of it like we ve said we ll likely publish that in june and so we ve been looking at series of scenarios around with the bridger facilities going away different timing on what the bridger facilities winding down and so i think that boardman to hemingway continues to be an integral part of our resource opportunities i m going to let mitch kind of talk to you a little bit about it because he s the guy on the ground who is working with that so i think it would be good to hear from mitch mitch colburn manager transmission and distribution strategic projects hi chris this is mitch so given your irp as darrel mentioned boardman to hemingway is a critical element of our future and obviously a critical element of our clean energy plans as we see it we have signed a contract for solar additions in early 2020s preliminary analysis shows additional resource additions you know what we re seeing today potentially natural gas more solar there s some battery storage in our preliminary 20 year look but i d say in general as we look at potential early exits of bridger units it will drive additional resource additions steve keen senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer and chris this is steve i might just mention that while the what we have when we made the clean announcement was reference to a ppa that asset in particular is one that we ll be looking at hard to see if it is better structured as an asset we own or as a ppa and those are things that we look at as well so i do believe what you re looking at is is it possible that there s other changes to your portfolio beside boardman to hemingway and i think the answer to that is yes and relative is going to be dealing with the dynamic change that s ongoing and we don t know what technology might bring or what growth might bring so i think it ll be exciting time for us darrel anderson president and chief executive officer chris as you can imagine you take off a baseload resource you can t necessarily just replace that with intermittent resources so the combination of some type of storage devices in some form we believe is going to also be integral to the future success of this clean energy plans so one of the things we will continue to watch there is that technology evolution you ve seen some of that some of those projects in the northwest already that where folks have entered into those those types of storage and intermittent resource combinations those will be things that again in this window that we look at will absolutely be evaluated chris ellinghaus williams capital group analyst and you had this string of strong growth in your transmission system usage is there are you seeing any reason for additional transmission investment from what you ve been seeing in recent behavioral changes darrel anderson president and chief executive officer chris i think it s possible i think that s one of the things as we with boardman to hemingway we all targeted kind of pieces that we might take initially but we ll be looking very closely at that to see if the piece we originally bought is the right size or if it may make more sense because it does feel like there s some market dynamics adjustment going on and we kind of fit between a lot of things and maybe we should be taking advantage of that steve keen senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer chris the other piece of that is and we talked a little bit about it in the q is that our gateway project we ve got a couple of segments there that have permit and sighted and for us it s a matter of looking at when the needs for those are to enhance capacity across our system and so those are costs that we would look at and those costs are not in these costs that you re looking at either as it relates to the out years from a capex perspective so these are all we have given you a baseline capex but all the most of things we ve been talking about today are things that that would be added to that capex plan operator that concludes

advertisement advertisement todd stevens president and chief executive officer thank you scott and thank you to everyone for attending today s earnings call crc started 2019 with a great first quarter and made significant progress toward strengthening our balance sheet we demonstrated the flexibility of our business model as well as our ability to quickly adjust to market conditions and align our value driven capital program with expected cash flow crc benefits from the differentiated scale and diversity of our world class portfolio which provides exceptional optionality that enhances our operations in california while navigating commodity price volatility as we highlighted on our last earnings call we lowered the number of rigs in late 2018 to respond to this volatility and we reduced our activity as we entered the year and moved through the quarter as always our 2019 plan focuses on living within cash flow enhancing cash margins and maximizing the value of our investments there s been a lot of recent interest in california legislative activity and i want to start out by providing context to our state s energy landscape california has an incredible thirst for petroleum products which underpin our modern lifestyle well beyond gas for our cars and trucks californians consume an immense amount of energy on a stand alone basis we re the fourth largest global consumer of energy to meet this need the state imports 73 of its crude last year californians effectively sent over 32 billion to saudi arabia iraq and kuwait and other places outside the state by importing oil advertisement advertisement by comparison this is the equivalent of 26 of california s general fund budget last year californians consume every drop of oil produced in the state and we represent a vital industry that provides high paying middle class career path that enables californians to achieve the american dream crc produces under the world s leading environmental safety labor and human rights standard and is inherently aligned with the california s progressive values native production doesn t just benefit our shareholders workforce and consumers the california s state lands commission is one of the largest mineral owners and the oil and gas industry contributes substantially to state and local revenues for example our long beach operations alone have generated over 4 8 billion in the last 15 years for the state los angeles county and the city of long beach legislation that would export jobs diminish much needed public revenue increase reliance on oil imported from countries that don t share our values and environmental standards is both irresponsible and misguided in fact just shipping imported oil to california already burns over 250 million gallons of marine fuel per year replacing native production with imported oil would burn nearly an additional 100 million gallons of marine fuel per year further increasing overall worldwide emissions responsible policymakers in sacramento and across the state recognizes these facts in a critical would of our industry and workforce we expect there is thoughtful leadership to prevail as it has in the past looking ahead crc s greatest competitive advantage rely in our long life low risk high quality resource base operated by our exceptional team one factor that highlights this strength is our r p ratio of nearly 15 supported by low capital intensity low declining assets the majority of our proved reserves nearly three quarters are in the proved developed category which further highlights the low risk predictable and long live nature of our california resource base this provides for a healthy pipeline of development opportunities ahead as well as continued growth in our 3p reserves another factor that highlights our resource base is our significant inventory that meets or exceeds our internal vci metric of 1 3 the strength of this pipeline has also been validated through continued joint venture interest advertisement advertisement at 65 brent our actionable inventory currently stands above 800 million barrels of oil equivalent and over 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent at 75 brent finally crc s resource advantage was further demonstrated by our attractive organic and finding and development costs which have which has run approximately 750 per barrel over the last three years this low f d cost aids in our value driven full cycle economics and translate to cash margin expansion i m also pleased to say that our valuable resources were validated just yesterday with the reaffirmation of our borrowing base at 2 3 billion we ll continue to strategically leverage crc s resource advantage are made prudent with our capital investment we expect relatively flat production from the second quarter through the end of the year with investments focused primarily on crude oil while there appear to be many factors point to higher prices throughout the year we are prepared for future volatility we remain responsive enhance our hedge book as needed and continue to pursue disciplined capital allocation based on the current strip we believe our 2019 capital program which was based on 60 brent will allow crc to generate substantial free cash flow this amount of free cash flow will ultimately depend upon realized prices for the remainder of the year and it could be significant particularly relative to the size of our planned program we will dedicate this free cash flow in addition to the proceeds from potential transaction activity toward strengthening our balance sheet this will enable crc to achieve our objective of applying 10 to 15 or more of our discretionary cash flow toward that end on the transaction front we have progressed multiple discussions with several counterparties following a pause during the crude oil market downturn during the fourth quarter of 2018 we maintain in all of the above approach to reducing our debt burden we know there are multiple ways to achieve our balance sheet objective and we intend to be strategic as we continue these discussions on that point we closed on the monetization of a producing asset yesterday selling a 50 interest and operatorship of certain shallow zones at our lost hills steamflood field in a transaction with a private e p company for total consideration in excess of 200 million advertisement advertisement this consisted of 168 million in cash and a minimum carry on our remaining 50 non operated working interest of 35 million this reflects a valuation of 88 000 per flowing barrel including the carry the carry covers 100 of our investment in 200 development wells through 2023 crc will retain all of our deep rights prior to the sale our lost hills oil field produced approximately 4 600 net barrels of oil per day our diverse portfolio of assets is generating interest on many fronts including producing properties minerals and infrastructure transactions we continue to execute against our capital program and pursue jvs as they makes sense to bring value forward for our shareholders we posted solid cash flow during the first quarter and ebitdax was 301 million production was down slightly from the prior quarter due to downtime at one of our gas plants and other factors although occasional downtime is to be expected given crc s large scale operations we re able to consistently maintain a high level of reliability thanks to our team s quick turnaround time to ensure continuity across our operations with this laser focus on operational excellence we also maintain a relatively flat cost structure during the first quarter on the operation side despite higher energy costs during the quarter we also benefited from higher crude oil realizations which were up about 10 year over year including hedges as you know we received attractive brent based pricing as waterborne crude drives the california market california has complex refineries for which crc s crude is ideal international analogous that crc grade crude remain in high demand advertisement advertisement additionally the same in state refineries produce the spec product of gasoline and low sulfur diesel these factors position crc well for the shift to the international maritime organization sulfur standards next year instead of strong demand for native california crude for the foreseeable future at the same time we are thoughtfully putting hedges in place to underpin our cash flow opportunistically through the cycle details on our first quarter performance and our borrowing base affirmations i will now turn the call over to mark mark smith senior executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks todd crc s asset base performed as expected in the first quarter of the year delivering production within our guidance range while maintaining relatively flat production costs our overall economics in margin performance remains strong underscoring the diversity and optionality of our asset base as well as our operational focus on driving value we registered production of 133 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during the first quarter contributing to quarterly ebitdax of 301 million ebitdax margins of 38 and adjusted net income of 31 million or 0 63 per diluted share after the lost hills transaction we expect relatively flat production through the end of the year under our current capital program as todd highlighted we responded quickly to the steep decline in commodity prices experienced in the fourth quarter of last year we began the first quarter of 2019 by initiating a lower capital program aligning our activity with expected cash flow and a continued focus on efficiency capital in the quarter was largely directed to activity in the san joaquin and los angeles basins advertisement advertisement we drilled 60 wells centered primarily on our core san joaquin basin properties including elk hills and buena vista fields the los angeles basin saw activity in both the huntington beach area and wilmington field while both sacramento and ventura operations continued to show remarkable resilience by maintaining flat production on a sequential basis with no capital directed toward drilling new development wells relying instead on limited work overs and thorough well surveillance during the quarter we controlled the controllables and delivered consistent cash flow generation from our high margin low decline asset base with opportunistic hedges to underpin our capital program and jv capital to supplement our internally funded capital program we look to extend our proven track record in 2019 capitalizing on healthy brit base differentials and capturing the full value of our world class resources as we ve discussed we have multiple monetization opportunities within our large portfolio of assets to strengthen our financial position as todd noted the lost hills transaction garnered over 200 million of considerations and that s excluding 168 million in cash which we applied to pay down our revolver in addition during the first quarter crc purchased an aggregate 18 million face value of our second lien notes in the open market for a price 14 million demonstrating our commitment to balance sheet strengthening through debt repurchases in the quarter and debt reduction from the proceeds of the lost hills transaction we ve made good progress in lowering our total debt to 5 1 billion i m pleased to advise that our bank group reaffirmed our borrowing base at 2 3 billion effective yesterday which we consider another point of external validation of our commitment to balance sheet strengthening now turning to the details of our financial performance for the first quarter of 2019 we produced an average of 133 000 boe per day during the first quarter that s up 8 over the prior year period our performance included oil production averaging 84 000 barrels per day which was up 9 over the prior year period first quarter 2019 results included negative psc effects the gas plant downtime that todd mentioned earlier as well as power outages we continue to benefit from premium brent based pricing and realizations in the first quarter of 2019 oil differentials were robust registering 99 of brent before the effective of hedges our hedge program which underpins our capital program by sporting cash flow in the face of bulk of commodity prices enhanced our realized pricing by a 1 98 per barrel for an average realized price of 65 28 per barrel advertisement advertisement ngl realizations were stronger than expected and came in at 67 of brent continuing to reflect compelling local markets natural gas realizations were at 106 of nymex to the seasonality trends magnified by limited third party storage within california production cost for the first quarter of 2019 were 233 million or 19 46 per boe within our stated guidance range despite higher energy prices our focus on our controllable cost kept per barrel cost relatively flat versus the prior year period excluding psc effects our first quarter production costs would have been 8 01 per boe general and administrative costs were 6 93 per boe in line with our guidance range the majority of the increase over the previous quarter corresponded to a 51 increase in crc stock price during the first quarter which drove higher cash settled equity based incentive compensation costs at all levels of the organization as we ve previously discussed changes in our stock price introduced volatility in our income statement because a portion of our stock based rewards are cash settled and our mark to market every quarter taxes other than on income which are largely comprised of ad valorem taxes based on the value of the resource of the ground are paid and paid to the counties plus our ghg cost came in as expected for the first quarter of 2019 we reported a net loss of 67 million attributable to our common stock or 1 38 per diluted share adjusting for unusual and infrequent items and other non cash items such as non cash derivative gains and losses that are generally excluded from core earnings by investment analysts our net income would have been 31 million or 0 63 per diluted share adjusted ebitdax for the first quarter of 2019 was 301 million up 20 from the same quarter last year reflecting a stable adjusted ebitdax margin of 38 crc reported cash flow from operating activities of 158 million in the first quarter of 2019 cash flow was affected by a negative working capital change as fourth quarter 2018 levels rolled off as we moved through the first part of the year in the first quarter we generated approximately 190 million in discretionary cash flow comparing favorably to our internally funded capital investments of 104 million this level of free cash flow generation demonstrates the flexibility of our business model responsiveness to commodity prices during the fourth quarter of 2018 and our move to prudently adjusted capital program in the first quarter of 2019 we reduced our rig count from 10 rigs at the end of the fourth quarter down to six rigs by the end of the first quarter of 2019 including rigs focused on jv drilling this quick action lowered our internally funded capital by 40 and our total capital program by 30 from fourth quarter 2018 level a high level of operational control of our broad portfolio allows us to pivot during volatile periods and rapidly adjust plans to recalibrate our activity with expected cash flows we have a proven track record of focusing on value and we ll continue to respond and adapt accordingly just to see it in a wide range of environments our philosophy regarding hedging continues to target up to 50 of our oil production generally over 12 month to 18 month periods in order to provide more certainty in cash flows and support our capital program we recently added 5 000 barrels per day of swaps and 10 000 barrels per day of put spreads covering the first half of 2020 bringing the total hedge volume to 25 000 barrels and 15 000 barrels for the first and second quarters of 2020 respectively please refer to our earnings release for the details on our hedge positions as we look ahead we will continue to play to our strengths developing our extensive inventory of actionable projects working to capture the full value of our high quality long life and low risk assets we take pride in our flexible business model which is designed to facilitate dynamic capital allocation and deliver value utilizing our vci metrics across a varying range of price scenarios additionally we benefit from both our integrated infrastructure designed for scale as well as a relentless drive for operational excellence we ll continue to identify more ways we can add value for crc shareholders please note that we provide a detailed analysis of adjusted items as well as key second quarter 2019 guidance information in the attachments to our earnings release i ll be happy to take any questions you may have on that information and on other aspects of our results during the q a portion of the call i ll now turn it back over to todd todd stevens president and chief executive officer thanks mark crc continued to deliver solid results in the first quarter of 2019 with a disciplined capital program a diverse low decline asset base with healthy brent based realizations and our focus on margins that centers on controlling our controllable crc is able to register predictable and consistent results quarter after quarter demonstrating our optionality and importantly meaningful cash flow generation in addition we remain keenly focused on simplifying our balance sheet lowering the overall level of debt while utilizing joint ventures to derisk and unlock the full potential of crc s resilient asset base we are now happy to take your questions questions answers operator and our first question today comes from kalei akamine from bank of america please go ahead kalei akamine bank of america merrill lynch analyst good afternoon thanks for taking my question here todd in your opening remarks you started off by addressing the california legislation ab 345 and i m not going to ask you to handicap the odds of this passing but i will ask you to talk about where the bill is in the latest legislative process and any important dates that we should be a paying attention to over the course of this quarter todd stevens president and chief executive officer yeah kalei obviously i think topical in many ways but it s really early in legislative process prematurely to speculate on this bill or other bills but you got to remember we have a proven track record of crc of constructive outreach and policy issues that affect our state and our communities and we ve done this for years so this is not anything new but when you think about where it is like i said it s fairly new it s passed out of an assembly committee i don t think anyone thought there was no chance it there was a chance it wasn t going to pass over the assembly committee it would have to pass out of that now out of the appropriations committee where it sits and take into account the environmental employee and other economic impacts and i addressed some of that earlier when we talked about it and if it passed out of that it would have to then go to the assembly and then it will continue this process into the state senate and if we assign to a senate committee and then it go and as we pass out of that and go into the appropriation side of the senate and then it would have to go to the full senate and then if this goes then it would end up in the governor s desk in this timeframe to give you an idea the legislative session for would end sometime in september or october with these bills could end up on the governor s desk but i think the fact that the way the bill sits in its current form are essentially the odds are really close to zero if not zero be ending up in some substantially its current form by the time if it somehow made it through all this to that kalei akamine bank of america merrill lynch analyst i appreciate you answering that my second question just on lost hills just want to understand a little bit better it looks like a pretty fairly priced deal that could improve in your favor as the asset grows wondering if you can share a little bit about the rationale why this asset why now and your broader philosophy about monetizing upstream cash flows todd stevens president and chief executive officer yes as you know we everything is done around our vci metric and we rank order our inventory on our vci metric and we look for things that compete for crc capital while we live within cash flow then we look at things that could be potentially jv or in effect if we didn t think it could be jv is there a way to monetize it that makes sense and i think what we did here is effectively create a hybrid jv while monetizing 50 of our interest in transferring operatorship and control the asset while having a carry on our remaining interest because we don t think it ll probably would repeat for our internal capital going forward and so but we like the asset and we think that the new operator has an opportunity now to improve on the economics and invest that company s capital in the asset so i think this is the potential win win with kind of this hybrid jv monetization that we did here and really we re pleased with the upfront monetization we re pleased with the opportunity to grow the value and hopefully get it to compete for capital in the future and also you got to remember here we retain the deep rights and as you know california is fairly prolific with over 400 different producing horizons and this is pretty this is really the shallow steamflood is what we re talking about that was monetized here at lost hills kalei akamine bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks guys operator and our next question comes from silvio micheloto with mizuho please go ahead with your question paul sankey mizuho analyst hi guys this is paul sankey with silvio alongside me one just quick question is a follow up on the california stuff is what i don t know if this is my question or not but why did the stock so heavily hit on this when as you said it wasn t really a surprise and probably won t go anywhere todd stevens president and chief executive officer i think there is this heightened awareness given we ve had this type of activity in california for many many years and we paul sankey mizuho analyst yes because silvio and i cover refining in california as well for many many years and we ve sort of been through this movie before todd stevens president and chief executive officer to give you an idea you see this like in california you have a severance tax proposed this year i think in the last 30 years there s probably hasn t been a year that wasn t one proposed including a ballot measure but they ve never come to fruition again i think you get through the kind of misguided and irresponsible legislation and it has to work its way through all the gateways of the system and i think the heightened awareness of the activism that has gone on for here in california for years it s has gone to colorado and elsewhere so i think that when there was somebody i can t remember the name of it they published the awareness of ab 345 and it just spooked everyone and i think they sold first and asked questions later and we had that terrible down day last week but i think fundamentals haven t changed at all we ve dealt with these type of like i said misguided legislation in the past and frankly very reckless when you think about the california economy so again it s ordinary across of business is that things will work through and we think i mean thoughtful people in sacramento will eventually come to bear and understand what this mean paul sankey mizuho analyst understood so that if i could ask you a question which i think you will be probably lot happier talking about but i was intrigued that you highlighting your degree of flexibility and you talked about how you ve been able to change the number of rigs as rapidly as you through what s been the extraordinary volatility really over the last what is it now eight months in oil i was just wondering can you dig a bit deeper on the ability to change it seems i don t now understand quite heck contractually you could you could drill rigs as quick as you can or pick them up again for example any other observations you have about that thank you scott espenshade senior vice president investor relations and land yes paul good question i think it highlights really our asset base but also the supply chain market for services here in california i think when you look at our asset base we really have the assets of a super major buried and independent so we have effectively operating control over almost every one of our assets now we ve lost sales obviously we ceded operatorship so the ability to quickly shift activity we have that within our grasp we re not in anyone else s behalf the supply chain when you think about the type of rigs and the type of services that are in california most of that iron doesn t really leave the state it s really the deep iron will leave the state the deep more complex rigs but the shallower rigs the medium rigs they typically stay in the state so you re able to being the largest operator in most active driller both drilling rigs and workover rigs in the state we were able to price in this flexibility and enable us to have this kind of optionality because we we ve had to manage through this downturn since inception so it s been important for us to be able to manage our activity and manage our cash flow appropriately operator and our next question comes from pavel molchanov with raymond james please go ahead pavel molchanov raymond james analyst thanks for taking the question apologies but i m going to ask another one about ab 345 to your knowledge is there any anybody from the governor s office that is encouraging or pushing this effort in the legislature todd stevens president and chief executive officer not to my knowledge and i think that if you were to ask the long line of people not just our industry but business agriculture everyone else up in sacramento and the all kind of responsible citizens that are up against this i think it will be hard to find someone that s pushing behind the scenes with the exception of probably some irrational activists who want to send us back to a pre industrial age pavel molchanov raymond james analyst ok and there are some reporting in the media that governor knew some plans to issue his own kind of oil and gas policy in the near future any sense of what the process will be for that and any indications on what he may say todd stevens president and chief executive officer we have no indication and know what it s a i think it d be speculative and premature me to say anything that i think just so you know he s been around sacramento and understands what drives the state what drives the state economy and i know the thoughtful heads will prevail here at the end of the day but he is also driven to try and drive to a more balanced approach and in driving more renewables into the system which we ve done in the state effectively but i think also understands the value that our industry brings in the meantime pavel molchanov raymond james analyst ok and then lastly on the same topic are there any outside groups environmental or labor or otherwise that have been lobbying either for or against ab 345 and i m i mean outside of oil and gas groups obviously but anybody outside of that are they involved in the process of shepherding this bill or opposing it todd stevens president and chief executive officer i think the only people that we re aware of that have been for the bill have been environmental groups again you re trying to deindustrialize the country but as opposed to i know that labor has been on our side agricultural groups other business groups community groups i think the vast majority of folks have been on our side and see this as frankly like i said irresponsible and reckless pavel molchanov raymond james analyst ok i ll leave it there thank you guys operator and our next question comes from sean sneeden with guggenheim please go ahead sean sneeden guggenheim partners analyst hi and thanks for taking the questions i guess just mark like to start off can you talk about the borrowing base a little bit is that inclusive of the lost hills transaction or should we expect that actually gets revised at all post closing and can you also just remind us what the remaining basket is at this point on the junior buybacks todd stevens president and chief executive officer sean this is todd what i ll say is as you know we ve been thoughtful as commodity prices have risen and we pulled things out of the borrowing base lost hills was not in the borrowing base so this will be no adjustment to our borrowing base and we ve been thoughtful and done this through the process as we look to monetize things and whether it d be a royalty or producing assets or infrastructure so with that said i ll let mark get into the other question mark smith senior executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah sean so following on to todd s comment that the lost hills assets constituted non borrowing based assets for purposes of the credit agreement we were able to build basket in that basket for repurchases which you described now stands at 305 million sean sneeden guggenheim partners analyst and i guess when we try to think about the kind of remaining non borrowing based assets is there any kind of directional guidance of how we should think about that and i think you ve talked about royalties and some the like in the past but can you help kind of shape our thinking around how to think about potential valuations around that todd stevens president and chief executive officer i mean for us it s been an all of the above approach and like i said earlier we go through the process of looking at the value of our assets and our inventory and what we re going to invest in with our capital or with the jv capital and if we don t see a window for investment in a reasonable time frame we want to accelerate that value we ll look at monetizing different things we are not conducting a fire sale we want to get a value that makes sense for our shareholders so and then we felt like this was a win win here with lost hills we were looking at everything from infrastructure to royalties to as you know we have a comprehensive set of assets that s really a business not just assets from midstream upstream and everything in between so we re continuing to evaluate that and we had been in active negotiation for not just that but also for new joint ventures as i ve outlined before and kind of meaningful joint venture so i think this is something that for you to understand that we re not just targeting one thing we re looking at many things and we re only going to do what makes sense at the end of the day mark smith senior executive vice president and chief financial officer and sean tying in again to what todd said is helping to frame it for you those significant infrastructure assets that todd described are considered non borrowing base assets the way to think about it is infrastructure what s in the borrowing base is oil and gas producing assets so that would exclude the non borrowing based assets the infrastructure assets and it would include select other properties such as lost hills that we see that we may have the potential to potentially do something with or jv etc and we have a as you know we have a very good working relationship with the banks and will keep them right in the front seat with us and will work closely with them in order to maintain the borrowing base on the one hand and preserve flexibility in terms of non borrowing base assets on the other sean sneeden guggenheim partners analyst got it that makes sense and then todd you had mentioned that you kind of think of the lost hills transaction as kind of a hybrid jv and we ve previously talked about the potential for jv this year is that the lost hills transaction or is there still something more to come on that front todd stevens president and chief executive officer no we are still in active negotiations with some larger jvs and also jvs with similar size sean sneeden guggenheim partners analyst got that thank you very much operator and our last question will come from gregg brody with bank of america please go ahead gregg brody bank of america merrill lynch analyst good afternoon guys and congrats on the sell just so you mentioned that our production number associated with lost hills and i wanted to make sure that i that i heard it right did you say 3500 net per day todd stevens president and chief executive officer just before the sale when it was a 100 owned by us in the first quarter it was 4 600 barrels of oil per day gregg brody bank of america merrill lynch analyst yes i thought i misheard so that s 100 so 100 and you ll keep 50 did you will you have any g a reductions as a result of moving it to a non operating position todd stevens president and chief executive officer it would be modest at best some of the field level g a that we re going to have an opportunity for the new operator to purchase but it s the vast majority is coming from opex gregg brody bank of america merrill lynch analyst got you and your when i look i think it s the heavy oil field so it s 100 oil is that right todd stevens president and chief executive officer correct gregg brody bank of america merrill lynch analyst did you i wasn t sure what actually you gave the production guidance and i so i guess it s just it s simple as just adjusting that by 100 by 2 3 dozen barrels a day to figure out kind of what the pro forma oil ngls and natural gas will be going forward todd stevens president and chief executive officer we gave guidance out and then this is basically oil coming off 2 300 barrels a day coming off and as you heard mark and i both say we think we ll be roughly flattish and we just closed on this yesterday gregg brody bank of america merrill lynch analyst and it s flattish on crude oil or total production or both i guess the total production will be both operator and this will conclude our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to todd stevens for any closing remarks todd stevens president and chief executive officer thank you all for participating in today s call and your time and interest on california s political landscape we plan to move forward and replicate the fundamentals of crc s strong first quarter performance throughout 2019 we continue to be guided by disciplined capital allocation aligned with expected cash flows to capture the full value of our high quality low decline and low risk resource base aided by an unrelenting focus on operational excellence our business model is built to perform through the cycle and deliver consistent value to our shareholders we look forward to seeing you on the road thank

can t be just me i go into target and the shelves are not full stocked i see signs in stores looking for employee s when was the last time anybody got a raise above 1 or 2 manufacturing companies are closing factories left and right drug prices keep rising gas prices are at 5 a gallon in some places and people are paying more to the feds s in taxes consumer prices are creeping up because of trump s import tax rises does all the above sound like a roaring economy or is it just president obama s legacy still running but starting to run out of gas the cheerful economic news is largely absent from worker paychecks though average hourly wage growth has been 2 7 percent over the past year anemic given the power and length of the economic expansion making matters worse a surge of inflation driven by higher oil prices has clawed back almost all those wage gains as david leonhardt documents at the new york times these trends didn t begin with trump s election this is what the unemployment rate has looked like since 2012 if you can detect a sharp break between the obama and trump economies you ve got a keener eye than i do looking at job growth yields a similar picture depending on which period you re talking about you can argue that job growth since trump was elected has been a bit slower or a bit faster than in the years preceding him but it s all clearly within the same trend if you take a look at president obama s second term he was adding 217 000 jobs says betsey stevenson an economist at the university of michigan who served as chief economist at the labor department under barack obama and since trump assumed the presidency he s been adding 189 000 jobs per month i d say those are roughly around the same ballpark but i don t think trump should be bragging that he s somehow doing something that president obama wasn t doing the same is true for gdp growth not too long ago progressive economists said strong economic growth couldn t be done anymore that a stagnant u s economy was the new normal tweeted house speaker paul ryan and yet our economy is growing at its fastest rate since 2014 there is something odd about suggesting you ve owned the libs and defied the odds by returning to a growth rate last seen during obama s second term at any rate the bureau of economic analysis offers this chart which again makes a strong case that we re basically seeing an economy similar to that of obama s second term spot the boom it s hard to look at this data and argue that the trump economy represents a sharp break with the obama economy but that argument cuts both directions trump hasn t unleashed an economic miracle but he hasn t caused a crisis either plenty of liberals believed a trump victory would be devastating for the economy tanking stock markets amid fears of trade wars nuclear wars and political chaos that trump has managed to keep growth going might be a less impressive record than he claims but it s a more impressive record than many of his critics expected i ll give the president credit for not steering the economy into a ditch says aaron sojourner a labor economist at the university of minnesota who closely tracks economic trends that s the main accomplishment he inherited a strong economy strong trends after a campaign of telling us the economy was terrible and awful and we had to make america great again and now he s declared victory how republicans stopped worrying and remembered they love deficits to the extent that we ve seen a modest growth bump over the past year the driving reason might be one republicans are loath to admit after years of refusing the obama administration s entreaties to lift sequestration and cut taxes for workers congressional republicans have joined trump to boost government spending by hundreds of billions of dollars and pass 1 5 trillion in unpaid tax cuts there s been in other words a large deficit financed demand side stimulus of the sort republicans condemned when obama asked for it but were all too happy to pass as soon as trump took office more share this facebook x like this like loading

call over to todd todd stevens president and chief executive officer thank you scott and thank you to everyone for attending today s earnings call crc started 2019 with a great first quarter and made significant progress toward strengthening our balance sheet we demonstrated the flexibility of our business model as well as our ability to quickly adjust to market conditions and align our value driven capital program with expected cash flow crc benefits from the differentiated scale and diversity of our world class portfolio which provides exceptional optionality that enhances our operations in california while navigating commodity price volatility as we highlighted on our last earnings call we lowered the number of rigs in late 2018 to respond to this volatility and we reduced our activity as we entered the year and moved through the quarter as always our 2019 plan focuses on living within cash flow enhancing cash margins and maximizing the value of our investments there s been a lot of recent interest in california legislative activity and i want to start out by providing context to our state s energy landscape california has an incredible thirst for petroleum products which underpin our modern lifestyle well beyond gas for our cars and trucks californians consume an immense amount of energy on a stand alone basis we re the fourth largest global consumer of energy to meet this need the state imports 73 of its crude last year californians effectively sent over 32 billion to saudi arabia iraq and kuwait and other places outside the state by importing oil by comparison this is the equivalent of 26 of california s general fund budget last year californians consume every drop of oil produced in the state and we represent a vital industry that provides high paying middle class career path that enables californians to achieve the american dream crc produces under the world s leading environmental safety labor and human rights standard and is inherently aligned with the california s progressive values native production doesn t just benefit our shareholders workforce and consumers the california s state lands commission is one of the largest mineral owners and the oil and gas industry contributes substantially to state and local revenues for example our long beach operations alone have generated over 4 8 billion in the last 15 years for the state los angeles county and the city of long beach legislation that would export jobs diminish much needed public revenue increase reliance on oil imported from countries that don t share our values and environmental standards is both irresponsible and misguided in fact just shipping imported oil to california already burns over 250 million gallons of marine fuel per year replacing native production with imported oil would burn nearly an additional 100 million gallons of marine fuel per year further increasing overall worldwide emissions responsible policymakers in sacramento and across the state recognizes these facts in a critical would of our industry and workforce we expect there is thoughtful leadership to prevail as it has in the past looking ahead crc s greatest competitive advantage rely in our long life low risk high quality resource base operated by our exceptional team one factor that highlights this strength is our r p ratio of nearly 15 supported by low capital intensity low declining assets the majority of our proved reserves nearly three quarters are in the proved developed category which further highlights the low risk predictable and long live nature of our california resource base this provides for a healthy pipeline of development opportunities ahead as well as continued growth in our 3p reserves another factor that highlights our resource base is our significant inventory that meets or exceeds our internal vci metric of 1 3 the strength of this pipeline has also been validated through continued joint venture interest at 65 brent our actionable inventory currently stands above 800 million barrels of oil equivalent and over 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent at 75 brent finally crc s resource advantage was further demonstrated by our attractive organic and finding and development costs which have which has run approximately 750 per barrel over the last three years this low f d cost aids in our value driven full cycle economics and translate to cash margin expansion i m also pleased to say that our valuable resources were validated just yesterday with the reaffirmation of our borrowing base at 2 3 billion we ll continue to strategically leverage crc s resource advantage are made prudent with our capital investment we expect relatively flat production from the second quarter through the end of the year with investments focused primarily on crude oil while there appear to be many factors point to higher prices throughout the year we are prepared for future volatility we remain responsive enhance our hedge book as needed and continue to pursue disciplined capital allocation based on the current strip we believe our 2019 capital program which was based on 60 brent will allow crc to generate substantial free cash flow this amount of free cash flow will ultimately depend upon realized prices for the remainder of the year and it could be significant particularly relative to the size of our planned program we will dedicate this free cash flow in addition to the proceeds from potential transaction activity toward strengthening our balance sheet this will enable crc to achieve our objective of applying 10 to 15 or more of our discretionary cash flow toward that end on the transaction front we have progressed multiple discussions with several counterparties following a pause during the crude oil market downturn during the fourth quarter of 2018 we maintain in all of the above approach to reducing our debt burden we know there are multiple ways to achieve our balance sheet objective and we intend to be strategic as we continue these discussions on that point we closed on the monetization of a producing asset yesterday selling a 50 interest and operatorship of certain shallow zones at our lost hills steamflood field in a transaction with a private e p company for total consideration in excess of 200 million this consisted of 168 million in cash and a minimum carry on our remaining 50 non operated working interest of 35 million this reflects a valuation of 88 000 per flowing barrel including the carry the carry covers 100 of our investment in 200 development wells through 2023 crc will retain all of our deep rights prior to the sale our lost hills oil field produced approximately 4 600 net barrels of oil per day our diverse portfolio of assets is generating interest on many fronts including producing properties minerals and infrastructure transactions we continue to execute against our capital program and pursue jvs as they makes sense to bring value forward for our shareholders we posted solid cash flow during the first quarter and ebitdax was 301 million production was down slightly from the prior quarter due to downtime at one of our gas plants and other factors although occasional downtime is to be expected given crc s large scale operations we re able to consistently maintain a high level of reliability thanks to our team s quick turnaround time to ensure continuity across our operations with this laser focus on operational excellence we also maintain a relatively flat cost structure during the first quarter on the operation side despite higher energy costs during the quarter we also benefited from higher crude oil realizations which were up about 10 year over year including hedges as you know we received attractive brent based pricing as waterborne crude drives the california market california has complex refineries for which crc s crude is ideal international analogous that crc grade crude remain in high demand additionally the same in state refineries produce the spec product of gasoline and low sulfur diesel these factors position crc well for the shift to the international maritime organization sulfur standards next year instead of strong demand for native california crude for the foreseeable future at the same time we are thoughtfully putting hedges in place to underpin our cash flow opportunistically through the cycle details on our first quarter performance and our borrowing base affirmations i will now turn the call over to mark mark smith senior executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks todd crc s asset base performed as expected in the first quarter of the year delivering production within our guidance range while maintaining relatively flat production costs our overall economics in margin performance remains strong underscoring the diversity and optionality of our asset base as well as our operational focus on driving value we registered production of 133 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during the first quarter contributing to quarterly ebitdax of 301 million ebitdax margins of 38 and adjusted net income of 31 million or 0 63 per diluted share after the lost hills transaction we expect relatively flat production through the end of the year under our current capital program as todd highlighted we responded quickly to the steep decline in commodity prices experienced in the fourth quarter of last year we began the first quarter of 2019 by initiating a lower capital program aligning our activity with expected cash flow and a continued focus on efficiency capital in the quarter was largely directed to activity in the san joaquin and los angeles basins we drilled 60 wells centered primarily on our core san joaquin basin properties including elk hills and buena vista fields the los angeles basin saw activity in both the huntington beach area and wilmington field while both sacramento and ventura operations continued to show remarkable resilience by maintaining flat production on a sequential basis with no capital directed toward drilling new development wells relying instead on limited work overs and thorough well surveillance during the quarter we controlled the controllables and delivered consistent cash flow generation from our high margin low decline asset base with opportunistic hedges to underpin our capital program and jv capital to supplement our internally funded capital program we look to extend our proven track record in 2019 capitalizing on healthy brit base differentials and capturing the full value of our world class resources as we ve discussed we have multiple monetization opportunities within our large portfolio of assets to strengthen our financial position as todd noted the lost hills transaction garnered over 200 million of considerations and that s excluding 168 million in cash which we applied to pay down our revolver in addition during the first quarter crc purchased an aggregate 18 million face value of our second lien notes in the open market for a price 14 million demonstrating our commitment to balance sheet strengthening through debt repurchases in the quarter and debt reduction from the proceeds of the lost hills transaction we ve made good progress in lowering our total debt to 5 1 billion i m pleased to advise that our bank group reaffirmed our borrowing base at 2 3 billion effective yesterday which we consider another point of external validation of our commitment to balance sheet strengthening now turning to the details of our financial performance for the first quarter of 2019 we produced an average of 133 000 boe per day during the first quarter that s up 8 over the prior year period our performance included oil production averaging 84 000 barrels per day which was up 9 over the prior year period first quarter 2019 results included negative psc effects the gas plant downtime that todd mentioned earlier as well as power outages we continue to benefit from premium brent based pricing and realizations in the first quarter of 2019 oil differentials were robust registering 99 of brent before the effective of hedges our hedge program which underpins our capital program by sporting cash flow in the face of bulk of commodity prices enhanced our realized pricing by a 1 98 per barrel for an average realized price of 65 28 per barrel ngl realizations were stronger than expected and came in at 67 of brent continuing to reflect compelling local markets natural gas realizations were at 106 of nymex to the seasonality trends magnified by limited third party storage within california production cost for the first quarter of 2019 were 233 million or 19 46 per boe within our stated guidance range despite higher energy prices our focus on our controllable cost kept per barrel cost relatively flat versus the prior year period excluding psc effects our first quarter production costs would have been 8 01 per boe general and administrative costs were 6 93 per boe in line with our guidance range the majority of the increase over the previous quarter corresponded to a 51 increase in crc stock price during the first quarter which drove higher cash settled equity based incentive compensation costs at all levels of the organization as we ve previously discussed changes in our stock price introduced volatility in our income statement because a portion of our stock based rewards are cash settled and our mark to market every quarter taxes other than on income which are largely comprised of ad valorem taxes based on the value of the resource of the ground are paid and paid to the counties plus our ghg cost came in as expected for the first quarter of 2019 we reported a net loss of 67 million attributable to our common stock or 1 38 per diluted share adjusting for unusual and infrequent items and other non cash items such as non cash derivative gains and losses that are generally excluded from core earnings by investment analysts our net income would have been 31 million or 0 63 per diluted share adjusted ebitdax for the first quarter of 2019 was 301 million up 20 from the same quarter last year reflecting a stable adjusted ebitdax margin of 38 crc reported cash flow from operating activities of 158 million in the first quarter of 2019 cash flow was affected by a negative working capital change as fourth quarter 2018 levels rolled off as we moved through the first part of the year in the first quarter we generated approximately 190 million in discretionary cash flow comparing favorably to our internally funded capital investments of 104 million this level of free cash flow generation demonstrates the flexibility of our business model responsiveness to commodity prices during the fourth quarter of 2018 and our move to prudently adjusted capital program in the first quarter of 2019 we reduced our rig count from 10 rigs at the end of the fourth quarter down to six rigs by the end of the first quarter of 2019 including rigs focused on jv drilling this quick action lowered our internally funded capital by 40 and our total capital program by 30 from fourth quarter 2018 level a high level of operational control of our broad portfolio allows us to pivot during volatile periods and rapidly adjust plans to recalibrate our activity with expected cash flows we have a proven track record of focusing on value and we ll continue to respond and adapt accordingly just to see it in a wide range of environments our philosophy regarding hedging continues to target up to 50 of our oil production generally over 12 month to 18 month periods in order to provide more certainty in cash flows and support our capital program we recently added 5 000 barrels per day of swaps and 10 000 barrels per day of put spreads covering the first half of 2020 bringing the total hedge volume to 25 000 barrels and 15 000 barrels for the first and second quarters of 2020 respectively please refer to our earnings release for the details on our hedge positions as we look ahead we will continue to play to our strengths developing our extensive inventory of actionable projects working to capture the full value of our high quality long life and low risk assets we take pride in our flexible business model which is designed to facilitate dynamic capital allocation and deliver value utilizing our vci metrics across a varying range of price scenarios additionally we benefit from both our integrated infrastructure designed for scale as well as a relentless drive for operational excellence we ll continue to identify more ways we can add value for crc shareholders please note that we provide a detailed analysis of adjusted items as well as key second quarter 2019 guidance information in the attachments to our earnings release i ll be happy to take any questions you may have on that information and on other aspects of our results during the q a portion of the call i ll now turn it back over to todd todd stevens president and chief executive officer thanks mark crc continued to deliver solid results in the first quarter of 2019 with a disciplined capital program a diverse low decline asset base with healthy brent based realizations and our focus on margins that centers on controlling our controllable crc is able to register predictable and consistent results quarter after quarter demonstrating our optionality and importantly meaningful cash flow generation in addition we remain keenly focused on simplifying our balance sheet lowering the overall level of debt while utilizing joint ventures to derisk and unlock the full potential of crc s resilient asset base we are now happy to take your questions questions answers operator and our first question today comes from kalei akamine from bank of america please go ahead kalei akamine bank of america merrill lynch analyst good afternoon thanks for taking my question here todd in your opening remarks you started off by addressing the california legislation ab 345 and i m not going to ask you to handicap the odds of this passing but i will ask you to talk about where the bill is in the latest legislative process and any important dates that we should be a paying attention to over the course of this quarter todd stevens president and chief executive officer yeah kalei obviously i think topical in many ways but it s really early in legislative process prematurely to speculate on this bill or other bills but you got to remember we have a proven track record of crc of constructive outreach and policy issues that affect our state and our communities and we ve done this for years so this is not anything new but when you think about where it is like i said it s fairly new it s passed out of an assembly committee i don t think anyone thought there was no chance it there was a chance it wasn t going to pass over the assembly committee it would have to pass out of that now out of the appropriations committee where it sits and take into account the environmental employee and other economic impacts and i addressed some of that earlier when we talked about it and if it passed out of that it would have to then go to the assembly and then it will continue this process into the state senate and if we assign to a senate committee and then it go and as we pass out of that and go into the appropriation side of the senate and then it would have to go to the full senate and then if this goes then it would end up in the governor s desk in this timeframe to give you an idea the legislative session for would end sometime in september or october with these bills could end up on the governor s desk but i think the fact that the way the bill sits in its current form are essentially the odds are really close to zero if not zero be ending up in some substantially its current form by the time if it somehow made it through all this to that kalei akamine bank of america merrill lynch analyst i appreciate you answering that my second question just on lost hills just want to understand a little bit better it looks like a pretty fairly priced deal that could improve in your favor as the asset grows wondering if you can share a little bit about the rationale why this asset why now and your broader philosophy about monetizing upstream cash flows todd stevens president and chief executive officer yes as you know we everything is done around our vci metric and we rank order our inventory on our vci metric and we look for things that compete for crc capital while we live within cash flow then we look at things that could be potentially jv or in effect if we didn t think it could be jv is there a way to monetize it that makes sense and i think what we did here is effectively create a hybrid jv while monetizing 50 of our interest in transferring operatorship and control the asset while having a carry on our remaining interest because we don t think it ll probably would repeat for our internal capital going forward and so but we like the asset and we think that the new operator has an opportunity now to improve on the economics and invest that company s capital in the asset so i think this is the potential win win with kind of this hybrid jv monetization that we did here and really we re pleased with the upfront monetization we re pleased with the opportunity to grow the value and hopefully get it to compete for capital in the future and also you got to remember here we retain the deep rights and as you know california is fairly prolific with over 400 different producing horizons and this is pretty this is really the shallow steamflood is what we re talking about that was monetized here at lost hills kalei akamine bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks guys operator and our next question comes from silvio micheloto with mizuho please go ahead with your question paul sankey mizuho analyst hi guys this is paul sankey with silvio alongside me one just quick question is a follow up on the california stuff is what i don t know if this is my question or not but why did the stock so heavily hit on this when as you said it wasn t really a surprise and probably won t go anywhere todd stevens president and chief executive officer i think there is this heightened awareness given we ve had this type of activity in california for many many years and we paul sankey mizuho analyst yes because silvio and i cover refining in california as well for many many years and we ve sort of been through this movie before todd stevens president and chief executive officer to give you an idea you see this like in california you have a severance tax proposed this year i think in the last 30 years there s probably hasn t been a year that wasn t one proposed including a ballot measure but they ve never come to fruition again i think you get through the kind of misguided and irresponsible legislation and it has to work its way through all the gateways of the system and i think the heightened awareness of the activism that has gone on for here in california for years it s has gone to colorado and elsewhere so i think that when there was somebody i can t remember the name of it they published the awareness of ab 345 and it just spooked everyone and i think they sold first and asked questions later and we had that terrible down day last week but i think fundamentals haven t changed at all we ve dealt with these type of like i said misguided legislation in the past and frankly very reckless when you think about the california economy so again it s ordinary across of business is that things will work through and we think i mean thoughtful people in sacramento will eventually come to bear and understand what this mean paul sankey mizuho analyst understood so that if i could ask you a question which i think you will be probably lot happier talking about but i was intrigued that you highlighting your degree of flexibility and you talked about how you ve been able to change the number of rigs as rapidly as you through what s been the extraordinary volatility really over the last what is it now eight months in oil i was just wondering can you dig a bit deeper on the ability to change it seems i don t now understand quite heck contractually you could you could drill rigs as quick as you can or pick them up again for example any other observations you have about that thank you scott espenshade senior vice president investor relations and land yes paul good question i think it highlights really our asset base but also the supply chain market for services here in california i think when you look at our asset base we really have the assets of a super major buried and independent so we have effectively operating control over almost every one of our assets now we ve lost sales obviously we ceded operatorship so the ability to quickly shift activity we have that within our grasp we re not in anyone else s behalf the supply chain when you think about the type of rigs and the type of services that are in california most of that iron doesn t really leave the state it s really the deep iron will leave the state the deep more complex rigs but the shallower rigs the medium rigs they typically stay in the state so you re able to being the largest operator in most active driller both drilling rigs and workover rigs in the state we were able to price in this flexibility and enable us to have this kind of optionality because we we ve had to manage through this downturn since inception so it s been important for us to be able to manage our activity and manage our cash flow appropriately operator and our next question comes from pavel molchanov with raymond james please go ahead pavel molchanov raymond james analyst thanks for taking the question apologies but i m going to ask another one about ab 345 to your knowledge is there any anybody from the governor s office that is encouraging or pushing this effort in the legislature todd stevens president and chief executive officer not to my knowledge and i think that if you were to ask the long line of people not just our industry but business agriculture everyone else up in sacramento and the all kind of responsible citizens that are up against this i think it will be hard to find someone that s pushing behind the scenes with the exception of probably some irrational activists who want to send us back to a pre industrial age pavel molchanov raymond james analyst ok and there are some reporting in the media that governor knew some plans to issue his own kind of oil and gas policy in the near future any sense of what the process will be for that and any indications on what he may say todd stevens president and chief executive officer we have no indication and know what it s a i think it d be speculative and premature me to say anything that i think just so you know he s been around sacramento and understands what drives the state what drives the state economy and i know the thoughtful heads will prevail here at the end of the day but he is also driven to try and drive to a more balanced approach and in driving more renewables into the system which we ve done in the state effectively but i think also understands the value that our industry brings in the meantime pavel molchanov raymond james analyst ok and then lastly on the same topic are there any outside groups environmental or labor or otherwise that have been lobbying either for or against ab 345 and i m i mean outside of oil and gas groups obviously but anybody outside of that are they involved in the process of shepherding this bill or opposing it todd stevens president and chief executive officer i think the only people that we re aware of that have been for the bill have been environmental groups again you re trying to deindustrialize the country but as opposed to i know that labor has been on our side agricultural groups other business groups community groups i think the vast majority of folks have been on our side and see this as frankly like i said irresponsible and reckless pavel molchanov raymond james analyst ok i ll leave it there thank you guys operator and our next question comes from sean sneeden with guggenheim please go ahead sean sneeden guggenheim partners analyst hi and thanks for taking the questions i guess just mark like to start off can you talk about the borrowing base a little bit is that inclusive of the lost hills transaction or should we expect that actually gets revised at all post closing and can you also just remind us what the remaining basket is at this point on the junior buybacks todd stevens president and chief executive officer sean this is todd what i ll say is as you know we ve been thoughtful as commodity prices have risen and we pulled things out of the borrowing base lost hills was not in the borrowing base so this will be no adjustment to our borrowing base and we ve been thoughtful and done this through the process as we look to monetize things and whether it d be a royalty or producing assets or infrastructure so with that said i ll let mark get into the other question mark smith senior executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah sean so following on to todd s comment that the lost hills assets constituted non borrowing based assets for purposes of the credit agreement we were able to build basket in that basket for repurchases which you described now stands at 305 million sean sneeden guggenheim partners analyst and i guess when we try to think about the kind of remaining non borrowing based assets is there any kind of directional guidance of how we should think about that and i think you ve talked about royalties and some the like in the past but can you help kind of shape our thinking around how to think about potential valuations around that todd stevens president and chief executive officer i mean for us it s been an all of the above approach and like i said earlier we go through the process of looking at the value of our assets and our inventory and what we re going to invest in with our capital or with the jv capital and if we don t see a window for investment in a reasonable time frame we want to accelerate that value we ll look at monetizing different things we are not conducting a fire sale we want to get a value that makes sense for our shareholders so and then we felt like this was a win win here with lost hills we were looking at everything from infrastructure to royalties to as you know we have a comprehensive set of assets that s really a business not just assets from midstream upstream and everything in between so we re continuing to evaluate that and we had been in active negotiation for not just that but also for new joint ventures as i ve outlined before and kind of meaningful joint venture so i think this is something that for you to understand that we re not just targeting one thing we re looking at many things and we re only going to do what makes sense at the end of the day mark smith senior executive vice president and chief financial officer and sean tying in again to what todd said is helping to frame it for you those significant infrastructure assets that todd described are considered non borrowing base assets the way to think about it is infrastructure what s in the borrowing base is oil and gas producing assets so that would exclude the non borrowing based assets the infrastructure assets and it would include select other properties such as lost hills that we see that we may have the potential to potentially do something with or jv etc and we have a as you know we have a very good working relationship with the banks and will keep them right in the front seat with us and will work closely with them in order to maintain the borrowing base on the one hand and preserve flexibility in terms of non borrowing base assets on the other sean sneeden guggenheim partners analyst got it that makes sense and then todd you had mentioned that you kind of think of the lost hills transaction as kind of a hybrid jv and we ve previously talked about the potential for jv this year is that the lost hills transaction or is there still something more to come on that front todd stevens president and chief executive officer no we are still in active negotiations with some larger jvs and also jvs with similar size sean sneeden guggenheim partners analyst got that thank you very much operator and our last question will come from gregg brody with bank of america please go ahead gregg brody bank of america merrill lynch analyst good afternoon guys and congrats on the sell just so you mentioned that our production number associated with lost hills and i wanted to make sure that i that i heard it right did you say 3500 net per day todd stevens president and chief executive officer just before the sale when it was a 100 owned by us in the first quarter it was 4 600 barrels of oil per day gregg brody bank of america merrill lynch analyst yes i thought i misheard so that s 100 so 100 and you ll keep 50 did you will you have any g a reductions as a result of moving it to a non operating position todd stevens president and chief executive officer it would be modest at best some of the field level g a that we re going to have an opportunity for the new operator to purchase but it s the vast majority is coming from opex gregg brody bank of america merrill lynch analyst got you and your when i look i think it s the heavy oil field so it s 100 oil is that right todd stevens president and chief executive officer correct gregg brody bank of america merrill lynch analyst did you i wasn t sure what actually you gave the production guidance and i so i guess it s just it s simple as just adjusting that by 100 by 2 3 dozen barrels a day to figure out kind of what the pro forma oil ngls and natural gas will be going forward todd stevens president and chief executive officer we gave guidance out and then this is basically oil coming off 2 300 barrels a day coming off and as you heard mark and i both say we think we ll be roughly flattish and we just closed on this yesterday gregg brody bank of america merrill lynch analyst and it s flattish on crude oil or total production or both i guess the total production will be both operator and this will conclude our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to todd stevens for any closing remarks todd stevens president and chief executive officer thank you all for participating in today s call and your time and interest on california s political landscape we plan to move forward and replicate the fundamentals of crc s strong first quarter performance throughout 2019 we continue to be guided by disciplined capital allocation aligned with expected cash flows to capture the full value of our high quality low decline and low risk resource base aided by an unrelenting focus on operational excellence our business model is built to perform through the cycle and deliver consistent value to our shareholders we look forward to seeing you on the road thank

washington never seems to run out of big spending promises and when house speaker nancy pelosi d calif and senate minority leader chuck schumer d n y huddled with president trump on tuesday they came up with a doozy schumer emerged from the meeting to announce that the president wants congress to come up with a bill that would spend 2 trillion on infrastructure including roads bridges water systems and broadband now 2 trillion is a lot of loot it s almost twice as much money as is currently in circulation in the u s it s also somewhere between two and 10 times as much as the administration talked about spending last year doug schoen trump pelosi and schumer show bipartisanship possible on 2 trillion infrastructure plan in 2018 the administration proposed putting up 200 billion in federal matching funds to generate 1 trillion in new investments previous proposals from democrats such as 2017 s 2 trillion 21st century new deal for jobs have relied exclusively on increasing federal spending it seems that this week s s talks never got around to figuring out where to get the money to make good on this latest promise but one thing we do know for sure is that the feds already spend too much on infrastructure projects that are not proper national priorities state highways metro transit systems and local initiatives should be paid for by the people who use them and the taxpayers of the state and local jurisdictions who benefit from them the federal government has a long history of blowing federal taxpayer dollars on projects that should be funded either by state or local governments the private sector or in some cases not funded at all from alaska s infamous bridge to nowhere to california s disastrous high speed rail project to protecting ritzy golf courses in new york politicians from both parties have shown a willingness to waste billions of dollars in the name of investments consider the federal gasoline tax it s supposed to be a user fee paid by motorists to go toward interstate highway maintenance and repair yet 28 cents of every dollar of gas taxes collected are diverted to other purposes heavily subsidized urban transit systems bike paths even ferry boat terminals while some of these may be worthy projects they have no national significance and should not be funded by washington by focusing on further regulatory reforms that reduce the federal government s wasteful interference america can have better infrastructure while avoiding higher taxes and a bigger debt a better alternative would be to reduce the federal gas tax and devolve much of the feds current infrastructure activity to the private sector and to state and local governments they are much closer to the people than washington bureaucrats and therefore more knowledgeable about and responsive to local infrastructure needs even when the federal government does spend money on a worthwhile project it often causes significant delays and cost increases due to red tape that is inevitably entangled with federal funding the process of applying for federal grants and the necessary oversight by federal agencies that comes along with federal dollars always means that projects take longer to complete rules that artificially increase labor costs such as the davis bacon act and make inputs more expensive such as buy american rules mean that federally funded projects give taxpayers less bang for their buck private infrastructure projects similarly suffer from onerous and unnecessary regulation that is why an infrastructure package focusing on reducing regulation and streamlining the environmental review process rather than just shoveling cash at states and localities could deliver hundreds of billions of dollars in added value one other key consideration there is no good way to cover the cost of a federally financed 2 trillion infrastructure package tax increases would reduce the flow of economic investment that is now driving the american economy to new highs a dangerous temptation for elected officials would be to avoid paying for the cost of new infrastructure spending altogether this would be reckless click here to get the fox news app with the federal debt in excess of 22 trillion and a strong economy now is the time to rein in the debt rather than add to it putting the cost of infrastructure on the national credit card would mean passing the bill to our children and grandchildren that would be profoundly unfair president trump s greatest policy successes have been in deregulation and the implementation of a pro growth tax policy by focusing on further regulatory reforms that reduce the federal government s wasteful interference america can have better infrastructure while avoiding higher taxes and a bigger debt

representatives available to help answer any questions you may have after steve and darryl provide updates on slide 4 we present our quarterly financial results idacorp s 2019 first quarter earnings per diluted share were 0 84 an increase of 0 12 per share over last year s first quarter today we also affirm our full year 2019 earnings guidance estimate in the range of 4 30 and 4 45 per diluted share i will now turn the call over to steve steve keen senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thanks justin and welcome everyone customer growth has accelerated in idaho power service area with an annual growth rate of 2 4 over the last 12 months this growth along with colder winter weather and higher transmission wheeling related revenues combined to open 2019 with a strong first quarter for idacorp turning to slide 5 a reconciliation of the changes from the first quarter of 2018 to the first quarter this year begin with customer growth which added 4 1 million to operating income in the quarter overall usage per customer increased operating income by an additional 1 9 million however this higher per customer usage was largely related to residential customers as a result of colder temperatures than last year s first quarter you ll also note an offsetting decrease of 2 3 million in fixed costs adjustment revenues further down the table overall heating degree days during the first three months of 2019 were relatively close to normal though higher than last year the comparatively colder weather also increased the proportion of residential sales in higher rate categories under idaho power s tiered rate structure and was the primary reason for the 3 7 million increase in retail revenues per megawatt hour that is next on the reconciliation table these revenue items net to a 7 4 million benefit to operating income idaho power also benefited from a 4 million increase from higher transmission wheeling related revenues this is the fourth quarter in a row that we have seen higher wheeling revenues related to regional wholesale market activity as you may have heard on other earnings calls the enbridge pipeline situation and the resulting efforts to increase maintenance on pipeline infrastructure have impacted market dynamics in a way that we believe contributed to a portion of these higher transmission related revenues predicting the duration of that pipeline response is difficult but we expect some moderation to occur going forward however we believe at least some of the regional transmission market conditions maybe ongoing due to more general market dynamics the increase in volume for the quarter was slightly offset by a 10 decrease in open access transmission tariff rate that became effective last october wheeling rates reset annually to align with actual costs and revenue impact other operating and maintenance expenses were 2 7 million higher in the first quarter o m related to thermal generation increased 1 5 million due primarily to increased generation at the north valmy coal fired plant for which a corresponding amount was recorded as revenues the remaining increase was primarily due to various inflationary impacts for our full year we still expect o m expenses to fall in the range of 350 million to 360 million the results of all of these items led to an increase in operating income of 7 6 million over the last year s first quarter earnings of equity method investments that largely consist of earnings from bridger coal company returned to a more normal level compared with the prior year s first quarter which was driven by abnormally high coal prices in that period this change resulted in 1 9 million decrease in this line item for the quarter for the full year our expectations remain in line with prior years a higher pre tax income led to slightly higher income tax during the first quarter in addition during the first quarter of 2018 we recorded 0 5 million of additional accumulated deferred investment tax credits or aditc in anticipation of needing some amount of additional credits to support full year 2018 earnings that accrual was reversed in the second quarter last year this year we did not record any additional aditc as we no longer anticipate needing to utilize any additional credits under our idaho regulatory stipulation overall idaho power s and idacorp s net income were 5 7 million and 6 6 million higher than the first quarter of last year respectively idacorp and idaho power continue to maintain strong balance sheets including investment grade credit ratings with sound liquidity enabling us to fund ongoing capital expenditures and dividend payments as a reminder we expect to recommend to the board of directors future annual dividend increases of 5 or more to be near the upper end of the target payout range of between 50 and 60 of sustainable idacorp earnings over the past several years the board has approved increases in the dividend in september for a total increase of 110 in the annualized dividend since 2011 on slide 6 we show idacorp s operating cash flows along with our liquidity position as of the end of march 2019 cash flow from operations was approximately 35 million lower than the first three months of 2018 mostly related to the timing of working capital receipts and payments the liquidity available under idacorp s and idaho power s credit facility is shown on the bottom of slide 6 at this time we do not anticipate issuing additional equity in 2019 other than relatively nominal amounts under compensation plans slide 7 shows our firm s full year 2019 earnings guidance and our updated key financial and operating metrics estimates we continue to expect idacorp s 2019 earnings to be in the range of 4 30 to 4 45 per diluted share our strong first quarter results allow us to expect no use of additional aditc under our idaho regulatory stipulation in 2019 again preserving the full 45 million for future years as mentioned earlier we have no change to our expected o m range we also affirm our expectation that capital expenditures will be between 280 million and 290 million strong winter snowpack and current reservoir storage conditions combined with the current forecast suggest that hydroelectric generation should now be in the range of 7 million to 9 million megawatt hours as always our guidance assumptions reflect normal weather conditions going forward looking forward to the remainder of the year i want to remind you that we have several recent second quarters where nonrecurring items impacted the result while we don t provide quarterly guidance keep in mind that we are not currently expecting any such nonrecurring items to hit this year s second quarter with that i ll turn the presentation over to darrel darrel anderson president and chief executive officer thanks steve and thanks again for everyone joining us on today s call as steve noted the first quarter was a very successful quarter for idacorp and idaho power this is the best first quarter financial performance in the history of idaho power company and i believe is primarily attributable to the operations of the core business in addition during the quarter we introduced our 100 clean energy goal that highlights the path we have been traveling for many years to provide safe reliable clean energy to our customers at a fair price while focusing on generating long term competitive returns for our shareholders i will talk more about that a little later on slide 9 and as steve noted you ll see that customer growth remains robust and is up 2 4 over the past 12 months this is the highest number we have seen since before the great recession up from 2 3 last quarter as new residential and business customers continue to move to our service area and existing customers expand our company benefits from increased energy sales and further business development opportunities at the same time we believe and research from the milken institute and others supports that the reliable affordable clean energy idaho power provides is one of the key contributors for continued economic growth in our region several notable large load projects came online this quarter in idaho power service area these include simplot grower solutions a new fertilizer plant in eastern idaho capitol distributing s new distribution center at the sky ranch industrial park in southwestern idaho and premier technology s new welding and fabrication center also in the eastern part of our service area we expect additional projects to begin taking service throughout the year and we continue to receive new large load requests while construction activities of both large and small projects continuing to move forward moody s latest forecast of gross domestic product in idaho power service area predicts growth at 3 8 in 2019 and 3 4 in 2020 showing that a positive growth trend continues in the near term employment within our region also remains on an upward trend compared to this time last year employment within idaho power service area has grown 2 8 now 532 000 people employed another new record unemployment in idaho power service area into the first quarter was 2 7 compared to 3 8 nationally turning to slide 10 just last month we reached a pair of important and related milestones on hells canyon complex relicensing the state of idaho and oregon finalized the settlement that we helped negotiate related to reintroduction of steelhead and spring chinook salmon into the snake river above hells canyon as part of the settlement our company committed to spend an additional 20 million over the term of the license for hatchery expansion research water quality and habitat improvement the state also approved our broader proposal to achieve our water quality obligations under section 401 of the federal clean water act these agreements should remove significant obstacles toward achieving a new long term federal license for our three hydroelectric dams in hells canyon several governmental approvals are still required so we still do not expect to receive a new federal license from the federal energy regulatory commission or fer until 2022 however this is very positive step forward once the license is issued by the fer the company will begin operating under new compliance requirements those requirements are expected to increase both o m expenses and capital expenditures given the uncertainty regarding the timing of the new license these expected increases in capital costs have not been included in our most recent capital expenditure projections as estimates are updated to reflect new compliance requirements we expect to begin showing the increased level of the capital expenditures in our projections as noted on slide 11 idaho power made an important announcement in march setting a goal to provide 100 clean energy by 2045 our clean today cleaner tomorrow message has been met with positive feedback from our customers from regional national and even international media and from peers across the energy industry in considering and launching this goal the company believed it was an effective way to highlight idaho power s long standing position as a leader in clean energy as we look forward we believe advances in technology could allow idaho power to continue integrating additional clean sources into its energy mix as we move along our path away from coal fired generation and further down the road other carbon emitting resources we expect the 2019 integrated resource plan set to be filed in june to provide further clarity on economical end of life scenarios for the jim bridger power plant we have agreements in place already for ceasing operations at the other two jointly owned coal fired plants and regulatory orders for most aspects of the closures joining the western energy imbalance market and constructing the boardman to hemingway and gateway west transmission line projects will also help us move clean energy throughout the northwest and make progress toward our clean energy goal this 100 clean energy goal will not come at the expense of reliability or affordability for customers as we will look for prudent ways for shareholders to benefit i stated in february that we did not plan to file a general rate case in idaho or oregon in the next 12 months that remains true today as we look at the upcoming 12 months very low growth combined with increases in our customer base constructive regulatory outcomes and effective management of operating expenses all play significant roles as we look at the need and timing of our next general rate case i will close with a look at weather on slide 12 current projections from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration suggests a 40 to 50 chance of above normal precipitation level and a 50 to 60 chance of above normal temperatures for much of the summer thanks to our cool wet spring heavy snowfall and carryover water for back to back strong water years our snowpack and reservoir levels should provide favorable conditions for hydro generation agricultural needs as well as recreational activities as a reminder our power cost adjustment mechanisms in idaho and oregon significantly reduce earnings volatility related to changes in our resource mix and associated power supply costs with that steve and i and others on the call look forward to answering questions you may have questions answers operator the first question comes from julien dumoulin smith of bank of america merrill lynch alex morgan bank of america merrill lynch analyst good afternoon this is alex morgan calling in for julien i was wondering if there s anything that you can provide to help gauge generally what costs of relicensing might look like darrel anderson president and chief executive officer alex this is darrel one of the things that we will be looking to do is begin enhancing that disclosure in the near term as some things solidify around the relicensing side of things i think one of the things you probably already know and we talk about it in the 10 q is that we have over 300 million to date that we have spent so far that we re receiving some recovery on some of those expenses now a modest amount but we would be looking to seek recovery of those expenses as well as then the additional mitigation and compliance costs post license so we ll talk about those when we refresh our estimates for those with you but they re pretty significant over the life again if anything you have to think about it over the life which is about another 50 about what we re hoping to get is a 50 year license so you think of you have to look at those costs in the context of 50 years steve keen senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer alex this is steve i d just say i do believe that s a great question because i think as we ve talked through these long life projects as we get closer to the end then we have positive milestone that s what brings that additional capital spend closer into the picture and we had a great step this year with improved with the water quality and more to come on that so i would say stay tuned but it is a significant number that we haven t talked about a lot because we ve been focused on the relicensing itself of getting to the license but once we get the license then we will do a lot of things that really will help the river and further many of those capital projects that we ll be glad to talk about here in the near future darrel anderson president and chief executive officer alex the other thing i ll just add if you look in our the capital requirements of our 10 q and you look at the estimates that we have in there today those do not include any of those costs just as a reminder so where we show the range is out to 2023 those do not include any estimates for relicensing or for that matter also does not include any of the construction costs related to our boardman to hemingway transmission line where we also continue to see ongoing successes in attaining milestones and just as it relates boardman to hemingway you didn t ask about that but we do expect a decision or some information coming out of oregon this year which we think that we know today should be positive and so that s another piece of information to kind of focus on as you look forward as to what our capital costs will be looking at going forward alex morgan bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok thank you so much and i know you mentioned just one more quick follow up i know that you ve mentioned we might see some capex updates in sometime the rest of this year but i was wondering if there s going to be any potential eps trajectory updates considering the hells canyon relicensing the valmy plant agreement potential resolution around bridger plant and then also the transmission projects darrel anderson president and chief executive officer well we re certainly be looking at updates on our current year eps and if you think you re talking about guidance on further on out and that is something we ve discussed i think we need to do a little more just seeing what is what the potential might be to show there but i do believe there s a trajectory you guys have heard us talk about our plan that we ve we feel very fortunate to have the growth that we have you look at our growth in revenues this year we actually lowered rates from last year to this year and revenues went up significantly that s a great thing but we ve always said there s a plan after this as well and we look every year at the plan that would be filing based on growing rate base and we look at the plan of how much growth is going to come and how will that deliver us and this has been the best story currently but we ve always had our eye on that future and i think i don t know how growth that is setting records can lead us anywhere except to growing company as well and we re fortunate that we ve had some excess capacity we ve been taking advantage of right now but the long term picture for that should look a lot like others that you see that have significant capex out there so more to come and i do think we ve heard your request and i think helping you guys with that trajectory is something we re going to work on this year operator the next question comes from chris ellinghaus of williams capital chris ellinghaus williams capital group analyst if i recall correctly last year we sort of had good conditions as well for irrigation and it looks like just looking at your noaa slide that the conditions might be developing to have similar good irrigation season is that sort of what your thought processes is at this point darrel anderson president and chief executive officer chris this is darrel i think we re geared up for a good irrigation season we have i think good resources available and i think the good news is the ag community also was i think projecting a good water situation so the emphasis around more water intensive crops wasn t going to be necessary an issue like it may have been in past years so i think all those things we believe stacks up to be positive but we don t know until all the crops are in the field and they get on with it they do and they re in the middle of planting now so that s the good news and we ve got a steady again we our meteorologists tell me i can t look out more than 7 to 10 days so i don t try to do that but when i look at the next 7 to 10 days weather conditions are very conducive for the ag guys to get in the field and get on to what they re doing so it s dry and it s mid 70s to 80s so it s a really good weather so i can give you that 7 to 10 days sort of look chris ellinghaus williams capital group analyst ok how would you characterize reservoir levels you talked a little bit about snowpack but what do the reservoirs look like darrel anderson president and chief executive officer so we re going we will ask chris we have tess park who heads up our power supplier we re going to ask her to kind of comment on the reservoir side tess park vice president power supply chris this is tess on the reservoir levels the upper snake reservoirs are nearly full they re still doing their flood control but expected to refill and we re in the process of flood control the brownie reservoir will be released from flood control the end of april and start our refill trajectory but we are expected to refill chris ellinghaus williams capital group analyst one last thing i guess this dovetails into what you re saying about capex but would it be fair to say that with the new kind of we re saying clean energy plan and whatever you re going to say about bridger and irp the boardman to hemingway transmission line that was your resource plan before if bridger s retired does the boardman to hemingway line fully provide you with replacement resource darrel anderson president and chief executive officer chris this is darrel i m going to answer a little bit then we ve got mitch colburn who s here with us today who is actually help managing our irp process i think it s good for you to hear from him but i ll just tell you obviously it s a fluid process as we look at the irp right now we re right in the middle of it like we ve said we ll likely publish that in june and so we ve been looking at series of scenarios around with the bridger facilities going away different timing on what the bridger facilities winding down and so i think that boardman to hemingway continues to be an integral part of our resource opportunities i m going to let mitch kind of talk to you a little bit about it because he s the guy on the ground who is working with that so i think it would be good to hear from mitch mitch colburn manager transmission and distribution strategic projects hi chris this is mitch so given your irp as darrel mentioned boardman to hemingway is a critical element of our future and obviously a critical element of our clean energy plans as we see it we have signed a contract for solar additions in early 2020s preliminary analysis shows additional resource additions you know what we re seeing today potentially natural gas more solar there s some battery storage in our preliminary 20 year look but i d say in general as we look at potential early exits of bridger units it will drive additional resource additions steve keen senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer and chris this is steve i might just mention that while the what we have when we made the clean announcement was reference to a ppa that asset in particular is one that we ll be looking at hard to see if it is better structured as an asset we own or as a ppa and those are things that we look at as well so i do believe what you re looking at is is it possible that there s other changes to your portfolio beside boardman to hemingway and i think the answer to that is yes and relative is going to be dealing with the dynamic change that s ongoing and we don t know what technology might bring or what growth might bring so i think it ll be exciting time for us darrel anderson president and chief executive officer chris as you can imagine you take off a baseload resource you can t necessarily just replace that with intermittent resources so the combination of some type of storage devices in some form we believe is going to also be integral to the future success of this clean energy plans so one of the things we will continue to watch there is that technology evolution you ve seen some of that some of those projects in the northwest already that where folks have entered into those those types of storage and intermittent resource combinations those will be things that again in this window that we look at will absolutely be evaluated chris ellinghaus williams capital group analyst and you had this string of strong growth in your transmission system usage is there are you seeing any reason for additional transmission investment from what you ve been seeing in recent behavioral changes darrel anderson president and chief executive officer chris i think it s possible i think that s one of the things as we with boardman to hemingway we all targeted kind of pieces that we might take initially but we ll be looking very closely at that to see if the piece we originally bought is the right size or if it may make more sense because it does feel like there s some market dynamics adjustment going on and we kind of fit between a lot of things and maybe we should be taking advantage of that steve keen senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer chris the other piece of that is and we talked a little bit about it in the q is that our gateway project we ve got a couple of segments there that have permit and sighted and for us it s a matter of looking at when the needs for those are to enhance capacity across our system and so those are costs that we would look at and those costs are not in these costs that you re looking at either as it relates to the out years from a capex perspective so these are all we have given you a baseline capex but all the most of things we ve been talking about today are things that that would be added to that capex plan operator that concludes the question and answer session for today mr anderson i will turn the conference back to you darrel anderson president and chief executive officer thank you daniel thank you again for all of you who

turn the call over to cindi buckwalter head of investor relations for minerals technologies please go ahead ms buckwalter cindi buckwalter head of investor relations thank you savannah good morning everyone and welcome to our first quarter 2019 earnings conference call today s call will be led by chief executive officer doug dietrich and chief financial officer matt garth following doug and matt s prepared remarks we will open it up for questions i would like to remind you that beginning on page 14 of our 2018 10 k we list the various risk factors and conditions that may affect our future results and i ll also point out the safe harbor disclaimer on the slide statements related to future performance by members of our team are subject to these limitations cautionary remarks and conditions now i ll turn the call over to doug doug douglas t dietrich chief executive officer thanks for the introduction cindi and good morning everyone i ll start the call today by covering the highlights from our first quarter including a number of factors that impacted our results both positively and negatively i ll then take some time to provide an overview of our operating environment and the current state of our end markets as well as the trends we re seeing after that i ll turn it over to matt to review our financials the first quarter of every year is usually our most volatile and this one was no exception i ll characterize the quarter as a productive one for us marked by our team s solid performance navigating through several market and operating challenges on the market side we experienced a slow start to 2019 most notably in china and europe as well as in the building and construction markets in north america while these factors were most pervasive in the first two months conditions improved for us in march when we saw a noticeable uptick in business activity as demand picked up across our markets and geographies we executed on several strategic fronts during the quarter specifically we delivered solid geographic growth increased volumes through new capacity expansions and generated sales from recently introduced value added products that gained traction with customers additionally we extended our large larger global position in pet care through sivomatic s strong performance in europe from a financial perspective total sales in the quarter increased 1 over last year to 438 million and were up 4 on a constant currency basis we generated 62 million of operating income with double digit margins across all segments and delivered earnings per share of 1 11 as we ve done in previous quarters we ve tightly managed our expenses as well as our overall cost structure drove productivity improvements and implemented measures to adjust to the market conditions seen early in the quarter continued pricing actions which increased revenue by about 10 million over last year more than offset persistent inflationary cost pressures extending the trend from the second half of last year now let me take you through some of the quarter highlights for each segment in performance materials household personal care sales increased 54 driven by the acquisition of sivomatic and 25 growth in our pet care products in north america where we re benefiting from strong private label pet care demand and healthy customer pull for our new product formulations such as lightweight cat litter scented and non scented scoopable litters as well as our new fragrance boosters additionally environmental products sales grew 25 driven by a large remediation project in the middle east as well as strong pull for our innovative environmental and wastewater remediation technologies while overall sales in metalcasting were lower north america remained relatively strong with sales increasing 3 lower activity in china during january and february weighed on our metalcasting sales for the quarter but we benefited from an improving demand environment there in march on a positive note demand for and penetration of our higher value pre blended greensand bond products remained strong building materials with sales down 19 compared to last year was the product line most impacted this quarter from weather related construction project delays in north america our largest market in our specialty minerals businesses sales were impacted by lower paper pcc volumes in north america primarily due to the year over year impact of paper machine closures that occurred last year our pcc expansion in asia continues to build momentum during the quarter we finalized the construction of our new 125 000 ton pcc plant in indonesia which came online in april and we expect to break ground on our 150 000 ton plant in china in the next few months our specialty pcc business had a strong quarter with sales up 6 driven by increased customer demand for our newest products which were supported by the capacity expansion that came online at our uk facility in our refractory segment we continue to benefit from improving steel market conditions in the us where utilization rates averaged 82 for the quarter up from 77 last year however we did experience some market weakness and lower demand in european steel markets energy services delivered a much stronger quarter compared to 2018 with sales up 6 and operating income up nearly 1 million we re beginning to see increased customer demand for our services in the gulf of mexico as offshore activity picks up our innovation pipeline a key source of organic growth is robust we continue to strengthen our efforts in terms of increasing the number of products being commercialized and improving the speed with which we bring them to market to size our new product pipeline for you we have a total portfolio of over 280 products from early stage development through commercialization representing over 600 million of revenue at full potential there are between 40 and 50 of these products in the final stage before commercialization specific to the quarter we made solid progress in product development across all of our businesses highlighted by several of our newest pcc technologies including enhanced variations of our new yield and high filler solutions that moved closer to commercialization we ve adapted our innovation pipeline to meet evolving demands from our customers who require products geared toward environmental and recycling issues in addition to cost reduction solutions acquisitions are also an important component of how we intend to grow we continue to analyze and evaluate potential acquisitions and we have an active pipeline of opportunities to recap the quarter we navigated through a couple of challenging months but maintain positive momentum in several growth areas as we move into our strongest period of the year as i mentioned eps for the quarter was at a similar level to last year reflecting the slower start we experienced in several of our markets however we saw demand pick up significantly in march which continued into april and we expect these improved market conditions to remain throughout the second quarter so let me take you a little deeper into what s happening across our end markets and geographies i thought it d be helpful to give some additional context around the second quarter and what we re seeing through the second half of the year i ll also outline the key projects for 2019 that will drive growth at mti irrespective of the market and demand conditions i ll begin with metalcasting our largest business in performance materials overall greensand bond demand in north america from foundries supplying the agriculture machinery heavy truck and automotive markets remained relatively stable and we expect these conditions to continue for the balance of the year we also see solid demand and an opportunity to continue our growth in india and southeast asia where we ve delivered double digit sales increases over the past several quarters in china we believe the foundry market will be stronger in the second half of the year compared to the first half based on conversations with our customers around the potential impact of several government stimulus programs focused on the automotive and transportation markets given the solid demand we saw for our blended products during the first quarter we remain confident that the value proposition of our blended greensand bonds will continue to drive penetration into the foundry market for the full year we anticipate continued sales and volume growth in china likely in the mid single digit range we have a very positive outlook for our global pet care business as the trends in our key markets and geographies remain strong private label package demand is robust our new fragrance formulations and packaging options are seeing increased customer pull and our premium bentonite based litter products in europe are trending upward in addition the investments we ve made in both our fabric care and bleaching earth products are also driving sales and profit growth and we expect this performance trend to continue for the remainder of the year we have a stable outlook on construction markets in north america which we serve through our building materials talc and gcc product lines overall we anticipate base volumes in these products to improve as we enter our seasonally stronger part of the year going a little deeper our talc and gcc products are sold into paints coatings and general construction materials in the residential construction market and we see these volumes improving after a slow start to the year we also expect to realize increased sales in our building materials product line from commercial construction projects that shifted out of the first quarter in our environmental products business we expect the positive sales trend in the first quarter to continue into the second we have a very strong pipeline of higher margin remediation projects where we can deploy our resistex and fluoro sorb products and we look to capitalize on these opportunities over the course of the year turning to paper pcc paper markets are relatively healthy with operating rates in north america and europe at around 90 for the first three months of 2019 which is a similar level to the past several quarters we expect our asia pcc volume to pick up in the second half of 2019 and into early 2020 as 300 000 tons of additional capacity will come online from the two new satellite plants as well as through satellite expansions in addition we have an active pipeline of more than 20 opportunities for new pcc satellites and for the application of our new high value technologies in specialty pcc after a strong start to the year we see an opportunity to build on the solid demand for our current and new high performance sealant products our capacity expansion in the united kingdom continues to ramp up and we will be bringing on an expansion at our adams massachusetts plant in the second half of the year to support growing customer demand for our refractory segment we expect to continue to benefit from stable steel market conditions in the us while the slower demand environment in europe will likely persist we anticipate a strong year of laser equipment sales similar to last year along with robust demand for our hybrid refractory products globally and in total we see another positive year for this segment and in our energy services business increased global demand for our services should remain for the rest of the year and we ve secured several large well testing and filtration projects that will take place over the next three quarters our produced water analytics offering is gaining traction with an expanded customer base which will result in additional service contracts we re also beginning to see signs of pricing recovery that should help improve the segment s profitability later this year to sum it all up after a slower start to the year demand trends turned positive in march and april and many of our key market end markets are heading in a more favorable direction these market trends combined with our new technology launches new capacity additions ongoing pricing actions and continued strong operating performance positions mti for another solid year now i ll turn it over to matt to go through the details of the quarter and our outlook for the second quarter matt matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury chief financial officer thanks doug and hello everyone i ll review our first quarter results the performance of our four segments and also provide you with our outlook for the second quarter sales grew 1 in the first quarter or 4 on a constant currency basis despite a slower start to the year in several of our markets and regions we experienced a notable increase in activity late in the first quarter and we delivered solid growth across several of our product lines gross margin was 25 1 in the first quarter lower than the prior year driven by an unfavorable product mix due to project delays in building materials lower sales of drilling products and reduced north american pcc volumes we managed expenses tightly and reduced sg a by 2 8 million versus last year resulting in an 80 basis point reduction in sg a as a percent of sales operating income for the quarter was 62 million versus 63 million in the prior year excluding the impact of foreign exchange operating income was essentially flat compared to the prior year pricing actions we are taking delivered 9 7 million in the first quarter which more than offset 8 2 million of raw materials freight and energy inflation total business performance includes the impact of product mix and the north american pcc volumes earnings per share were 1 11 2 lower than the prior year primarily due to the change in operating income our effective tax rate was 18 9 equal to the first quarter of last year and now let s review the segments in more detail starting with performance materials performance materials sales increased 6 led by hpc and environmental products segment sales grew 8 on a constant currency basis as doug highlighted we delivered 54 growth in hpc driven by the sivomatic acquisition but also a 25 increase in our north american pet care business where we are capturing increased demand for our private label pet care products environmental product sales grew 25 driven by a large bauxite and red mud remediation project in saudi arabia as well as strong pull for our innovative new products from customers who are seeking environmental and recycling solutions our growth in these two product lines was partially offset by decreased sales in building materials basic minerals and metalcasting building materials sales were 19 lower due to weather related project delays in the united states and basic minerals sales were 28 lower on weaker demand for drilling products particularly in the permian basin of the united states metalcasting sales were impacted by weaker market demand in china particularly in the first two months of the quarter and mainly within the specialty sands portion of the product line sales of our value added pre blended greensand bond formulations in china were less affected and returned to prior levels in march and we also see continued growth from our penetration strategy going forward in addition our global greensand bond business continued to show strength outside china with north america india and southeast asia sales all growing this quarter operating margin for the segment was 13 2 in the quarter and was impacted by an unfavorable product mix from delayed projects in building materials and lower sales of basic minerals products i d also like to highlight that pricing actions more than offset the inflationary costs we are facing we will continue to raise prices to recapture the cumulative inflationary cost increases that this business has absorbed and drive operational excellence to increase productivity gains segment operating income was 26 3 million up slightly from the prior year and now looking to the second quarter we expect operating income to be higher by 4 million to 5 million as we are in the seasonally stronger period for building materials and environmental products we should also benefit from the building materials projects that were delayed in the first quarter we see continued strength in pet care and we expect to build on our late first quarter momentum in greensand bonds globally now let s turn to specialty minerals overall sales in this segment were 3 lower than the prior year primarily due to the north american paper mill shutdowns and a slow start for paper pcc in china sales in this segment were flat on a constant currency basis specialty pcc sales grew 6 on strong demand for our innovative ultraflex and thixocarb sealant products in north america and from our capacity expansion in the uk which started ramping up in the first quarter sales of gcc were down slightly demand on the east coast was higher while severe rain in southern california delayed construction projects and pushed some of our sales on the west coast out of the first quarter talc sales were 5 lower due to weaker volumes of our residential construction projects that support our paints and coatings customers operating income was 22 million versus 24 1 million in the prior year this was the segment that was most impacted by foreign exchange and it contributed roughly half of the decline in segment operating income the north american paper machine shutdowns drove the remainder of the operating income reduction i d also like to point out that pricing actions are more than offsetting inflationary costs paper pcc contractual price increases are offsetting higher lime costs and in performance minerals we are raising prices to overcome higher energy prices and looking to the second quarter we expect to offset the impact of paper machine shutdowns in north america with volume growth from our new indonesian satellite and higher volumes from our existing facilities in china india and brazil we are entering a seasonally stronger period for sales of talc and gcc and we expect spcc sales to remain strong overall for the segment we expect operating income to be higher by 2 million to 3 million sequentially now let s turn to the refractory segment refractory segment sales were 2 lower than the prior year primarily due to lower sales of metallurgical products refractory products growth in the us was offset by lower steel demand in europe primarily in turkey and germany operating margin was strong at 16 4 operating income was 12 1 million 5 lower than the prior year primarily due to the lower sales and higher raw material costs note that these higher raw material costs will be passed through to customers in pricing beginning in july as we look to the second quarter continued weakness in europe will be fully offset by strength in north america we re also introducing hybrid products in europe which provide enhanced value to our customers and have proven very successful in north america overall for this segment we expect operating income to be similar to the first quarter turning to energy services energy services sales grew 6 as the increase in offshore activity continued from the fourth quarter of 2018 into the first quarter of 2019 we saw growth in global well testing wastewater and custom engineered equipment sales operating income was up 900 000 versus the prior year on increased international activity going forward we expect similar levels of activity to the first quarter and a similar level of operating income in the second quarter now let s take a look at our liquidity and debt highlights cash from operations was 31 million in the first quarter and we deployed 18 million of capital as you can see on the chart cash flows are typically lower in the first quarter than they are in the other quarters of the year as i ve discussed previously we expect strong cash flow generation to continue in 2019 in the first quarter we repaid 15 million of debt and over the past year we have repaid nearly 90 million maintaining our net leverage ratio at 2 2 times ebitda our total debt is 1 billion and is evenly split between fixed and variable rate debt interest expense in this quarter was up 700 000 year over year on higher interest rates on the variable portion of our debt and a slightly higher debt level we will continue to pay down debt toward our goal of achieving a net leverage ratio of 2 times ebitda company s financial position is strong with 207 million of cash and equivalents and 200 million of availability on our revolving credit facility for a total of 407 million of liquidity so now let me summarize what we are seeing for the second quarter which is typically our seasonally strongest quarter of the year in performance materials we expect operating income to increase 15 to 20 sequentially or 4 million to 5 million in specialty minerals we expect operating income to increase 10 to 15 sequentially or 2 million to 3 million we expect both refractories and energy services to deliver similar levels of operating income sequentially and as i turn to our eps guidance let me note that at current foreign exchange rates we are not expecting the same benefit to our below the line earnings as last year and in total we expect second quarter earnings per share to be between 1 20 and 1 25 with the momentum we had in march and april the market dynamics that doug outlined and the incremental growth from our expansions and innovations we expect to grow both sales and operating income in the second quarter by 10 sequentially and 4 to 5 year over year with that let s open the call up to questions questions and answers operator operator instructions and we will take our first question from daniel moore with cjs securities please go ahead daniel moore cjs securities analyst good morning doug good morning matt thanks for taking the questions a couple things as far as household and personal maybe i think you said north america was up 25 what was organic growth in that segment and what kind of organic growth do you think is reasonable as we lap the sivomatic acquisition matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury chief financial officer yes dan the 25 in north america was organic growth driven by so of the 54 i m trying to even split there but 25 it s our largest business is north america well it s not equal to europe and that was both driven by volume and pricing daniel moore cjs securities analyst helpful and on the environmental services how much longer does that middle east project last and i think you said felt pretty good about the pipeline there i guess is this sort of a lumpy project or do we see continued growth as we look out to the back half year douglas t dietrich chief executive officer yes let me let me start off and then i ll let jon talk a little bit about both actually he has comments on pet care as well yes that s a again in this product line we get some very large projects and then there s some small remediation based gcl products this is one of those high value resistex types projects it s for a red mud pond that for a customer in saudi arabia it s actually the second phase of what we ve done we did the last one i believe with this customer several years three years ago or so so it s a large one it will extend into the second quarter but beyond that and so we re very positive about that and that growth beyond that we have a large pipeline i mentioned in some remediation projects similar types around the world these are for the higher value products resistex and starting to see some interest in and demand in our fluoro sorb product if you remember that s a new product we ve developed which takes ppfas out of water and we know if you ve seen in the news that that s been a big issue with water remediation around the united states in particular and so we ve qualified that product with a number in a number of places and we see that that s going to grow some demand throughout the year so we re pretty positive on our environmental products business and it is one of the the base gcls are one of the lower margin products i mean not low but below average i guess for the segment which is why matt highlighted when you sell when we re selling more of this right now that it does have a dilutive effect on the margins but these projects i m talking about going forward are the higher margin type and we think that that s going to be very accretive to margins as we go throughout the year jon anything you want to on the type of projects you want to add to that jonathan j hastings group president performance materials yes just a couple of comments hi dan the like doug said we are pretty bullish on environmental products right now the projects that we see in queue we do have several large projects they are resistex oriented they are in different parts of the world and the timing is staggered and sequenced over the course of the next year or so as far as starting up the benefit of the technology is certainly being recognized and the value proposition is there so again we re pretty bullish on environmental products from the resistex side with fluoro sorb last quarter we got the nsf certification for the four products that we have in our product line right now again that s a testament to the value of the products and the capabilities they have it certainly positions us very well to satisfy the customer requirements so again something that we re looking forward to as we continue launching that product line and executing projects going forward i did want to just follow up on the pet care question as well i wanted add i thought you asked also about the organic growth over in europe that s been about 5 per year and we continue to see that going forward with our premium and customized pet liter products that we sell in europe douglas t dietrich chief executive officer and dan a little bit more on the north america i was looking at something when you asked the question that in my comments that was really that really is organic growth it s driven by volume expansion in our packaged pet care products we ve come up with a number of different formulations for customers customer driven formulations in fragrance packages with a new product called fragrance booster it s not necessarily a cat litter itself but it s actually something that s that seems to be trending very well with customer demand where you actually kind of like a salt shaker sprinkling fragrance into the box and so we provide that as kind of a tangential add on product to our pet litter so got a number of new things customer pull new product innovations packaging and i think private label demand just in general has been increasing over the past several quarters and so we re seeing both volume growth and that with some of these new products that s driving up some of the pricing as well so we see we re really positive on the pet care product and as jon mentioned sivomatic in europe is trending very favorably and especially in some of that premium bentonite category so we see a good year for pet care going forward daniel moore cjs securities analyst that s helpful is the overall organic and i ve got enough of the picture last one for me and apologize maybe a couple of parts but in terms of the q2 guide really nice to see the improvement and reacceleration on the topline expected still fighting some cost headwinds and not a ton of operating leverage so as you look out to h2 is more significant margin expansion reasonable to expect in light of the inflationary pressures doug and what levers can you pull either in terms of pricing or more significant cost reductions to start maybe translating the topline growth into a little faster bottom line thanks douglas t dietrich chief executive officer yes i appreciate that dan we are getting the leverage has been a bit challenging given that we continue to see persistent inflation i d say the cost pressures are tailing a little bit in different places some are accelerating even further and some are tailing matt mentioned we had about 8 million year over year this quarter where we saw for the past three almost 10 million year over year so it s slowing but not tremendously we are though i ll say getting ahead of that in price so this is the second third quarter in a row where pricing has outpaced those cost inflation so that is helping the underlying margins so in many of our product lines margins are boosting you didn t see it this quarter just because of the mix of what happened i don t like talking about mix but that is the reality this quarter so we do see margin expansion and getting further leverage as we go our target has always been to get to 16 op income margins i do think that 15 is a near term reality i think our highest we saw in 2017 was about 15 5 and i think within this year we can start getting back to 15 albeit i ll couch that with inflation we lag in some of our pricing formulaic but also on pricing to customers and so as these cost pressures continue we re going to continue to lag it once they start to tail over i think we ll get back to normalized pricing and you ll see that 15 margin and then further with the products that i m talking about the new formulations in pricing in pet care pricing across the board in performance minerals and also the environmental products and some new paper pcc technologies those are above average margins that s our strategy with our new technologies that s what s going to get us through 2020 into the 16 range or the upper 15 s okay so i m very bullish on the margins there is more room to go on cost reduction we are focused as you can see this quarter on overheads and total fixed we made some good strides this quarter in making sure that we kept our costs in control productivity continues to improve but there s more to go on costs and i think that will also help get to those margins quicker so more to come on that one daniel moore cjs securities analyst got it thanks again for the color operator and we will take our next question from rosemarie morbelli from g research please go ahead rosemarie j morbelli gabelli company analyst thank you good morning everyone so just looking at refectories is that margin sustainable was that part of the mix and we should not expect it to be at the to remain at this particular first quarter level for the balance of the year douglas t dietrich chief executive officer well let me take it and then i m going to pass it over to brett argirakis who s the president of that business yes i think those margins are largely sustainable rosemarie i think if you remember you probably remember when margins in the business were about 6 right rosemarie j morbelli gabelli company analyst unfortunately i do douglas t dietrich chief executive officer you do so we ve taken that business and through brett s leadership to a different level new products et cetera but yes i do think they re sustainable i m going to let brett take you through kind of what he s seen over the past couple of years running the business and the changes he s made to make that kind of margin sustainable going forward brett argirakis vice president and managing director minteq international inc hi rosemarie thanks for the question unfortunately i remember those margins when they were 6 as well this business has always provided very good service equipment and products and after the last financial crisis we resized this business to the right levels that i think are very sustainable we focused on business fundamentals oe safety expense control productivity was focused on very heavily as well and customer requirements and we looked at our research and development group and they did a really good job of focusing on value added products just in every category refractories for instance doug pointed out the hybrid product last year this was rolled out very well and we launched about 17 000 tons of the new hybrid product in north america alone these products were developed for the customer for to be faster to apply easier and to give them a lower cost solution and they really caught on very well the good news is we re in the process in europe and asia right now mainly europe doing a very good job and we have a lot of trial activity there so we anticipate doing the same things in europe this year ferrotron same thing we we looked at the value of our laser which is the fastest in the world this we launched a new lacam explorer technology this last year sold our first unit that will allow us to utilize a laser and read the measurements of refractory in a very hot environment this new laser will be able to detect the smallest issues in the refractory lining and really create a much safer and more efficient operation for the customer and lastly really what we ve done with that ferrotron engineering group is tied them into equipment in multiple product lines so they ve helped us with optimizing our equipment in lasers refractory and also our calcium wire equipment so it s been a long road and look i m very proud of what this team has done and we re on track for another very solid year in 2019 rosemarie j morbelli gabelli company analyst thank you cindi buckwalter head of investor relations some of that rosemarie i think we re we are benefiting from some strong conditions in north america as i mentioned we saw some weakness but we think through the balance of the year and we re at a different level of margin in this business now given kind of products that we re selling the value we re bringing to the customer and ability to maintain those margins through inflationary periods so a little bit different business now than it was back when i talked about it you remember rosemarie j morbelli gabelli company analyst yes thank you no that was very helpful looking at the greensands so automotive production has slowed down in china but your strategy is that it s one of substitution so i was wondering if during the slowdown there were more trials going on and we could see quite a jump in demand when the production improves maybe in the second half douglas t dietrich chief executive officer yes we ve always talked about how demand for our products is based on substituting a base play or our current customers their own formulation and so we continue to conduct trials automotive production especially and greensand bond demand was lower in january and february but after the chinese new year picked up considerably we did see trial activity we continue to see strong demand for our greensand bond product and those were in my comments we see that as a testament to our ability to continue the penetration in that market furthermore it s not only automotive that we sell into the foundry market supplies heavy truck industrial equipment and those fared a little bit differently than automotive in china so they were a little bit stronger so jon anything to add to that jonathan j hastings group president performance materials sure just talk about the segments auto sales in china were down 11 but as doug highlighted the compressor market was flat and heavy engineering actually grew about 24 what we also see is as there s more and more pressure on the casting industry in china there are new lines coming on and those new lines are heavily automated they re using western technologies and as a consequence they re demanding the high value blended products so while we did see some decline overall in our sales especially around that chinese new year time in february we ve responded the market s responded very nicely in both march and april and the greensand bonds the blended products continue to be very robust and we continue to see demand for our specific product line and also growth going forward so again another part of the business that with the blended products we continue see the value of our proposition going forward rosemarie j morbelli gabelli company analyst thank you and if i may on the pet care you did not mention asia what are you seeing there particularly in china where according to my view there are going to be many many cats in households douglas t dietrich chief executive officer clearly we still see continued growth in pet care in asia we have highlighted it before i think it was kind of overshadowed by some of our growth here in north america obviously north america and europe are a bigger base i think our average pet care sales have grown mid double digits i think we were at one point about 100 but as that base gets bigger year over year we ve been growing in the 40 50 range per year albeit from a small base but yes we re continuing that trend we ve got a number of different lightweight litter that we introduced there last year we ve got a number of different fragrance formulations as well so smaller base rosemarie but still we note the trend in terms of domesticated cats in asia that is something that s going to continue and we intend to continue to look to capture on that market rosemarie j morbelli gabelli company analyst thank you i ll get back into queue operator and our next question will come silke kueck from jp morgan please go ahead silke kueck valdes jp morgan chase co analyst good morning how are you douglas t dietrich chief executive officer good morning silke kueck valdes jp morgan chase co analyst my first question is like sales analysis so on slide 8 what you say is that your sales growth excluding currencies was up 18 million and you said price was up like 10 million and the acquisitions probably contributed like 20 million your volumes were down 12 million or 3 is that the right way to look at it matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury chief financial officer yes so your mix silke you have overall sales were 1 fx as we told you would have been about an 11 impact so when you remove that that gets you to that 4 sivomatic like you said gets you into that mid 20 s range which it s been trending but going higher as jon told you from when we purchased it you have pricing which doug outlined to you which is about 2 and the rest there would be volume silke kueck valdes jp morgan chase co analyst so sivomatic is like in the mid 20 million per quarter attributed to sales matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury chief financial officer in dollars silke kueck valdes jp morgan chase co analyst okay that s helpful in the metalcasting business what you said is that you think that the business is stabilizing and by stabilizing do you mean it s going to be flat year over year or it s actually growing year over year douglas t dietrich chief executive officer so there s two parts let me take that one silke there s two parts to the metalcasting business we don t talk about one of it it s a smaller part of it it s called specialty sands but we have what s called greensand bonds those are the ones we talk about in terms of clay blended products north america asia growth and then the specialty sands specialty sands goes into stainless steel castings it has a raw material in it chrome based raw material that it s market driven in terms of pricing the biggest impact this year this past quarter was on that specialty sands piece i think pricing was off almost 40 over last year and volumes were down a similar amount due to the weakness and most of that goes into china the greensand portion of it was relatively strong and we saw the growth throughout southeast asia north america et cetera so we see in total for metalcasting we see and specialty sands is about 15 of that product line so we see continued growth in metalcasting this year we think with the flat kind of flat to slightly down north america automotive market we see a growing a better second half in asia in terms of not just automotive but in total industrial output which will help our greensand bond volumes there the thing is that we have a pretty large decline in terms of revenue from that specialty sands and that s going to that s going to probably temper that growth a little bit this year globally so we still see a positive year but it s going to be lower growth due to that specialty sands now that specialty sands like i said is a small portion of our business and really the profitability of the margins are driven going to be driven this year from that greensand bond program silke kueck valdes jp morgan chase co analyst right so your expectation says including everything and considering what your currency headwinds may be you think your metalcasting sales will be up year over year or up a little bit douglas t dietrich chief executive officer yes i mean i can predict currency i think currency in china was one of the biggest headwinds we were down i think we were down 15 in sales in china our volumes in greensand bonds single digits but our volumes in specialty sands double digits they were threefold what and that was really driven by that commodity pricing so we saw pricing drop 40 year over year and that s going to affect the that s going to affect the sales in the segment i will say though that those specialty sands are priced on conversion so when you re talking about income and cash no different we don t talk about it much because it s such a small portion of the segment but when you re off 40 in price in one quarter it had an impact on the topline silke kueck valdes jp morgan chase co analyst yes ok then i have a question about your comment you made about that margin expansion so your operating margin last year was 14 4 and what you said is like all of these headwinds that you re managing very well with all of those cost controls you re putting in place but in the first quarter your margins are still down 40 basis points so when you say we think 15 operating margin is possible do you mean that s for the year or maybe in one quarter or do you just like round it and maybe you think you re going to get the 14 6 because 15 seems a stretch just given all the headwinds that are out there douglas t dietrich chief executive officer yes no look i think getting this full year up to 15 starting out at 14 2 you re right is going to be a challenge what i m saying is that i think we can start to see run rate margins getting back to the 15 by the end of the year kind of on an annualized basis so i don t want to take the calendar year but the reason i m bullish about that is because 14 2 over 14 4 i think you mentioned last year comes with a very weak mix of our products we re selling some fortunately we re selling a lot of good environmental and pet care products but that mix is a little bit different and we think some of that is temporary we see both those building products which are accretive to the average margins in the segment performance materials segment coming back in the second quarter so we think that that s a temporary and without that base margins in the business year over year have grown now we re still overcoming continued inflationary pressures that s going to that s making it difficult to get ourselves back to average pricing as we lag but we re starting to see some of those prices playing over and we will catch up i ve always said we ll get back to our pricing but we ve got to get through kind of these inflationary pressures the margins in this business back in average pricing and with our mix should be in the 15 range i think like i said 16 is possible over the next couple of years getting back to where we were in 17 with some of these higher margin products in addition it s the other thing they re positive cash to the company these paper pcc contracts we always talk about how dollar per ton of revenue is a little bit lower because they are in china so as we grow in asia the ebitda that comes from those contracts is the same however the margins because of the brand new capital when you put in something in indonesia and lose something in port hudson does affect your margins it doesn t affect the cash flow doesn t affect your ebidta but it will change your margins a little bit so there s some of that going on silke but nonetheless even with that and with constant focus on our expenses and costs and i think there s still some room to go there i m bullish on getting ourselves back to and i ll give you the run rate of 15 into next year into the end of this year into next year silke kueck valdes jp morgan chase co analyst and like a last set of questions for matt if i may i was hoping you could tell me like what your total d a was in the quarter first matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury chief financial officer yes d a in the quarter was 24 5 million and i know where you re going with this silke so let me try and answer that string for you that should continue so total d a for the year will be around 95 million to 100 million from a capex perspective we re looking at about 70 million to 80 million that s going to be fairly evenly split between sustaining and roi return type capex and within that sustaining just note that we also put about 10 million toward environmental health and safety projects so continuing to do that as well this year when you look at the overall cash flow generation for the company what we ve told you before is we re targeting about 150 million there are working capital elements that we are working on to get there you probably saw that working capital in the first quarter was a little bit of a use versus what you ve seen previously we did have as we told you the sales ramp up in march so those sales will be collected in the second quarter but that was an overhang of about 5 million that moved from the first quarter to the second quarter so if that was held equal you would have seen the first quarter this year look pretty equal to last year and so as we move through the rest of the year the opportunities and the growth that doug was just talking about and how we deliver those to the bottom line along with working capital is going to help us grow working capital year over year sorry free cash flow year over year silke kueck valdes jp morgan chase co analyst that s very helpful thanks for the comprehensive answer i appreciate that douglas t dietrich chief executive officer thanks operator and our next question will come from steve schwartz with first analysis please go ahead steven k schwartz first analysis securities analyst good morning everyone douglas t dietrich chief executive officer hi steve steven k schwartz first analysis securities analyst i ll echo that thanks from silke i have one question on quarterly d a he took out about four of my questions but with that there s still a few more and these are i think relatively simple so i think you re seeing very nice utilization of this uk expansion and i d like to hear a little more about that just the planning for it what you expected how it s and how it s come to fruition with sales and then with adams mass i mean that s a domestic expansion that s under way right so can we expect the same kind of thing douglas t dietrich chief executive officer yes let me start off by kind of how we look at expansions in general hopefully and thanks for the question steve we look before we make any expansion in the company or add capital to something we look at oee which is overall equipment effectiveness and it s really a measure that says what are we getting out of that have we squeezed everything possible out of the existing asset before we move it and the oee is a combination of percent uptime the productivity to nameplate times to quality off of that thing so we will not expand a piece of equipment unless that oee is up to kind of world class levels in the mid 80s upper 80s and so what we have done over the past years as demand has increased for products as we ve introduced new products that require capacity we just have put in kaizen events waste reduction opportunities that really look at taking out bottlenecks as much as possible then you get to a point where you got to make a step change because demand is going and in these two cases in specialty pcc really these are the kind of first expenses we made some small tweaks over the past couple years these are the first expansion at adams massachusetts and the second one in lifford in birmingham sorry england in the past several years and we did that through product demand and some new products so let me let d j monagle talk to you about some of that demand and those new products and what s driving at least the requirement for more capacity d j monagle iii group president specialty minerals and refractories yes thanks for the question steve so as doug mentioned we ve been pretty much sold out so there s two things that are going on first one is we are seeing in general increased demand in the major drivers on both the auto industry and the building and construction industry is the use of higher technology sealants and by applying our pcc in those sealants we are able to help our customers deliver a better product so in general we re seeing that demand grow the other part that we re that we ve been working on doug mentioned that this aspect of oee another way of saying it is we have been flat sold out and i can t ask the operations group to do a much better job on maintaining things the problem is breaking into that production cycle to get our new products launched and so we ve got some new products that are able to even drive our performance higher so these expansions are letting us do two things first one is address what we re going to see as inherent growth but even more importantly for us positioning us for future years address with higher performing products that will increase our margins and further solidify our leadership positions so this 6 that matt mentioned for the quarter maybe that goes up or down in a given quarter but for the year i think that s a reasonable expectation based on what we re seeing right now and the pull that we re getting from these customers steven k schwartz first analysis securities analyst okay thanks d j and it s nice to see the expansions like this and the idea that you can simply pull mineral out of the ground and place it so well like this d j monagle iii group president specialty minerals and refractories i wish it was that simple it s a little bit more work than that steve steven k schwartz first analysis securities analyst it s been a long time since i ve done chemical engineering anyway but just and then just with respect to the environmental projects i might have asked this in the past but i want to make sure i have a clear picture of what your pipeline and current project activity is like what s the average size of a project in that business and it sounds like when you talk about the middle east project and how big it is is there some way that on a public call you can just kind of scale that for us jonathan j hastings group president performance materials yes the average project this is jon the average project in our portfolio can range anywhere from 50 000 to 100 000 all the way up to a large project like this which is a 10 million project when we look at our portfolio it s balanced we have a lot of small projects that we fill our pipeline with and we execute on day in and day out and then we also position ourselves very strongly to tackle the bigger projects based on when they come up so we re always working with potential customers trying to identify timing and sequencing and where they are in their cycle of installing either a new bond or a new retention basin or a landfill or whatever it may be so again a very robust pipeline active in the markets that we participate in always trying to determine what s next and what s coming and like i said they can range from pretty small to very large douglas t dietrich chief executive officer steve i d say the average steven k schwartz first analysis securities analyst multiple speakers like where it s a 16 million quarter i mean that s you re talking about maybe 150 projects outside of like a middle east project so it s pretty well diversified douglas t dietrich chief executive officer those projects will span the projects that size that s a unique kind of project now they re all not all 10 million 9 million 10 million i d say average for a large kind of specialized product is in the 1 million to 2 million you can see smaller in the hundreds of thousands for a large municipal waste site which more commodity based gcl so they are they do range around we do have a nice pipeline of i d say maybe one or two in the 10 million but they re out there they don t happen all the time we usually get one of those a year but we we ve got a good pipeline of the 1 million to 2 million to 3 million ranges and those are for those specialty projects that s why i kind of get back to silke s question we re seeing as we move into these higher margin products especially away from those kind of what we call commodity gcls in this product line we see those margins have been improved and we ve seen that improve over the past year so that s going to help continue to drive margin expansion across this segment and mti steven k schwartz first analysis securities analyst that s great well thank you all for the color have a great weekend douglas t dietrich chief executive officer thanks steve jonathan j hastings group president performance materials thanks steve operator and our final question will be a follow up from rosemarie morbelli please go ahead rosemarie j morbelli gabelli company analyst thank you i was just wondering doug you mentioned that the potential from your innovation pipeline was about 600 million and that you had about 40 to 50 ready to be commercialized could you give us the potential of those 40 to 50 and then the timing of when they could generate that douglas t dietrich chief executive officer no i didn t give you that but i can i will give you i ll give you some broad numbers so last year just to give you a perspective last year we commercialized about 35 projects new products and the potential of those products were about 100 million we have about 40 as i mentioned 40 to 50 in the pipeline i don t think all of those will be commercialized this year i would say of the ones we ll commercialize this year we see right now there may be a couple more or less but probably in the 70 million to 90 million range of potential value that could come out this year sort of a similar pace to last year i will highlight that though it s at a similar pace we re moving products out of the pipeline faster 2018 over 2016 i think we moved and by the way that s an annualized value i m getting signals here that that s not all going to happen this year rosemarie that s at a full potential annualized rate the 70 million to 90 million so we re moving things through our pipeline 20 faster than we were and so our thought is we focus in on the projects with the strongest customer pull we move them fast we fail fast and then we get them commercialized and then we repeat and so moving that innovation engine and getting those 70 million to 100 million of annualized opportunities out faster is what s driving some of our revenue growth over the past four quarters five quarters so those are the kind of numbers that we think we see this year rosemarie j morbelli gabelli company analyst okay thanks and when you were talking i know they were having a heart attack there but when you are talking about the 70 the 70 million potential annualized do we start out with something like 5 million in one year and how long before it gets to that full potential douglas t dietrich chief executive officer yes our products some of our products ramp up very quickly i guess it s hard to characterize one product we ve had i think we look at some of these things as a potential over five years to generate sales over a five year period so every year we re launching products that i can give you round numbers that have a potential value of 100 million over five years but you keep doing that and you move that faster and that s what we think yields that type of run rate every year we have been behind we ve been moving up that speed curve and up that value curve over the past two years that s what i m trying to draw a picture of so over some product like i said some of our new sealant products that we re just launching now have been developed with customers i mean thixo these have been probably three years in kind of product testing especially with automotive it takes a long time to get things qualified on new build so some are very quick our new high filler technology that i just mentioned was developed over probably the past two years and we took several trials and we think that one could ramp up quicker because it s an add on to an existing known technology so some very quickly and some take a little bit longer depending on the market rosemarie j morbelli gabelli company analyst thank you that is very helpful operator at this time i d like to turn the call back to ms buckwalter for any closing remarks cindi buckwalter head of investor relations thank you savannah and thank you all for joining us today we look forward to speaking with you again soon have a great day duration 65 minutes call

seventh floor desk early on a thursday morning the skyscrapers of downtown boston crowding the windows behind him on a laptop in the nearly empty office he worked on code for a webpage he was developing for his employer the learning materials company houghton mifflin harcourt in half an hour he needed to join a conference call about changes to the company s website he had been at houghton mifflin harcourt for four months coding he liked meetings not so much that s one thing i wasn t warned about when it comes to the corporate world he said so many meetings tillman french 26 grew up in a detroit neighborhood where few people around him had jobs he received an associate degree hoping to eventually get a bachelor s and work as a financial adviser instead he bounced from one unfulfilling job to the next in the hospitality and restaurant industries in the fall of 2017 he moved to boston and enrolled in a community college planning to transfer to a four year program ryan tillman french at his desk in houghton mifflin harcourt s downtown boston offices courtesy the hechinger report one day a friend forwarded an email about resilient coders a boot camp that trains people of color for web development and software engineering jobs on a lark tillman french went to a resilient coders hackathon and the passionate staff there sold him on the opportunity after he finished the 14 week program he said he had over two dozen interviews three employers asked him back only houghton mifflin harcourt made an offer several years ago tillman french s résumé would likely have ended up in the trash until last summer houghton mifflin harcourt screened out web developer applicants who lacked a four year degree houghton mifflin harcourt wasn t alone in that practice the previous decade saw a spike in the number of job listings requiring a bachelor s degree even for so called middle skills jobs think executive secretaries production supervisors it help desk workers that have traditionally been filled by workers with an associate degree or less analysts say that this degree inflation as they call it has shrunk opportunities for upward mobility for americans without four year degrees but now some workforce organizations researchers and regional civic leaders are pushing back persuading companies to look beyond academic credentials and to instead hire people based on their skills a growing number of businesses are listening in the past few years apple google ibm and other high profile companies have stripped the bachelor s degree requirement from many of their positions if this movement continues to gather steam researchers say it could aid not only individual job seekers but also the u s economy by helping businesses hold onto workers and by boosting the middle class degree inflation in 2014 the labor market analysis firm burning glass technologies tried to capture the extent of degree inflation the firm compared the percentage of people in a given occupation say executive assistant who have a bachelor s degree with the percentage of job listings for that occupation requiring a bachelor s degree who you have working for you and who you want to have working for you in the future aren t always the same said burning glass ceo matthew sigelman sigelman found that 19 percent of current executive assistants had a bachelor s degree but that 65 percent of job listings for the position asked for one a credentials gap of 46 percent in surveying broader groups of occupations burning glass found a credentials gap of 26 percent for management jobs 21 percent for computer and math jobs and 13 percent for sales jobs in late 2017 a research project led by the harvard business school a workforce organization called grads of life and the consulting firm accenture concluded in a report dismissed by degrees that employers appear to be closing off their access to the two thirds of the u s workforce that does not have a four year college degree the researchers estimated that 6 2 million jobs were at risk of degree inflation they cited research showing that the proportion of job listings requiring a four year degree increased by more than 10 percentage points from 2007 to 2010 that timespan should look familiar the great recession lasted from december 2007 to june 2009 unemployment spiked and employers stocked up on college graduates without having to pay a premium in wages some of that is legitimate where the job is getting more technical said dismissed by degrees co author joe fuller a harvard business school professor but employers want more than technical skills they want characteristics like attention to detail problem solving working with a team one of the major reasons degree inflation is so common is because employers use it as proxy for those kinds of soft skills fuller said related out of poverty into the middle class using a four year degree as a proxy for employability shuts out the most economically vulnerable job seekers it hurts employers too fuller and his harvard colleague researcher manjari raman found in their report degree holders command an 11 to 30 percent wage premium yet fail to justify that premium in productivity and other outcomes it takes longer to fill jobs when filtering for four year degrees and degree holders change jobs more quickly nonetheless according to harvard s survey of 600 business and human resource leaders 61 percent of respondents reported tossing resumes without four year degrees even if the applicant was qualified that survey also revealed that 63 percent of respondents had trouble filling middle skills jobs andy van kleunen ceo of the national skills coalition attributed that trouble to public policies that push bachelor s degrees as a one size fits all solution rather than training workers for specific middle skill positions the national skills coalition which lobbies policymakers and employers to invest in workers skills wants federal pell grants to be available not just for students seeking degrees but also for workers who want to take short term courses that they could apply on the job immediately but part of employers inability to fill middle skills jobs can be attributed to degree inflation fuller s report encouraged employers to push back against the trend once the logic of resisting degree inflation takes root in an organization it soon permeates different aspects of the organization s culture and eventually embeds itself at the heart of its strategy the report states a 1 percent market after years of being criticized for a lack of diversity companies especially in the technology world are looking for ways to make their workplaces more inclusive and a tight labor market there were more than 7 million job openings in the u s as of february has employers in many sectors scrambling for talent for decades at many companies that i worked for i wasn t allowed to hire unless somebody had a four year degree said trish torizzo the chief information officer for houghton mifflin harcourt but today she said supply is so low that people are almost being forced to think more creatively about how they operate houghton mifflin harcourt stripped the four year degree requirement from information technology positions including web developer last summer and the number of applications that made it through their initial screening doubled to screen candidates the company looks for a tech stack a list of programming languages and tools a candidate knows houghton mifflin harcourt then revisited hiring practices for sales positions which are heavy on soft skills at the urging of roberta rainville the vice president for talent acquisitions rainville knew it was time for a change when the company found itself unable to hire a great candidate for a sales position they interviewed splendidly she said and then it was well i want to hire them and i was like yeah you can t and they re like why not and i m like because your job description says bachelor s degree required i said that s got togo related are apprenticeships the new on ramps to good jobs rainville had to persuade 10 people from the sales leadership team before she could make the change some folks were like we can t take the bachelor s degree off we re sending the wrong message to our teacher population that we re selling to she said ultimately everyone signed off and in september the company stripped the four year degree requirement from some of its sales jobs and three months later did the same for software engineering jobs now 11 percent of applicants who make it through the interview process for an entry level sales position have no credential beyond a high school diploma another 11 percent have an associate degree previously all had bachelor s degrees as the company retools its pipeline it is working with organizations in boston communities hoping to attract job applicants it had previously failed to reach so far houghton mifflin s relationship with resilient coders has resulted in the company hiring tillman french and another web developer resilient coders founder david delmar has offered to tailor part of the organization s curriculum to houghton mifflin harcourt s needs resilient coders has already built a curriculum for wayfair a rapidly growing home furnishings company that generated 6 8 billion in revenue last year a goal that we ve set something we think it s reasonable to achieve in the next couple of seasons is to have potentially as much as half of entry level software developers come from boot camps whereas historically it s been 100 percent out of universities said deborah poole wayfair s global head of talent acquisition in late march wayfair hosted researchers employers and representatives of boston s economic development office at an event called untapped to release a research report on redefining hiring in the area the report is part of a regional effort to bring

cnbc s steve liesman sits down with hoover institution s john taylor st louis fed president jim bullard cleveland fed president loretta mester and dallas federal reserve president robert kaplan when today friday may 3 2019 where cnbc s business day programming interviews live from stanford university in stanford ca the following are the unofficial transcripts of cnbc interviews with cnbc s steve liesman and hoover institution s john taylor st louis fed president jim bullard cleveland fed president loretta mester and dallas federal reserve president robert kaplan which aired live across cnbc s business day programming today friday may 3rd the interviews took place at the hoover institution annual monetary policy conference in stanford ca videos of the interviews on cnbc com are linked below all references must be sourced to cnbc first on cnbc hoover institution s john taylor on cnbc s squawk box m f 6am 9am video steve liesman thank you andrew yeah we ve got a bunch of guests but none better than john taylor eminent professor of finance monetary policy at stanford university john i almost want to skip the jobs number and get to the broader discussion we were having about productivity because at the end of the day monthly jobs don t matter for wit if you have this strong productivity because that changes things when you look at these numbers how do you judge what yesterday was 3 6 for the first quarter and you had a 1 8 for the fourth quarter which was higher than trend john taylor i think productivity is key right now it s what we ve been hoping that s why we were hoping growth was going be higher it s not a sugar high it s because we re getting some good productivity numbers coming in it s significant and i m glad people are talking about that we re talking about it out here all the time steve liesman if these numbers are higher the productivity numbers are higher and we re not really necessarily going to change the demographics because t what happened 30 years ago determines the populations we have now to work essentially what happened to potential growth is it potential growth potentially higher john taylor absolutely we ve been arguing you ll go from a lousy 2 to above 3 and that s what s been happening the last few years it s been going up and up and up and now 3 2 for the most recent numbers and that consistent with the productivity numbers the demographics are important remember bls was forecasting declines and it s flat that s a positive thing steve liesman a victory to have a flat participation rate john taylor i think so yeah steve liesman because you do have the retirements john taylor absolutely steve liesman so the idea that it s john a 3 6 unemployment rate you re doing 200 000 plus jobs a month is the fed in the right place john taylor i think they made some good changes since they ve started to normalize i think that s a good thing i think that s actually one of the positives people forget that to get a normalized fed is good for the economy good for the world steve liesman rates up at this point you re saying john taylor i think that s good they re in a better place at this point in case something happens i think they ll probably continue to adjust but we ll see what happens to the rest of the data steve liesman it s hard not to get too wonky about this but we had an interesting conversation last night about the relationship of productivity to interest rates if productivity is higher economics would suggest interest rates should be higher can you explain that to the audience john taylor well i think in terms of the fed it s the other way around they want to see the potential of the economy to grow we all do of course steve liesman right john taylor and once that happens the need for rate increases is diminished because you ve got productivity you ve got the potential of the economy growing rapidly steve liesman so they don t have to raise rates in light of higher productivity or lower unemployment john taylor well there are other things but certainly the productivity number the real question you re raising is what s this normal interest rate steve liesman right john taylor and a lot of people we re going to be talking about this at this conference a lot and has it come down is it going back up again i think it s probably too early to say that i ve been a little skeptical that it s come down as far as people think so maybe we ll get some better estimates steve liesman fed chairman jay powell says the fed is in a good place with this current policy rate do you think it s in a good place john taylor i think as long as it keeps adjusting i think again what s going to be on the table here today is these policies strategies rules and as long as they are doing that i think a big change in the last couple years really has been as more rules based policy more strategies are being considered steve liesman where s the inflation john everybody thought we were going to have rising inflation instead we have inflation the core pce is down three four months in a row john taylor i think to some extent it s because the supply side of the economy is picking up remember these are productivity and labor forces supply side steve liesman deregulation and tax cuts or supply side john taylor both of those deregulation and the tax reform are both absolutely i think bring the financial side in bring the fed in as well to that steve liesman okay john we have to leave it there because we have some other imminent guests and warren buffett et cetera going from that conference there john taylor thanks for joining us this morning andrew back to you first on cnbc st louis fed president jim bullard on cnbc s squawk on the street m f 9am 11am video steve liesman yeah thanks carl and i have a special guest who can help us understand it i m joined by st louis fed president james bullard so jim it isn t every day that we have a vice president on talking about the fed the fed and fed policy and i get to throw it at president a voting member of the fomc who says you ought to be lowering rates and maybe not considering the employment mandate just have an inflation mandate take it away james bullard i actually have supported single mandate for the fed in the past i ve said that it would clarify what the fed can actually do over the medium term i don t think actual policy would change very much we would still react to the economy and everything but it would clarify in people s minds that the only thing the fed can do over the medium term is try to control the inflation rate steve liesman do the president and the vice president have a point that growth is strong inflation is low and the fed ought to be cutting rates and if it did cut rates the economy would soar james bullard i think the way you think about the current situation you have to step back a little bit there has been a sea change in u s monetary policies since january 4th when the chair was at in atlanta at the aa meetings that sea change has altered the structure of interest rates and you can really see it in the ten year the ten year was trading at 325 last fall now it s trading low 250s you re talking 75 basis points on the ten year i would attribute the lion share of that to changed fed policy we know there are long and variable legs you ve got to wait and see how big an impact this has on the economy so i think we re in great shape today we have a great jobs report inflation is a little bit low and we can talk about that but we already made a gigantic change in policy one which i welcomed and supported most of the committee came to my view about the flat rate outlook and this has had a big impact steve liesman so you re saying you already eased through what is sort of derived something we call open mouth operations by changing your stance on the forward outlook james bullard policy is not just the rate it is the expected path of the rate over the next two years and we used to be saying you know 50 100 basis points on that path now we re saying zero or close to zero steve liesman and that s brought ten year down and real rates and the economy down james bullard absolutely steve liesman let s talk about this jobs number i mean did your eyebrows sort of go up towards the top of your forehead when you saw 260 james bullard it is a good number it sounds like since the first of the year we re about 205 or something on average a little bit lower than last year so this is consistent with the idea that 2018 was going to be faster growth than 2019 i think the news in the last just in the last month the news is that we re not going to get this slowdown to below 2 gdp growth instead we re going to slow down to 2 5 which is you know more moderate type of slowdown in 2019 compared to what people were expecting steve liesman i mean i get that but it looks more like we re closer to 3 i mean we did 3 in the first quarter james bullard and there is upside potential that you could just steve liesman talk about that risk james bullard you could just stay at 3 you have this good productivity number which i love looks like productivity is picking up there could be supply side effects here kicking in possibly because of the tax acts so i think some good things are happening and it could be that you get even higher growth in 2019 than the numbers i just said steve liesman okay we re going get to sara in just a second sara if you would just bear with me if you have a 2 5 forecast with a 3 upside is 2 4 the current funds rate the right rate for that environment and that potential james bullard well i think we re a little tight on the rate not too much but a little bit tight i think the global safe real interest rate short term is about zero and if you steve liesman real rate james bullard real rate steve liesman so explain that to people james bullard the real rate is zero if you add the 2 inflation target to that you get to 2 we re at 240 sounds a little tight to me i don t think it is a something to really worry about but sounds tight and you ve got core pce inflation running at 1 6 it is making me a little nervous i think inflation expectations are a little on the low side steve liesman do you agree with that it is transient james bullard i would like to re center inflation take this opportunity to re center inflation expectations at 2 that would pay handsome dividends for the fed going forward steve liesman we ll come back to transient let s get sara s question in sorry about that sara sara eisen my question is on transient professor bullard steve liesman go ahead james bullard excellent steve liesman thought it might be sara eisen i was wondering what you made of the market reaction to the fed meeting i mean it seemed like there was real disappointment in market positioning around the fact that chairman powell describes inflation as transient or transitory and therefore suggested it is not persistent enough to make a rate cut james bullard yeah i think you know again we have made a big move in monetary policy over the last three or four months and i think it is time to wait and see how that is going to impact the economy going forward it is true that the the core pce numbers have come in a little bit light but of course there is noise in the data as the chair noted and you could look at the dow s fed trimmed mean which is a measure i ve liked in the past that is at 2 so i think this is a point where we probably want to be assessing the data steve liesman so jim if indeed we re going to be running 1 5 core pce which is the better measure you guys think of inflation how tight is the fed here do you think it ought to be cutting rates james bullard well like i say i m not averse to the idea that we should try to re center inflation expectations while the economy is good and make sure that we re centered at 2 they look a little light to me it looks like markets expect you know something below 2 inflation over the next five years and i don t think that s a good place for us to be there will be days in the future where the economy is not performing so well and those expectations will go down even further so i think it is a reasonable option is to try to re center inflation expectations on 2 steve liesman tell us how as a policymaker you react when you hear the president talk about what the federal reserve should be doing with interest rates james bullard well as you know all these discussions are very get very technical very quickly and so i think we have our mandate we re supposed to get full employment we re supposed to hit our inflation target keep inflation low and stable many factors come into that we get advice from all kinds of people including you and including other politicians who the chair goes before the senate banking committee house financial services committee they all comment on monetary policy so we get a lot of input from a lot of different angles we re used to that and we try to make the best decisions we can but we have this mandate we have to come back to that s a law steve liesman alright jim i want to see where your forecasts are here we re at 3 6 now on the unemployment rate how low does it go and at what level does it make you more nervous about the potential for inflation james bullard you know i think we have talked about this before but the empirical philips curve is very very weak in this environment you might be talking about a ratio of 10 to 1 so you need 100 basis points of gap to get ten basis points on inflation and you know what do you think 3 6 is that 100 basis points below the natural rate i don t know a lot of people think not how much inflation are you thinking you re going to get out of the low unemployment rate in this environment steve liesman and then before we go real quick your gdp number for this year james bullard i would be at 2 5 sitting here today steve liesman great jim bullard thanks very much for joining us james bullard alright thanks a lot steve liesman and we ll check back with you at the end of the year james bullard okay first on cnbc cleveland fed president loretta mester on cnbc s the exchange m f 1pm 2pm video steve liesman kelly thanks very much here at the hoover institution annual monetary policy conference it s become quite a deal right practically the whole committee you could take a vote in there on interest rates now if you wanted to loretta mester a lot of people listening to this conference exactly steve liesman loretta thank you for joining us let s talk about the jobs report this morning 260 000 plus jobs created are you ready to go raise rates because the economy s running so hot loretta mester no you know i fully support our patient approach to looking at what the data is telling us as it comes in the job market is strong and today s report just reinforces that we have a strong labor market which is great we have inflation a little bit below our target but stable prices we have productivity growth growing which is a good positive for the economy and growth has came in in the first quarter a little bit stronger than people had anticipated now grant you some of that was inventory building so we ll have to look to see what it implies for the second quarter but growth is good so i think we re in a really good place our interest rate policy i think is exactly appropriate for now and we ll just see how the economy evolves steve liesman 3 6 unemployment do you worry that the employment market s too tight loretta mester no i think we have to take on the ground you know we don t see inflationary pressures building we do see people getting back to work labor force participation is growing over time although it was down a little bit in this last report people are working wages are not accelerating but they re growing so that s a good thing they re growing in line with productivity growth so this is a strong economy these are good numbers steve liesman can you put more detail on that when you say growing in line because the vice chairman clarida said that today as well 3 2 is in line more or less with recent productivity numbers or whatever as long as it s not above the combined productivity and inflation you don t worry that that pushes inflation up higher loretta mester yeah because usually you d see in the longer run that wages are going to be going with productivity growth and inflation as long as it doesn t go above that then there s no real feed through to price inflation steve liesman so i can factor in the future if it s 4 that s still okay as long as it s below those two numbers loretta mester yeah as long as well productivity growth rising is a good thing for the economy right steve liesman did you see the recent decline president mester of the core inflation numbers as being transitory or something to worry about loretta mester so again you don t want to overreact to one report i do think that we have to take seriously our 2 inflation goal and work to try to get inflation back to our goal over time but i also agree that we need to be patient about it and we need to look at the data and underlying data to understand what s going on i would be concerned if inflation and expectations were falling if aggregate demand was falling if the signal of low inflation was that growth was going down but there s no evidence of that the economy s in a really strong place so i m willing to be patient right on the inflation on the down side as well as inflation on the upside steve liesman does patient mean you want to do something eventually do you have an idea of where you d like policy to go would you be loretta mester no i honestly think we re in a good we re well calibrated right now and of course we always have to be forward looking but it s got to be based on where we think the economy is going steve liesman but you would not prefer for example there were some people who had a neutral rate of 3 you would not prefer to get there but you re just patient in getting there loretta mester no because as you know and what clarida talked about today is that those numbers are measured with a lot of confidence bands around them so they re estimates and so you always have to be taking the signals from the market signals from the real economy signals from the price data to calibrate where your policy is we re about at a neutral rate because we can see that in the economy we don t have building pressures inflation we have growth a little bit above trend and that s a good economy to be in steve liesman so that growth above trend is interesting we did 3 last year we did a surprise 3 in first quarter but there s some stuff in there loretta mester right steve liesman what s your best guess for what we do this year loretta mester yeah so i m at a between 2 and 2 5 the first quarter came in a little bit stronger than i thought it was going to so i m probably in the upper part of that range now steve liesman so 2 5 loretta mester yeah probably i would say steve liesman is the risk to the up side or the down side would you say or would you loretta mester i think it s balanced right now i think there s good reason to think that some of the upside if you know some of the uncertainty on trade come offs that would be an upside surprise so you know i m seeing balanced risks out there steve liesman how about the global risks that are out there chairman powell talked on wednesday that some of that has subsided do you have less concern now about what s happening in europe loretta mester i think some of it has subsided we do have more positive numbers out of china brexit was postponed so that was an uncertainty there postponed but again i think we have to watch the data we have to see how it s going in europe there are weaker numbers coming in on certain parts of europe and stronger numbers in other so basically we re in this sort of monitoring the economy now steve liesman president mester thank you for joining me today loretta mester thank you steve liesman kelly back to you where things are remarkably cool here in san francisco dallas federal reserve president robert kaplan on cnbc s closing bell m f 3pm 5pm video steve liesman yeah wilf thanks very much we have enough fomc members here to hold a meeting and raise rates if you wanted to not in the cards robert kaplan not in the cards steve liesman robert kaplan dallas fed president joining us what did you make this morning of this very strong jobs report today robert kaplan consistent with an economy that s i think growing at a solid rate maybe not as well as last year but still solid rate of growth and we expect that to continue into 2019 steve liesman did you were you surprised by the strength of the number robert kaplan i think it s still my view that we re running out of capacity in the workforce we you know we keep saying that the unemployment rate s now 3 6 steve liesman running out of capacity running out of capacity running out of capacity we do 200 200 200 we re not running out of workers at all robert kaplan well we re bringing people in off sidelines but we re starting to approach prime age participation pre crisis we re reaching prerecession lows on discouraged workers in a good way i would expect it s going to slow down but i don t think that would be necessarily a bad sign in that it s just a fact when you ve got this low rate of unemployment but we re going to grow we think at solid rates we would like to see ways to continue to grow the workforce and we may have to start looking at other alternatives and that may be you know transportation issues child care and yes immigration even though it s a sensitive issue steve liesman you don t get worried about inflation when the unemployment rate falls to 3 6 robert kaplan so you know the trimmed mean measure that we use at the dallas fed is hovering around 2 it s not quite as steve liesman hold on because jerome powell made that famous on wednesday talking about the dallas trimmed mean and what you do is you get rid of the all the noise on the top and bottom robert kaplan the outliers steve liesman the outliers and it s not just food or energy could be one thing one month one thing another month robert kaplan it tends to change month to month i like that measure better and i think it s a better indicator steve liesman it s been doing what exactly robert kaplan it ended last year around 2 it slipped a little bit early this year 1 8 1 9 it s now around 2 and so the point is it s not that we don t have any inflation but the reason though and you ve heard me say this before inflation forces i think are going to continue to be muted is technology technology enabled disruption and to some extent globalization businesses have less pricing power today and this comes through in corporate earnings reports it comes through in all my conversations businesses just don t have pricing power to the extent they have wage pressure or cost pressure it s going to come out of margins more likely than being translated to prices steve liesman so at 2 4 are you at a neutral rate do you think right now are you still stimulating the economy with your balance sheet and with the funds rate robert kaplan i mean in my own view yeah at the rate we are 2 25 2 5 we re in the neighborhood of neutral right now and so i think sort of the performance of the economy reinforces to me that we re in the neighborhood of neutral steve liesman how so robert kaplan i think potential growth for the u s economy let s say we get a little improvement in productivity i still think it s around 2 we think we re going to grow around 2 25 and i think all that s consistent with a policy setting that s probably in the neighborhood of neutral steve liesman did somebody sara or wilf have a question i thought i heard something sara eisen i can ask a question steve thank you president kaplan good to see you steve liesman go ahead sara i had something in my ear i wasn t sure what it was sara eisen probably a producer president kaplan when you see jobs numbers like today and when you talk about a pretty decent outlook for the economy see us outgrowing the world how much do you think it is the tax cuts that we saw adding sort of an extra jolt of stimulus this late in the recovery robert kaplan so our own view in our work at the dallas fed is there were three elements of the fiscal stimulus one of them was an individual tax cut one of them was a big spending bill and then the third was corporate tax reform and i would say at this point we think those first two items are waning but the corporate tax reform probably we think will have some sustainable positive impact and i think that s likely to help here wilfred frost president kaplan sara said it in her question the u s is outgrowing the rest of the world the developed world at least how concerned are you about a prolonged or further strengthening u s dollar and what that might do to growth prospects in the 18 months ahead or so robert kaplan so it s listen i ve learned from 30 years in the markets it s hard to forecast what the currency s going to do i do worry though on your point i worry that weak growth outside the united states particularly in europe we re not immune to it and some of that is spilling over and particularly that s the case because you know almost 50 of s p 500 earnings and profits come from outside the united states so i think that s a bigger issue that i think will have some muting effect on gdp growth here steve liesman let me follow up on wilf s question what other things concern you corporate leverage inside the united states it doesn t seem like at this conference which i ve been to now for five or six years there s a pressing issue on the table of something that must be done or addressed right now robert kaplan so to me the big issues are it s still the case our workforce is ageing and workforce growth is slowing and we still think that s going to be an issue to deal with for the next number of years we re getting a good bout of pulling people back into the workforce we ve still got an aging issue and also our skills of our labor force math science and reading are lagging we re not investing enough in our human capital skills training and education and then our third thing you ve heard me talk about corporate debt corporate debt is at record levels triple b debt has tripled over the last ten years leverage loans have doubled and i think in a downturn if we slow more that could be a bit of an amplifier to the slowdown and so i still i think it s worth continuing to talk about that steve liesman president kaplan vice president mike pence this morning on our air questioned whether the fed ought to be following the dual mandate and said maybe it should just be following inflation what do you make of that robert kaplan yeah my own view and i was a market participant for a long time and now i ve been on the fed close to four years there are periods in our history where we re very glad we ve got a dual mandate where we worry about employment and inflation there are periods where it seems like because right now we re at near or past full employment we worry a bit more about inflation i think the key is our framework needs to stand the test of time it can t be the framework that s right for the next six months or the next 18 months it has to be a framework that works for the foreseeable future on a sustainable basis so i m glad for one that we ve got a dual mandate steve liesman so texas doesn t have its own district for nothing it s a major major i mean as a country it would be a stand alone country with a major economy two issues are huge in texas right now that are huge for the u s economy immigration and trade if i could put those as one and oil and gas is what s happening at the border now hurting the texas economy is it helping the texas economy robert kaplan the issue at the border because it hasn t been that widely reported the migrant issue is a very real issue and i was just down at the border last week in that we have a record number of migrants moving up from central america what border patrol is doing is diverting personnel to deal with that and so a lot of the commercial traffic we re hearing from businesses is being impeded so for example the average number of trucks across the el paso border our contacts tell us is 3 000 a day commercially it s down to 1 500 this is affecting logistics and supply chains not just in texas and the southwest but also in the midwest the issue is does it go on right now it s not gone on for long enough to have a material impact on texas steve liesman it could robert kaplan it could and it s something we re watching steve liesman let s leave it there president kaplan and we ll come back and ask you about the energy and oil and gas business next time robert kaplan thanks steve steve liesman dallas fed president from the hoover institution monetary policy conference in stanford for more information contact jennifer

the may fomc meeting is over they say every cloud has a silver lining the may fomc statement didn t bring much of a surprise fed chair powell remained upbeat in his assessment of the u s economy while dismissing low inflation as transitory gold has initially jumped only to keep declining later what has actually happened yesterday then fomc statement acknowledges lower inflation yesterday the fomc published the monetary policy statement from its latest meeting that took place on april 30 may 1 in line with expectations the us central bank unanimously kept its policy rate unchanged as previously the inaction reflected the new patient approach adopted by the fed in january so the federal funds rate remained at the target range of 2 25 to 2 50 percent consistent with its statutory mandate the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability in support of these goals the committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2 1 4 to 2 1 2 percent did we get anything new first of all not all interest rates were unchanged the fed set the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances at 2 35 percent or 15 basis points below the top of the target range for the federal funds rate officially the third cut by 5 basis points was intended to foster trading in the federal funds market at rates well within the target range however some analysts argue that the move was a direct response to the relatively increasing scarcity of reserves amid the quantitative tightening second the us central bank acknowledged the recent drop in both overall and core inflation below 2 percent indeed the chart below shows that both the pcepi and its core version are now around 1 5 percent chart 1 personal consumption expenditures price index green line in and personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy red line in in march the statement still saw the core inflation near the target but this time the fomc changed its tone on a 12 month basis overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have declined and are running below 2 percent the modification can be seen as just reflection of the current data but it is a dovish change which suggests that the fed s patience may last a while longer weaker inflation is not good for gold which is considered to be an inflation hedge but a passive us central bank should support it on the other hand the fed characterized economic growth and job gains as solid an upward revision compared to march meeting apart from these changes the policy statement was virtually kept the same as it was in march the fed is still reluctant to signal the next move or the direction despite that the financial markets projecting an interest rate cut so the statement should not significantly affect the gold market mr powell spoils the party let s now move to mr powell s press conference his introductory remarks were less dovish than the statement itself first mr powell admitted that risks to the outlook have eased as we have expected them to at the start of the year a number of cross currents presented risks to the outlook including weak global growth particularly in china and europe the possibility of a disruptive brexit and uncertainty around unresolved trade negotiations while concerns remain in all of these areas it appears that risks have moderated somewhat global financial conditions have eased supported in many places around the world by an accommodative shift in monetary policy and in some cases fiscal policy recent data from china and europe show some improvement and the prospect of a disorderly brexit has been pushed off for now further there are reports of progress in the trade talks between the united states and china this is another hint that the current inaction is not a change in the stance but a pause in the unfinished tightening cycle the implications of diminished risks would not help safe haven assets such as gold second mr powell said that muted inflationary pressure might be temporary which make the interest rate cut even less probable we suspect that some transitory factors may be at work thus our baseline view remains that with a strong job market and continued growth inflation will return to 2 percent over time and then be roughly symmetric around our longer term objective indeed mr powell admitted that the fomc doesn t see a strong case for a rate move in either direction implication for gold the statement was little changed however the wording seems dovish this is why gold pumped initially but powell sounded more hawkish during the press conference and more hawkish than expected so the price of the yellow metal dropped eventually as the chart below shows chart 2 gold prices from april 30 to may 2 2019 this is because mr powell sounded optimistic on the economy and dismissed concerns about low inflation saying that this is a transitory development and he dashed hopes of a near term rate cut saying that the us central bank does not see a strong case for a rate move either way so investors adjusted their expectations the market odds of the interest rate cut by december 2019 declined from above 60 to around 50 percent this is exactly what we expected and we warned investors that the markets seem to be too pessimistic in the gold news monitor published on april 11 we wrote that there is little in the minutes that warrants a rate cut by december if the market expectations adjust gold may struggle we reiterated our view on april 23 the fomc may pause for a few months but given the strong labor market and frothy valuations of certain assets it shouldn t cut interest rates such a move would unsettle markets which closely follow how the fed sees the economy while leaving the us central bank with less ammunition when the next economic crisis hits the economy therefore when we get more positive economic reports the market participants could change their views this is bad news for the gold bulls as the revised expectations of the future path of the federal funds rate would make gold struggle and this is what is happening gold struggled yesterday looking at the fundamentals only a downward move shouldn t surprise us given the current level of market expectations especially if the upcoming data paints an upbeat picture of the economy you have

revenue in cra s history not only this q1 build on the highest annual revenue of 2018 but it is a continuation of the strength and consistency demonstrated over the past five years advertisement advertisement q1 s year over year growth rate of 6 4 is consistent with our long term growth targets and the continuation of our strong revenue performance we completed the first quarter of fiscal 2019 with strong performance across our portfolio of practices once again demonstrating the continued dedication and hard work of our entire team we delivered 75 companywide utilization while headcount increased by 6 2 translating into 7 9 year over year revenue growth on a constant currency basis on the bottom line we delivered non gaap net income of 4 5 million or 0 54 per diluted share these results were negatively affected by a foreign currency loss which reduced our non gaap net income and earnings per diluted share by approximately 600 000 and 0 07 respectively chad will discuss this in greater detail in a few minutes looking more closely at the first quarter we exhibited strength across our geographic footprint our north american operations grew 6 and european operations led by the antitrust competition economics practice grew 7 9 year over year we continued to enjoy broad based contributions across our service portfolio with particularly strong performance in our auctions and competitive bidding finance financial economics forensic services intellectual property and life sciences practices as these results demonstrate we continue to see strong demand for our services first quarter lead flow and new project originations were up more than 5 and 10 respectively year over year in fact the past six months represents the strongest such period of activity in cra s history while the timing and size of these new projects cannot be determined in advance cra s business fundamental and strategy position the firm for continued success within legal and regulatory our forensic services practice was certified under international organization for standardization for information security management earlier in q1 to our knowledge cra is the first forensic services

was appointed by the u s advertisement advertisement department of health and human services for specific right to serve as an independent monitor for one of the nation s largest nonprofit healthcare

market manipulation brought by government agencies and civil plaintiffs cra clients in these matter include corporations financial institutions and traders our intellectual property practice continues

dairy trade which surpassed 24 billion in dairy products transacted on the platform since its inception among other services it provides the practice also designs and manages auction and rfp processes

healthcare market and now i ll turn the call over to chad for a few additional comments chad holmes chief financial officer thanks paul as a reminder more expansive commentary on our financial results is available on the investor relations section of our website under prepared cfo remarks before we get to your questions let me provide a few additional metrics related to our performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 in terms of headcount we ended the quarter with 687 consulting staff which consisted of 123 officers 387 other senior staff and 177 junior staff advertisement advertisement this is a net increase of 40 consultants or 6 2 growth compared with 647 total headcount we reported at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2018 non gaap selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue excluding the 3 2 attributable to commissions to nonemployee experts was 18 3 for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with 18 2 a year ago as paul mentioned we incurred approximately 750 000 foreign currency loss in the first quarter resulting from the revaluation and realized gains and losses on working capital balances these losses are included in interest and other expense on our consolidated statement of operations and arose mainly from fluctuations in the euro and pound exchange rates which were affected by the ongoing political uncertainty surrounding brexit the effective tax rate for the first quarter on a non gaap basis was 23 4 compared with 17 4 on a non gaap basis for the first quarter of 2018 the higher rate in the first quarter of 2019 was primarily attributable to a smaller benefit arising from the accounting for stock based compensation in the current quarter relative to last year turning to the balance sheet dso at the end of the first quarter was 111 days compared with 104 days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 dso in the first quarter consisted of 72 days of billed and 39 days of unbilled compared with 74 days of billed and 30 days of unbilled in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 we concluded the first quarter of fiscal 2019 with 15 million in cash and cash equivalents with the majority residing internationally as a result in the first quarter we borrowed on our line of credit in the amount of 39 million the first quarter is typically a period of lower cash levels as it coincides with the timing of a significant portion of our annual bonus outlays turning to our capital allocation strategy we remain committed to maximizing long term value per share by reinvesting in the business and returning capital through both share repurchases and quarterly dividends during the first quarter of 2019 we returned 6 million of capital to our shareholders consisting of 1 7 million of dividend payments and 4 3 million for share repurchases of approximately 87 000 shares at an average price of 50 25 finally we announced earlier today that our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0 20 per common share payable on june 14 2019 to shareholders of record as of may 28 2019 advertisement advertisement that concludes my prepared remarks rob we would now like to open up the call for questions questions answers operator our first question comes from tim mchugh with william blair tim mchugh william blair analyst paul i wonder if you could just elaborate on i think you made the comment that last six months are kind of the best new business period i guess one is that on an absolute basis or i guess i m trying to think of a growth rate i guess because you obviously have been growing so i guess the bigger you get each new period should be the biggest and then trying to translate you not to give us the numbers about the kind of 5 to 10 growth in the lead flow in new projects advertisement advertisement how those growth rate of 5 to 10 compare to what you ve been seeing one year ago or two years ago in terms of just the growth rate not the absolute level paul maleh president and chief executive officer sure tim i m not trying to be nice to you in any way tim but that s a good question with it so i think the foundation of the question is that cra has been achieving all time highs basically on a quarterly basis so 2018 was the best year this firm has ever experienced and q1 has been more of the same so from that perspective i guess it shouldn t be a surprise that the lead flow both in project leads and new project originations were also at all time highs as those tend to be precursors to the actual revenue so my comment is that these last six months on an aggregate basis are higher than any other past six months we have achieved on both lead flow and new project originations so i wasn t just making a year over year comparison but more of an absolute statement with respect to what that entails for future revenue typically lead flow and new project originations are correlated and oftentimes strongly correlated with future revenue advertisement advertisement the difficulty there tim is it s hard for me and hard for the firm to exactly know the timing of that new revenue but if we see lead flow continue at the rates we re observing now you should again see a high correlation between the rates of change of those and our rate of change of revenue all things being equal there tim mchugh william blair analyst ok and then i guess maybe just to ask on cash flow i guess i understand that this is obviously a seasonally weak period i guess but if i look at a trailing 12 month free cash flow number or even kind of trailing 24 month it s a little lower than i thought is there anything happening and i missed the dso number you gave chad but i guess just as we think about cash conversion is there anything happening as we think about that going forward here that we need to be aware of i guess chad holmes chief financial officer sure when i think about the cash generating capacity of the business although we start with ebitda i will look at the forgivable loan issuances and expense that occurred during a quarter and if you actually look at these two measures and compare them to year ago measures we re actually generating more cash flow in q1 of 19 than we were in q1 of 18 so there s nothing systemic happening within the firm to say that it is less profitable relative to the same time a year ago our dsos are a little higher than we would like around at 111 we need to get busy on that our goal is still to try to have dsos under 100 days so there ll be some additional cash generation from those collections but we really haven t seen any kind of market shift in the profit generating capacity of this firm tim mchugh william blair analyst and then last question just is bit of a high level question always but it s relevant i think in this type of economy which is the competition for talent and i guess both junior talent but i guess the cost necessary to recruit senior talent out of competitors in terms of the transfer kind of market if you will chad holmes chief financial officer yes i think cra has and continues to be an attractive destination for top talent the one thing is with the recruitment of top talent from competitors often times it does require a capital payment for those individuals and it also requires a little bit of patience as they transition and ramp to more of their historical levels so when we recruit top talent is always with that value lens on how we do it and i think we ve done a pretty good job history shows of generating a positive value on these recruitment efforts and that s what we re striving to do with every hire operator our next question comes from marc riddick with sidoti marc riddick sidoti and company analyst wanted to touch on the new hires a little bit it seems as though the concentration over the last few quarters has been in the senior levels and i was wondering if you could shed a little light on that it certainly seems as though the opportunities out in front of you and the lead flow would talk to that but i was wondering if you could shed a little light on maybe some areas of if there was any particular of focus within the new senior hires and what we might be looking at as far as potential headcount changes over the next couple of quarters paul maleh president and chief executive officer sure thanks marc with respect to the new senior hires the one thing i think this firm has done really well for the last number of years has been able to grow the top line and also grow profits at a commensurate rate but as i commented to tim oftentimes senior hires require a little bit of an upfront capital investment in which we ll take multiple periods to recoup so you always need to keep that in mind the activity during q1 is no different than the activity that we ve done in prior quarters and years on that so it will be active we try to manage the hiring of consulting staff to not get too far ahead of demand so i think if you also have gone back through our history and quite frankly q1 of 2019 is no different you ll see revenue growth rates to be roughly commensurate with that headcount growth rates and you see that consistency again in this quarter so you should expect to see headcount growth at or slightly above the revenue guidance we have provided for 2019 if we see revenue materialize little more quickly we will be more active in the secondary market marc riddick sidoti and company analyst ok great that s very helpful and then wanted to switch gears on the growth you re seeing in actually instead of going in that direction i was wondering if you could sort of give an update we talked in the past about a potential acquisition to what the pipeline and valuations look like i was wondering if you could touch on that and maybe what you re seeing there if they happen to be any more attractive looking internationally than they are here in the states paul maleh president and chief executive officer i see no real difference in the level of attractiveness of recruiting opportunities whether they re individual group hires or acquisitions between here domestically and internationally so a lot of the hiring that has been done particularly over the last 12 months have been focused on in the u s but that by no means says that we don t have an active pipeline internationally with that so i m really happy with our portfolio the consistency of this portfolio in terms of the growth the profit contributions as quite frankly i know i m biased has been quite remarkable over the past five years so i am willing to invest in each of our practices and each of our geographies they have demonstrated the ability to create value for our shareholders and thus warrant investments as opportunities arise marc riddick sidoti and company analyst and then one other things that you and thanks for giving us much detail as you did as to some of the practice areas and what you re seeing there i was wondering if you could are there a couple practice areas that may be we don t talk about as much publicly that that you think of growing opportunities that might be bigger contributors that they re kind of on the horizon but maybe you re kind of under the radar that that would be good to call attention to paul maleh president and chief executive officer what i m really excited about q1 of 2019 is you ve heard us highlight some practices that may be have been unable to push themselves to the top given the exemplary performance of some of our main state practices so you heard me talk about my our intellectual property practice you heard me talk about our auctions and competitive bidding practice and that s really you require that kind of broad based contribution to achieve the consistency that we ve done practices like our life sciences practice our forensic services practice have enjoyed our energy practice have enjoyed really exceptional growth over the past number of years and we are trying to be as creative as possible to try to continue to fund of those leaders in their pursuit for providing even broader client services marc riddick sidoti and company analyst ok then last one for me i was wondering if you re see any are there ongoing lingering effects of the government shutdown from earlier this year and any of the practices that are still going or are we pretty much completely past that at this point paul maleh president and chief executive officer i don t know whether i would say there are any ongoing lingering effects you clearly saw a little bit of softness in the month of january of this calendar year now i just put an asterisk on that because january is typically a slower month in our calendar year as people like that the holidays and get ramped up again so january was a little softer but i m pretty pleased with the way the company is performing exiting that month and i don t see any lingering weaknesses there in terms of our demand profile operator at this time we ve reached the end of the question and answer session i would now like to turn the conference back over to mr maleh for any closing or additional remarks paul maleh president and chief executive officer again thanks to everyone for joining us today before we conclude i want to pause for a moment to reflect on the passage of someone very special to this organization earlier this week frank fisher passed away at the age of 84 frank was a towering force in the field of antitrust economics microeconomics and industrial organization and his accomplishments are many he received a phd in economics from harvard in 1960 and embarked on a teaching career at mit influencing generations of students he received many accolades and awards including the 1973 john bates clark medal cra was fortunate to have frank as a colleague since 1967 frank served as a senior consultant and member of our board for 40 years including a 10 year as chairman and vice chairman frank has left an indelible mark on cra with his intellect his collegiality and compassion and we will miss him dearly we appreciate your time and interest in cra we ll be meeting with investors in the coming months and we look forward to updating you on our progress on our second quarter call this concludes today s call thank you everyone operator duration 33 minutes

in a move that is becoming common in economically stressed nations crypto activity is booming in brazil and argentina as high inflation and general financial malaise is driving more people to invest in blockchain assets both states have long been among south america s leaders in cryptocurrency adoption which is gaining the attention of their politicians and central banks the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies is clearly putting these nations at a crossroads as leaders are increasingly confronted with the need to address the use and legality of this new asset class brazil has seen record high bitcoin trade volumes throughout april with numbers averaging well over 100 000 btc per day and growing the nation s renewed interest in cryptocurrency coincides with a growing inflation rate which is well over four percent for the year this issue is compounded by a downgrade of brazil s projected 2019 economic growth which according to its central bank is now expected to be a mere 1 71 percent argentina is in substantially worse economic shape with an inflation rate expected to hit 34 percent this year down from almost fifty percent in 2018 the nation has to put it mildly a long history of economic incompetence by its leaders making the increasing popularity of blockchain assets no surprise argentinian exchanges have been reporting record volumes for several months which directly coincides with the collapsing value of the peso unlike other states with struggling economies leaders in these two nations appear to be somewhat receptive to cryptocurrencies as legitimate assets for example brazil s new president jail bolsonaro has spoken positively of blockchain technology he recently appointed roberto campos neto a prominent economist to chair the central bank campos neto has signaled that he is receptive to blockchain and digital assets noting that he has studied them and he plans to prepare the bank for the future market the central bank is already developing a blockchain platform to transfer data within the departments of the brazilian government likewise a number of argentinian leaders are also giving pro crypto signals the nation s deputy minister of finance felix martin soto has made a number of statements praising the potential of cryptocurrency to stabilize the nation s economy and increase foreign investment also crypto entrepreneur tim draper claims to have had a conversation with president mauricio macri over bitcoin s potential as a legal currency bitcoin can already be used by argentinians to pay for public transportation in thirty seven cities and it is quite commonly accepted by businesses across the country the popularity of cryptocurrency during financial downturns is a well established pattern that is now clearly visible in south america s two largest economies this phenomenon demonstrates the potential for blockchain assets to protect wealth and as the blockchain revolution moves forward will no doubt be considered when leaders make significant fiscal decisions in the case of brazil and argentina the growing popularity of crypto during these difficult times is serving to push an even greater awareness of its benefits featured image via bigstock

measures to the most comparable gaap measures can be found in our earnings release at this point i ll turn the call over to eric fuller advertisement advertisement eric fuller president and chief executive officer thank you brian and good afternoon everyone i d like to start by reviewing our first quarter results and the progress that we have achieved executing upon our strategic initiatives and then conclude with a review of our market outlook eric peterson will then discuss our first quarter financial results in more detail before opening the call for questions i am pleased with our team s execution to the first quarter given the more challenging market backdrop that we encountered as we managed through the closure of our mexico joint venture and encountered weather disruptions despite these challenges we delivered a 95 7 adjusted operating ratio for the 2019 first quarter which is a 40 basis point improvement from the year ago quarter and our seventh consecutive quarter of or improvement our results clearly demonstrate the continued successful implementation of our strategic initiatives as we strive to transform our operations and improve our profitability while we have achieved a great deal over the last several years we have much more to accomplish in order to realize our goal turning to our segment level highlights in our over the road division average revenue per tractor per week declined 6 1 compared with the first quarter of 2018 this was a result of a 6 7 decrease in average revenue miles per tractor per week partially offset by 0 7 increase in our average revenue per mile the impact on average revenue per tractor per week resulted from unfavorable weather conditions the transition out of the companies us mexico cross border operations and the less favorable freight environment typically about 80 of our over the road division s volume is contracted and approximately 20 is noncontracted advertisement advertisement in the first quarter we experienced an 8 increase in our contract rates while noncontracted spot rates declined more than 20 turning to our dedicated division the average revenue per tractor per week excluding fuel surcharges increased to 11 8 in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the year ago quarter the increase was primarily the result of a 7 1 rise in the division s revenue per mile in addition to a 4 4 increase in the division s revenue miles per tractor per week the increase in utilization was largely the result of our initiative designed to grow our business with those accounts that offer a more attractive combination of rate and utilization while reducing our business with accounts that have a less attractive blend we implemented this initiative through 2018 and i am very pleased with the improved execution in the dedicated division over the last two quarters brokerage segment revenue decreased to 46 2 million in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to 54 5 million in the first quarter of 2018 on fewer loads and decreased revenues per loads the revenue decrease was more than offset by a higher gross margin as transportation cost per load decreased significantly due to sourcing third party capacity more efficiently as a result operating income increased 18 9 to 2 8 million in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the year ago quarter importantly the brokerage segment continues to provide additional selectively for our assets to optimize yield while at the same time offering more capacity solutions to our customers i would now like to spend a few minutes reviewing our strategic initiatives designed to deliver improved profitability and the priorities that we have for the year ahead as we ve discussed on previous calls our management team has been driving a complete overhaul to company strategy and operations in order to improve our execution and profitability we have created an execution oriented structure whereby we now manage the business by core metrics with the focus on rate truck count utilization and cost we ve also designed and implemented initiatives to improve these core metrics and ultimately our operating ratio where we strive to meaningfully improve our profitability as part of our transformation we have improved our asset optimization through a redesigned fleet renewal and maintenance program optimized our asset utilization through the use of proprietary optimization software and implemented our load planning initiative in our over the road initiative designed to improve utilization advertisement advertisement the successful implementation of these initiatives have contributed to the significant margin expansion that we have achieved over the last three years another key focus for our initiatives is to improve the quality of life for our drivers as we reduced the day to day challenges and frustrations that they encounter our drivers are critical to our success and are our greatest asset as a result we have launched a series of initiatives designed to position u s xpress as the company of choice for drivers in the industry one such initiative was the launch of our new driver development program and the opening of our redesigned development center in tunnel hill georgia this past february the newly launched program was created with input from our drivers and provides continuous learning opportunities for both new and experienced drivers the multi platform program features in person development sessions a hands on commercial motor vehicle learning lab where drivers inspect and identify faulty equipment a competency aligned simulator program a driving range where drivers can practice complicated maneuvers over a 150 e learning modules and eld practices and device training our goal is to provide our drivers with the knowledge skills and abilities necessary for successful driving career moving to the balance of 2019 our priority continues to be on improving the lifestyle and satisfaction of our drivers as well as our operations as we focus on technology including digital load matching automated load acceptance and prioritization and working toward our ultimate growth of the frictionless order when you analyze the process from order to cash what you find is that there are many gates in that process where manual decisions are made these manual decision points open the door to less than optimal decisions along with the potential for errors given that data entry is often required as we remove more the friction that exists those errors which frustrate our drivers will be reduced and our driver satisfaction will improve our goal over time is to have a frictionless order which we believe will not only improve driver retention but also reduce costs and optimize freight planning not to mention improved capacity as you can see utilizing technology to improve our operations represents a significant opportunity for u s xpress advertisement advertisement as the trucking industry continues to rapidly evolve u s xpress will be at the forefront and we re very excited to have cameron ramsdell join our team as president of our newly formed unit u s xpress ventures as we announced last week u s xpress is internal business unit focused on developing and implementing new asset based business models and technology strategies turning to the market and our outlook the second quarter freight environment remains subdued relative to normal seasonality and in comparison to the strongest market in 20 years which we experienced in the second quarter of 2018 while we expect ongoing improvements in network efficiency from the exit of our mexico business and then operating efficiencies from our strategic initiatives the changing market conditions since our fourth quarter call has changed our expectations on second quarter earnings while we continue to expect our initiatives and an improving market backdrop to allow us to improve our adjusted operating ratio on a sequential basis we now expect our second quarter adjusted operating ratio to deteriorate as compared to the year ago comparable quarter importantly we believe the operating improvements implemented over the past several years has positioned the company to better manage market fluctuations such as those that we are now experiencing as we look forward our current guidance of delivering a 93 adjusted operating ratio for the full year 2019 remains achievable though it is dependent on market conditions strengthening through the balance of the second quarter as a result we plan to update our full year adjusted operating ratio guidance when we have better visibility on the freight market and our full year results despite the more challenging freight market we have contractually agreed to rate renewals for approximately 40 of our anticipated truckload revenue for 2019 with an average rate increase of approximately 5 since november while current rate increases have moderated slightly we believe full year contract rates will increase in the mid single digit range i would now like to turn the call over to eric peterson for a review of our financial results advertisement advertisement eric peterson chief financial officer thank you eric and good afternoon as eric discussed we are pleased with the continued successful execution of our strategic initiatives which enabled our team to manage through a more challenging market backdrop we offset more challenging market conditions through leveraging our fleet and our brokerage operations and taking advantage of our enhanced dedicated business mix achieved during 2018 in addition we believe we are well positioned to continue to execute on our current initiatives to drive continued operating ratio improvement i m going to spend a few minutes summarizing our results for the quarter and we ll focus on the core metrics we use to evaluate and monitor our progress operating revenue was 415 4 million a decrease of 10 3 million compared to the first quarter of 2018 excluding revenue from our mexico operations which were discontinued in january 2019 operating revenue increased 2 9 million excluding fuel surcharge the increase was attributable to a 3 8 increase in revenue per mile mostly offset by decreases of 8 3 million in brokerage revenue operating income for the first quarter of 2019 was 12 5 million compared to the 14 9 million achieved in the prior year quarter excluding 3 4 million in costs related to the exit of our mexico operations our adjusted operating income for the first quarter of 2019 was 15 9 million which compares to 14 9 million in the first quarter of 2018 as eric discussed we delivered a 95 7 adjusted operating ratio for the 2019 first quarter which is the 40 basis points improvement from the year ago quarter additionally our adjusted operating ratio improved by 260 basis points to an adjusted operating ratio of 93 9 from 96 5 for the trailing four quarters ending march 31 2019 and 2018 respectively advertisement advertisement net income for the first quarter of 2019 was 4 7 million compared to 1 2 million in the prior year quarter adjusted net income for the first quarter was 7 3 million and compares favorably to 1 2 million in the prior year quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share were 0 15 for the first quarter of 2019 as we discussed our fourth quarter call the exit of our fixed cost investment and our cross border us mexico operations was expected to be a drag on our first half results as revenues would declined more rapidly than expenses which we experienced in the first quarter looking forward we expect the headwind to persist into the second quarter though at a reduced level before turning neutral in the third quarter thereafter we expect to build an annualized operating income benefit importantly we ll offer customers both additional capacity within our core u s lanes and continued access to cross border coverage through an asset light alternative our effective tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 27 5 and we continue to anticipate our full year 2019 effective tax rate to be between 27 to 29 that we outlined on the fourth quarter 2018 call for the full year 2019 we continue to expect our cash tax rate to be in the low single digits turning to our fleet we continue to manage our tractors to a 475 000 mile replacement cycle and we are converting a portion of our leased tractors to owned and we ll spend approximately 170 million to 190 million in net capex through 2019 to execute that strategy with approximately 45 million of the total related to replacing leased equipment with owned as a reminder when thinking of free cash flow a normalized net capex figure over a four year period is approximately 115 million annually and we expect our net capex to revert to more normalized levels in 2020 and 2021 during the first quarter of 2019 the company adopted new asc topic 842 leases the new standard requires us to recognize right of use assets and a comparable amount of lease liabilities arising from operating leases on the balance sheet this resulted from in approximately 187 million of assets and a comparable amount of liabilities being recognized on the balance sheet at march 31 2019 rent associated with these operating leases was approximately 20 million for the first quarter of 2019 and is reflected under vehicle rent and general and other expenses in our income statement for the 2019 quarter advertisement advertisement the impact on stockholders equity was immaterial and the impact on covenant compliance under our credit facility is also immaterial capital leases will continue to be recognized on the balance sheet but are now referred as finance leases as required by the new standard in regards to leverage we ended the first quarter with 407 1 million of net debt and had 120 4 million of cash in availability under our revolving credit facility interest expense for the first quarter was 5 6 million and we continue to expect interest expense to be approximately 22 0 million for the full year of 2019 looking for the remainder of the year we continue to have opportunities for improvement as our existing driver centric initiatives mature and as a focus on operational execution with that i d like to turn the call back to eric fuller for concluding remarks eric fuller president and chief executive officer thank you eric in summary we are pleased with the progress that we have achieved executing upon our strategic initiatives enabling us to achieve our seventh consecutive quarter of adjusted operating ratio improvement in the first quarter and the highest earnings of any first quarter in our company s history as we ve discussed the outlook for the second quarter remains challenged in comparison to an exceptionally strong 2018 comparable quarter that said we continue to have much opportunity and remain well positioned to capitalize on our numerous initiatives aimed at driving operational efficiencies as we work toward our goal of achieving a 100 frictionless order which will improve the lives and daily routines of our drivers not to mention reduce costs and expand our capacity as we focus on managing the core metrics within our business we remain committed to our goal of improving our operations in solidifying u s xpress as a leader within the industry we look forward to updating everyone on our progress on our second quarter call thank you again for your time today operator please open the call for questions questions answers operator our first question here is from ravi shanker from morgan stanley please go ahead ravi shanker morgan stanley analyst thanks good evening guys so on the or target for the year obviously it s understandable it s going to be dependent on market conditions but part of the story here also was you guys undertaking a number of cost initiatives to close the gap to peers and so maybe that or improvement was not as market depend on some of your peers so can you help us understand that how much tailwind or opportunity there is in the cost side this year and kind of if that s tracking consistent with your initial expectations behind the ipo eric fuller president and chief executive officer yes so this is eric fuller so we had obviously we have focused around a couple of the big factors and driver turnover being one of them that is an area where we still believe we re going to continue to get traction through the year our big focus the big initiative that we have in our operation is around what we re calling the frictionless order and we believe that s going to greatly improve our driver retention so we think we can drive a good bit of cost in that area over probably the next say four quarters we also still believe that we re going to get improvement in the insurance line item insurance is the area where we continue to see higher than what we had expected or what we d hoped for but with the forward looking event recorders we re putting a new program around driver training we re trying to move more toward all of our drivers going to hair follicle testing we believe that we will start to see some significant results in that area as well so those really are our two biggest cost items that we think we can see some improvement over the next couple of quarters ravi shanker morgan stanley analyst ok got it and just on the pricing side i think your mid single digit pricing expectations sounds pretty good and may be ahead of some of your peers what gives you confidence that you should be able to kind of sustain that rate going into the back half of the year when maybe you could see some more pricing pressure if current trends continue eric fuller president and chief executive officer sure yes i think we can we will continue to see a little bit of pressure from where we re at today but we re still having constructive conversations with customers in a positive manner in relation to rate increases for this year so we feel confident that where the market is where we believe the market is going and we will continue to be able to get decent rate increases on a go forward basis that will still put us in that mid single digit range ravi shanker morgan stanley analyst great and if i can just squeeze one more in can i just ask you what u s x ventures sounds pretty interesting can you just give us maybe two or three top priorities for that venture and kind of does that involve m a is this homegrown kind of what do expect to see there and maybe some timing on some of the new initiatives eric fuller president and chief executive officer sure i think it s really an exploration about what technology can do for us going forward if you look at all the money that s getting thrown in to venture capital all the investments out there we believe that technology is going to be a big driver of asset based trucking companies going forward i think it s going to be an improvement to the overall operations and profitability we also think that there s going to be some maybe not on the asset side exactly but there s going to be some new entrants and some new things that we re going to have to face that maybe we have faced in the past and we think applying technology to those problems is going to be key to having a lot of them and so we re going to be exploring exactly what that means i think today i would tell you that we are in an infancy stage but we will be looking at opportunities whether it be an m a type opportunities or whether it be looking at some homegrown opportunities to further make better business model type changes in our existing business or potentially new businesses as we explore what technology can do for us and we just think there s a lot of exciting things going on in the market and we think that we can capitalize if we put a focus on it ravi shanker morgan stanley analyst great thank you eric fuller president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question is from brad delco from stephens please go ahead brad delco stephens inc analyst hey good afternoon guys eric i think you kind of touched on this in your comments but can you sort of help us reconcile the revenue per loaded mile being up 60 basis points versus kind of your comments about mid single digits i mean is it just because you have 20 exposure of a spot i mean why wouldn t we be reducing that and trying to get more trucks into a committed or contractual basis or maybe even in more dedicated eric fuller president and chief executive officer yes so it is in it is because of the spot concentration so absolutely we are looking at probably more dedicated the market is probably a little tougher from bringing on new opportunities the one thing that we have that s been a little bit of a headwind for us is that move out of mexico where we ve had additional capacity that we ve had to try to fill so we ve had to go to customers and find new opportunities and so i think that for us to move some trucks out of these spot environment we re going to have to probably go to dedicated but we re doing that and we are seeing some a little bit of growth in our dedicated area and so i think that over time we ll continue to migrate more into that dedicated arena i think personally i think that where we re at from our spot exposure though is still decent level of spot exposure and when you look at a long term on a long term basis so while it is kind of affecting us today i think long term we re in the right position brad delco stephens inc analyst ok and then when we think about sort of weather impacting results would that have would you have visibility to know if that impacted your otr business or dedicated business more and any comments would be helpful there eric fuller president and chief executive officer so dedicated we had a big concentration in the northeast and so obviously any time you ve got any kind of weather issues winter weather issues you end up being pretty impacted in those areas so i would say it s probably a fair mix but with our concentration of dedicated in the northeast we definitely saw a fairly large impact from that business the over the road piece was typically because the trucks aren t as concentrated you do end up having trucks probably down for a little bit longer so when you re ending up having a maintenance related issue as it relates to weather that s probably a little bit more impactful in the over the road division but i would say that both areas were impacted by the weather brad delco stephens inc analyst ok and then maybe last one i appreciate the comments about second quarter and not seeing or improvement on a year over year basis what is maybe this is for eric peterson what s really happening on the cost side that gives you that much visibility i mean i feel like it s pretty early into 2q and june s probably the most important month but is there anything specific that s occurred in april whether a bad accident or something that maybe gives you less confidence in being able to improve margins in this environment eric peterson chief financial officer brad i think the biggest thing right now is our visibility where we stand today on may 2 as it relates to the quarter from an overall volume standpoint the freight is a little bit weaker than we would like and as we get into spring shipping we would have liked to seen a little bit of a more robust environment than we re seeing today so that leads us to believe where we stand today that may be the quarter could be a little weaker than we expected now obviously your quarter s made in may and june and so things could change but we felt like it was prudent to go ahead and get that out there we re not seeing any kind of cost issues as it relates to this quarter that have us concerned at this point brad delco stephens inc analyst ok all right guys i ll get back in queue thanks for the time eric fuller president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question is from scott group of wolfe research please go ahead scott group wolfe research analyst hey thanks afternoon guys eric fuller president and chief executive officer afternoon scott group wolfe research analyst so i just want to follow up on the second quarter comments can you say are you including or excluding the mexico cost and then what s the base of or you re using for second quarter 18 eric fuller president and chief executive officer ok if you look at our adjusted second quarter or for 18 we re comparing that to a 93 4 the headwinds on the we had a 3 4 million adjustment in the first quarter related to mexico that adjustment in the second quarter is going to be significantly lower than that 3 4 million so it won t really impact the adjusted or by a meaningful amount scott group wolfe research analyst ok helpful and then as we think about the utilization on the otr it was down 7 maybe eric what are some of the initiatives to get that better are you seeing that start to get better when can that turn positive and then on the pricing side if we look at the rev per loaded mile up less than a percent even with the pricing contract pricing are we confident that that stays positive in the second quarter eric fuller president and chief executive officer so on the utilization piece it really impacted in two areas weather was a big impact and then just overall freight volumes was an impact i would say we re not going to have those weather issues in the second quarter i still think that freight volumes are lighter than we would like and so that could have a little bit of a drag in our utilization in our over the road division as we go into this quarter especially in comparison to the previous year on the contract business we still think that the contract rates will trend in a positive manner and even with that little bit of underlying weakness in the market we are still getting positive rate increases currently from our customers so i still feel confident that we will be positive up and like we said that mid single digit range in contracts for the year scott group wolfe research analyst i guess i was asking about the total revenue per mile eric fuller president and chief executive officer oh i m sorry oh ok oh we re going to be higher than that i think that with our exposure to spot i think that s going to be difficult to be higher than scott group wolfe research analyst understood and then maybe just lastly for eric peterson given sort of the backdrop here any thoughts to maybe slowing in the capex a little bit maybe doing less of the lease conversions just to generate some cash and pay down some debt eric peterson chief financial officer yes i think it s too early to make that call i think if we look at why we re here is to stick to our strategy which we believe is in the best interest of our shareholders over the long run to bring that equipment in when we do the math it shows that if we delay that equipment cycle the operating costs increase significantly and it might get a temporary benefit on my net debt for a quarter or free cash flow calculation but i believe that s absolutely the wrong decision over the longer for the enterprise and so we re going to stick to our strategy at 475 000 miles obviously if there s an extreme situation or circumstance then we won t be so bullish on that strategy if we need to make a change but i don t see us as anywhere near the type of situation right now with our current credit profile and liquidity that would prevent us from executing our strategy scott group wolfe research analyst ok makes sense thank you guys appreciate the time operator our next question is from ken hoexter from bank of america please go ahead ken hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey good afternoon eric can you just quickly clarify what is your spot exposure now and what was it eric fuller president and chief executive officer so it s really it s right in that 10 of our total revenue or say differently 20 of our over the road division and that really hasn t changed it s just that obviously the spot rates have changed dramatically but our overall exposure hasn t changed much ken hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst and how significantly have you seen the spot rates change whether it s year to date year over year eric fuller president and chief executive officer i think we re down roughly 20 ken hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok year over year eric fuller president and chief executive officer yes ken hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst at this point eric fuller president and chief executive officer yes ken hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok so just to come back to i guess the first question i guess i m little still troubled by the lack of improvement on the initiatives during the ipo process you talked about all the different programs you were putting in place that were specifically focused irrespective of the market that we re going to see the operating ratio improved and even last year was the best freight environment in generation so we should have been setting all time record and now we re back to kind of it seems like october 17 if you re down 20 on spot rates that s kind of right around the time of the hurricanes but maybe a little bit before elds but not a collapsed market and if you re talking about rates being up mid single digits i m confused as to why we re not seeing some of the benefits from the initiatives that you made has something gone awry in terms of driver pay or has turnover actually gone against you and increased maybe talk a little bit about what s going against some of the initiatives that you have been rolling out eric peterson chief financial officer ok i think this is eric peterson i believe when i m looking at the financial results from these initiatives i think it s fair to say that there are some we haven t made progress on that we d like but i think if i step back and look what just happened in the first quarter it was the best first quarter from an earnings perspective in the enterprise s history and i believe in what 100 of the people would agree it was not the strongest market from a first quarter perspective to answer your question on where we re behind is these event recorders with the insurance and you look at our insurance expense for the quarter i believe it was adversely impacted by weather but i also believe we re not making the progress at the speed of financial return that he probably thought we would with that said eric addressed earlier with our new training facility that launched in the first quarter of this year and also with the hair follicle testing we are laser focused on this forward facing event recorder that we are going to get the savings and just because we don t have it now doesn t mean we re not going to get it it s a path that we re not recreating anything other organizations are doing this successfully and it s just because it s not implemented doesn t mean that it will not be and so that s where we are on that initiative but i guess just to step back are we where we want to be on an absolute basis on earnings no was it the best quarter in the enterprise s history and are we still progress and do we have initial initiatives that we re launching that we think will accelerate over earnings improvement yes ken hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks for that eric and then just on your ability to get to 93 full year you said you need to see some see strengthening is that you need to see a strengthening on where is it on the volume side as eric talked about maybe not as strong of a second quarter or is it pricing to accelerate maybe just walk through on that target eric fuller president and chief executive officer yes i mean i think that a little bit of market pick up as it relates to both volume and rate if we can just get some a little bit of life in the spot market i think that would go a long way and then get a little bit more volume as i mentioned part of our utilization impact has been a lack of volume opportunities in the market so we believe with just a little bit of pick up on the demand side then we can start to see some movement there that i think can get us in that direction as eric just mentioned i still we re going to have to see a little bit of life in the initiatives around insurance that has been an area that admittedly has been disappointing and one that we did talk about on the ipo that we expected to see a little bit of movement there previous to now so that is an area that we continue to believe that we have put a lot of focus on and investment on and we re going to we believe we will see some improvement in that area but that is an area where at this point if there s anything i would say disappointing as that we haven t seen that move as of yet ken hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst just one last one if i can we head some other companies talk about amazon and walmart bringing business in house have you seen any enterprises pull any dedicated business away from the market is that any exposure of yours that we should look to eric fuller president and chief executive officer no i m not seeing anything on the dedicated side at all ken hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst or over the road eric fuller president and chief executive officer no we have seen some stuff on that we re really were running mostly in our brokerage division but we ve had two customers two larger customers that did pull some business out of the brokerage side and take that in house so that s probably been about the only thing that we ve seen from somebody moving business back in house ken hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst appreciate the time and thoughts thanks guys operator our next question is from brian ossenbeck from j p morgan please go ahead brian ossenbeck j p morgan analyst hey guys good afternoon i just want to come back to the hair follicle testing for a second is this something where you re going to see a bit of cost before you get some benefit potentially on the insurance side i m thinking when you make switch you have a higher standard and little bit more cost and probably a little bit more turnover so maybe if you can just walk us through that and if that s the right way to look at it and if so where you are in that process this is going to get a little bit worse before you start to get some improvements and some benefits from it eric fuller president and chief executive officer yes if you look at how we re managing that process is we re doing it a little bit more in a phased approach you ve seen some people who ve had probably the most impactful results from an overall truck count standpoint that went 100 all in we have been a little bit more phased in our rollout and it s for that reason that we know we re trying to overall manage the impact on the negative side i do believe though that we are seeing some real positive results as it relates to not only less accidents and insurance related issues from drivers who have been hair follicle tested but we re actually seeing less turnover as well so i feel confident that as we continue to roll this out to the entire fleet then we can manage any kind of downside issues as it relates to truck count and we can get through this with a positive impact throughout the entire process brian ossenbeck j p morgan analyst ok and then so the timing is it supposed to be done by the end of the year i mean what specifically would look like eric fuller president and chief executive officer yes yes i would say that at this point our plan would be to have the entire fleet under hair follicle testing by the end of the year brian ossenbeck j p morgan analyst ok and eric one more for you you talked about this frictionless order concept and it sounds like there might be something we talk more about in the next couple of quarters it sounds like from what you said about the timeline so maybe you can give a high level view in terms of what that means in the longer term and i guess in the intermediate step what you re looking to accomplish is this in brokerage or do you tend to see a lot more of the tech enabled stuff or it does sound like it s going to be more impactful for the drivers so maybe you re approaching a little bit differently than what we ve seen so far in the market eric fuller president and chief executive officer yes i would say we re approaching it a little differently and really focused around on the asset side of our business so if you look at a typical order there could be as many as 15 gates and those 15 gates are points in the order in which either they are some sort of data entry point or some sort of decision has to be made some of those decisions are being made by office employees and that entries being entered by office employees some of those gates are actually managed by the drivers so it creates a level it s a couple of issues one when you re every time you have to enter data there s a chance that you re going to have errors so being able to completely take that data entry piece off the table can reduce the amount of errors i have on my system but then also by optimize and then i can optimize those gates and make better decisions and make sure that i m making an optimal decision every time and then also by optimizing and potentially even automating the gates on the driver side i can reduce the amount of friction and frustration that the drivers have so the drivers aren t constantly having to send information back into us on things going on with them or in their order that we can automate a lot of that and so for us we believe it s probably more impactful on the driver turnover side so as the drivers job become easier and they don t have that friction in their day to day we can drive the driver the driver turnover down and we think it s going to be extremely impactful as we go through the year admittedly we started this process what about three or four months ago i can tell you today we re at 0 frictionless but we believe over this next year we ll start to drive some of those gates out to where we can automate them and we re going to make things a lot easier for the drivers and also a lot easier for office employees as well brian ossenbeck j p morgan analyst ok and i just want a quick follow up is this an internal process where you re dealing with the u s x folks or you have consultants is this more off the shelf what s how s this all structured and being handled eric fuller president and chief executive officer it s mostly internal we have worked a little bit with some consultants here and there but for the most part we re doing this internal and so that s where we think we re going to get the biggest benefit and we think it will be a differentiator operator our next question is from david ross of stifel please go ahead david ross stifel financial corp analyst yes so just a follow up there on the technology costs is there any lumpiness to the investments that you are making in the technology around the frictionless order or other and is it going to flow through mainly in capex or opex eric peterson chief financial officer yes thanks for the question this is eric peterson i look at this more of a continuation of what we ve been working on if you track back to our s 1 this is launched last june two of our four strategies were technology and we were using words like ai and graph databases and we were doing that back then and then kind of as we ve evolved and we ve had these initiatives around the fleet management the customer service the load planning part of those initiatives had a technology component and as these initiatives evolve you start putting the investment where you re getting the largest return and what we found right now is that on the technology component to those initiatives they re all ultimately driven around to see the tractor utilization rate and cost is where how we focus our initiatives we see that as we re putting extra investment to the technology piece that we re getting a larger return and so as we mentioned the core part of that was a consultant component and then part of that now is bringing some of that talent and ideas in house to augment the team with perspectives we haven t had before so right now we re not talking about a significant capex investment that we re making but to the extent that we re walking in trying to enhance the enterprise value and we have a discovery on this initiative where an investment might make a lot of sense relative to the return then we would do that but right now i don t have a plan in place that says this is how much i m going to have this big lumpy spend in the next month and then it s going go away we re just focused on the technology and investing in it as we go along david ross stifel financial corp analyst ok so no lumpiness in the opex or anything it just flows through and then eric peterson chief financial officer correct david ross stifel financial corp analyst what s the current average fleet age for the tractors and trailers eric peterson chief financial officer yes we re in that mid 27 month range right now and i think the important with this capex here to point out as we plan on exiting the year at 18 months on the tractors and so when you re and that s why that investment looks heavy in 2019 but i think what really sets us up for the 2020 is having a really young fleet lower operating cost and a chance to really enhance our earnings as we migrate down to 18 months over that remaining seven months of the year david ross stifel financial corp analyst and what about the trailer side eric peterson chief financial officer i don t have that exact number in front of me david ross stifel financial corp analyst ok and you talked about the event recorders what percent of the fleet now has those event recorders and when is it going to be 100 eric fuller president and chief executive officer i mean we re pretty much at 100 there are some straggler out there but for the most part we re at 100 and have been since mid summer of last year david ross stifel financial corp analyst ok and last question is just a clarification when you talked about a couple customers moving freight from your brokerage division in house were they moving it in house to their own private fleet in house to their own in house brokerage or in house to manage under contract with another carrier eric fuller president and chief executive officer not moving into another carrier in most cases moving it in house to manage through potentially their own brokerage david ross stifel financial corp analyst ok excellent thank you very much operator this concludes the question and answer session i d like to turn the floor back to management for any closing comments eric fuller president and chief executive

economic dominoes are starting to drop in the great recession authorities faced enormous pressure to do something letting nature take its course may well have been the best strategy but it couldn t happen that way in our political system they had to act in 2008 2009 we got things like tarp the troubled asset relief program that used 431 billion of your money to buy loans that banks no longer wanted on their books what we now forget is that tarp helped banks that weren t even banks before that point goldman sachs morgan stanley and numerous other broker dealers and insurers hurriedly got bank charters specifically so they could be part of tarp st louis fed st louis fed the entire world is up to its ears in debt thanks to a decade of central bank action we are late in a growth cycle that is going to end possibly soon whenever it does us government borrowing needs will skyrocket higher from already astronomical levels the federal reserve will end up monetizing this new debt i laid out a scenario of how it plays out in my latest special report the government welcomed it too but these fiscal and regulatory surprises pale in comparison to the federal reserve s unprecedented monetary actions in august 2007 the fed cut a quarter point from 5 25 where it had stayed for some time a year later it was down to 2 and soon to zero compare that to the current cycle where the fed spent four years raising the rate from the zero level to the present 2 5 chart the fed is capable of moving rates far more aggressively than we have seen recently and in either direction but the bigger and even more aggressive policy move was in asset purchases it included but wasn t limited to quantitative easing when the crisis hit the fed by law could only buy certain kinds of assets treasury securities bank debt federally backed mortgage securities and the like it didn t change the rules but instead stretched them far beyond what anyone envisioned could ever happen that hockey stick jump in the next chart wasn t on anyone s radar but it happened the fed then added several more rounds before finally topping out and recently beginning to exit chart st louis fedwas any of this the end of the world no the markets absorbed it all and even performed well in fact markets performed well because they absorbed all this craziness in that lies the seed of our next cycle my friend william white recently had an interview with a swiss newspaper bill is the former chief economist with the bank for international settlements and my favorite central banker in discussing the current move to loosen policy the reporter asked how did we end up in the debt trap bill s answer we were encouraged to do this just think what we have been doing since 2007 monetary easing is an invitation to take on more private sector debt and fiscal expansion is by definition an increase of government debt both instruments carry the risk of higher debt levels that eventually will kill you that may seem counterintuitive since recessions supposedly bring deleveraging that happened but not uniformly some deleveraged while others added more and the latter group was much larger and the fed s vast liquidity injections enabled it according to the institute for international finance global debt was 244 trillion as of q3 2018 more than half of it was financial and non financial corporate debt about 27 65 trillion was government debt not counting unfunded liabilities which are huge while us households retrenched in the recession corporations did not limit themselves like families did here s nonfinancial corporate debt growth for that same period 2003 2018 source the recession shaded area had almost no effect on corporate debt growth which continued merrily higher note that this is only securitized debt much more exists on private books you could argue that the added debt is not so dramatic as a percentage of gdp which also grew in this period that s true but it s also riskier debt the proportion of bonds at junk or near junk status has grown significantly the fed is now at least pausing that experiment and appears set to reverse it later this year i fear it is acting too late the latest corporate earnings news and lots of other data suggest the cyclical weakening has begun the next marker will be some high profile debt defaults probably among lower rated issuers i don t know who wework tesla name your favorite but somebody is going to run out of cash and find themselves unable to refinance for the 97th time and then the real fun will begin the fed waited too long to start exiting from crisis era measures it gave the economy time to go from dependence on easy money to outright addiction and as we all know addictions are very very hard to break so now the fed has cold feet too further tightening appears unlikely the fed will try to cut rates as the weakness grows more obvious but it won t help and it will start digging through the toolbox for something else to try whatever the fed does will probably surprise and alarm us it will not have the desired effects at least not as fast as it wants but it also won t kill us if we prepare for it the dominoes are starting to drop as expected to review working off that debt will take years possibly decades hence the long slow japanization i ve described i don t think we will endure it for 30 years like japan has we will instead force a worldwide default which i ve dubbed the great reset beyond that lie better times but we ll go through hell first the great reset the collapse of the biggest bubble in

earnings release issued this afternoon and available on our website we ve also posted supplemental investor materials regarding the first quarter results on our website with that i ll turn the call over to ed ed west chief executive officer thank you brad and welcome everyone i would like to convey the following key messages today first we executed on our priorities in the first quarter and the financial results came in ahead of our previous expectations second market conditions for fis and fintechs particularly in the u s continue to evolve in a favorable way for cardtronics and our retail partners third early indications and interest levels in our new allpoint retail deposit network are encouraging and is additive to our growing fi pipeline in north america now let me start with a brief recap of our results for the first quarter on a consolidated basis revenues were 318 million and adjusted ebitda was 61 million for the first quarter both of which were solid results given some of the headwinds we faced this quarter and came in better than we expected we also generated over 20 million of adjusted free cash flow in the quarter up significantly from just over 4 million during the year ago period now looking at our segments we executed on several fronts in north america while we officially launched a couple of new solutions to the market the allpoint retail deposit network and cardless cash access in nearly 11 000 atms through our partnerships with the fis 47 fis and counting today have cardless cash access through our atms additionally we have now developed an api for fintechs to connect to our platform regarding our deposit strategy our deposit taking customers are expected to have access to nearly 1 000 of our deposit taking atms by the end of the year and the market in the u s continues to evolve the financial institutions of all sizes are increasingly looking for unique flexible solutions to help them grow in a cost effective way pressure on banks to optimize their businesses is coming from many angles from big tech from new fintech disruptors to traditional fis of all sizes looking to efficiently grow their customer and deposit base most retail institutions are realizing that traditional branch networks are not an efficient use of resources and that branches are increasingly less relevant to their customers providing convenient fee free atm access is still very important to bank customers but owning a large atm fleet is expensive and not necessarily an important differentiator we can deliver an efficient on demand solution for the fis that can maximize roi whether fis are looking to reduce costs simplify their operations or strategically expand our suite of solutions can solve a number of needs for their business plans our end to end capabilities and ubiquitous geographic coverage in the u s are truly unique and our value proposition is increasingly resonating with fis of all sizes and we are seeing growing interest in addition to the new allpoint customers we entered agreements with 19 new financial institutions to our allpoint network bringing with them over 200 000 additional cardholders during the first quarter we also had success with bank branding adding new relationships to brand over 1 000 units in the u s in coming periods as i just mentioned we re seeing interest from fis of all sizes 10 of the branding agreements signed this past quarter are with top 30 banks our allpoint and bank branding surcharge free offerings are the core of our strategy to drive more volume to our existing atm locations we executed nicely on this again in the first quarter as our u s same store withdrawal transactions were up 2 led by surcharge free transactions up almost 10 for the quarter coming back to operations for a moment one of our key priorities for delivering customer success and shareholder value is operational excellence during the first quarter the team continued to execute in an exemplary fashion we had near record levels of atm availability in north america rolled out new products and concurrently drove down unit cost operational execution same store transaction growth and the roll off of 7 eleven yielded nice operating leverage our gross margin in north america was up 180 basis points for the quarter let me conclude my comments on north america by saying that we built a differentiated network centered on convenient atm locations at leading retailers and extensive partnerships with over 1 500 fis in north america all combined with unmatched experience and scale we believe this network will serve as the underpinning of our strategy to grow in what we estimate will be a 15 billion market in the u s today we estimate that almost 90 of cash supply in the u s occurs at either a branch teller or bank atm and we are laser focused on this evolving opportunity now let s move to our europe and africa segment on a constant currency basis revenue was down 1 for the quarter this was a pretty solid result and candidly better than we expected given the headwinds and negative year over year comps in our u k business over all same store transactions in the u k were about flat for the quarter the best result we ve seen in a couple of years and impacted by a combination of atm removals across the market consumer behavior good weather and exceptional atm availability resulting from new platform capabilities similar to the previous quarters the u k business which is the largest component of this segment was down on revenues driven by the significant reductions to the link interchange rate in addition to the removal of about 3 000 marginally performing atms that did not warrant additional investments after the interchange rate cuts now we continue to take action in the u k to manage through the headwinds as a reminder we were impacted by the second link rate cut on january 1 of this year these arbitrary rate cuts have caused significant disruption in the marketplace since the link reductions were announced we have changed approximately 2 300 atms to pay to use and expect to convert an additional 700 atms to pay to use during the remainder of 2019 these are in addition to our removals our fast growing germany spain and south africa businesses once again grew at double digit rates as we continue to grow nicely in these markets we added retail and touristic locations and layered in bank branding and managed services arrangements during the quarter we entered into agreements to place approximately 600 atms at retail locations across these markets we also announced a partnership with ing bank in spain enabling their 3 9 million domestic customers with fee free access to our atms in that market in south africa we initiated relationships with prasa the passenger rail agency of south africa and shell petroleum to install atms at premium passenger railway stations and shell petroleum sites countrywide now moving on to australia our revenues were down about 7 on a constant currency basis excluding the atms that were removed from service in early 2018 our revenues would have been nearly flat for the quarter while revenues are still showing declines in australia conditions began to improve and stabilize in the market we continue to manage the business for solid cash flows and believe we can turn this business back to growth in the medium term over all we made good progress on our plans during the quarter and our results exceeded our expectations largely due to the transaction performance in the u k accordingly we are raising our outlook for the year to reflect the first quarter s performance i would now like to take a minute to briefly comment and give you some color on our top five priorities as outlined in our investor supplement first drive durable organic revenue growth we remain focused on driving organic growth by rolling out new products optimizing the productivity of our portfolio and driving more transactions to our network we returned to organic growth in north america last year excluding 7 eleven and we see a pathway to growth across all of our segments over the medium term in the u k and australia we are positioning a return to growth and extension into adjacent services and in germany spain and south africa we expect to experience double digit growth in revenue and adjusted ebitda our second priority is to deliver operational excellence and portfolio optimization we expect to benefit from scale and operating leverage as well as provide an enhanced customer experience with better controls and security we plan to achieve this by further integrating our platforms driving standardization across the business fully roll out our new erp and manage asset productivity with enhanced software and analytics our third priority is to create raving fans with our customers our solutions assist in solving customer growth and efficiency problems for our partners across both retail and financial services our strongest asset is the partnership we have with the leading retailers and 2 000 fis globally combined with the over 60 million allpoint cardholders having a truly loyal relationship with all of these constituents is a surefire path for growth our fourth priority is to engender employee pride we have a purpose driven mission resulting from the delivery of convenient low cost access to cash around the world and we believe executing on our vision and making cardtronics a great place for employees to learn and grow will drive long term success for the business and our fifth priority is to deliver on our financial commitments in strong free cash flow at the end of the day we are highly focused on long term growth in cash flow we are investing for growth as evidenced by our product investments this year but we are mindful that every asset and investment carries a return and we are accountable to deliver reliable growth in cash flow over time for our shareholders and this brings me to my last topic today which is a recap of our medium term growth plan that we reviewed during our investor day just a few weeks ago over the medium term we expect to deliver roughly 3 to 5 revenue growth with a corresponding adjusted ebitda growth of 7 to 9 this implies margin expansion resulting from scale and operating leverage we expect to deploy capital into areas where we see quantifiable and tangible growth and continue to delever and drive toward our targeted net leverage level of two times to 2 5 times as we approach that level we expect to come back to you to announce either stock repurchases and or dividends when the time is appropriate we believe we will reach these targeted levels within the next three to four quarters during this period we also have the authorization to opportunistically repurchase shares should the occasion arise while we work to reach our targeted net leverage range i would now like to turn the call over to gary to give some color on the results and the outlook gary ferrera chief financial officer thank you ed i will start with a quick recap of our financial performance in the quarter while we had a solid quarter there are a few significant matters when trying to compare reported results to the prior year first the results are significantly impacted by the u k link interchange rate reductions as this is the first quarter that has both reductions therefore the u k link interchange rate in q1 2019 was a full 10 lower than q1 2018 second we had fairly strong currency headwinds compared to a year ago as the pound was considerably weaker against the dollar compared to q1 last year third we had the last of the 7 eleven revenue in q1 as there were a few hundred atms still in service in january and february of 2018 these remaining atms generated just over 5 million in revenues but had a minimal amount of ebitda contribution lastly we had a nonrecurring property tax benefit of 3 9 million related to our u k business in q1 last year as this was an expense item this factor only impacted profitability measure comparisons on an as reported basis consolidated revenues for the quarter were 318 million down 5 from the first quarter of 2018 on a constant currency basis and excluding the impact of 7 eleven our consolidated organic revenue growth rate was approximately flat for the quarter organic constant currency atm operating revenues excluding 7 eleven were up 1 in north america this growth rate which we expect to accelerate during late 2019 and into 2020 was driven by a u s same store transaction withdrawal growth rate of 2 we continue to see a double digit growth rate of surcharge free transactions at our company owned locations in the u s this growth rate continues to be driven by increases in participating financial institutions within allpoint and bank branding that continue to drive consumers to our locations the u s same store transaction growth rate of 2 was solid and in line with expectations q1 was somewhat adversely impacted by weaker surcharge transactions which were down 4 compared to nearly a flat result in q4 of 2018 we think this sequential change was partly related to transitory factors with harsh extremely cold weather impacting a big part of the midwest during the first part of the quarter also there was a slight delay in this year s tax refund season the north america revenue growth rate in q1 was also adversely impacted by the removal of atms at sunoco locations during 2018 as sunoco was acquired by 7 eleven this transition to 7 eleven s sister company operator adversely impacted the q1 growth rate in north america by about 1 revenues in our europe and africa segment as reported were down 8 for the quarter revenues were only down about 1 after adjusting for the changes in fx rates when you adjust for the atms we removed early in 2018 as a result of the link interchange rate reduction we estimate that our europe and africa segment would have had slightly positive organic revenue growth on a constant currency basis our u k business had same store transactions that were about flat for the quarter and this result is a little better than we have seen recently we believe the better than expected transaction performance in the u k was impacted by a few factors first more consumers migrating transactions to a smaller pool of free to use atms as more atms in the market become fee charging as a result of the link interchange reduction second continued declines in the total number of atms as banks continue to contract their atms and branches and third better weather relative to the prior year the rest of our europe and africa segment continued to grow nicely as germany spain and south africa each had a double digit top line growth in the quarter transitioning to australia as reported revenues were down 16 for the quarter but that result was only down 7 on a constant currency basis as the aussie dollar significantly weakened over the past year relative to the u s dollar this result in australia is an improvement over the growth rate in the prior year and we continue to see moderation in the rate of same store transaction declines in this market we were nearly flat on the top line excluding the atms that were removed from service last year moving down in the income statement the consolidated adjusted gross margin for the quarter is down about 60 basis points to 31 5 compared to 32 1 in q1 2018 adjusted for the nonrecurring u k property tax benefit in q1 2018 our adjusted gross margin would have been up about 60 basis points driven by strong operational execution in our north america business with margins up approximately 180 basis points adjusted ebitda for the quarter was 61 million a decline of 11 from q1 2018 absent the nonrecurring property tax benefit in q1 2018 and exchange rate movement adjusted ebitda would have been nearly flat for the quarter this is in spite of the two interchange rate reductions in the u k this result was better than we had anticipated and was mostly driven by better than expected revenues in the u k and strong cost management across the enterprise our adjusted eps for the quarter was 0 35 compared to 0 46 in q1 2018 and was mainly impacted by the same factors that impacted adjusted ebitda but we also had lower interest expense as a result of our late 2018 refinancing efforts that more than offset the slight increase in depreciation expense moving to capital expenditures our total spend for the quarter was 29 3 million about half of which falls into the growth bucket this is up from 20 7 million in q1 of 2018 this result was about in line with what we anticipated and reflects the meaningful investments for our product enhancements in the u s we are still expecting approximately 135 million of capex this year we continue to focus the organization on free cash flow and as ed mentioned this measure remains one of our key priorities for the year our adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was 20 4 million up almost 16 million from the prior year the improvement in adjusted free cash flow was primarily related to positive changes in working capital and cash paid for interest which was down almost 6 million subsequent to the previously mentioned refinancing of our balance sheet i would just like to note that the only adjustment we make on our free cash flow metric which is gaap operating cash flow less capital expenditures is to exclude movements in restricted cash related to settlement timing our daily settlement balances that include restricted cash can change materially between quarters depending on the day of the week and holidays and do not truly represent operational cash generated by the business in the quarter moving to the balance sheet our net leverage ratio for the quarter was 2 8 times about flat from last quarter we continue to use free cash flow to reduce debt outstanding and with our anticipated year over year ebitda growth in the second half of the year of 2019 we d expect to enter our target net leverage range of two times to 2 5 times adjusted ebitda later this year or early next year during the quarter we paid down just over 24 million on our revolving credit facility and continue to have plenty of borrowing capacity and headroom on all of our covenants in late march we announced a 50 million share repurchase authorization this authorization is meant to be an opportunistic tool available to the company whether we repurchase shares will depend on a number of factors including valuation business opportunities leverage and other factors we have not repurchased any shares to date next i want to make note of a couple of gaap and disclosure items in our 10 q first like most other u s public companies we implemented the new lease standard this quarter while this had no direct impact to any of our reported gaap or non gaap income statement measures it did result in over 93 million in operating leases going on to our balance sheet as liabilities related mostly to building leases this truly is an accounting presentation matter that we do not anticipate having any impact to our reported income statement cash flow or liquidity metrics second we made a few minor adjustments in our segment reporting the adjustments relate to internal cost allocations after we completed some functional integration during 2018 particularly in our technology and processing operations both 2019 and 2018 segment results are reported on the same updated basis in this quarter s 10 q now let me turn to our 2019 outlook our first quarter results especially at the bottom line were better than we anticipated on our previous call we communicated that adjusted ebitda could decline as much as 20 in q1 the actual results were approximately half that amount and was mostly driven by better than expected revenues in the u k and strong cost management across the enterprise with a solid first quarter under our belts we re raising the outlook for the year our adjusted outlook is updated in our earnings release and some of the key metrics are as follows revenues of 1 3 billion to 1 36 billion up 10 million on each end of the range adjusted ebitda in a range of 290 million to 300 million for the year up 5 million on each end of the range and adjusted eps in a range of 2 01 to 2 12 up 0 07 on each end of the range while we do not provide specific quarterly guidance it continues to be a year of two halves so i will provide some color as to how we anticipate the year unfolding at this time we re anticipating the remainder of the year to be in line with what we communicated on our previous earnings call we continue to expect q2 to be down on both revenues and adjusted ebitda compared to the prior year this is mostly due to the same factors that impacted our q1 results the two interchange rate reductions in the u k a smaller but still significant impact from the property tax benefit in q2 last year and foreign currency exchange rates we currently expect q2 to be down in the mid single digit percentage range on adjusted ebitda or approximately half of what we were down in q1 revenues could be down a couple of percentage points we continue to expect top and bottom line growth starting in q3 as we begin to lap the headwinds we are experiencing in the first half with that let me turn it back over to ed ed west chief executive officer thank you gary so in summary we are pleased with the performance and are encouraged by some of the key indicators in the business including good surcharge free transaction growth in the u s new branding agreements to brand over 1 000 atms with a mix of fis of all sizes a growing fi pipeline in north america improved same store transaction performance in the u k australia beginning to stabilize from an ebitda standpoint and continued double digit growth in all of our growth markets so operator we d now like to turn the call back over to you to open it up for a q a session questions answers operator thank you our first question comes from ramsey el assal with barclays ramsey el assal barclays analyst hi guys thank you for taking my question i wanted to ask about first of all great same store sales result in the u k it was above our expectations can you talk about the competitive environment in the u k and how it s evolved post the link cuts are smaller operators dropping out are you seeing sort of less competition in the market if you can comment on that that would be great ed west chief executive officer ok sure good afternoon ramsey thanks again we are seeing some changes through there as you can imagine over all the country just from the cuts that link put through obviously the number of atms in the country have come down considerably there are fewer than 70 000 i think it s frankly down to about 63 000 we ve removed atms others have removed atms we ve read about and seen others making other switches to pay to use again just as i mentioned during the call these arbitrary cuts have caused a lot of disruption in the marketplace and frankly adds a lot of consumer concern from just having ubiquitous access to cash as gary pointed out in his comments there is now a smaller pool of the free to use and i think you probably saw a little bit of that benefit this past quarter from our standpoint we continue to make that mix change the balancing between free to use and pay to use just based on frankly just the demand that we see and the economics of that particular location and we just need to make sure we get it right to be able to leave that atm there then i would say going forward we ll just continue to monitor the markets and seeing transaction levels we did benefit this past quarter as well we both pointed out and you pointed out it exceeded our expectations the united kingdom had seasonably very warm weather for the winter which was terrific now we re going into a period over the next quarter where it was actually warm going last summer so probably the comps are a little bit more challenging then i would say one last thing that i think we benefited from some new platform integration work on our end and we saw absolute record availability for our platform which really matters there in the u k because of the volumes that we experience across our network end of the day we re optimistic that we will get back that the market here will stabilize we ll muscle through this situation that we ve had to deal with we ll get through that it will balance out and we will get back to growth the great news is cardtronics we re the largest operator there we have a great asset base we can leverage other things we talked a little bit about that at the investor day marc talked about some of the things we re piloting and we ll continue to work that and keep you up to date ramsey el assal barclays analyst great thanks for that a follow up for me on the allpoint the deposit taking capability can you help us understand the economics of that program from sort of both a revenue sort of the per transaction economics from both a revenue and expense perspective i m assuming it generates more revenue is there an incremental expense element to it how does it impact profitability just a little more granularity on the sort of economic model would be helpful ed west chief executive officer sure so as we just announced that a few weeks ago with the new allpoint retail deposit network we re on a methodical way rolling that out across the country the revenue model in that is a mix between both some fixed payments as well as transaction based based on the deposit and there s different structures depending on the financial institution that s joining in and we re seeing a mix of that and interest levels are frankly at all levels whether it s a local community bank looking for more catchment and convenience for their customers to national platforms who want to see a national level and so our structure and pricing is adjusted accordingly based on what the institution or the fintech would be looking for in terms of what their needs are from a cost basis yes the costs are a little bit different just because it s deposit taking you re having to manage that ultimately what we ve designed is a recycler what we re rolling out that would be a future capability right now it would just have additional cit activity because of the deposits ramsey el assal barclays analyst terrific thanks so much ed west chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from andrew jeffrey with suntrust andrew jeffrey suntrust robinson humphrey analyst guys thank you for taking the question this afternoon ed i just want to ask about north america the u s in particular it seems like as time goes on and as allpoint surcharge free transactions become more important to your revenue growth the difference between both allpoint and same store sales and then allpoint and sort of revenue growth widens can you just comment on sort of what you think the right most relevant kpi is going forward and i suspect the key benefit of this big increase in allpoint aside from relevance of the network is at the gross margin line right ed west chief executive officer thanks for the question so just stepping back in the u s i think it comes back to as we outlined a few weeks ago is the value and the benefit of what s really unique to us which is this surcharge free network and where it s a two sided network self reinforcing on one side you have key leading retailers in convenient locations and the other side 1 500 financial institutions looking for convenience for their customers and efficiency of this where we see the growth here is adding on to that from both the penetration within those customers as well as new customers coming on and driving more and more transactions at those key locations so yes seeing the transaction growth in these levels is what we re very focused on across the organization as we talked about our compensation is tied to that we re working very closely with the various partners whether it s the fi or the retail to get better awareness we re investing more in marketing programs as i mentioned we hired a new chief marketing officer paul wilmore focused in on this bringing in additional analytics capabilities understanding how do we continue to partner more and more in this area to drive transactions i think the best driver will be is the transaction level at those key locations and getting more throughput and then that s what will drive the margin as i talked about earlier that long term outlook the medium term outlook where you see ebitda growth in excess of revenue it just comes down to good old fashioned scale and leverage across the business andrew jeffrey suntrust robinson humphrey analyst ok so we ll keep focusing i guess on allpoint transactions as sort of the key indicator then ed west chief executive officer well i would say it s surcharge free because remember it s i think the branding bank branding and allpoint so this past quarter is a great example it s like wow we re 1 000 new agreements on atms to brand with institutions of all sizes eight of those being top 30 institutions andrew jeffrey suntrust robinson humphrey analyst ok thank you for that and then just as a follow up you talk about allpoint perhaps reaching 1 000 machines by the end of the year where do you think critical mass is in terms of when you go out and you talk to financial institutions at what point do they have that ah hah moment where they kind of say oh boy this gets really interesting for us ed west chief executive officer well you look at a particular market just first kind of stepping back on allpoint as we talked about this is a methodical rollout we expect to be nearly 1 000 locations by this year and that s going to continue on into next year we re just going to continue to monitor and gauge that rollout but let s just say an example where a financial institution may be moving into a new market or region they can quickly overnight on an almost on demand basis enter a market where we filled out for example let s talk about chicago where i believe it s over 80 locations we now have deposit taking in that market overnight a financial institution can move up to be one of the top locations in density for their customers to take deposits on a very rapid basis so it depends on the institution it depends on the market they want to see that presence and it depends on the size of that i would say the other one is the national for those that are interested on a national basis obviously they re monitoring the rollout the cities where we re doing it we re in close discussions with several organizations and we re rolling out some of these markets based on what we hear in those conversations everything we re doing in trying to roll out is very well informed andrew jeffrey suntrust robinson humphrey analyst right thanks thank you operator thank you again ladies and gentlemen our next question comes from kartik mehta with northcoast research kartik mehta northcoast research analyst ed i wanted to go back to your commentary i think at the analyst day and today about getting back to positive growth in the u k and you had a very good quarter this year this quarter and i m wondering with link transactions declining about 8 what strategy you ll take so that you can get back to revenue growth in that geography ed west chief executive officer so as you pointed out it was a decent quarter given all the headwinds that we had which is two rate cuts from link and then we have another quarter that we re in right now where it has a year over year negative impact of the two and then the comps you have a little bit more benefit in the back half of this year we re doing a lot of different things different product related marc walked through a pilot that we re doing with our partner vaultex and three large financial institutions in the market that s being piloted it all stems back to our scale size and experience there we are the largest operator in the country and having countrywide depth and resources and how we leverage those capabilities and assets into adjacent activities is what we re working through and also we do believe the market will stabilize where yes transactions have been coming down but so has capacity and frankly we think our infrastructure can benefit many including the banks and others as they reprioritize their resources as we talked about our network there is as large nearly as the three largest banks combined so there is an efficiency for them as well by us helping serve the community there kartik mehta northcoast research analyst and then just ed your thoughts on u s trends i know they decelerated a little bit in the first quarter compared to third and fourth quarter of last year any concern there or was this just in line with expectations and you d expect those trends to kind of reverse as you go through the year ed west chief executive officer yes actually it we were pleased with where it came out frankly surcharge levels came in back where we had been experiencing if you ll recall from our previous conversations third and fourth quarter actually did a lot better than what we had been used to on a surcharge basis where frankly it was nearly flat and as gary pointed out in his commentary surcharge levels were down about 4 for the quarter and largely that was the first part of the quarter january february where the country the midwest got walloped with the cold and harsh conditions but after that in march we saw that come back up and improve in march so we are not concerned about that i think that was just transitory and weather related and surcharge free transactions are doing well karthik mehta executive managing director director of research principal hey thank you very much and i really appreciate it operator thank you and our next question comes from charles nabhan with wells fargo charles nabhan wells fargo analyst hi guys thank you for taking my question i just wanted to follow up with your previous comments on surcharge free and surcharge same store sales specifically i m curious as to why surcharge revenues were impacted by weather and tax related factors to a greater degree than the surcharge free transactions is that based on just the geography of the network i m just hoping you could comment on that a little bit to help us parse out that bifurcation ed west chief executive officer it could be multiple different things as you point out the geography it could be from the location it could be the demographic of the use and a convenient space of that and then just in terms of the lifestyle of who that is there are a lot of different factors but those are the first couple that come to mind gary gary ferrera chief financial officer and remember there s not a lot of outside factors pushing surcharge as they are pushing surcharge free right surcharge free is growing because we re adding bank branding we re doing all these things those don t always necessarily directly impact surcharge so i think that s probably one of the main reasons ed west chief executive officer and then on the surcharge basis which is more convenience based you can have other activities what we ve had before in the big lottery activity where you ll see spikes in demand versus something that s a little more constant on the surcharge free basis charles nabhan wells fargo analyst ok great and just as a follow up thinking about some of the optimization initiatives you ve undertaken in the past year in the u k and australia i was just curious as to whether you were done reducing the fleet there and if you could potentially see yourself at a point over the next year or so where you re even adding atms or looking outside of that at some of your growth markets spain south africa germany are you in a position or have you given any thought to potentially expanding but expanding through m a in any of those areas ed west chief executive officer so a couple of different things first of all every investment stands on its own merit so right now where we re investing is obviously in north america spain germany south africa where we see very good returns on growth we ve gone through to continue to optimize the portfolios as you point out between the u k and australia and just we ll see when as those markets straighten out and have better conditions in which we would want to invest otherwise we have good investment opportunities in these other markets and attractive growth and returns separately with respect to m a as we talked about at the investor day and as we ve talked about over the last year we are highly highly focused on integrating operations and driving organic growth if we see things that offer a very attractive and short return on that attractive returns that leverage our current capabilities we would look at that but in terms of the markets you mentioned i d say we re focused on continued execution gary gary ferrera chief financial officer completely agree operator ladies and gentlemen that concludes the question and answer session of today s call as well as today s conference ed west chief executive officer great thank you very much operator duration 45 minutes call participants brad conrad executive

washington ap the federal reserve is all but sure to keep interest rates on hold wednesday and for the foreseeable future even as president donald trump keeps up his attacks on the fed for not cutting rates the fed will likely reiterate a message that has reassured consumers and investors since the start of the year no rate hikes are likely anytime soon the fed s low rate policy is keeping borrowing costs down helping boost stock prices and supporting an economy that s growing steadily and with inflation remaining tame the fed is seen as able to stay on the sidelines at least through this year yet trump insists the economy can do better and to that end he is demanding what almost no mainstream economist would favor cutting rates further on tuesday trump tweeted that the u s economy has the potential to go up like a rocket if the fed would only slash rates and resume the emergency bond buying programs it unveiled after the great recession to ease long term loan rates to stimulate spending and growth yes we are doing very well at 3 2 gdp growth in the first quarter but with our wonderfully low inflation we could be setting major records trump tweeted on the first day of the fed s two day policy meeting the central bank will disclose its policy decisions in a statement and in a news conference by chairman jerome powell economists overwhelmingly expect no major change in its rate policy the fed raised rates four times last year but has indicated that it foresees no hikes at all this year the fed is in a sweet spot right now with moderate growth and low inflation said brian bethune an economics professor at tufts university in boston if growth were any stronger or inflation higher the fed would have no choice but to raise interest rates the brighter outlook marks a sharp rebound from the final months of 2018 when fears about a possible global recession and of further fed rate increases had darkened the economic picture stock prices tumbled in the final quarter of the year especially after the fed in december not only raised rates for the fourth time in 2018 but signaled that it was likely to keep tightening credit this year yet beginning in january the fed engineered an abrupt reversal suggesting that it was finished raising rates for now and might even act this year to support rather than restrain the economy in characterizing its stance the fed s new watchword became patient and investors have responded by delivering a major stock market rally the market gains have also been fed by improved growth prospects in china and some other major economies and by the view that a trade war between the world s two biggest economies the united states and china is moving closer to a resolution on friday the government reported that the u s economy grew at a surprisingly strong 3 2 annual rate in the january march quarter it was the best performance for a first quarter in four years and it far surpassed initial forecasts that annual growth could be as weak as 1 at the start of the year if economic prospects were to brighten further could fed officials rethink their plans to suspend further rate hikes and perhaps resume tightening credit possibly but investors don t seem to think so according to data tracked by the cme group investors foresee zero probability that the fed will raise rates anytime this year and in fact their bets indicate a roughly 66 likelihood that the fed will cut rates before year s end one factor in that dovish view is that the economy might not be quite as robust as the latest economic figures suggest the first quarter s healthy 3 2 annual growth rate was pumped up by some temporary factors from a surge in restocking of companies inventories to a narrowing of the u s trade deficit that are expected to reverse themselves if so this would diminish the pace of growth and likely hold down inflation indeed for all of 2019 growth is expected to total around 2 2 down from last year s 2 7 gain as the effects of the 2017 tax cuts and billions of dollars in increased government spending fade at the same time the fed is still struggling to achieve one of its mandates to produce inflation of roughly 2 on monday the government reported that the fed s preferred inflation gauge rose just 1 5 in march from 12 months earlier many analysts say they think the fed won t resume raising rates until inflation hits or exceeds its 2 target
washington there are times when it seems we re worrying about things that aren t worth worrying about a good example these days is inflation amazingly the complaint is that it s not rising fast enough in march the consumer price index or cpi had increased 1 9 over the past year the gain of another inflation indicator the deflator of the personal consumption expenditures or pce was 1 5 what s not to like despite criticism from donald trump all this qualifies as good news prices have hardly risen indeed technical difficulties in measuring inflation for example how to account for new products such as smartphones suggest that actual inflation could be close to zero some prices go up new vehicles 0 7 over the past year other prices go down televisions 19 the pce is the federal reserve s preferred inflation indicator for workers this means that if their wages and fringe benefits rose by more than 1 5 over the year they would ve received a modest boost to their real inflation adjusted incomes and yet many respected economists worry that inflation is too low to those of us including me old enough to have lived through the double digit inflation of late 1970s and early 1980s this is crazy high and uncontrolled inflation annually it peaked at 13 in 1979 was a scourge it sowed almost universal anxiety and was wildly unpopular people felt they had lost control of their lives government seemed powerless to stop it why would anyone want to re create that anarchy advertisement three reasons are typically given for starters critics complain that the fed isn t hitting its own inflation target which is 2 on the pce this suggests incompetence if the fed can t hit its target the assumption goes what else can t it do frankly this is fear mongering the fed simply isn t powerful enough to hit a precise target as long as reported inflation stays between zero and 2 the fed is delivering a crude price stability a more realistic concern involves the fed s ability to respond to a recession typically the fed cuts interest rates to reverse an economic downturn but interest rates reflecting inflation are already low the fear is that the fed won t be able to cut rates enough to prevent a recession from getting worse consider the so called fed funds rate the rate on overnight loans and the rate most influenced by the fed is now set at about 2 5 by contrast it was 5 25 in 2007 the start of the last recession and higher earlier if the fed can only cut rates modestly before they hit zero then the next recession could be lengthy and stubborn that s the argument this brings us to the most serious of inflation s alleged shortcomings paradoxically it s deflation or falling prices of course some prices are falling even when the overall price level is rising to take an obvious example computers and other tech products have experienced massive price cuts no one is against those by contrast deflation signifies declines in most prices and this prospect can do enormous economic damage the most terrifying example is the great depression of the 1930s when the wholesale price index fell a staggering 33 from 1929 to 1933 the result was to prolong the depression deflation causes people to delay major purchases they think that prices will go even lower deflation also makes it harder for debtors to repay their loans the economy gets caught in a vicious circle of deflation weak consumer spending and more loan defaults in the 1930s annual unemployment peaked at around 25 advertisement higher inflation is cast as the antidote to deflation it s an extra cushion of protection this sounds sensible but it overlooks the likely reality that the transition to higher inflation would create a new set of problems involving interest rates exchange rates consumer and business uncertainty and the stock market to name just a few moreover it presumes that deflation would quickly attain depression like proportions when a more likely outcome would be modest deflation probably many americans wouldn t notice slight price declines others might seize on them as an opportunity to go bargain hunting indeed the combination of rigid wages and falling prices would enhance consumer purchasing power and could stimulate an economic recovery we have a case study in the probabilities japan it s been grappling with deflation for years but price declines have been puny from 2001 to 2010 the average annual decline was 0 3 that s one third of 1 says the international monetary fund millions of americans are unaware of our disastrous experience with double digit inflation they have either forgotten or weren t yet born the fed says it won t abandon its current inflation target of 2 that s a promise the fed needs to keep robert samuelson is a columnist with the washington post send questions comments to the editors
dan roodt american renaissance may 3 2019 until recently i never thought that i would have to write these words i live in a failed state south africa has become so corrupt that the state could soon be bankrupted through outright theft and graft over the last year or two there have been constant revelations about public assets looting by the ex terrorist anc regime in 2018 a liberal journalist stefan hofstatter published a book called licence to loot how the plunder of eskom and other parastatals almost sank south africa penguin 2018 also on kindle hot on its heels has come another book by pieter louis myburgh who used to write for the afrikaans sunday paper rapport called gangster state penguin 2019 with a focus on the web of corruption around the anc secretary general ace magashule in licence to loot hofstatter painstakingly recounts how the infamous gupta family from saharanpur india bribed itself right to the top eventually controlling both the now former president jacob zuma and brian molefe the ceo of our largest utility the electricity supplier eskom due to political infighting eskom s position of ceo became something of a revolving door as one conniving black mogul was ousted and replaced by the next though with an uninterrupted flow of contracts and kickbacks changing hands a young afrikaner engineer who studied with a scholarship from eskom and now works at one of the utility s power stations once told me we are relatively good at losing the best people in our organization and retaining the weakest ones regardless of race this would hold true for most of government run and even corporate south africa these days only the most corrupt and venal survive one corrupt and venal white is gavin watson a liberal who refused to play rugby in the previously all white system under the old government and joined an unofficial multiracial leftist rugby league affiliated with the anc his brave stance ingratiated him with the anc and he has benefited hugely especially from government contracts with the correctional services department the wheeling and dealing of his company bosasa has recently been exposed by the so called zondo commission when some of his former employees testified they were told to deliver bags full of cash to politicians and bureaucrats to keep the machine oiled ironically the whistle blower angelo agrizzi has been indicted but gavin watson has suffered no criminal sanction despite days of testimony about his company s corruption south african banks were embarrassed by the revelations however and closed the company s accounts mr watson put bosasa into voluntary liquidation in february but it continues to trade under other names atul ajay and rajesh tony gupta eventually fled south africa to dubai after a wave of negative publicity about their business empire but they took approximately r50 billion about 3 5 billion of loot with them an international search warrant for their luxury bombardier jet financed by the export development canada finally led to its grounding by court order at lanseria airport in johannesburg the guptas still owed the canadian export credit agency 27 million on the 60 million jet although there are still court cases pending three conclusions can be drawn the guptas will not return to stand trial the money laundered through mid east and far east front corporations will not be recovered corruption is pushing south africa over the fiscal cliff with state debt growing rapidly stretching the country s payment capacity to the limit and ratings agencies are downgrading its debt to junk or near junk western legal niceties fall by the wayside as black politicians and their businessmen cronies glut their appetites they are not satisfied with high paying affirmative action appointments they want to be instant billionaires or at least millionaires the sunday times in johannesburg for which mr hofstatter often writes revealed many of the corruption scandals that are often stranger than fiction on march 26 2017 its front page ran a facebook picture of a 26 year old black girl with the headline billion rand babe the subtitle eskom lavished deals on boss s 26 year old stepdaughter asked to comment the then ceo of eskom matshela koko feigned ignorance of his stepdaughter s deals with the utility claiming she is my stepdaughter from my wife s previous relationship and she lives with us but i wasn t aware that she was a director of this company doing business with eskom until four weeks ago and i asked her to resign with immediate effect only a few days ago mr koko was again on the front page with this headline koko s eskom looting frenzy the same company aptly named impulse of which his step daughter was a director had paid r81 million about 5 6 million into his wife s bank account on the streets of johannesburg and pretoria the proceeds of corruption and embezzlement are visible thousands of blacks drive 100 000 plus vehicles frequent clubs and expensive restaurants and buy european luxury brands they live in huge mansions designed by white architects in exclusive gated communities or estates as they are called here with thousands of square feet wine cellars three to five car garages swimming pools etc it s a party or more precisely an african feast whatever happens tomorrow the economic consequences the bond downgrades don t matter sometimes expensive handbags make headlines especially when they are used as bribes during his testimony on corruption at south africa s correctional services department the white whistleblower angelo agrizzi told how his boss gavin watson had bought an expensive louis vuitton handbag for dudu miyeni head of south african airways at the time south african airways had already been looted into bankruptcy and needs regular state injections by the billion to stay afloat and avoid having its accounts frozen by the banks dudu miyeni knew nothing about airlines and had no management experience either but she was a friend of jacob zuma s the disgraced former president some newspapers hinted that she was also his mistress even though he already had five wives during her stint as chairman of south african airways from 2012 to 2017 the state owned corporation lost billions of dollars which meant bailouts at taxpayer expense the dudu miyeni wikipedia page notes that she once lied about completing a university degree in administration she has a only teacher s diploma from an all black tribal college yet she was appointed to head a major airline with 31 7 billion rand in revenue slightly more than 2 billion per year the last profitable year at south african airways was 2011 the year before she was appointed 2010 11 r782 million profit 2011 12 r843 million loss 2012 13 r1 2 billion loss 2013 14 r2 6 billion loss 2014 15 r5 6 billion loss 2015 16 r1 5 billion loss 2016 17 r5 6 billion loss 2017 18 r5 7 billion loss these numbers were taken from the airline s annual reports by wayne van zijl a senior lecturer in accounting at the university of the witwatersrand newspaper reports describe saa as financially crippled and bankrupt needing at least r31 billion about 2 billion equivalent to its annual revenues over the next two years just to keep flying compared to eskom this is pocket change according to energy expert ted blom the utility will need a government bailout of r200 billion to stay in business it already owes r420 billion on two new coal fired mega power stations that have been plagued by corruption cost overruns delays and even design faults these stations were given proudly african names medupi and kusile the first is running at one sixth of its planned capacity while the second is still not operating some believe that the two projects should simply be abandoned and their costs written off south africa used to have the cheapest power in the world that was back when the united nations considered us to be world enemy number one and we had more boycotts against us than iran or north korea mainly from western nations such as socialist france canada jimmy carter s usa the netherlands our mother nation and of course the scandinavian countries that financed outright urban terrorism against us we had to be energy independent the one thing that we had in abundance besides gold and platinum was coal so the old government and the eskom engineers built a series of coal fired stations next to coal deposits with fuel delivered by conveyor belt right from the mines we also built the sasol oil from coal factories that partially met our need for gasoline while the oil companies supplied us with the rest from secret sources that slipped through the oil embargo in the western cape which was far from any coal we built the koeberg nuclear generator using french technology therefore when nelson mandela was sworn in as president in 1994 after whites had been hoodwinked into believing that everyone will now have equal rights south africa and eskom had some 16 major power stations that produced a surplus of electricity no one suspected that within a little more than a decade we would have blackouts and an energy crisis that gets worse every year there were no design faults in our older power stations the collapse of eskom south african airways the railway company transnet the south african broadcasting corporation and other is the result of anti white animus and corruption when the anc installed its cronies throughout the system the first thing they did was fire most of the white engineers and replace them with overpaid corporate politicians they had no technical expertise so they hired foreign consultants the american company mckinsey has fully participated in the corruption and looting at eskom last year mckinsey supposedly apologized and repaid r1 billion 74 million at the time to the electricity utility mckinsey collaborated with a gupta linked company trillian to fleece eskom of tens of millions of dollars in consultancy fees as recounted in stephen hofstatter s book the collusion began in 2012 after a golf course meeting between two indians gupta insider kuben moodley and niven pillay years ago when i worked in the standard bank treasury in johannesburg mr pillay had been there and had won a large bonus doing dodgy deals in the foreign exchange market of the kind that sent a few white traders to prison later i saw his name crop up as the ceo of city power the utility that buys power from eskom for the city of johannesburg i remember thinking that affirmative action can work wonders even for indians in south africa s industrial heartland the gauteng province around johannesburg and pretoria indians have a higher per capita income than whites they are considered black and therefore qualify for affirmative action so if there is one ethnic group that has really thrived within the anc s elaborate anti white system it is indians indians seem to thrive in africa because they themselves come from a third world or non western country and seem to understand the greed conquers all mentality of africans as long as you wave a wad of cash or an anonymous transfer to an offshore middle eastern bank account in front of an african he will do what you ask sometimes indians face a backlash in march black radical julius malema of the economic freedom fighters eff party accused indians of racism but recanted only three days later in a speech on the need for unity against whites he reason why they are threatened by unity of africans coloureds and indians is because they know when we are united we will not be dominated by white monopoly capital because whether you are indian whether you are coloured and you might think you are closer to whites whiteness doesn t like you it oppressed you before it will forever oppress you anti white solidarity may not continue forever but it made atul ajay and rajesh tony gupta dollar billionaires they are rumored to have bribed the minister of home affairs malusi gigabi to grant them south african citizenship with dual indian south african citizenship and their proceeds from government business the guptas bought up a whole city block in a posh johannesburg suburb saxonwold and converted it into the gupta compound of four mansions with enough garages to park their spectacular fleet of ferraris lamborghinis and bentleys the guptas shady rags to riches story even caught the attention of the new york times which is usually loathe to criticize our multiracial utopia the title of the times article reflects the now almost universal admission that the anc regime has become typically african in gupta brothers rise and fall the tale of a sullied a n c the subtitle reads an indian family rose to the heights of power and fortune in south africa with the help of eager officials in the legendary party of nelson mandela in one sweetheart deal the guptas not only signed an exclusive and one sided contract to supply fuel to eskom from the optimum coal mine but even got the power utility partially to finance their purchase of the mine from the swiss israeli south african magnate ivan glasenberg shortly before the deadline for a payment of r2 15 billion the guptas were r600 million short eskom simply transferred the money to the mine as an advance payment for coal still to be delivered which enabled the guptas to meet the payment john maseko was a gupta security guard and chauffeur he was so impressed by all the important people from the highest echelons of government visiting the gupta compound to collect bribes or favors that he started recording their movements including the license plates of their vehicles aware that he was privy to glimpses of south africa s center of power mr maseko noted his impressions in a diary mr hofstatter dedicates an entire chapter to him in licence to loot under the title what the driver saw however it was the famous gupta wedding that really made headlines on may 1 2013 a gupta daughter vega married aakahs jahajgarhia in a lavish hindu ceremony for which the guptas booked the five star sun city resort north east of pretoria they flew in 100 guests from india who landed at waterkloof air force base and never went through passport control then to be whisked to their luxury accommodations the wedding is rumored to have cost r30 million slightly more than 2 million of money destined for a failed land reform program in the free state the province paid r500 million 35 million to build an all black affirmative action dairy farm but it never got off the ground with most of the money landing in the guptas dubai bank account south african whites have become inured to the totalitarian extravagance of black rule they mostly accept being pushed off the highway by the so called blue light brigades transporting anc politicians and have grown accustomed to family members of those politicians becoming instantly rich through miraculous business deals but the waterkloof air force base episode somehow rekindled atavistic memories of afrikaner power when the base housed a few hundred french mirage planes able to strike anywhere in the subcontinent hence the outcry when a trio of northern indian immigrants and their hindu guests somehow invaded our once proud country that had fought the british colonial armies during the boer war and had helped defeat erwin rommel in the north african desert if it hadn t been for the ostentatious wedding the guptas might still have been here amassing more millions leaking from our africanized state but eventually the big four south african banks standard absa nedbank and first national refused to touch gupta money citing reputational risk that made it harder to make transfers to off shore companies in the zero tax gulf states but the guptas continued to use the local branch from the home country the bank of baroda the guptas also maintained a local public company oakbay investments which housed their holdings in the it firm sahara computers which supplied government departments and schools the guptas started getting bad publicity even in our mainstream liberal media that usually hold up whites and racism as the root of all evil at first they paid off some radical black groups such as black first land first to lean on journalists and ran a muck raking social media campaign against them at the height of this infowar the guptas hired a well known london pr firm bell pottinger to smear all south african whites and cast the guptas in the role of innocent victims of a racist white elite clinging to their ill gotten apartheid gains a high powered lead partner in bell pottinger victoria geoghegan devised a plan whereby the gupta company oakbay would be portrayed as a victim of white monopoly capital bell pottinger used a barrage of press releases social media and social media bots to stir up hatred against white monopoly capital and south african whites in general the phrase white monopoly capital is straight from the lexicon of the south african communist party whose theorists have for decades maintained that real freedom and equality will come to south africa only after the assets of white capitalists have been nationalized and redistributed to the african masses in fact this is more or less the official policy of the two most radical black parties now taking part in elections the eff economic freedom fighters under julius malema and blf black first land first led by andile mngxitama bell pottinger focused a lot of its attacks on afrikaner businessman johann rupert the heir to his father anton s tobacco and luxury goods empire perhaps the pr firm reasoned that afrikaners in general attract bad publicity from the international media so it would not be difficult to smear an afrikaner billionaire a key part of the campaign was to draw attention away from the guptas whose corrupt and outlandish deals were constantly making headlines the gupta scandals were too big to hide and the smear campaign blew up this effectively sank bell pottinger but the mastermind miss geoghegan has apparently found a new job at the pr firm thoburns its founder says that the moment he met her he was immediately struck by her intelligence and personal integrity the current president of south africa cyril ramaphosa was a beneficiary of bee deals that took him from communist trade unionist to millionaire businessman according to the website businesstech ramaphosa is now the 16th richest man in south africa with a net worth of r6 4 billion about 460 million mr ramaphosa had barely settled into the presidency when it was revealed that his son andile had received a payment of r500 000 thought to be a bribe from gavin watson s notorious bosasa corporation a spokesperson for the president told the media that ramaphosa sr did not need to disclose the financial interests of his son because he was not a dependent child it sounds a lot like the response from former eskom ceo matshela koko during the billion dollar babe scandal even though mr ramaphosa s son is suspected of simply being a proxy for himself in like manner jacob zuma s son duduzane was a business associate of the guptas and also became an overnight billionaire during a meeting in 2009 also attended by tony gupta jacob zuma is reputed to have told a senior government bureaucrat duduzane is my only child involved with money i will appreciate it if you would help him wherever you could when zuma jr crashed his porsche killing a passenger in the other vehicle he phoned tony gupta even before alerting the police if an afrikaner organization had not threatened to privately prosecute him for culpable homicide he would have got off scot free the state declined to charge him with reckless driving having largely plundered the state and state owned corporations the anc is now setting its sights on pension funds south africa s government pension fund managed by the pic public investment commissioner is already mired in scandals for buying stock in non listed private companies at inflated prices effectively fleecing the fund one such series of scandals involves another indian iqbal survé who got the pic to fund his takeover of a major media group and other businesses the china development bank is supposed to step in and bail out eskom because the sa government is running out of money what china will get for the rescue is still unclear however there is talk that as an alternative form of finance the anc regime will make a law forcing private pension funds to buy bonds issued by eskom these would be known as prescribed assets which all pension funds would have to carry in their portfolios yet another illegitimate way to prop up an illegitimate system at some point liberalism and african corruption intersect liberals are convinced that all people are the same regardless of race culture or ethnicity income inequality is a sign of past discrimination and that is why we must have affirmative action and its south african version bee south africans swear by bee but a system in which white companies hand out free shares to politically connected blacks creates an elaborate web of legalized corruption for now the gravy train will continue as the anc and its thousands of cronies spend four centuries of savings accumulated by mainly white south africans in any normal country an avalanche of corruption scandals in the press would bring down the government or what would be more likely in africa lead to a muzzled press however south africa s newspapers do not have much influence on anc voters because the papers are read mainly by whites and by educated blacks many of whom are themselves engaged in corruption or directly benefit from the anti white system the most politically influential media are the state radio and television created by the former white government that reach tens of millions of blacks in african languages the sabc south african broadcasting corporation is so tightly controlled by the anc and its cronies that it poses no threat either it does not report scandals or presents them as partisan controversies not to be taken seriously any suspicion that the major western powers would step in to curtail south africa s runaway corruption was effectively dispelled earlier this year when a document was leaked to the johannesburg sunday times it consisted of a letter by american british german dutch and swiss diplomats impressing upon mr ramaphosa that he should do something to curtail corruption if he wanted further foreign investment in the country stung by such imperialist interference in the affairs of an independent african country the anc jettisoned its nominally pro business mask in favor of its traditional afro marxist rhetoric in a statement the anc condemns this dramatic holier than thou stance of these former colonizers and we would not like to relate to them on the history of master slave relations the five western powers promptly assured the anc that it had been misunderstood and that they were not worried about corruption in south africa their embassies issued a joint statement essentially saying they had never taken official notice of corruption in south africa its conclusion we have strongly supported south africa s drive to attract foreign investment from the start and we will continue to do so in the future we are happy with the positive engagement we have had with the south african government and with civil society partners the german ambassador in south africa martin schäfer is a kind of cheerleader for the anc and has even celebrated the east german communist contribution to toppling the former white government as part of a rosa luxemburg foundation event on april 11 2019 felicitous opening of an exhibition on east germans contribution to the anc s freedom struggle against apartheid at liliesleaf with rosaluxstiftung last night complexities and contradictions of history made comprehensible memories coming alive with many zeitzeugen present pic twitter com qrxrzzm61m martin schäfer ambschaefer april 12 2019 i suppose daimler benz and bmw are making millions selling their most expensive models to south africa s looting class while our national capital disappears down the black hole of anc corruption the germans must be having a good laugh at our expense we south african whites stand alone no western power nor russia china or japan dares to speak out against the staggering levels of corruption in south africa and other african countries but we do we may have lost our country and most of our assets however as leftists are so fond of saying we speak truth to power we are at least making a record of that truth

seventh floor desk early on a thursday morning the skyscrapers of downtown boston crowding the windows behind him on a laptop in the nearly empty office he worked on code for a webpage he was developing for his employer the learning materials company houghton mifflin harcourt in half an hour he needed to join a conference call about changes to the company s website he had been at houghton mifflin harcourt for four months coding he liked meetings not so much that s one thing i wasn t warned about when it comes to the corporate world he said so many meetings tillman french 26 grew up in a detroit neighborhood where few people around him had jobs he received an associate degree hoping to eventually get a bachelor s and work as a financial adviser instead he bounced from one unfulfilling job to the next in the hospitality and restaurant industries in the fall of 2017 he moved to boston and enrolled in a community college planning to transfer to a four year program ryan tillman french at his desk in houghton mifflin harcourt s downtown boston offices courtesy the hechinger report one day a friend forwarded an email about resilient coders a boot camp that trains people of color for web development and software engineering jobs on a lark tillman french went to a resilient coders hackathon and the passionate staff there sold him on the opportunity after he finished the 14 week program he said he had over two dozen interviews three employers asked him back only houghton mifflin harcourt made an offer several years ago tillman french s résumé would likely have ended up in the trash until last summer houghton mifflin harcourt screened out web developer applicants who lacked a four year degree houghton mifflin harcourt wasn t alone in that practice the previous decade saw a spike in the number of job listings requiring a bachelor s degree even for so called middle skills jobs think executive secretaries production supervisors it help desk workers that have traditionally been filled by workers with an associate degree or less analysts say that this degree inflation as they call it has shrunk opportunities for upward mobility for americans without four year degrees but now some workforce organizations researchers and regional civic leaders are pushing back persuading companies to look beyond academic credentials and to instead hire people based on their skills a growing number of businesses are listening in the past few years apple google ibm and other high profile companies have stripped the bachelor s degree requirement from many of their positions if this movement continues to gather steam researchers say it could aid not only individual job seekers but also the u s economy by helping businesses hold onto workers and by boosting the middle class degree inflation in 2014 the labor market analysis firm burning glass technologies tried to capture the extent of degree inflation the firm compared the percentage of people in a given occupation say executive assistant who have a bachelor s degree with the percentage of job listings for that occupation requiring a bachelor s degree who you have working for you and who you want to have working for you in the future aren t always the same said burning glass ceo matthew sigelman sigelman found that 19 percent of current executive assistants had a bachelor s degree but that 65 percent of job listings for the position asked for one a credentials gap of 46 percent in surveying broader groups of occupations burning glass found a credentials gap of 26 percent for management jobs 21 percent for computer and math jobs and 13 percent for sales jobs in late 2017 a research project led by the harvard business school a workforce organization called grads of life and the consulting firm accenture concluded in a report dismissed by degrees that employers appear to be closing off their access to the two thirds of the u s workforce that does not have a four year college degree the researchers estimated that 6 2 million jobs were at risk of degree inflation they cited research showing that the proportion of job listings requiring a four year degree increased by more than 10 percentage points from 2007 to 2010 that timespan should look familiar the great recession lasted from december 2007 to june 2009 unemployment spiked and employers stocked up on college graduates without having to pay a premium in wages some of that is legitimate where the job is getting more technical said dismissed by degrees co author joe fuller a harvard business school professor but employers want more than technical skills they want characteristics like attention to detail problem solving working with a team one of the major reasons degree inflation is so common is because employers use it as proxy for those kinds of soft skills fuller said related out of poverty into the middle class using a four year degree as a proxy for employability shuts out the most economically vulnerable job seekers it hurts employers too fuller and his harvard colleague researcher manjari raman found in their report degree holders command an 11 to 30 percent wage premium yet fail to justify that premium in productivity and other outcomes it takes longer to fill jobs when filtering for four year degrees and degree holders change jobs more quickly nonetheless according to harvard s survey of 600 business and human resource leaders 61 percent of respondents reported tossing resumes without four year degrees even if the applicant was qualified that survey also revealed that 63 percent of respondents had trouble filling middle skills jobs andy van kleunen ceo of the national skills coalition attributed that trouble to public policies that push bachelor s degrees as a one size fits all solution rather than training workers for specific middle skill positions the national skills coalition which lobbies policymakers and employers to invest in workers skills wants federal pell grants to be available not just for students seeking degrees but also for workers who want to take short term courses that they could apply on the job immediately but part of employers inability to fill middle skills jobs can be attributed to degree inflation fuller s report encouraged employers to push back against the trend once the logic of resisting degree inflation takes root in an organization it soon permeates different aspects of the organization s culture and eventually embeds itself at the heart of its strategy the report states a 1 percent market after years of being criticized for a lack of diversity companies especially in the technology world are looking for ways to make their workplaces more inclusive and a tight labor market there were more than 7 million job openings in the u s as of february has employers in many sectors scrambling for talent for decades at many companies that i worked for i wasn t allowed to hire unless somebody had a four year degree said trish torizzo the chief information officer for houghton mifflin harcourt but today she said supply is so low that people are almost being forced to think more creatively about how they operate houghton mifflin harcourt stripped the four year degree requirement from information technology positions including web developer last summer and the number of applications that made it through their initial screening doubled to screen candidates the company looks for a tech stack a list of programming languages and tools a candidate knows houghton mifflin harcourt then revisited hiring practices for sales positions which are heavy on soft skills at the urging of roberta rainville the vice president for talent acquisitions rainville knew it was time for a change when the company found itself unable to hire a great candidate for a sales position they interviewed splendidly she said and then it was well i want to hire them and i was like yeah you can t and they re like why not and i m like because your job description says bachelor s degree required i said that s got togo related are apprenticeships the new on ramps to good jobs rainville had to persuade 10 people from the sales leadership team before she could make the change some folks were like we can t take the bachelor s degree off we re sending the wrong message to our teacher population that we re selling to she said ultimately everyone signed off and in september the company stripped the four year degree requirement from some of its sales jobs and three months later did the same for software engineering jobs now 11 percent of applicants who make it through the interview process for an entry level sales position have no credential beyond a high school diploma another 11 percent have an associate degree previously all had bachelor s degrees as the company retools its pipeline it is working with organizations in boston communities hoping to attract job applicants it had previously failed to reach so far houghton mifflin s relationship with resilient coders has resulted in the company hiring tillman french and another web developer resilient coders founder david delmar has offered to tailor part of the organization s curriculum to houghton mifflin harcourt s needs resilient coders has already built a curriculum for wayfair a rapidly growing home furnishings company that generated 6 8 billion in revenue last year a goal that we ve set something we think it s reasonable to achieve in the next couple of seasons is to have potentially as much as half of entry level software developers come from boot camps whereas historically it s been 100 percent out of universities said deborah poole wayfair s global head of talent acquisition in late march wayfair hosted researchers employers and representatives of boston s economic development office at an event called untapped to release a research report on redefining hiring in the area the report is part of a regional effort to bring economic opportunity to bostonians who lack a four year degree more than 50 percent of adults in the city there is a huge amount of talent in this market that we are not talking to poole said when the time came for audience questions the first to speak up was delmar from resilient coders he asked a panel including city leaders researchers and executives a question that was met with silence followed by nervous laughter is it time will it ever be time to ban the b a requirement from coding jobs closing the gap with more than 20 four year colleges and universities boston is known as a college town but only 25 percent of the city s black and latino adults have a bachelor s degree and the boston metro area ranks sixth in the nation for income inequality the regional economy might be thriving but many of its jobs are taken by people who come from outside massachusetts when it comes to the labor market said marybeth campbell executive director of skillworks a workforce group dedicated to low income low skilled bostonians our two year community colleges are competing with our four year schools and those four year schools are competing with three or four schools here harvard mit the staff

segregated america your networks are going to be looking the same as you most of the time the four year degree requirement is a habit diallo said but habits change so what if it becomes a habit that

four year degree dipped a quarter of a percentage point for every 1 percent drop in a region s unemployment rate that raises a troubling question if employers turn to skill based hiring during a tight labor market will they start hiring based on four year degrees again during the next economic downturn that s the question that keeps me up at night grads of life principal elyse rosenblum said with a chuckle and why we are working so hard and so fast to try to instill these practices the other lingering question is whether nondegree hires will stay and advance at their workplaces that is

messenger chief financial officer with that i ll turn the call over to dale dale francescon chairman and co chief executive officer thank you scott today on the call i will review our operating highlights and business updates rob will then discuss our business and markets in more detail afterwards dave will follow up with further information on our financial results balance sheet and outlook following our prepared remarks we will open the lines for questions while 2019 started with the same muted buyer interest that characterized much of the second half of last year solid momentum across our national home building platform began to build as the quarter progressed by the end of the quarter we were experiencing an overall stabilization in demand trends along with better affordability across our business this welcome uptick has continued into the second quarter in the first quarter of 2019 we increased home sales revenues by 33 to 523 million and grew net new home contracts by 35 to a record 1 858 homes this progress was largely driven by our successful expansion into lower price point homes operationally we continued focusing our efforts on streamlining operations and process improvements to improve core profitability while expanding wade jurney homes asset light fast turning business model into new as well as existing geographies looking more closely at our operating metrics our improved first quarter revenues were driven by a 77 increase in deliveries to 1 663 homes versus 941 a year ago excluding the impact of the wade jurney homes acquisition deliveries from our century communities branded business increased 13 year over year this substantial improvement in revenues helped us increase our gross margin dollars to 104 million despite the increasing costs of home construction and incremental incentives as one of our primary focus areas we made further progress managing down sg a which as a percent of home sales revenues improved 120 basis points to 13 2 in the first quarter 2019 compared to 14 3 in the prior year quarter this improvement is the result of our national platform and expanded scale which has allowed us to drive enhancements throughout our business as a reminder sg a as a percent of home sales revenues is seasonally highest in the first quarter and will decline as the year progresses assuming stable market conditions in the first quarter we executed a record 1 858 net new home contracts compared to 1 378 net new home contracts in the prior year quarter our homes in backlog increased 35 to 2 376 homes at the end of the first quarter with a dollar value of 718 million down slightly year over year and consistent with the shift in our business to more entry level product mix we achieved a 25 decline in asp over the same period last year in line with our expectations given increased entry level offerings in our legacy offerings and the continued regional expansion of our wade jurney homes brand as a supplement to our core business the continued penetration of our mortgage title services and insurance offerings to create a one stop solution for century s home buyers remains one of our key focus areas for 2019 even with the recent slowdown that the industry has experienced we remain confident about underlying housing fundamentals and the overall economic conditions the years of double digit price increases are over however we believe we are well positioned for continued success due to our diverse national geographic footprint and our concentration of affordable homes at lower prince points these strong attributes are reinforced by the proven ability of our experienced and cycle tested team to source land control costs and strategically deploy capital into sound investments with attractive returns as we move into the second quarter we will continue to generate core profitability streamline century s operations in our legacy and wade jurney homes businesses and prudently invest capital to further enhance returns to our shareholders i d now like to turn the call over to rob to discuss our markets and business in greater detail rob francescon co chief executive officer thank you dale and good afternoon everyone our markets continue to exhibit solid fundamentals and we are encouraged by the improving trends in traffic and contracts as the months progressed in the quarter lower interest rates have helped to mitigate some of the affordability challenges across the country although some markets remain more constrained primarily parts of california and the southeast we continue to employ the use of incentives where we feel it is necessary however indicators such as household formations employment and population numbers all remain healthy encouragingly the average month s supply across our legacy markets decreased to 2 3 months since our last earnings call these positive economic indicators give us confidence in the longer term housing story now looking more closely at our markets starting with our texas region houston was a significant driver of the excellent results we saw in this region during the first quarter helping to generate a 54 improvement in net contracts a 33 year over year increase in home sales revenues and a 54 increase in deliveries in texas during the quarter our absorption pace increased over 110 and we closed out a number of communities throughout the region which will be replaced by new larger and lower price point communities opening throughout the balance of the year the success in our texas region continues to validate our company wide strategy to pivot to lower price point homes in regard to the mountain region our home sales revenues and deliveries increased 10 and 7 respectively year over year in the first quarter this region followed the national trend experienced month by month sequential improvement in traffic and contracts as the quarter progressed our las vegas and colorado markets have held up well as has salt lake city which john burns recently highlighted as one of the top performing markets in the country throughout our mountain region we expect to open 11 new communities during the second quarter that will positively affect our net new contracts as the year progresses in our west region lower interest rates have helped to improve the tight affordability we saw earlier this year and in the later portion of 2018 year to date demand has improved throughout the region particularly in the bay area and seattle where employment growth is promising in higher paying job sectors in our bay area division alone we are scheduled to open three new communities during the second quarter which will collectively generate nearly 1 100 closings over the next few years southern california which is our smallest division in the region has a focus on growth to achieve operational scale we have and will continue to open a number of new communities that will position us to capitalize on what we view as stabilizing improvement of homebuilding activity in the west in the southeast region our home sales revenues and deliveries increased by 20 and 60 year over year respectively during the first quarter charlotte and nashville have seen steady improvements in traffic while atlanta has seen lower than usual seasonal activity which we believe is temporary we have continued to utilize incentives to drive demand in this region where new community openings have been most impacted by weather we continue to invest capital and other resources into wade jurney homes asset light entry level business line to support its growth as discussed last quarter this includes process enhancements and geographic expansion in fact generated closings during the first quarter in the new markets of texas arizona and indiana where phoenix has been particularly strong and the existing markets demand in the carolinas continues to be very positive on our last call we also provided updates on changes to our sales approach and our wade jurney homes brand whereby we are now selling homes later in the construction cycle this change to our sales strategy is progressing well and we continue to believe that it will not have a material impact to the timing of closings in this spec based business model as evidenced by a 15 year over year increase in deliveries we continue to anticipate that our implementation of enhanced systems processes and procedures including the back office conversion will be largely completed by the end of the third quarter throughout 2019 we will continue to focus heavily on creating additional efficiencies in our operations maintaining consistent strength in our balance sheet sourcing accretive investments building and closing homes on our nearly 38 000 owned and controlled lots and expanding wade jurney homes into carefully selected areas i will now turn the call over to dave who will provide greater detail on our financial results and outlook david messenger chief financial officer thank you rob during the first quarter of 2019 our adjusted net income was to 18 4 million or 0 60 per diluted share compared to 0 75 per diluted share in the prior year quarter net income for the quarter was 17 1 million or 0 56 per diluted share we experienced benefits from our continued efforts to streamline our operations despite margin and bottom line pressure driven by increasing home costs to higher incentives and integration initiatives ebitda in the first quarter increased by 11 to 38 6 million adjusted ebitda in the first quarter of 2019 was 40 4 million compared to 42 3 million in the prior year quarter gross margin for the first quarter was 17 1 primarily due to the use of incentives and incurring the remaining 1 7 million of purchase accounting charges pertaining to the wade jurney homes acquisition adjusted homebuilding gross margin percentage was 19 8 compared to 23 2 in the prior year quarter which benefited from a particularly favorable product mix when we look at our backlog of deliveries for the next couple of quarters we see adjusted gross margins trending upwards such that we see the full year adjusted gross margin to be in the range of 20 to 21 sg a as a percent of homebuilding revenues improved to 13 2 in the first quarter compared to 14 3 in the prior year quarter the 110 basis point improvement was primarily due to process enhancements tighter cost controls and scale benefits derived from our expanding homebuilding platform compared to the fourth quarter our variable costs were consistent at 3 6 of homebuilding revenues and our fixed spend was only 700 000 higher sequentially due to certain legal settlements severance costs and the start of the wade jurney homes back office system conversion reducing our sg a as a percent of homebuilding revenues remains one of our primary focus items for the remainder of 2019 and we expect that it will improve as the year progresses such that we see improvement on a year over year basis in the first quarter of 2019 our financial services business continued to scale and contributed 1 6 million in pre tax income compared to 1 2 million of pre tax income in the prior year quarter now turning to our balance sheet and liquidity as of march 31 2019 we had total long term debt of 1 1 billion with total liquidity of 416 million including 63 million of cash and 353 million of availability on our unsecured revolver with 875 million of stockholders equity our net homebuilding debt to net capital ratio stood at 53 6 at march 31 due to the typical sequential buildup of work in process and backlog and certain land investments we are targeting our net homebuilding debt to net capital ratio to be in the upper 40 range by year end with greater visibility following the first quarter we are introducing our full year 2019 outlook we expect deliveries to be in the range of 7 000 to 8 000 homes and home sales revenues to be in the range of 2 2 billion to 2 5 billion in regards to our tax rate for 2019 we expect to incur an income tax rate of approximately 26 5 compared to 25 in 2018 we expect to deliver another year of earnings improvement as we utilize our expanded scale to drive operational efficiencies in our business while strengthening our current positions in legacy markets we have a strong backlog of homes and land positions to achieve our strategic growth objectives for 2019 in closing we are confident in our outlook for growth in 2019 and are well on the path to capturing another solid year of profitability and improvement across our national footprint operator please open the lines for questions questions answers operator our first question comes from the line of thomas maguire with zelman associates please proceed with your question thomas maguire zelman and associates analyst hey guys great job really strong results this quarter i guess just first on the wade jurney side of the business just to revisit some of the transitory repositioning you called out there last quarter that s waiting on the orders just where we are in digesting it was it less of an impact this quarter versus last quarter and when should we be all the way through that and then i guess if we just take a step back i mean timing issues aside how do you guys feel about demand in that piece of the business and is the 15 closings growth the right way to think about the longer term volume potential there dale francescon chairman and co chief executive officer thomas this is dale the impact of that change in the sales is actually going to continue to a certain extent through the third quarter and then by that time it will be all washed through we still think that s the right decision the 15 closing growth was nice to see as we go forward we re going to expect to see more increase in that as we continue to expand into new geographies and continue getting closings out of those as far as the business i mean we still remain completely bullish on it we think that there is a tremendous growth opportunity for us in this area and we re continuing to deploy resources to enhance the business and grow the business thomas maguire zelman and associates analyst got it thanks and then just on the incentive environment and how that affects margins understanding that you re still using them kind of per the prepared comments but can you talk about how incentive levels trended through the quarter and maybe where we are versus what you guys would think about normalized and then just on the pickup in march and expected through the year is that a function of incentives having been peeled back year to date or what s driving that dale francescon chairman and co chief executive officer as things progress for us through the quarter i think it is probably relatively similar to what other people have said that they saw but each month of the quarter sequentially improved both from a standpoint of actual number of net sales as well as sales absorptions january was by far the worst month we were year over year off by about a third and then it continued to build from there and has continued into april and when we look at our absorptions in april they were consistent with april of 2018 which was a pretty strong comp so when we looked at that while we are still having some cautiousness in the market overall we have felt that we have been able to reduce incentives so we have done that and so we ve slowed them down we still have them as we need them on a case by case basis but overall we re certainly feeling much better about the marketplace thomas maguire zelman and associates analyst got it thanks have a good one operator our next question comes from the line of michael rehaut with jp morgan please proceed with your question michael rehaut j p morgan analyst thanks good afternoon everyone congrats on the results first question i just wanted to perhaps talk about wade jurney from another angle and i don t know if it s the right one obviously there s still growth but when you look at and still expected a good amount of growth obviously as the opportunity geographically kind of still presents itself but i m just kind of looking at closings over the last three quarters now plus or minus 600 and i m just kind of wondering if that s kind of a good annualized quarterly run rate and then on top of that you would add perhaps that 10 perhaps a little bit better type of growth is that the right way to think about the trajectory there or given that at points wade jurney has had more of even a stronger growth rate or a step function we could expect something bigger because obviously the law of numbers and you re rolling this out and you don t want to perhaps bite off more than you can chew just trying to think about the right way to think about the trajectory dale francescon chairman and co chief executive officer michael i think as we re continuing to grow that platform we re going to continue to see growth somewhere in the 10 to 15 range going forward and we feel very confident that that number s achievable over the next several quarters michael rehaut j p morgan analyst secondly on the community count i guess you ended the quarter at 125 obviously ex wade jurney how should we think about that number through the end of the year david messenger chief financial officer hi mike this is dave i think as we said on our last call that while we haven t provided any specific guidance on community count we definitely have lots under development and communities under development that we re going to be looking to open throughout the course of 2019 as rob mentioned we have double digit communities opening up here in the west and in the mountain region in the second quarter of this year and so we are looking to see growth but a lot of that is really going to be contingent on timing of when we do close out some of the legacy communities that we opened in years before but we do expect to see some sort of growth in our overall community count through the balance of 2019 michael rehaut j p morgan analyst i guess just another couple of quick housekeeping items here just to clarify when you said before that january was down by roughly a third was that referring more specifically to sales pace just wanted to make sure i got that right david messenger chief financial officer that s our net sales our net sales are down by about a third from january 2019 compared to january of 2018 but then we saw it sequentially improve each month throughout the quarter so we finished the quarter strong michael rehaut j p morgan analyst ok all right great thanks so much operator our next question comes from the line of alex rygiel with b riley fbr alex rygiel b riley fbr inc analyst great quarter gentlemen can you give us a little bit of help in appreciating or understanding directionally where asps will go as wade jurney continues to expand dale francescon chairman and co chief executive officer i think if you look at our backlogging and see our backlog today it s just a tad over 300 000 at 302 000 as an asp i think that you re going to seeing this based on whatever the mix is for the quarter being somewhere in that 300 to 320 type range for an asp that we re looking to do so depending on each quarter in terms of what percentage of the overall closings come out of the wade jurney homes brand versus the central communities brand will really dictate that but as you can see we ve been pretty diligent about it in the century brand bringing that price point down and looking to be bringing on lower price product and then obviously with the way journey brand it definitely helps us drive that price point down alex rygiel b riley fbr inc analyst and then coming back to your comments on adjusted home sales gross margin can you go back through directionally what you were guiding us toward david messenger chief financial officer yes from an adjusted gross margin basis we re looking at we think we ll finish the year between 20 and 21 so in the first quarter we had 19 8 and as we look at our backlog as it sits today we think that 20 to 21 is achievable for the balance of for all of 2019 alex rygiel b riley fbr inc analyst and lastly there s been a number of new entrants in the carolina marketplace have you seen any increased pressure on pricing has it changed your strategy in the carolinas at all dale francescon chairman and co chief executive officer no not really when we look at it the carolinas both in our wade jurney homes business as well as our century business where we re just in the charlotte market we ve really not seen additional pressure coming in beyond what we re just experiencing on a more national level but when we look at charlotte charlotte has rebounded from the very beginning of the year just as the rest of our business has alex rygiel b riley fbr inc analyst that s very helpful thank you operator our next question comes from the line of nishu sood with deutsche bank please proceed with your question tim daley deutsche bank analyst thanks for the time this is actually tim on for nishu thanks for the time my first question is you all were discussing the texas strategy pivoting to some more new entry level communities we noticed a few weeks ago that you were all were offering floor plans under the century flag around 160 000 which seems much more priced in line with wade product than century s so thinking about the community openings that you ll have this year how many will be offering floor plans with that level of i guess relative affordability and how are you achieving kind of the underwriting of your margins with prices that low it s really kind of more i guess century traditional style community dale francescon chairman and co chief executive officer it starts with the land positions we re buying and to answer the first part of that yes our new offerings that are coming up as we mentioned they re all generally speaking going to lower price point offerings and so they will be in that range now the 160 000 that would be on the low end of that range they would go from there to the low 200 000s and the basic focus of our strategy within houston is to keep within that low price point band as far as the offerings they re very efficient plans that have been designed specifically for that market as well as some of our other markets where we re offering the low price point of the century complete brand and we started doing this about i don t know 18 months ago or so and it s really ramping up now with the new communities that have been opening the success we re getting and as we mentioned we have several new communities that are ready to open over the second third and fourth quarter of this year that would fit that same profile tim daley deutsche bank analyst and then i guess the next question is we also noticed that you guys did i think i believe had your first national open house the weekend of kind of march 23 and 24 just focusing more on finish spec side of things so just curious how did that go how many closings in the quarter came from that and did that weigh on the margin the gross margins that you guys delivered this quarter or just kind of the general margin profile that came out of that event dale francescon chairman and co chief executive officer yes in terms of closings for the quarter they really had no impact just given of the timing of when that was and i think you ll see as we ve enhanced our marketing efforts you ll see more national campaigns that we ll be rolling out on a consistent basis that ll have different themes and that s just as we ve continued to grow and evolve as a company it starts making sense to be able to do things on a national scale as opposed to just doing it on an individual market basis so you ll see us do more and more of that tim daley deutsche bank analyst and then just one final one if i could wade jurney has a pretty unique lot acquisition strategy picking off some lots and parcels from kind of more outlying areas that maybe more traditional builders would maybe shy away from so just curious during the volatility of the past few months we ve heard of anecdotes builders may be taking a pause in their land acquisition strategy particularly in further out markets where this kind of wade model really does work so were you able to kind of maybe scoop up some additional lots this quarter or find any or in general kind of was the land market receptive to maybe lowering prices or giving better terms as you kind of shift toward this asset right strategy dale francescon chairman and co chief executive officer when we look at on the wade jurney home side i don t know that i would say we ve seen a specific impact over the last say 90 or 120 days we ve been very active in the land market adding to our positions we re very specific on the types of deals that work there they need to be finished lots they re typically done on a rolling option basis so that we re not bringing them on balance sheet and so in that area we really haven t seen much of a change on the broader business we have seen some flexibility on land sellers in terms of in some cases pricing in some cases terms and it really kind of is case by case and market by market and depends on the needs of the seller and what their motivations are tim daley deutsche bank analyst got it thanks for the time operator we now have a follow up question from the line of michael rehaut with jp morgan please proceed with your question michael rehaut j p morgan analyst hey thanks again just a couple of points of clarification dave the purchase accounting in the gross margin did i hear it right that that s now fully exhausted and going forward that adjustment is not going to be necessary david messenger chief financial officer that s correct michael rehaut j p morgan analyst and then also circling back to wade jurney with the transition and the sales process i was curious if you guys had any sense they booked still obviously pretty healthy number of orders 627 in the quarter i was curious if you had any sense of what that number might have been without the changes to the sales process what those changes might have done from in terms of suppressing a potentially bigger number david messenger chief financial officer obviously it impacted it because there s a lot of homes that we could have sold that we didn t to what that extent is we really haven t spent any time trying to figure that out because once we made the decision from a business perspective make that change we just knew that the sales were kind of going to be what they re going to be and we ve really been focusing on making sure that we get our closings and that we don t have inventory that remains unsold and that hasn t changed at all so as i indicated earlier i mean we re still committed to that strategy we think it s the right strategy and how many more sales we could have we haven t really focused on it we re really more focused on selling homes when we can close them michael rehaut j p morgan analyst akes sense i just figured i d ask thanks very much operator ladies and gentlemen at this time there are not further questions i would like to turn the floor back to dale for any closing comments dale francescon chairman and co chief executive officer thank you operator and thank you again to everyone for joining us on today s call we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter operator duration 41 minutes call

after a sluggish start this year that had sparked fears of recession the u s economy has taken a sweeping turn for the better consumer spending has picked up stocks are back at record levels and the outlook for trade has brightened along with the global economy a big political advantage for incumbent president donald trump just as the 2020 presidential campaign begins to intensify confirmation of the good news came friday with the latest monthly jobs numbers showing the economy produced 263 000 new jobs last month average wages rose at a solid pace and the nation s unemployment rate fell to 3 6 per cent that s the lowest in almost 50 years the number of jobs in the economy has now grown for 103 months a record at a remarkably steady rate through two very different presidencies stocks are at or near record levels too as the president often notes the news bolstered president donald trump for whom a strong economy provides a necessary but perhaps not sufficient basis for reelection trump cheered the report declaring in a twitter message jobs jobs jobs when we have an economy that maybe is the best economy we ve ever had people tend to like you trump said friday during a meeting with the visiting prime minister of slovakia i ll be running on the economy trump declared on friday and why wouldn t he the president s chief economic adviser larry kudlow said the united states has entered a very strong and durable prosperity cycle he gave all the credit to his boss he is president of the whole economy by most measures the u s economy is in solid shape it is expanding at a roughly 3 pace businesses are posting more jobs than there are unemployed workers and wage growth long the economy s weak spot has picked up all these trends are helping lift a broader swath of the population than in the first five years or so after the great recession low income workers are actually seeing healthy wage gains larger than everyone else s in march the poorest one quarter of workers were earning 4 4 more than a year earlier according to data compiled by the federal reserve bank of atlanta the richest one quarter were up 3 lower income workers had started to outpace their higher paid counterparts in 2015 so it s not a trump phenomenon and part of the increase has occurred because of minimum wage hikes by more than two dozen states the news isn t good for everyone all that deepens two of the great conundrums of the trump presidency how does his approval rating stay so bad when the economy is so good and what might that forecast about his prospects for reelection indeed a normal president with these economic numbers would have job approval somewhere in the vicinity of 60 percent said republican pollster whit ayres but donald trump is a nontraditional president and he has at least at this point severed the traditional relationship between economic well being and presidential job approval currently an average of just over four in 10 americans approve of trump s performance in office a number that has fluctuated in a very narrow range since early in his presidency that said a good economy obviously helps a president running for reelection ayres said we have to see if it helps donald trump as much as it would have helped a traditional president at least since the end of world war ii economic growth rates have lined up strongly with the vote share received by the president s party ray fair a yale university economist who uses economic data to model election outcomes says that the state of the economy in the first three quarters of an election year matters more than the rest of a president s term fair s model points to a trump victory in 2020 should the economy continue along its current path however this doesn t take into account the personalities fair said trump is an unusual person at this point 18 months before election day trump s political standing is far weaker than the economic numbers would suggest the latest cnn poll finds 43 of americans approve of the way he is handling his job as president that s even as 56 say they approve of his handling of the economy marking a high for the president since he took office he receives lower marks for other issues including health care immigration and foreign policy specific candidates aside the general social survey a respected nationwide survey has found that the share of americans feeling satisfied with their finances has returned to pre recession levels in 2018 about a third expressed satisfaction with their financial situation up from 23 in 2010 about 4 in 10 said their finances had been improving over the previous few years while just 15 felt them worsening in 2010 more than twice as many said their financial situations were getting worse two factors appear to have held down trump s ability to benefit as much as his predecessors might have his personal conduct and the nature of the current economy a large share of american voters find trump repugnant and for them no amount of good economic news will change their view they re numerous enough to make a close election in 2020 highly likely beyond that the uneven nature of current prosperity gives democrats an opening to argue for spreading the wealth more equitably the moral obligation of our time is to rebuild the middle class when the middle class does well everyone does well former vice president joe biden the current democratic front runner told audiences in iowa this week regardless of whom the democrats nominate the candidate likely will use some form of that argument it s a case that finds a receptive audience among many voters a recent washington post abc poll found that by nearly 2 to 1 americans said the economic system in this country mainly works to benefit those in power rather than all people democrats overwhelmingly took that view but so did about a third of republicans the poll found workers in metro areas are still getting larger pay increases than those in smaller towns or rural areas according to the atlanta fed s data in fact that gap that has widened since trump was elected and overall income inequality hasn t narrowed the richest 5 percent of americans earned 3 4 times a median worker s pay in 2018 according to the left leaning economic policy institute that s up from 3 3 times as much in 2016 last month the government report said the african american unemployment rate was 6 7 up from a record low 5 9 last may that s more than double the rate for whites and in 2017 according to the latest data available the black white income gap widened with the typical african american household earning 40 258 while the equivalent white figure was 68 145 still the asian and latino unemployment rates hit or matched record lows in april by some measures the job market has been better in the past a much smaller proportion of americans are working than in the late 1990s the last time unemployment was nearly this low part of that is because the united states is aging and baby boomers are retiring but even among workers aged 25 through 54 which filters out the impact of retirement and increased college attendance a smaller percentage of people are working in april 79 7 had jobs that figure peaked at 81 9 back in 2000 but the democrats who are fighting to deny the republican president a second term are beginning to acknowledge the weight of their challenge since world war ii no incumbent president has ever lost reelection in a growing economy even trump s critics are forced to admit the state of the economy could help him at the ballot box relative to all the other terrible aspects of trump s record the economy is more of an asset to him said geoff garin a veteran pollster whose clients include priorities usa the most powerful super pac in democratic politics amid the largely positive news for trump friends and foes alike question whether he can stay focused on the economy as the 2020 contest plays out blessed with similarly positive news in the past he has veered into more controversial topics like immigration the russia investigation and personal attacks against his rivals democrats in fact are counting on him to change the subject the economic indicators would normally be incredibly positive for an incumbent president said jefrey pollock the pollster for democratic sen kirsten gillibrand s presidential campaign however the pollster said hopefully and somewhat rudely he can t shut his mouth still trump had been noticeably worried in the fall and earlier this year by the talk among economic forecasters about a rising risk of recession and those worries dissipating has been a great relief to the white house viewed from today s perspective the beginning of the year seems like just a bad dream said carl tannenbaum chief economist for northern trust in chicago earlier in the year tannenbaum had put the odds of recession in 2019 at 33 percent he s since lowered that to less than 20 percent and even that is partly because of statistical reasons the last recession ended in june 2009 making the current economic expansion close to 10 years old in july the economy will almost certainly break the record for the longest period of sustained growth in u s history but no economic law requires economic recessions to die of old age some countries with smaller economies have gone decades without a recession douglas holtz eakin an economist and president of the conservative leaning american action forum said that the jobs report should put to rest the notion that the economy is doomed to falter in 2019 although he added that he could easily see it in 2020 the chances go up and the biggest source would be a policy error he said noting two possibilities in which trump might help cause a downturn a trade war or another budget battle in the federal government things looked bleaker a few months ago than they actually were because of the partial government shutdown which lasted a record 35 days into late january the shutdown deepened pessimism that had set in from december s stock market woes anxieties about the slowing chinese economy aggravated by a trade war with the united states had also rattled global markets earlier this year more recently however china s growth appears to have steadied thanks partly to government support and an easing of tensions with the u s the administration and chinese leaders have stepped up negotiations toward a possible trade deal a big chinese delegation headed by beijing s top economic minister is expected to arrive in the u s next week for what could be a wrap up in talks the outlook for europe has improved as well at least for the moment europe s central bank has resumed stimulus measures to prop up the continent s growth and britain s tortured exit from the european union or brexit has been put off until the fall but the u s economy still has some soft spots manufacturing employment has cooled this year after two years of solid growth and the decline in unemployment last month from 3 8 per cent in march was in part due to a drop in the number of unemployed workers looking for jobs another point of uncertainty involves how long the steady job growth can continue recent job and wage gains have benefited many lower educated workers as well as formerly disabled workers who have come off the sidelines to fill positions and older workers are staying in the labor market helping to meet employer demands but no one knows how much lower the unemployment rate can fall or when employers will hit the wall ben herzon economist at macroeconomic advisers a leading forecasting firm shares the view of most other economists that the economic growth rate will drop from last year s 3 percent to about 2 percent this year roughly the average over the last 10 years that s a healthy rate he said but he and other economists worry about the tightened labor market and the possibility that the economy may be reaching capacity the federal reserve at the start of the year halted its interest rate hikes because of concerns of slowing growth some investors and notably also trump have called for the fed to cut rates again the fed this week kept rates steady and the new jobs report makes further cuts unlikely but if signs emerge of the economy overheating the central bank could pivot back again to raising rates the economy right now is in a good spot herzon said but there is a concern that the economy is at capacity and if you push it harder that s where we could get into problems

today on the call i will review our operating highlights and business updates rob will then discuss our business and markets in more detail afterwards dave will follow up with further information on our financial results balance sheet and outlook following our prepared remarks we will open the lines for questions while 2019 started with the same muted buyer interest that characterized much of the second half of last year solid momentum across our national home building platform began to build as the quarter progressed by the end of the quarter we were experiencing an overall stabilization in demand trends along with better affordability across our business this welcome uptick has continued into the second quarter in the first quarter of 2019 we increased home sales revenues by 33 to 523 million and grew net new home contracts by 35 to a record 1 858 homes this progress was largely driven by our successful expansion into lower price point homes operationally we continued focusing our efforts on streamlining operations and process improvements to improve core profitability while expanding wade jurney homes asset light fast turning business model into new as well as existing geographies looking more closely at our operating metrics our improved first quarter revenues were driven by a 77 increase in deliveries to 1 663 homes versus 941 a year ago excluding the impact of the wade jurney homes acquisition deliveries from our century communities branded business increased 13 year over year this substantial improvement in revenues helped us increase our gross margin dollars to 104 million despite the increasing costs of home construction and incremental incentives as one of our primary focus areas we made further progress managing down sg a which as a percent of home sales revenues improved 120 basis points to 13 2 in the first quarter 2019 compared to 14 3 in the prior year quarter this improvement is the result of our national platform and expanded scale which has allowed us to drive enhancements throughout our business as a reminder sg a as a percent of home sales revenues is seasonally highest in the first quarter and will decline as the year progresses assuming stable market conditions in the first quarter we executed a record 1 858 net new home contracts compared to 1 378 net new home contracts in the prior year quarter our homes in backlog increased 35 to 2 376 homes at the end of the first quarter with a dollar value of 718 million down slightly year over year and consistent with the shift in our business to more entry level product mix we achieved a 25 decline in asp over the same period last year in line with our expectations given increased entry level offerings in our legacy offerings and the continued regional expansion of our wade jurney homes brand as a supplement to our core business the continued penetration of our mortgage title services and insurance offerings to create a one stop solution for century s home buyers remains one of our key focus areas for 2019 even with the recent slowdown that the industry has experienced we remain confident about underlying housing fundamentals and the overall economic conditions the years of double digit price increases are over however we believe we are well positioned for continued success due to our diverse national geographic footprint and our concentration of affordable homes at lower prince points these strong attributes are reinforced by the proven ability of our experienced and cycle tested team to source land control costs and strategically deploy capital into sound investments with attractive returns as we move into the second quarter we will continue to generate core profitability streamline century s operations in our legacy and wade jurney homes businesses and prudently invest capital to further enhance returns to our shareholders i d now like to turn the call over to rob to discuss our markets and business in greater detail rob francescon co chief executive officer thank you dale and good afternoon everyone our markets continue to exhibit solid fundamentals and we are encouraged by the improving trends in traffic and contracts as the months progressed in the quarter lower interest rates have helped to mitigate some of the affordability challenges across the country although some markets remain more constrained primarily parts of california and the southeast we continue to employ the use of incentives where we feel it is necessary however indicators such as household formations employment and population numbers all remain healthy encouragingly the average month s supply across our legacy markets decreased to 2 3 months since our last earnings call these positive economic indicators give us confidence in the longer term housing story now looking more closely at our markets starting with our texas region houston was a significant driver of the excellent results we saw in this region during the first quarter helping to generate a 54 improvement in net contracts a 33 year over year increase in home sales revenues and a 54 increase in deliveries in texas during the quarter our absorption pace increased over 110 and we closed out a number of communities throughout the region which will be replaced by new larger and lower price point communities opening throughout the balance of the year the success in our texas region continues to validate our company wide strategy to pivot to lower price point homes in regard to the mountain region our home sales revenues and deliveries increased 10 and 7 respectively year over year in the first quarter this region followed the national trend experienced month by month sequential improvement in traffic and contracts as the quarter progressed our las vegas and colorado markets have held up well as has salt lake city which john burns recently highlighted as one of the top performing markets in the country throughout our mountain region we expect to open 11 new communities during the second quarter that will positively affect our net new contracts as the year progresses in our west region lower interest rates have helped to improve the tight affordability we saw earlier this year and in the later portion of 2018 year to date demand has improved throughout the region particularly in the bay area and seattle where employment growth is promising in higher paying job sectors in our bay area division alone we are scheduled to open three new communities during the second quarter which will collectively generate nearly 1 100 closings over the next few years southern california which is our smallest division in the region has a focus on growth to achieve operational scale we have and will continue to open a number of new communities that will position us to capitalize on what we view as stabilizing improvement of homebuilding activity in the west in the southeast region our home sales revenues and deliveries increased by 20 and 60 year over year respectively during the first quarter charlotte and nashville have seen steady improvements in traffic while atlanta has seen lower than usual seasonal activity which we believe is temporary we have continued to utilize incentives to drive demand in this region where new community openings have been most impacted by weather we continue to invest capital and other resources into wade jurney homes asset light entry level business line to support its growth as discussed last quarter this includes process enhancements and geographic expansion in fact generated closings during the first quarter in the new markets of texas arizona and indiana where phoenix has been particularly strong and the existing markets demand in the carolinas continues to be very positive on our last call we also provided updates on changes to our sales approach and our wade jurney homes brand whereby we are now selling homes later in the construction cycle this change to our sales strategy is progressing well and we continue to believe that it will not have a material impact to the timing of closings in this spec based business model as evidenced by a 15 year over year increase in deliveries we continue to anticipate that our implementation of enhanced systems processes and procedures including the back office conversion will be largely completed by the end of the third quarter throughout 2019 we will continue to focus heavily on creating additional efficiencies in our operations maintaining consistent strength in our balance sheet sourcing accretive investments building and closing homes on our nearly 38 000 owned and controlled lots and expanding wade jurney homes into carefully selected areas i will now turn the call over to dave who will provide greater detail on our financial results and outlook david messenger chief financial officer thank you rob during the first quarter of 2019 our adjusted net income was to 18 4 million or 0 60 per diluted share compared to 0 75 per diluted share in the prior year quarter net income for the quarter was 17 1 million or 0 56 per diluted share we experienced benefits from our continued efforts to streamline our operations despite margin and bottom line pressure driven by increasing home costs to higher incentives and integration initiatives ebitda in the first quarter increased by 11 to 38 6 million adjusted ebitda in the first quarter of 2019 was 40 4 million compared to 42 3 million in the prior year quarter gross margin for the first quarter was 17 1 primarily due to the use of incentives and incurring the remaining 1 7 million of purchase accounting charges pertaining to the wade jurney homes acquisition adjusted homebuilding gross margin percentage was 19 8 compared to 23 2 in the prior year quarter which benefited from a particularly favorable product mix when we look at our backlog of deliveries for the next couple of quarters we see adjusted gross margins trending upwards such that we see the full year adjusted gross margin to be in the range of 20 to 21 sg a as a percent of homebuilding revenues improved to 13 2 in the first quarter compared to 14 3 in the prior year quarter the 110 basis point improvement was primarily due to process enhancements tighter cost controls and scale benefits derived from our expanding homebuilding platform compared to the fourth quarter our variable costs were consistent at 3 6 of homebuilding revenues and our fixed spend was only 700 000 higher sequentially due to certain legal settlements severance costs and the start of the wade jurney homes back office system conversion reducing our sg a as a percent of homebuilding revenues remains one of our primary focus items for the remainder of 2019 and we expect that it will improve as the year progresses such that we see improvement on a year over year basis in the first quarter of 2019 our financial services business continued to scale and contributed 1 6 million in pre tax income compared to 1 2 million of pre tax income in the prior year quarter now turning to our balance sheet and liquidity as of march 31 2019 we had total long term debt of 1 1 billion with total liquidity of 416 million including 63 million of cash and 353 million of availability on our unsecured revolver with 875 million of stockholders equity our net homebuilding debt to net capital ratio stood at 53 6 at march 31 due to the typical sequential buildup of work in process and backlog and certain land investments we are targeting our net homebuilding debt to net capital ratio to be in the upper 40 range by year end with greater visibility following the first quarter we are introducing our full year 2019 outlook we expect deliveries to be in the range of 7 000 to 8 000 homes and home sales revenues to be in the range of 2 2 billion to 2 5 billion in regards to our tax rate for 2019 we expect to incur an income tax rate of approximately 26 5 compared to 25 in 2018 we expect to deliver another year of earnings improvement as we utilize our expanded scale to drive operational efficiencies in our business while strengthening our current positions in legacy markets we have a strong backlog of homes and land positions to achieve our strategic growth objectives for 2019 in closing we are confident in our outlook for growth in 2019 and are well on the path to capturing another solid year of profitability and improvement across our national footprint operator please open the lines for questions questions answers operator our first question comes from the line of thomas maguire with zelman associates please proceed with your question thomas maguire zelman and associates analyst hey guys great job really strong results this quarter i guess just first on the wade jurney side of the business just to revisit some of the transitory repositioning you called out there last quarter that s waiting on the orders just where we are in digesting it was it less of an impact this quarter versus last quarter and when should we be all the way through that and then i guess if we just take a step back i mean timing issues aside how do you guys feel about demand in that piece of the business and is the 15 closings growth the right way to think about the longer term volume potential there dale francescon chairman and co chief executive officer thomas this is dale the impact of that change in the sales is actually going to continue to a certain extent through the third quarter and then by that time it will be all washed through we still think that s the right decision the 15 closing growth was nice to see as we go forward we re going to expect to see more increase in that as we continue to expand into new geographies and continue getting closings out of those as far as the business i mean we still remain completely bullish on it we think that there is a tremendous growth opportunity for us in this area and we re continuing to deploy resources to enhance the business and grow the business thomas maguire zelman and associates analyst got it thanks and then just on the incentive environment and how that affects margins understanding that you re still using them kind of per the prepared comments but can you talk about how incentive levels trended through the quarter and maybe where we are versus what you guys would think about normalized and then just on the pickup in march and expected through the year is that a function of incentives having been peeled back year to date or what s driving that dale francescon chairman and co chief executive officer as things progress for us through the quarter i think it is probably relatively similar to what other people have said that they saw but each month of the quarter sequentially improved both from a standpoint of actual number of net sales as well as sales absorptions january was by far the worst month we were year over year off by about a third and then it continued to build from there and has continued into april and when we look at our absorptions in april they were consistent with april of 2018 which was a pretty strong comp so when we looked at that while we are still having some cautiousness in the market overall we have felt that we have been able to reduce incentives so we have done that and so we ve slowed them down we still have them as we need them on a case by case basis but overall we re certainly feeling much better about the marketplace thomas maguire zelman and associates analyst got it thanks have a good one operator our next question comes from the line of michael rehaut with jp morgan please proceed with your question michael rehaut j p morgan analyst thanks good afternoon everyone congrats on the results first question i just wanted to perhaps talk about wade jurney from another angle and i don t know if it s the right one obviously there s still growth but when you look at and still expected a good amount of growth obviously as the opportunity geographically kind of still presents itself but i m just kind of looking at closings over the last three quarters now plus or minus 600 and i m just kind of wondering if that s kind of a good annualized quarterly run rate and then on top of that you would add perhaps that 10 perhaps a little bit better type of growth is that the right way to think about the trajectory there or given that at points wade jurney has had more of even a stronger growth rate or a step function we could expect something bigger because obviously the law of numbers and you re rolling this out and you don t want to perhaps bite off more than you can chew just trying to think about the right way to think about the trajectory dale francescon chairman and co chief executive officer michael i think as we re continuing to grow that platform we re going to continue to see growth somewhere in the 10 to 15 range going forward and we feel very confident that that number s achievable over the next several quarters michael rehaut j p morgan analyst secondly on the community count i guess you ended the quarter at 125 obviously ex wade jurney how should we think about that number through the end of the year david messenger chief financial officer hi mike this is dave i think as we said on our last call that while we haven t provided any specific guidance on community count we definitely have lots under development and communities under development that we re going to be looking to open throughout the course of 2019 as rob mentioned we have double digit communities opening up here in the west and in the mountain region in the second quarter of this year and so we are looking to see growth but a lot of that is really going to be contingent on timing of when we do close out some of the legacy communities that we opened in years before but we do expect to see some sort of growth in our overall community count through the balance of 2019 michael rehaut j p morgan analyst i guess just another couple of quick housekeeping items here just to clarify when you said before that january was down by roughly a third was that referring more specifically to sales pace just wanted to make sure i got that right david messenger chief financial officer that s our net sales our net sales are down by about a third from january 2019 compared to january of 2018 but then we saw it sequentially improve each month throughout the quarter so we finished the quarter strong michael rehaut j p morgan analyst ok all right great thanks so much operator our next question comes from the line of alex rygiel with b riley fbr alex rygiel b riley fbr inc analyst great quarter gentlemen can you give us a little bit of help in appreciating or understanding directionally where asps will go as wade jurney continues to expand dale francescon chairman and co chief executive officer i think if you look at our backlogging and see our backlog today it s just a tad over 300 000 at 302 000 as an asp i think that you re going to seeing this based on whatever the mix is for the quarter being somewhere in that 300 to 320 type range for an asp that we re looking to do so depending on each quarter in terms of what percentage of the overall closings come out of the wade jurney homes brand versus the central communities brand will really dictate that but as you can see we ve been pretty diligent about it in the century brand bringing that price point down and looking to be bringing on lower price product and then obviously with the way journey brand it definitely helps us drive that price point down alex rygiel b riley fbr inc analyst and then coming back to your comments on adjusted home sales gross margin can you go back through directionally what you were guiding us toward david messenger chief financial officer yes from an adjusted gross margin basis we re looking at we think we ll finish the year between 20 and 21 so in the first quarter we had 19 8 and as we look at our backlog as it sits today we think that 20 to 21 is achievable for the balance of for all of 2019 alex rygiel b riley fbr inc analyst and lastly there s been a number of new entrants in the carolina marketplace have you seen any increased pressure on pricing has it changed your strategy in the carolinas at all dale francescon chairman and co chief executive officer no not really when we look at it the carolinas both in our wade jurney homes business as well as our century business where we re just in the charlotte market we ve really not seen additional pressure coming in beyond what we re just experiencing on a more national level but when we look at charlotte charlotte has rebounded from the very beginning of the year just as the rest of our business has alex rygiel b riley fbr inc analyst that s very helpful thank you operator our next question comes from the line of nishu sood with deutsche bank please proceed with your question tim daley deutsche bank analyst thanks for the time this is actually tim on for nishu thanks for the time my first question is you all were discussing the texas strategy pivoting to some more new entry level communities we noticed a few weeks ago that you were all were offering floor plans under the century flag around 160 000 which seems much more priced in line with wade product than century s so thinking about the community openings that you ll have this year how many will be offering floor plans with that level of i guess relative affordability and how are you achieving kind of the underwriting of your margins with prices that low it s really kind of more i guess century traditional style community dale francescon chairman and co chief executive officer it starts with the land positions we re buying and to answer the first part of that yes our new offerings that are coming up as we mentioned they re all generally speaking going to lower price point offerings and so they will be in that range now the 160 000 that would be on the low end of that range they would go from there to the low 200 000s and the basic focus of our strategy within houston is to keep within that low price point band as far as the offerings they re very efficient plans that have been designed specifically for that market as well as some of our other markets where we re offering the low price point of the century complete brand and we started doing this about i don t know 18 months ago or so and it s really ramping up now with the new communities that have been opening the success we re getting and as we mentioned we have several new communities that are ready to open over the second third and fourth quarter of this year that would fit that same profile tim daley deutsche bank analyst and then i guess the next question is we also noticed that you guys did i think i believe had your first national open house the weekend of kind of march 23 and 24 just focusing more on finish spec side of things so just curious how did that go how many closings in the quarter came from that and did that weigh on the margin the gross margins that you guys delivered this quarter or just kind of the general margin profile that came out of that event dale francescon chairman and co chief executive officer yes in terms of closings for the quarter they really had no impact just given of the timing of when that was and i think you ll see as we ve enhanced our marketing efforts you ll see more national campaigns that we ll be rolling out on a consistent basis that ll have different themes and that s just as we ve continued to grow and evolve as a company it starts making sense to be able to do things on a national scale as opposed to just doing it on an individual market basis so you ll see us do more and more of that tim daley deutsche bank analyst and then just one final one if i could wade jurney has a pretty unique lot acquisition strategy picking off some lots and parcels from kind of more outlying areas that maybe more traditional builders would maybe shy away from so just curious during the volatility of the past few months we ve heard of anecdotes builders may be taking a pause in their land acquisition strategy particularly in further out markets where this kind of wade model really does work so were you able to kind of maybe scoop up some additional lots this quarter or find any or in general kind of was the land market receptive to maybe lowering prices or giving better terms as you kind of shift toward this asset right strategy dale francescon chairman and co chief executive officer when we look at on the wade jurney home side i don t know that i would say we ve seen a specific impact over the last say 90 or 120 days we ve been very active in the land market adding to our positions we re very specific on the types of deals that work there they need to be finished lots they re typically done on a rolling option basis so that we re not bringing them on balance sheet and so in that area we really haven t seen much of a change on the broader business we have seen some flexibility on land sellers in terms of in some cases pricing in some cases terms and it really kind of is case by case and market by market and depends on the needs of the seller and what their motivations are tim daley deutsche bank analyst got it thanks for the time operator we now have a follow up question from the line of michael rehaut with jp morgan please proceed with your question michael rehaut j p morgan analyst hey thanks again just a couple of points of clarification dave the purchase accounting in the gross margin did i hear it right that that s now fully exhausted and going forward that adjustment is not going to be necessary david messenger chief financial officer that s correct michael rehaut j p morgan analyst and then also circling back to wade jurney with the transition and the sales process i was curious if you guys had any sense they booked still obviously pretty healthy number of orders 627 in the quarter i was curious if you had any sense of what that number might have been without the changes to the sales process what those changes might have done from in terms of suppressing a potentially bigger number david messenger chief financial officer obviously it impacted it because there s a lot of homes that we could have sold that we didn t to what that extent is we really haven t spent any time trying to figure that out because once we made the decision from a business perspective make that change we just knew that the sales were kind of going to be what they re going to be and we ve really been focusing on making sure that we get our closings and that we don t have inventory that remains unsold and that hasn t changed at all so as i indicated earlier i mean we re still committed to that strategy we think it s the right strategy and how many more sales we could have we haven t really focused on it we re really more focused on selling homes when we can close them michael rehaut j p morgan analyst akes sense i just figured i d ask thanks very much operator ladies and gentlemen at this time there are not further questions i would like to turn the floor back to dale for any closing comments dale francescon chairman and co chief executive officer thank you operator and thank you again to everyone for joining us on today s call we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter operator duration 41 minutes call participants scott dixon chief accounting officer dale francescon chairman and co chief executive officer rob francescon co chief executive

nearly one month after jpmorgan chase chief executive jamie dimon told congress that another lehman style market crash is not a concern the international monetary fund has a different message global debt levels are elevated to extreme levels and the imf is warning about a coming global financial crisis increasingly the imf is being called to bail out troubled economies and the need is growing to never before witnessed levels the imf released its spring 2019 economic analysis noting that if unsustainable debt and risky market behavior are not brought under control we could see another global financial crisis get the full seth klarman series in pdf get the entire 10 part series on seth klarman in pdf save it to your desktop read it on your tablet or email to your colleagues q1 hedge fund letters conference scoops etc developing countries are wrestling with crisis un sovereign debt analyst and executive director of jubliee usa eric lecompte told valuewalk pointing to a virus that could quickly spread to the developed world there is more than one canary in this coal mine the imf has released a series of reports on unsustainable debt levels in developing economies that it says makes the global environment unsettled this is a delicate moment for the global economy gita gopinath the imf s director of research wrote in an april 9 blog post if any of the major risks materialize then the expected recoveries in stressed economies export dependent economies and highly indebted economies may be derailed lecompte notes that even with a relatively strong global economy many developing nations are finding trouble with gdp to debt levels above 100 and 17 countries are in default he was moderating an imf panel discussion on the topic when unknown derivatives risk exposures tied to the debt was raised as an issue that could derail the economy calling it the scariest imf meeting i ve ever attended the imf for its part sees direct comparisons with the 2008 financial crisis where unsustainable sovereign and corporate debt combined with bank derivatives blended to create a toxic economic mix that led to the great recession the reverberations of which are still being felt the debt crisis is now engulfing 40 of low income nations with the imf concerned of rising debt levels in african nations that is even starting to impact wealthy regions such as kenya and south africa what also concerns lecompte is how the debt problem is spreading in latin america right on the doorstep of the us brazil el salvador venezuela and argentina are all showing signs of cracking under a mountain of debt according to lecompte three latin american countries are beyond 70 debt to gdp argentina which lost a debt fight with hedge funds led in part by paul singer s elliott management is particularly hard hit investors are now pricing in a 49 chance of default up from 22 a year ago according to credit default swaps pricing in argentina public money from the imf is bailing out hedge funds lecompte quipped noting that solutions for another global debt crisis have not been put in place many nations battling high debt levels find it to be a vicious cycle austerity measures put in place to pay bondholders lead to reduced government spending that gets back to the economy which leads to lower economic output and ultimately less money to pay down the debt another issue hitting many developing nations particularly venezuela is lower oil prices are crimping revenue at a time when it is most needed in response to the crisis the imf is attempting to do higher monitoring of the debt situation so global leaders can track at risk nations many of whom approach china for debt relief lecompte noted often debt deals with china are secret and they often give up natural resources for some type of debt relief he said pointing to moves that lead to global strategic vulnerabilities lecompte advocates for a common global standard to restructure debt while at the same time seeking curbs on predatory lending this article first appeared on valuewalk premium
the second summit on china s belt and road initiative bri held in beijing from april 26 to 27 and attended by several world leaders from more than 150 countries provided an opportunity to showcase china s mega project aimed at promoting global growth and prosperity but critics led by the us used the occasion to castigate the bri as a manifestation of china s geo political ambitions that would force developing countries into a debt trap at the heart of this controversy is whether the bri is a benign chinese endeavour to promote greater international connectivity for shared economic development or a tool to dominate asian african and latin american countries this issue is of paramount importance for pakistan since cpec is the flagship project of the bri and an example to be emulated by other developing countries therefore the bri needs to be placed in its true context unveiled by president xi in 2013 as a foreign policy priority the bri seeks to revive and reinvigorate the ancient silk roads that connected china with eurasia to actualise this initiative china set up development oriented financial institutions and planning mechanisms to accelerate the construction of infrastructure connecting china with neighbouring regions and build a silk road economic belt and a maritime silk road to form a new pattern of all around opportunities the china development bank alone earmarked nearly one trillion us dollars by 2015 for over 900 projects involving transportation infrastructure and energy the chinese export import bank pledged financing for more than 1 000 projects in 49 countries as part of the bri the total chinese financial outlay is estimated at about three trillion dollars today over 80 countries are directly part of this initiative while scores of others including several members of the eu are also involved these countries spread from and across asia europe africa and latin america a total of around 63 per cent of the world s population with a collective total of over 21 trillion dollars of global output guided by china s policy of harmonious rise to superpower status and win win cooperation with partnering countries president xi has maintained that exchange will replace estrangement mutual learning will replace clashes and coexistence will replace a sense of superiority more pointedly chinese foreign minister wang yi stated that the bri is not a geo political tool but a platform for cooperation the bri grand design is unprecedented in scale but not unique such linkages have been suggested before in the aftermath of the iraq invasion american officials spoke of their goal to revive ancient ties between south and central asia to create new links in the areas of trade transport democracy energy and communications later in 2011 then secretary of state hillary clinton proposed creating a new silk road an international network of economic and transit connections but these proved to be mere statements of intent rather than substantive policies backed up by financial commitments more recently trump s secretary of state pompeo announced an enhanced us regional role in the indo pacific as one of the greatest engines of the global economy for which he announced 113 million dollars in new initiatives a minuscule amount compared to china s trillion dollars investments the reality is that a declining us and under trump an unreliable partner to boot does not carry the same influence as a rising china unable to compete in the global marketplace the us has resorted to building pressure against china instead of accepting china and russia as equal partners to evolve a new stable international order the us has resorted to building military alliances and trade wars to contain and confront china a key part of this strategy is to demonise china as a predatory state that is using the bri to entrap poor countries through increasing their debt burden american dominated international financial institutions like the imf and the world bank are being used to spread such allegations but this canard has been exposed by objective americans themselves for example of the overall debt for african countries estimated by the china africa research initiative at johns hopkins university amounting to 143 billion dollars the majority of this debt is owed to non chinese lenders mainly western banks the total debt of latin american countries according to the global development policy centre financing from china alone did not appear to be driving borrowers above the imf s debt sustainability threshold similarly the controversy generated about sri lanka s hambantota port which was allegedly surrendered to china due to non payable debts of 46 billion dollars it was revealed that actually only 10 per cent of the debt is owed to china in short according to these analysts as reported in the new york times of april 27 fears that china is deliberately preying on countries in need are unfounded pakistan s own example is a case in point while secretary pompeo fulminated that the us will not allow the imf to bail out pakistan so that it could pay off its chinese loans the fact remains that over 80 per cent of pakistan s debt is owed to western lenders including the us and imf not to china aside from the debt burden argument the us has resorted to a massive disinformation and destabilisation campaign within pakistan through its proxies and touts to mislead pakistanis about cpec it has also enlisted its indian acolytes to oppose cpec by promoting terrorism through the bla and the ttp such as attacks on chinese workers and the chinese consulate in karachi in this effort the gwadar port has also been projected as a chinese naval base rather than what it actually is a commercial port for trading and trans shipment purposes undoubtedly in any project the size of the bri there will be shortcomings which president xi acknowledged at the recent summit calling for transparency and zero tolerance for corruption but to argue that the bri is a geo political power grab by china to challenge the us belies its real purpose and exposes america s own vulnerabilities in a changing world

new york as small business week approaches the nation s smallest companies in the aggregate are by many accounts doing fairly well they re not however thriving en masse in direct response to trump administration and republican policies small business hiring is erratic according to numbers released by payroll provider adp small businesses typically struggle to add jobs when the unemployment rate is very low as it is now at 3 8 they often can t pay as much as larger companies or offer the comparatively robust benefits that big companies do thereby leaving them at a disadvantage when workers are scarce meanwhile surveys by bank of america wells fargo capital one and the u s chamber of commerce and metlife show small business owners have been losing some of their optimism as doubts linger about the strength of the current economic expansion the new tax law has had a mixed impact on small businesses and the trade war that began with trump administration tariffs is hurting small manufacturers and retailers business is good ok but no different from how it s been throughout the bulk of this expansion says mark zandi chief economist with moody s analytics it s hard to argue that the president s policies have led to some kind of renaissance for small businesses that s going to mean great things forever the administration believes otherwise former small business administrator linda mcmahon in an opinion piece published last week on foxbusiness com credited the administration s policies for helping the economy and in turn small companies she noted that she met with small business owners throughout her sba tenure advertisement i don t need a spreadsheet to tell me the president s america first program of tax trade regulatory and energy reform is supercharging our economy says mcmahon who resigned last month to work on president donald trump s re election campaign i saw it and continue to see it with my own eyes and through the eyes of the hundreds of business leaders i have met in a letter released last month by the sba mid atlantic regional administrator michelle christian said we see small business owners taking advantage of the tax cuts and deregulation efforts led by president trump to invest in their companies and their employees by raising wages providing bonuses increasing benefits and creating more jobs the economy is strong and small businesses are thriving economists and industry group officials see administration and gop policies as having a mixed impact on small businesses how a company is affected depends on the policy and the business s individual circumstances but even if a company has benefited from one policy it might be hurt by another it s been one step forward and one step back says david french senior vice president of government relations at the industry group national retail federation a lot of the positive gains we ve seen out of tax reform have been given back in lost sales and lost opportunities because of higher tariffs the administration s tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of chinese and european products have sent costs higher for small businesses including manufacturers and retailers it can be a mistake to generalize about the companies that will be the focus of national small business week may 5 11 the expression small business is used to describe companies with relatively few employees and small revenues compared to large companies with thousands of workers and hundreds of millions or billions of dollars coming in annually but there is no typical small business a retailer dry cleaner restaurant manufacturer dental office or auto mechanic can be a small business because these companies have vastly different structures products and services they have widely divergent needs and priorities and government policies have a varying impact on them the tax law has had an uneven impact not all sole proprietors partners and owners of what are called s corporations can take a new 20 deduction against their business income the provision excludes some industries and depends on filing status for example an owner of a small business whose spouse had high earnings from a job or other source might not qualify for the deduction nor could many people with professional practices such as doctors architects and consultants and while the law lowered the maximum corporate tax rate to 21 from 35 the rate went up for many small corporations advertisement under the previous tax law sandra payne s construction equipment manufacturer had a 15 tax rate on the first 50 000 in income under the new law that rose to 21 that was huge to us it was a big deal says payne president of denver concrete vibrator in colorado michael rogers estimates he saved about 3 100 in taxes because he was able to claim the 20 deduction for what s known as qualified business income from his cleveland tenn real estate company chandler properties but the money won t be reinvested in his business it will go to rogers family of four children overall it appears the tax law didn t help small businesses as much as the gop predicted in a bank of america survey of 1 504 small business owners released last week 28 said the government s tax policy has been positive for their companies down from the 45 who predicted a year ago it would be positive for them half said it was neutral up from 39 and 21 said the policy was negative for their companies up from 15 meanwhile although trump contends his trade policy is helping business billions of dollars in taxes on chinese and european imports and retaliatory tariffs on u s goods have driven up prices for small companies and their customers in the federal reserve s most recent beige book its assessment of regional economies eight of the 12 regional fed banks reported businesses were affected by or concerned about tariffs that run as high as 25 on some products while the april 17 report did not identify any of the companies as small businesses it does show tariffs are an ongoing issue the tariffs are also negating some tax benefits under the new law the nrf s french says if retailers benefit by consumers having more disposable income to spend a portion of that disposable income has gone to tariffs he says in a report released by the federal reserve bank of san francisco in february researchers found that tariffs already in place on chinese imports have added 0 1 percentage point to consumer price inflation a relatively small amount and that the contribution of chinese imports to overall personal consumption and business investment are also small however the report said when faced with tariffs as high as 25 on a broad set of product categories even these small shares can lead to sizable upward pressures on prices advertisement payne s company which uses steel and other raw materials that have been hit by tariffs is paying higher prices to suppliers all of our vendors are getting ready or have already increased prices in anticipation of the tariff issues she says the u s economy grew at a solid 3 2 in the first three months of the year but economists don t expect the current april june quarter to match that performance many are looking for gross domestic product growth to slow to around an annual rate of 2 in the current quarter a weakening economy can lead to a drop in hiring which has been inconsistent at small businesses while adp counted 77 000 new small business jobs in april and 20 000 in march that compared to an average 52 000 per month in 2018 although many businesses say they re unable to find skilled workers a problem zandi says is exacerbated by the administration s immigration policies some business owners have said they re cautious about taking on the added expense of new hires

financial performance measures our opinion regarding the usefulness of such measures together with a reconciliation of such measures to the nearest gaap measure is included in the earnings release issued this afternoon and available on our website we ve also posted supplemental investor materials regarding the first quarter results on our website with that i ll turn the call over to ed ed west chief executive officer thank you brad and welcome everyone i would like to convey the following key messages today first we executed on our priorities in the first quarter and the financial results came in ahead of our previous expectations second market conditions for fis and fintechs particularly in the u s continue to evolve in a favorable way for cardtronics and our retail partners third early indications and interest levels in our new allpoint retail deposit network are encouraging and is additive to our growing fi pipeline in north america now let me start with a brief recap of our results for the first quarter on a consolidated basis revenues were 318 million and adjusted ebitda was 61 million for the first quarter both of which were solid results given some of the headwinds we faced this quarter and came in better than we expected we also generated over 20 million of adjusted free cash flow in the quarter up significantly from just over 4 million during the year ago period now looking at our segments we executed on several fronts in north america while we officially launched a couple of new solutions to the market the allpoint retail deposit network and cardless cash access in nearly 11 000 atms through our partnerships with the fis 47 fis and counting today have cardless cash access through our atms additionally we have now developed an api for fintechs to connect to our platform regarding our deposit strategy our deposit taking customers are expected to have access to nearly 1 000 of our deposit taking atms by the end of the year and the market in the u s continues to evolve the financial institutions of all sizes are increasingly looking for unique flexible solutions to help them grow in a cost effective way pressure on banks to optimize their businesses is coming from many angles from big tech from new fintech disruptors to traditional fis of all sizes looking to efficiently grow their customer and deposit base most retail institutions are realizing that traditional branch networks are not an efficient use of resources and that branches are increasingly less relevant to their customers providing convenient fee free atm access is still very important to bank customers but owning a large atm fleet is expensive and not necessarily an important differentiator we can deliver an efficient on demand solution for the fis that can maximize roi whether fis are looking to reduce costs simplify their operations or strategically expand our suite of solutions can solve a number of needs for their business plans our end to end capabilities and ubiquitous geographic coverage in the u s are truly unique and our value proposition is increasingly resonating with fis of all sizes and we are seeing growing interest in addition to the new allpoint customers we entered agreements with 19 new financial institutions to our allpoint network bringing with them over 200 000 additional cardholders during the first quarter we also had success with bank branding adding new relationships to brand over 1 000 units in the u s in coming periods as i just mentioned we re seeing interest from fis of all sizes 10 of the branding agreements signed this past quarter are with top 30 banks our allpoint and bank branding surcharge free offerings are the core of our strategy to drive more volume to our existing atm locations we executed nicely on this again in the first quarter as our u s same store withdrawal transactions were up 2 led by surcharge free transactions up almost 10 for the quarter coming back to operations for a moment one of our key priorities for delivering customer success and shareholder value is operational excellence during the first quarter the team continued to execute in an exemplary fashion we had near record levels of atm availability in north america rolled out new products and concurrently drove down unit cost operational execution same store transaction growth and the roll off of 7 eleven yielded nice operating leverage our gross margin in north america was up 180 basis points for the quarter let me conclude my comments on north america by saying that we built a differentiated network centered on convenient atm locations at leading retailers and extensive partnerships with over 1 500 fis in north america all combined with unmatched experience and scale we believe this network will serve as the underpinning of our strategy to grow in what we estimate will be a 15 billion market in the u s today we estimate that almost 90 of cash supply in the u s occurs at either a branch teller or bank atm and we are laser focused on this evolving opportunity now let s move to our europe and africa segment on a constant currency basis revenue was down 1 for the quarter this was a pretty solid result and candidly better than we expected given the headwinds and negative year over year comps in our u k business over all same store transactions in the u k were about flat for the quarter the best result we ve seen in a couple of years and impacted by a combination of atm removals across the market consumer behavior good weather and exceptional atm availability resulting from new platform capabilities similar to the previous quarters the u k business which is the largest component of this segment was down on revenues driven by the significant reductions to the link interchange rate in addition to the removal of about 3 000 marginally performing atms that did not warrant additional investments after the interchange rate cuts now we continue to take action in the u k to manage through the headwinds as a reminder we were impacted by the second link rate cut on january 1 of this year these arbitrary rate cuts have caused significant disruption in the marketplace since the link reductions were announced we have changed approximately 2 300 atms to pay to use and expect to convert an additional 700 atms to pay to use during the remainder of 2019 these are in addition to our removals our fast growing germany spain and south africa businesses once again grew at double digit rates as we continue to grow nicely in these markets we added retail and touristic locations and layered in bank branding and managed services arrangements during the quarter we entered into agreements to place approximately 600 atms at retail locations across these markets we also announced a partnership with ing bank in spain enabling their 3 9 million domestic customers with fee free access to our atms in that market in south africa we initiated relationships with prasa the passenger rail agency of south africa and shell petroleum to install atms at premium passenger railway stations and shell petroleum sites countrywide now moving on to australia our revenues were down about 7 on a constant currency basis excluding the atms that were removed from service in early 2018 our revenues would have been nearly flat for the quarter while revenues are still showing declines in australia conditions began to improve and stabilize in the market we continue to manage the business for solid cash flows and believe we can turn this business back to growth in the medium term over all we made good progress on our plans during the quarter and our results exceeded our expectations largely due to the transaction performance in the u k accordingly we are raising our outlook for the year to reflect the first quarter s performance i would now like to take a minute to briefly comment and give you some color on our top five priorities as outlined in our investor supplement first drive durable organic revenue growth we remain focused on driving organic growth by rolling out new products optimizing the productivity of our portfolio and driving more transactions to our network we returned to organic growth in north america last year excluding 7 eleven and we see a pathway to growth across all of our segments over the medium term in the u k and australia we are positioning a return to growth and extension into adjacent services and in germany spain and south africa we expect to experience double digit growth in revenue and adjusted ebitda our second priority is to deliver operational excellence and portfolio optimization we expect to benefit from scale and operating leverage as well as provide an enhanced customer experience with better controls and security we plan to achieve this by further integrating our platforms driving standardization across the business fully roll out our new erp and manage asset productivity with enhanced software and analytics our third priority is to create raving fans with our customers our solutions assist in solving customer growth and efficiency problems for our partners across both retail and financial services our strongest asset is the partnership we have with the leading retailers and 2 000 fis globally combined with the over 60 million allpoint cardholders having a truly loyal relationship with all of these constituents is a surefire path for growth our fourth priority is to engender employee pride we have a purpose driven mission resulting from the delivery of convenient low cost access to cash around the world and we believe executing on our vision and making cardtronics a great place for employees to learn and grow will drive long term success for the business and our fifth priority is to deliver on our financial commitments in strong free cash flow at the end of the day we are highly focused on long term growth in cash flow we are investing for growth as evidenced by our product investments this year but we are mindful that every asset and investment carries a return and we are accountable to deliver reliable growth in cash flow over time for our shareholders and this brings me to my last topic today which is a recap of our medium term growth plan that we reviewed during our investor day just a few weeks ago over the medium term we expect to deliver roughly 3 to 5 revenue growth with a corresponding adjusted ebitda growth of 7 to 9 this implies margin expansion resulting from scale and operating leverage we expect to deploy capital into areas where we see quantifiable and tangible growth and continue to delever and drive toward our targeted net leverage level of two times to 2 5 times as we approach that level we expect to come back to you to announce either stock repurchases and or dividends when the time is appropriate we believe we will reach these targeted levels within the next three to four quarters during this period we also have the authorization to opportunistically repurchase shares should the occasion arise while we work to reach our targeted net leverage range i would now like to turn the call over to gary to give some color on the results and the outlook gary ferrera chief financial officer thank you ed i will start with a quick recap of our financial performance in the quarter while we had a solid quarter there are a few significant matters when trying to compare reported results to the prior year first the results are significantly impacted by the u k link interchange rate reductions as this is the first quarter that has both reductions therefore the u k link interchange rate in q1 2019 was a full 10 lower than q1 2018 second we had fairly strong currency headwinds compared to a year ago as the pound was considerably weaker against the dollar compared to q1 last year third we had the last of the 7 eleven revenue in q1 as there were a few hundred atms still in service in january and february of 2018 these remaining atms generated just over 5 million in revenues but had a minimal amount of ebitda contribution lastly we had a nonrecurring property tax benefit of 3 9 million related to our u k business in q1 last year as this was an expense item this factor only impacted profitability measure comparisons on an as reported basis consolidated revenues for the quarter were 318 million down 5 from the first quarter of 2018 on a constant currency basis and excluding the impact of 7 eleven our consolidated organic revenue growth rate was approximately flat for the quarter organic constant currency atm operating revenues excluding 7 eleven were up 1 in north america this growth rate which we expect to accelerate during late 2019 and into 2020 was driven by a u s same store transaction withdrawal growth rate of 2 we continue to see a double digit growth rate of surcharge free transactions at our company owned locations in the u s this growth rate continues to be driven by increases in participating financial institutions within allpoint and bank branding that continue to drive consumers to our locations the u s same store transaction growth rate of 2 was solid and in line with expectations q1 was somewhat adversely impacted by weaker surcharge transactions which were down 4 compared to nearly a flat result in q4 of 2018 we think this sequential change was partly related to transitory factors with harsh extremely cold weather impacting a big part of the midwest during the first part of the quarter also there was a slight delay in this year s tax refund season the north america revenue growth rate in q1 was also adversely impacted by the removal of atms at sunoco locations during 2018 as sunoco was acquired by 7 eleven this transition to 7 eleven s sister company operator adversely impacted the q1 growth rate in north america by about 1 revenues in our europe and africa segment as reported were down 8 for the quarter revenues were only down about 1 after adjusting for the changes in fx rates when you adjust for the atms we removed early in 2018 as a result of the link interchange rate reduction we estimate that our europe and africa segment would have had slightly positive organic revenue growth on a constant currency basis our u k business had same store transactions that were about flat for the quarter and this result is a little better than we have seen recently we believe the better than expected transaction performance in the u k was impacted by a few factors first more consumers migrating transactions to a smaller pool of free to use atms as more atms in the market become fee charging as a result of the link interchange reduction second continued declines in the total number of atms as banks continue to contract their atms and branches and third better weather relative to the prior year the rest of our europe and africa segment continued to grow nicely as germany spain and south africa each had a double digit top line growth in the quarter transitioning to australia as reported revenues were down 16 for the quarter but that result was only down 7 on a constant currency basis as the aussie dollar significantly weakened over the past year relative to the u s dollar this result in australia is an improvement over the growth rate in the prior year and we continue to see moderation in the rate of same store transaction declines in this market we were nearly flat on the top line excluding the atms that were removed from service last year moving down in the income statement the consolidated adjusted gross margin for the quarter is down about 60 basis points to 31 5 compared to 32 1 in q1 2018 adjusted for the nonrecurring u k property tax benefit in q1 2018 our adjusted gross margin would have been up about 60 basis points driven by strong operational execution in our north america business with margins up approximately 180 basis points adjusted ebitda for the quarter was 61 million a decline of 11 from q1 2018 absent the nonrecurring property tax benefit in q1 2018 and exchange rate movement adjusted ebitda would have been nearly flat for the quarter this is in spite of the two interchange rate reductions in the u k this result was better than we had anticipated and was mostly driven by better than expected revenues in the u k and strong cost management across the enterprise our adjusted eps for the quarter was 0 35 compared to 0 46 in q1 2018 and was mainly impacted by the same factors that impacted adjusted ebitda but we also had lower interest expense as a result of our late 2018 refinancing efforts that more than offset the slight increase in depreciation expense moving to capital expenditures our total spend for the quarter was 29 3 million about half of which falls into the growth bucket this is up from 20 7 million in q1 of 2018 this result was about in line with what we anticipated and reflects the meaningful investments for our product enhancements in the u s we are still expecting approximately 135 million of capex this year we continue to focus the organization on free cash flow and as ed mentioned this measure remains one of our key priorities for the year our adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was 20 4 million up almost 16 million from the prior year the improvement in adjusted free cash flow was primarily related to positive changes in working capital and cash paid for interest which was down almost 6 million subsequent to the previously mentioned refinancing of our balance sheet i would just like to note that the only adjustment we make on our free cash flow metric which is gaap operating cash flow less capital expenditures is to exclude movements in restricted cash related to settlement timing our daily settlement balances that include restricted cash can change materially between quarters depending on the day of the week and holidays and do not truly represent operational cash generated by the business in the quarter moving to the balance sheet our net leverage ratio for the quarter was 2 8 times about flat from last quarter we continue to use free cash flow to reduce debt outstanding and with our anticipated year over year ebitda growth in the second half of the year of 2019 we d expect to enter our target net leverage range of two times to 2 5 times adjusted ebitda later this year or early next year during the quarter we paid down just over 24 million on our revolving credit facility and continue to have plenty of borrowing capacity and headroom on all of our covenants in late march we announced a 50 million share repurchase authorization this authorization is meant to be an opportunistic tool available to the company whether we repurchase shares will depend on a number of factors including valuation business opportunities leverage and other factors we have not repurchased any shares to date next i want to make note of a couple of gaap and disclosure items in our 10 q first like most other u s public companies we implemented the new lease standard this quarter while this had no direct impact to any of our reported gaap or non gaap income statement measures it did result in over 93 million in operating leases going on to our balance sheet as liabilities related mostly to building leases this truly is an accounting presentation matter that we do not anticipate having any impact to our reported income statement cash flow or liquidity metrics second we made a few minor adjustments in our segment reporting the adjustments relate to internal cost allocations after we completed some functional integration during 2018 particularly in our technology and processing operations both 2019 and 2018 segment results are reported on the same updated basis in this quarter s 10 q now let me turn to our 2019 outlook our first quarter results especially at the bottom line were better than we anticipated on our previous call we communicated that adjusted ebitda could decline as much as 20 in q1 the actual results were approximately half that amount and was mostly driven by better than expected revenues in the u k and strong cost management across the enterprise with a solid first quarter under our belts we re raising the outlook for the year our adjusted outlook is updated in our earnings release and some of the key metrics are as follows revenues of 1 3 billion to 1 36 billion up 10 million on each end of the range adjusted ebitda in a range of 290 million to 300 million for the year up 5 million on each end of the range and adjusted eps in a range of 2 01 to 2 12 up 0 07 on each end of the range while we do not provide specific quarterly guidance it continues to be a year of two halves so i will provide some color as to how we anticipate the year unfolding at this time we re anticipating the remainder of the year to be in line with what we communicated on our previous earnings call we continue to expect q2 to be down on both revenues and adjusted ebitda compared to the prior year this is mostly due to the same factors that impacted our q1 results the two interchange rate reductions in the u k a smaller but still significant impact from the property tax benefit in q2 last year and foreign currency exchange rates we currently expect q2 to be down in the mid single digit percentage range on adjusted ebitda or approximately half of what we were down in q1 revenues could be down a couple of percentage points we continue to expect top and bottom line growth starting in q3 as we begin to lap the headwinds we are experiencing in the first half with that let me turn it back over to ed ed west chief executive officer thank you gary so in summary we are pleased with the performance and are encouraged by some of the key indicators in the business including good surcharge free transaction growth in the u s new branding agreements to brand over 1 000 atms with a mix of fis of all sizes a growing fi pipeline in north america improved same store transaction performance in the u k australia beginning to stabilize from an ebitda standpoint and continued double digit growth in all of our growth markets so operator we d now like to turn the call back over to you to open it up for a q a session questions answers operator thank you our first question comes from ramsey el assal with barclays ramsey el assal barclays analyst hi guys thank you for taking my question i wanted to ask about first of all great same store sales result in the u k it was above our expectations can you talk about the competitive environment in the u k and how it s evolved post the link cuts are smaller operators dropping out are you seeing sort of less competition in the market if you can comment on that that would be great ed west chief executive officer ok sure good afternoon ramsey thanks again we are seeing some changes through there as you can imagine over all the country just from the cuts that link put through obviously the number of atms in the country have come down considerably there are fewer than 70 000 i think it s frankly down to about 63 000 we ve removed atms others have removed atms we ve read about and seen others making other switches to pay to use again just as i mentioned during the call these arbitrary cuts have caused a lot of disruption in the marketplace and frankly adds a lot of consumer concern from just having ubiquitous access to cash as gary pointed out in his comments there is now a smaller pool of the free to use and i think you probably saw a little bit of that benefit this past quarter from our standpoint we continue to make that mix change the balancing between free to use and pay to use just based on frankly just the demand that we see and the economics of that particular location and we just need to make sure we get it right to be able to leave that atm there then i would say going forward we ll just continue to monitor the markets and seeing transaction levels we did benefit this past quarter as well we both pointed out and you pointed out it exceeded our expectations the united kingdom had seasonably very warm weather for the winter which was terrific now we re going into a period over the next quarter where it was actually warm going last summer so probably the comps are a little bit more challenging then i would say one last thing that i think we benefited from some new platform integration work on our end and we saw absolute record availability for our platform which really matters there in the u k because of the volumes that we experience across our network end of the day we re optimistic that we will get back that the market here will stabilize we ll muscle through this situation that we ve had to deal with we ll get through that it will balance out and we will get back to growth the great news is cardtronics we re the largest operator there we have a great asset base we can leverage other things we talked a little bit about that at the investor day marc talked about some of the things we re piloting and we ll continue to work that and keep you up to date ramsey el assal barclays analyst great thanks for that a follow up for me on the allpoint the deposit taking capability can you help us understand the economics of that program from sort of both a revenue sort of the per transaction economics from both a revenue and expense perspective i m assuming it generates more revenue is there an incremental expense element to it how does it impact profitability just a little more granularity on the sort of economic model would be helpful ed west chief executive officer sure so as we just announced that a few weeks ago with the new allpoint retail deposit network we re on a methodical way rolling that out across the country the revenue model in that is a mix between both some fixed payments as well as transaction based based on the deposit and there s different structures depending on the financial institution that s joining in and we re seeing a mix of that and interest levels are frankly at all levels whether it s a local community bank looking for more catchment and convenience for their customers to national platforms who want to see a national level and so our structure and pricing is adjusted accordingly based on what the institution or the fintech would be looking for in terms of what their needs are from a cost basis yes the costs are a little bit different just because it s deposit taking you re having to manage that ultimately what we ve designed is a recycler what we re rolling out that would be a future capability right now it would just have additional cit activity because of the deposits ramsey el assal barclays analyst terrific thanks so much ed west chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from andrew jeffrey with suntrust andrew jeffrey suntrust robinson humphrey analyst guys thank you for taking the question this afternoon ed i just want to ask about north america the u s in particular it seems like as time goes on and as allpoint surcharge free transactions become more important to your revenue growth the difference between both allpoint and same store sales and then allpoint and sort of revenue growth widens can you just comment on sort of what you think the right most relevant kpi is going forward and i suspect the key benefit of this big increase in allpoint aside from relevance of the network is at the gross margin line right ed west chief executive officer thanks for the question so just stepping back in the u s i think it comes back to as we outlined a few weeks ago is the value and the benefit of what s really unique to us which is this surcharge free network and where it s a two sided network self reinforcing on one side you have key leading retailers in convenient locations and the other side 1 500 financial institutions looking for convenience for their customers and efficiency of this where we see the growth here is adding on to that from both the penetration within those customers as well as new customers coming on and driving more and more transactions at those key locations so yes seeing the transaction growth in these levels is what we re very focused on across the organization as we talked about our compensation is tied to that we re working very closely with the various partners whether it s the fi or the retail to get better awareness we re investing more in marketing programs as i mentioned we hired a new chief marketing officer paul wilmore focused in on this bringing in additional analytics capabilities understanding how do we continue to partner more and more in this area to drive transactions i think the best driver will be is the transaction level at those key locations and getting more throughput and then that s what will drive the margin as i talked about earlier that long term outlook the medium term outlook where you see ebitda growth in excess of revenue it just comes down to good old fashioned scale and leverage across the business andrew jeffrey suntrust robinson humphrey analyst ok so we ll keep focusing i guess on allpoint transactions as sort of the key indicator then ed west chief executive officer well i would say it s surcharge free because remember it s i think the branding bank branding and allpoint so this past quarter is a great example it s like wow we re 1 000 new agreements on atms to brand with institutions of all sizes eight of those being top 30 institutions andrew jeffrey suntrust robinson humphrey analyst ok thank you for that and then just as a follow up you talk about allpoint perhaps reaching 1 000 machines by the end of the year where do you think critical mass is in terms of when you go out and you talk to financial institutions at what point do they have that ah hah moment where they kind of say oh boy this gets really interesting for us ed west chief executive officer well you look at a particular market just first kind of stepping back on allpoint as we talked about this is a methodical rollout we expect to be nearly 1 000 locations by this year and that s going to continue on into next year we re just going to continue to monitor and gauge that rollout but let s just say an example where a financial institution may be moving into a new market or region they can quickly overnight on an almost on demand basis enter a market where we filled out for example let s talk about chicago where i believe it s over 80 locations we now have deposit taking in that market overnight a financial institution can move up to be one of the top locations in density for their customers to take deposits on a very rapid basis so it depends on the institution it depends on the market they want to see that presence and it depends on the size of that i would say the other one is the national for those that are interested on a national basis obviously they re monitoring the rollout the cities where we re doing it we re in close discussions with several organizations and we re rolling out some of these markets based on what we hear in those conversations everything we re doing in trying to roll out is very well informed andrew jeffrey suntrust robinson humphrey analyst right thanks thank you operator thank you again ladies and gentlemen our next question comes from kartik mehta with northcoast research kartik mehta northcoast research analyst ed i wanted to go back to your commentary i think at the analyst day and today about getting back to positive growth in the u k and you had a very good quarter this year this quarter and i m wondering with link transactions declining about 8 what strategy you ll take so that you can get back to revenue growth in that geography ed west chief executive officer so as you pointed out it was a decent quarter given all the headwinds that we had which is two rate cuts from link and then we have another quarter that we re in right now where it has a year over year negative impact of the two and then the comps you have a little bit more benefit in the back half of this year we re doing a lot of different things different product related marc walked through a pilot that we re doing with our partner vaultex and three large financial institutions in the market that s being piloted it all stems back to our scale size and experience there we are the largest operator in the country and having countrywide depth and resources and how we leverage those capabilities and assets into adjacent activities is what we re working through and also we do believe the market will stabilize where yes transactions have been coming down but so has capacity and frankly we think our infrastructure can benefit many including the banks and others as they reprioritize their resources as we talked about our network there is as large nearly as the three largest banks combined so there is an efficiency for them as well by us helping serve the community there kartik mehta northcoast research analyst and then just ed your thoughts on u s trends i know they decelerated a little bit in the first quarter compared to third and fourth quarter of last year any concern there or was this just in line with expectations and you d expect those trends to kind of reverse as you go through the year ed west chief executive officer yes actually it we were pleased with where it came out frankly surcharge levels came in back where we had been experiencing if you ll recall from our previous conversations third and fourth quarter actually did a lot better than what we had been used to on a surcharge basis where frankly it was nearly flat and as gary pointed out in his commentary surcharge levels were down about 4 for the quarter and largely that was the first part of the quarter january february where the country the midwest got walloped with the cold and harsh conditions but after that in march we saw that come back up and improve in march so we are not concerned about that i think that was just transitory and weather related and surcharge free transactions are doing well karthik mehta executive managing director director of research principal hey thank you very much and i really appreciate it operator thank you and our next question comes from charles nabhan with wells fargo charles nabhan wells fargo analyst hi guys thank you for taking my question i just wanted to follow up with your previous comments on surcharge free and surcharge same store sales specifically i m curious as to why surcharge revenues were impacted by weather and tax related factors to a greater degree than the surcharge free transactions is that based on just the geography of the network i m just hoping you could comment on that a little bit to help us parse out that bifurcation ed west chief executive officer it could be multiple different things as you point out the geography it could be from the location it could be the demographic of the use and a convenient space of that and then just in terms of the lifestyle of who that is there are a lot of different factors but those are the first couple that come to mind gary gary ferrera chief financial officer and remember there s not a lot of outside factors pushing surcharge as they are pushing surcharge free right surcharge free is growing because we re adding bank branding we re doing all these things those don t always necessarily directly impact surcharge so i think that s probably one of the main reasons ed west chief executive officer and then on the surcharge basis which is more convenience based you can have other activities what we ve had before in the big lottery activity where you ll see spikes in demand versus something that s a little more constant on the surcharge free basis charles nabhan wells fargo analyst ok great and just as a follow up thinking about some of the optimization initiatives you ve undertaken in the past year in the u k and australia i was just curious as to whether you were done reducing the fleet there and if you could potentially see yourself at a point over the next year or so where you re even adding atms or looking outside of that at some of your growth markets spain south africa germany are you in a position or have you given any thought to potentially expanding but expanding through m a in any of those areas ed west chief executive officer so a couple of different things first of all every investment stands on its own merit so right now where we re investing is obviously in north america spain germany south africa where we see very good returns on growth we ve gone through to continue to optimize the portfolios as you point out between the u k and australia and just we ll see when as those markets straighten out and have better conditions in which we would want to invest otherwise we have good investment opportunities in these other markets and attractive growth and returns separately with respect to m a as we talked about at the investor day and as we ve talked about over the last year we are highly highly focused on integrating operations and driving organic growth if we see things that offer a very attractive and short return on that attractive returns that leverage our current capabilities we would look at that but in terms of the markets you mentioned i d say we re focused on continued execution gary gary ferrera chief financial officer completely agree operator ladies and gentlemen that concludes the question and answer session of today s call as well as today s conference ed west chief executive officer great thank you very much operator duration 45 minutes call participants brad conrad executive vice president and treasurer ed west chief executive officer gary ferrera chief financial officer

everything is firing for an economy and jobs market that continues to defy expectations photo getty images everything is firing for an economy and jobs market that continues to defy expectations photo getty images the us economy again defied expectations in april as another month of strong hiring and falling unemployment forced experts to reevaluate just how good the economy can get and how long the current expansion can last employers added 263 000 new jobs last month a record 103 straight months of job growth and the official unemployment rate fell to 3 6 per cent the lowest since 1969 the labour department reported friday the latest piece of good news comes accompanied by strong wage growth hot stock markets and a first quarter growth report last week that smashed expectations but equally noteworthy is what economists aren t seeing the high levels of inflation that have accompanied previous expansions as the economy continues to grow past what many predicted was possible some analysts and officials are wondering if the current state of the economy is too good to be true and that experts must be missing warning signs some expressed concerns about rising debt after the trump administration undertook heavy borrowing to fund tax cuts and additional government spending to boost growth president trump is actively pushing for more including a us 2 trillion infrastructure package additional military spending and extra stimulus from the federal reserve but few if any deny the remarkable overall strength of the us economy spectacular is the only way to describe this jobs report said sung won sohn an economist at loyola marymount university and ss economics it is hard to believe that this 10 year old recovery keeps pumping out home runs previous eras of such economic perfomance ended painfully the prosperity of the 1960s was followed by runaway inflation in the 1970s the long expansion of the 1990s burst along with the tech bubble and the 2000s ended when a collapsing house bubble spiralled into a global financial crisis and the worst recession in generations but so far during this era of growth inflation has remained subdued and most think financial market risks are manageable in july the economy s expansion is set to become the longest in us history breaking the record from the 1990s the widespread expectation was that hiring would slow at this point in the business cycle but companies keep adding people with sizable gains lately for women and some minorities hispanic american unemployment fell to 4 2 per cent in april the lowest on record women s unemployment is now at 3 4 per cent the lowest since 1953 and 3 percentage points lower than the rate for men while there are some signs of slowing job growth this year is averaging 205 000 a month down from 223 000 last year the pace remains well above forecasts and the abundance of we re hiring signs and online job postings is luring people who weren t necessarily looking for a job back into the labour market average hourly earnings rose 3 2 per cent in the past year well above inflation lower wage workers enjoyed some of the largest gains as companies scrambled to fill jobs and many states have raised their minimum wage how long the good times can last is a widely debated topic from the white house to wall street to corner stores can this economy be sustained or get better the short answer is we don t know it depends what happens with productivity growth said joseph lavorgna chief economist for the americas at natixis an investment bank right now the vital signs look solid much of us economic growth is driven by consumer spending and people are expected to keep spending given that jobs are plentiful wages are rising for many and optimism about the economy is back at the highest levels since about 2000 according to gallup polls expansions don t simply die of old age something has to knock us away from full employment said christina romer an economics professor at the university of california berkeley and the former head of obama s council of economic advisers right now the us economy appears to be relatively stable numerous economists told the washington post that the most encouraging economic news this week was actually productivity not jobs productivity a measure of how much a worker can make in an hour grew above expectations at 2 4 per cent in the first quarter compared to a year earlier the best rate since 2010 productivity growth was anemic during the expansion over the past ten years with little sign of an uptick economists say a productivity rate above 2 per cent should fuel strong growth and higher wages but this critical metric is notoriously difficult to predict you have to give the white house some credit on the productivity front there s been a clear change there said doug holtz eakin an economist who advised john mccain s presidential campaign it s very encouraging but you can t celebrate too soon the white house cheered the news as evidence trump s policies are working at the same time trump continues to call for more stimulus a highly unusual move at a time when the economy appears strong we are the envy of the world and the best is yet to come trump tweeted friday the president s victory laps comes three days after he called on the federal reserve to cut interest rates and buy more government bonds policies that are typically used only during economic and financial crises fed chair jerome powell left interest rates unchanged this week and showed little sign of wanting to move them any time soon opting to wait and see what happens with the economy before taking any further action one of the conundrums of this current economy is why inflation remains so low economic theory suggests that now that the unemployment rate has been at or below 4 per cent for more than a year wages should rise at a more rapid clip and that should force businesses to lift the price of goods in order to afford the extra pay but that s not happening yet there s just not a lot of inflationary pressure despite the really low unemployment rate said susan houseman an economist and vice president of the w e upjohn institute for employment research hiring has been strong this year across just about every sector but retail and manufacturing companies even continue adding temporary employees who are often the first to get the ax at early signs of trouble recessions are tricky to forecast leading some economists to argue that a better question to ask right now is how to ensure this economy helps as many people as possible while times are good the unemployment rate isn t 3 6 per cent for everybody said william rodgers chief economist at the heldrich center for workforce development at rutgers university i hope the president and his team don t think this is the best that we can do especially for minority youth

which we believe can be useful in evaluating our performance the presentation of this additional information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with u s gaap a reconciliation of these non gaap measures to the most comparable gaap measures can be found in our earnings release at this point i ll turn the call over to eric fuller eric fuller president and chief executive officer thank you brian and good afternoon everyone i d like to start by reviewing our first quarter results and the progress that we have achieved executing upon our strategic initiatives and then conclude with a review of our market outlook eric peterson will then discuss our first quarter financial results in more detail before opening the call for questions i am pleased with our team s execution to the first quarter given the more challenging market backdrop that we encountered as we managed through the closure of our mexico joint venture and encountered weather disruptions despite these challenges we delivered a 95 7 adjusted operating ratio for the 2019 first quarter which is a 40 basis point improvement from the year ago quarter and our seventh consecutive quarter of or improvement our results clearly demonstrate the continued successful implementation of our strategic initiatives as we strive to transform our operations and improve our profitability while we have achieved a great deal over the last several years we have much more to accomplish in order to realize our goal turning to our segment level highlights in our over the road division average revenue per tractor per week declined 6 1 compared with the first quarter of 2018 this was a result of a 6 7 decrease in average revenue miles per tractor per week partially offset by 0 7 increase in our average revenue per mile the impact on average revenue per tractor per week resulted from unfavorable weather conditions the transition out of the companies us mexico cross border operations and the less favorable freight environment typically about 80 of our over the road division s volume is contracted and approximately 20 is noncontracted in the first quarter we experienced an 8 increase in our contract rates while noncontracted spot rates declined more than 20 turning to our dedicated division the average revenue per tractor per week excluding fuel surcharges increased to 11 8 in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the year ago quarter the increase was primarily the result of a 7 1 rise in the division s revenue per mile in addition to a 4 4 increase in the division s revenue miles per tractor per week the increase in utilization was largely the result of our initiative designed to grow our business with those accounts that offer a more attractive combination of rate and utilization while reducing our business with accounts that have a less attractive blend we implemented this initiative through 2018 and i am very pleased with the improved execution in the dedicated division over the last two quarters brokerage segment revenue decreased to 46 2 million in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to 54 5 million in the first quarter of 2018 on fewer loads and decreased revenues per loads the revenue decrease was more than offset by a higher gross margin as transportation cost per load decreased significantly due to sourcing third party capacity more efficiently as a result operating income increased 18 9 to 2 8 million in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the year ago quarter importantly the brokerage segment continues to provide additional selectively for our assets to optimize yield while at the same time offering more capacity solutions to our customers i would now like to spend a few minutes reviewing our strategic initiatives designed to deliver improved profitability and the priorities that we have for the year ahead as we ve discussed on previous calls our management team has been driving a complete overhaul to company strategy and operations in order to improve our execution and profitability we have created an execution oriented structure whereby we now manage the business by core metrics with the focus on rate truck count utilization and cost we ve also designed and implemented initiatives to improve these core metrics and ultimately our operating ratio where we strive to meaningfully improve our profitability as part of our transformation we have improved our asset optimization through a redesigned fleet renewal and maintenance program optimized our asset utilization through the use of proprietary optimization software and implemented our load planning initiative in our over the road initiative designed to improve utilization the successful implementation of these initiatives have contributed to the significant margin expansion that we have achieved over the last three years another key focus for our initiatives is to improve the quality of life for our drivers as we reduced the day to day challenges and frustrations that they encounter our drivers are critical to our success and are our greatest asset as a result we have launched a series of initiatives designed to position u s xpress as the company of choice for drivers in the industry one such initiative was the launch of our new driver development program and the opening of our redesigned development center in tunnel hill georgia this past february the newly launched program was created with input from our drivers and provides continuous learning opportunities for both new and experienced drivers the multi platform program features in person development sessions a hands on commercial motor vehicle learning lab where drivers inspect and identify faulty equipment a competency aligned simulator program a driving range where drivers can practice complicated maneuvers over a 150 e learning modules and eld practices and device training our goal is to provide our drivers with the knowledge skills and abilities necessary for successful driving career moving to the balance of 2019 our priority continues to be on improving the lifestyle and satisfaction of our drivers as well as our operations as we focus on technology including digital load matching automated load acceptance and prioritization and working toward our ultimate growth of the frictionless order when you analyze the process from order to cash what you find is that there are many gates in that process where manual decisions are made these manual decision points open the door to less than optimal decisions along with the potential for errors given that data entry is often required as we remove more the friction that exists those errors which frustrate our drivers will be reduced and our driver satisfaction will improve our goal over time is to have a frictionless order which we believe will not only improve driver retention but also reduce costs and optimize freight planning not to mention improved capacity as you can see utilizing technology to improve our operations represents a significant opportunity for u s xpress as the trucking industry continues to rapidly evolve u s xpress will be at the forefront and we re very excited to have cameron ramsdell join our team as president of our newly formed unit u s xpress ventures as we announced last week u s xpress is internal business unit focused on developing and implementing new asset based business models and technology strategies turning to the market and our outlook the second quarter freight environment remains subdued relative to normal seasonality and in comparison to the strongest market in 20 years which we experienced in the second quarter of 2018 while we expect ongoing improvements in network efficiency from the exit of our mexico business and then operating efficiencies from our strategic initiatives the changing market conditions since our fourth quarter call has changed our expectations on second quarter earnings while we continue to expect our initiatives and an improving market backdrop to allow us to improve our adjusted operating ratio on a sequential basis we now expect our second quarter adjusted operating ratio to deteriorate as compared to the year ago comparable quarter importantly we believe the operating improvements implemented over the past several years has positioned the company to better manage market fluctuations such as those that we are now experiencing as we look forward our current guidance of delivering a 93 adjusted operating ratio for the full year 2019 remains achievable though it is dependent on market conditions strengthening through the balance of the second quarter as a result we plan to update our full year adjusted operating ratio guidance when we have better visibility on the freight market and our full year results despite the more challenging freight market we have contractually agreed to rate renewals for approximately 40 of our anticipated truckload revenue for 2019 with an average rate increase of approximately 5 since november while current rate increases have moderated slightly we believe full year contract rates will increase in the mid single digit range i would now like to turn the call over to eric peterson for a review of our financial results eric peterson chief financial officer thank you eric and good afternoon as eric discussed we are pleased with the continued successful execution of our strategic initiatives which enabled our team to manage through a more challenging market backdrop we offset more challenging market conditions through leveraging our fleet and our brokerage operations and taking advantage of our enhanced dedicated business mix achieved during 2018 in addition we believe we are well positioned to continue to execute on our current initiatives to drive continued operating ratio improvement i m going to spend a few minutes summarizing our results for the quarter and we ll focus on the core metrics we use to evaluate and monitor our progress operating revenue was 415 4 million a decrease of 10 3 million compared to the first quarter of 2018 excluding revenue from our mexico operations which were discontinued in january 2019 operating revenue increased 2 9 million excluding fuel surcharge the increase was attributable to a 3 8 increase in revenue per mile mostly offset by decreases of 8 3 million in brokerage revenue operating income for the first quarter of 2019 was 12 5 million compared to the 14 9 million achieved in the prior year quarter excluding 3 4 million in costs related to the exit of our mexico operations our adjusted operating income for the first quarter of 2019 was 15 9 million which compares to 14 9 million in the first quarter of 2018 as eric discussed we delivered a 95 7 adjusted operating ratio for the 2019 first quarter which is the 40 basis points improvement from the year ago quarter additionally our adjusted operating ratio improved by 260 basis points to an adjusted operating ratio of 93 9 from 96 5 for the trailing four quarters ending march 31 2019 and 2018 respectively net income for the first quarter of 2019 was 4 7 million compared to 1 2 million in the prior year quarter adjusted net income for the first quarter was 7 3 million and compares favorably to 1 2 million in the prior year quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share were 0 15 for the first quarter of 2019 as we discussed our fourth quarter call the exit of our fixed cost investment and our cross border us mexico operations was expected to be a drag on our first half results as revenues would declined more rapidly than expenses which we experienced in the first quarter looking forward we expect the headwind to persist into the second quarter though at a reduced level before turning neutral in the third quarter thereafter we expect to build an annualized operating income benefit importantly we ll offer customers both additional capacity within our core u s lanes and continued access to cross border coverage through an asset light alternative our effective tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 27 5 and we continue to anticipate our full year 2019 effective tax rate to be between 27 to 29 that we outlined on the fourth quarter 2018 call for the full year 2019 we continue to expect our cash tax rate to be in the low single digits turning to our fleet we continue to manage our tractors to a 475 000 mile replacement cycle and we are converting a portion of our leased tractors to owned and we ll spend approximately 170 million to 190 million in net capex through 2019 to execute that strategy with approximately 45 million of the total related to replacing leased equipment with owned as a reminder when thinking of free cash flow a normalized net capex figure over a four year period is approximately 115 million annually and we expect our net capex to revert to more normalized levels in 2020 and 2021 during the first quarter of 2019 the company adopted new asc topic 842 leases the new standard requires us to recognize right of use assets and a comparable amount of lease liabilities arising from operating leases on the balance sheet this resulted from in approximately 187 million of assets and a comparable amount of liabilities being recognized on the balance sheet at march 31 2019 rent associated with these operating leases was approximately 20 million for the first quarter of 2019 and is reflected under vehicle rent and general and other expenses in our income statement for the 2019 quarter the impact on stockholders equity was immaterial and the impact on covenant compliance under our credit facility is also immaterial capital leases will continue to be recognized on the balance sheet but are now referred as finance leases as required by the new standard in regards to leverage we ended the first quarter with 407 1 million of net debt and had 120 4 million of cash in availability under our revolving credit facility interest expense for the first quarter was 5 6 million and we continue to expect interest expense to be approximately 22 0 million for the full year of 2019 looking for the remainder of the year we continue to have opportunities for improvement as our existing driver centric initiatives mature and as a focus on operational execution with that i d like to turn the call back to eric fuller for concluding remarks eric fuller president and chief executive officer thank you eric in summary we are pleased with the progress that we have achieved executing upon our strategic initiatives enabling us to achieve our seventh consecutive quarter of adjusted operating ratio improvement in the first quarter and the highest earnings of any first quarter in our company s history as we ve discussed the outlook for the second quarter remains challenged in comparison to an exceptionally strong 2018 comparable quarter that said we continue to have much opportunity and remain well positioned to capitalize on our numerous initiatives aimed at driving operational efficiencies as we work toward our goal of achieving a 100 frictionless order which will improve the lives and daily routines of our drivers not to mention reduce costs and expand our capacity as we focus on managing the core metrics within our business we remain committed to our goal of improving our operations in solidifying u s xpress as a leader within the industry we look forward to updating everyone on our progress on our second quarter call thank you again for your time today operator please open the call for questions questions answers operator our first question here is from ravi shanker from morgan stanley please go ahead ravi shanker morgan stanley analyst thanks good evening guys so on the or target for the year obviously it s understandable it s going to be dependent on market conditions but part of the story here also was you guys undertaking a number of cost initiatives to close the gap to peers and so maybe that or improvement was not as market depend on some of your peers so can you help us understand that how much tailwind or opportunity there is in the cost side this year and kind of if that s tracking consistent with your initial expectations behind the ipo eric fuller president and chief executive officer yes so this is eric fuller so we had obviously we have focused around a couple of the big factors and driver turnover being one of them that is an area where we still believe we re going to continue to get traction through the year our big focus the big initiative that we have in our operation is around what we re calling the frictionless order and we believe that s going to greatly improve our driver retention so we think we can drive a good bit of cost in that area over probably the next say four quarters we also still believe that we re going to get improvement in the insurance line item insurance is the area where we continue to see higher than what we had expected or what we d hoped for but with the forward looking event recorders we re putting a new program around driver training we re trying to move more toward all of our drivers going to hair follicle testing we believe that we will start to see some significant results in that area as well so those really are our two biggest cost items that we think we can see some improvement over the next couple of quarters ravi shanker morgan stanley analyst ok got it and just on the pricing side i think your mid single digit pricing expectations sounds pretty good and may be ahead of some of your peers what gives you confidence that you should be able to kind of sustain that rate going into the back half of the year when maybe you could see some more pricing pressure if current trends continue eric fuller president and chief executive officer sure yes i think we can we will continue to see a little bit of pressure from where we re at today but we re still having constructive conversations with customers in a positive manner in relation to rate increases for this year so we feel confident that where the market is where we believe the market is going and we will continue to be able to get decent rate increases on a go forward basis that will still put us in that mid single digit range ravi shanker morgan stanley analyst great and if i can just squeeze one more in can i just ask you what u s x ventures sounds pretty interesting can you just give us maybe two or three top priorities for that venture and kind of does that involve m a is this homegrown kind of what do expect to see there and maybe some timing on some of the new initiatives eric fuller president and chief executive officer sure i think it s really an exploration about what technology can do for us going forward if you look at all the money that s getting thrown in to venture capital all the investments out there we believe that technology is going to be a big driver of asset based trucking companies going forward i think it s going to be an improvement to the overall operations and profitability we also think that there s going to be some maybe not on the asset side exactly but there s going to be some new entrants and some new things that we re going to have to face that maybe we have faced in the past and we think applying technology to those problems is going to be key to having a lot of them and so we re going to be exploring exactly what that means i think today i would tell you that we are in an infancy stage but we will be looking at opportunities whether it be an m a type opportunities or whether it be looking at some homegrown opportunities to further make better business model type changes in our existing business or potentially new businesses as we explore what technology can do for us and we just think there s a lot of exciting things going on in the market and we think that we can capitalize if we put a focus on it ravi shanker morgan stanley analyst great thank you eric fuller president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question is from brad delco from stephens please go ahead brad delco stephens inc analyst hey good afternoon guys eric i think you kind of touched on this in your comments but can you sort of help us reconcile the revenue per loaded mile being up 60 basis points versus kind of your comments about mid single digits i mean is it just because you have 20 exposure of a spot i mean why wouldn t we be reducing that and trying to get more trucks into a committed or contractual basis or maybe even in more dedicated eric fuller president and chief executive officer yes so it is in it is because of the spot concentration so absolutely we are looking at probably more dedicated the market is probably a little tougher from bringing on new opportunities the one thing that we have that s been a little bit of a headwind for us is that move out of mexico where we ve had additional capacity that we ve had to try to fill so we ve had to go to customers and find new opportunities and so i think that for us to move some trucks out of these spot environment we re going to have to probably go to dedicated but we re doing that and we are seeing some a little bit of growth in our dedicated area and so i think that over time we ll continue to migrate more into that dedicated arena i think personally i think that where we re at from our spot exposure though is still decent level of spot exposure and when you look at a long term on a long term basis so while it is kind of affecting us today i think long term we re in the right position brad delco stephens inc analyst ok and then when we think about sort of weather impacting results would that have would you have visibility to know if that impacted your otr business or dedicated business more and any comments would be helpful there eric fuller president and chief executive officer so dedicated we had a big concentration in the northeast and so obviously any time you ve got any kind of weather issues winter weather issues you end up being pretty impacted in those areas so i would say it s probably a fair mix but with our concentration of dedicated in the northeast we definitely saw a fairly large impact from that business the over the road piece was typically because the trucks aren t as concentrated you do end up having trucks probably down for a little bit longer so when you re ending up having a maintenance related issue as it relates to weather that s probably a little bit more impactful in the over the road division but i would say that both areas were impacted by the weather brad delco stephens inc analyst ok and then maybe last one i appreciate the comments about second quarter and not seeing or improvement on a year over year basis what is maybe this is for eric peterson what s really happening on the cost side that gives you that much visibility i mean i feel like it s pretty early into 2q and june s probably the most important month but is there anything specific that s occurred in april whether a bad accident or something that maybe gives you less confidence in being able to improve margins in this environment eric peterson chief financial officer brad i think the biggest thing right now is our visibility where we stand today on may 2 as it relates to the quarter from an overall volume standpoint the freight is a little bit weaker than we would like and as we get into spring shipping we would have liked to seen a little bit of a more robust environment than we re seeing today so that leads us to believe where we stand today that may be the quarter could be a little weaker than we expected now obviously your quarter s made in may and june and so things could change but we felt like it was prudent to go ahead and get that out there we re not seeing any kind of cost issues as it relates to this quarter that have us concerned at this point brad delco stephens inc analyst ok all right guys i ll get back in queue thanks for the time eric fuller president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question is from scott group of wolfe research please go ahead scott group wolfe research analyst hey thanks afternoon guys eric fuller president and chief executive officer afternoon scott group wolfe research analyst so i just want to follow up on the second quarter comments can you say are you including or excluding the mexico cost and then what s the base of or you re using for second quarter 18 eric fuller president and chief executive officer ok if you look at our adjusted second quarter or for 18 we re comparing that to a 93 4 the headwinds on the we had a 3 4 million adjustment in the first quarter related to mexico that adjustment in the second quarter is going to be significantly lower than that 3 4 million so it won t really impact the adjusted or by a meaningful amount scott group wolfe research analyst ok helpful and then as we think about the utilization on the otr it was down 7 maybe eric what are some of the initiatives to get that better are you seeing that start to get better when can that turn positive and then on the pricing side if we look at the rev per loaded mile up less than a percent even with the pricing contract pricing are we confident that that stays positive in the second quarter eric fuller president and chief executive officer so on the utilization piece it really impacted in two areas weather was a big impact and then just overall freight volumes was an impact i would say we re not going to have those weather issues in the second quarter i still think that freight volumes are lighter than we would like and so that could have a little bit of a drag in our utilization in our over the road division as we go into this quarter especially in comparison to the previous year on the contract business we still think that the contract rates will trend in a positive manner and even with that little bit of underlying weakness in the market we are still getting positive rate increases currently from our customers so i still feel confident that we will be positive up and like we said that mid single digit range in contracts for the year scott group wolfe research analyst i guess i was asking about the total revenue per mile eric fuller president and chief executive officer oh i m sorry oh ok oh we re going to be higher than that i think that with our exposure to spot i think that s going to be difficult to be higher than scott group wolfe research analyst understood and then maybe just lastly for eric peterson given sort of the backdrop here any thoughts to maybe slowing in the capex a little bit maybe doing less of the lease conversions just to generate some cash and pay down some debt eric peterson chief financial officer yes i think it s too early to make that call i think if we look at why we re here is to stick to our strategy which we believe is in the best interest of our shareholders over the long run to bring that equipment in when we do the math it shows that if we delay that equipment cycle the operating costs increase significantly and it might get a temporary benefit on my net debt for a quarter or free cash flow calculation but i believe that s absolutely the wrong decision over the longer for the enterprise and so we re going to stick to our strategy at 475 000 miles obviously if there s an extreme situation or circumstance then we won t be so bullish on that strategy if we need to make a change but i don t see us as anywhere near the type of situation right now with our current credit profile and liquidity that would prevent us from executing our strategy scott group wolfe research analyst ok makes sense thank you guys appreciate the time operator our next question is from ken hoexter from bank of america please go ahead ken hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey good afternoon eric can you just quickly clarify what is your spot exposure now and what was it eric fuller president and chief executive officer so it s really it s right in that 10 of our total revenue or say differently 20 of our over the road division and that really hasn t changed it s just that obviously the spot rates have changed dramatically but our overall exposure hasn t changed much ken hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst and how significantly have you seen the spot rates change whether it s year to date year over year eric fuller president and chief executive officer i think we re down roughly 20 ken hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok year over year eric fuller president and chief executive officer yes ken hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst at this point eric fuller president and chief executive officer yes ken hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok so just to come back to i guess the first question i guess i m little still troubled by the lack of improvement on the initiatives during the ipo process you talked about all the different programs you were putting in place that were specifically focused irrespective of the market that we re going to see the operating ratio improved and even last year was the best freight environment in generation so we should have been setting all time record and now we re back to kind of it seems like october 17 if you re down 20 on spot rates that s kind of right around the time of the hurricanes but maybe a little bit before elds but not a collapsed market and if you re talking about rates being up mid single digits i m confused as to why we re not seeing some of the benefits from the initiatives that you made has something gone awry in terms of driver pay or has turnover actually gone against you and increased maybe talk a little bit about what s going against some of the initiatives that you have been rolling out eric peterson chief financial officer ok i think this is eric peterson i believe when i m looking at the financial results from these initiatives i think it s fair to say that there are some we haven t made progress on that we d like but i think if i step back and look what just happened in the first quarter it was the best first quarter from an earnings perspective in the enterprise s history and i believe in what 100 of the people would agree it was not the strongest market from a first quarter perspective to answer your question on where we re behind is these event recorders with the insurance and you look at our insurance expense for the quarter i believe it was adversely impacted by weather but i also believe we re not making the progress at the speed of financial return that he probably thought we would with that said eric addressed earlier with our new training facility that launched in the first quarter of this year and also with the hair follicle testing we are laser focused on this forward facing event recorder that we are going to get the savings and just because we don t have it now doesn t mean we re not going to get it it s a path that we re not recreating anything other organizations are doing this successfully and it s just because it s not implemented doesn t mean that it will not be and so that s where we are on that initiative but i guess just to step back are we where we want to be on an absolute basis on earnings no was it the best quarter in the enterprise s history and are we still progress and do we have initial initiatives that we re launching that we think will accelerate over earnings improvement yes ken hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks for that eric and then just on your ability to get to 93 full year you said you need to see some see strengthening is that you need to see a strengthening on where is it on the volume side as eric talked about maybe not as strong of a second quarter or is it pricing to accelerate maybe just walk through on that target eric fuller president and chief executive officer yes i mean i think that a little bit of market pick up as it relates to both volume and rate if we can just get some a little bit of life in the spot market i think that would go a long way and then get a little bit more volume as i mentioned part of our utilization impact has been a lack of volume opportunities in the market so we believe with just a little bit of pick up on the demand side then we can start to see some movement there that i think can get us in that direction as eric just mentioned i still we re going to have to see a little bit of life in the initiatives around insurance that has been an area that admittedly has been disappointing and one that we did talk about on the ipo that we expected to see a little bit of movement there previous to now so that is an area that we continue to believe that we have put a lot of focus on and investment on and we re going to we believe we will see some improvement in that area but that is an area where at this point if there s anything i would say disappointing as that we haven t seen that move as of yet ken hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst just one last one if i can we head some other companies talk about amazon and walmart bringing business in house have you seen any enterprises pull any dedicated business away from the market is that any exposure of yours that we should look to eric fuller president and chief executive officer no i m not seeing anything on the dedicated side at all ken hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst or over the road eric fuller president and chief executive officer no we have seen some stuff on that we re really were running mostly in our brokerage division but we ve had two customers two larger customers that did pull some business out of the brokerage side and take that in house so that s probably been about the only thing that we ve seen from somebody moving business back in house ken hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst appreciate the time and thoughts thanks guys operator our next question is from brian ossenbeck from j p morgan please go ahead brian ossenbeck j p morgan analyst hey guys good afternoon i just want to come back to the hair follicle testing for a second is this something where you re going to see a bit of cost before you get some benefit potentially on the insurance side i m thinking when you make switch you have a higher standard and little bit more cost and probably a little bit more turnover so maybe if you can just walk us through that and if that s the right way to look at it and if so where you are in that process this is going to get a little bit worse before you start to get some improvements and some benefits from it eric fuller president and chief executive officer yes if you look at how we re managing that process is we re doing it a little bit more in a phased approach you ve seen some people who ve had probably the most impactful results from an overall truck count standpoint that went 100 all in we have been a little bit more phased in our rollout and it s for that reason that we know we re trying to overall manage the impact on the negative side i do believe though that we are seeing some real positive results as it relates to not only less accidents and insurance related issues from drivers who have been hair follicle tested but we re actually seeing less turnover as well so i feel confident that as we continue to roll this out to the entire fleet then we can manage any kind of downside issues as it relates to truck count and we can get through this with a positive impact throughout the entire process brian ossenbeck j p morgan analyst ok and then so the timing is it supposed to be done by the end of the year i mean what specifically would look like eric fuller president and chief executive officer yes yes i would say that at this point our plan would be to have the entire fleet under hair follicle testing by the end of the year brian ossenbeck j p morgan analyst ok and eric one more for you you talked about this frictionless order concept and it sounds like there might be something we talk more about in the next couple of quarters it sounds like from what you said about the timeline so maybe you can give a high level view in terms of what that means in the longer term and i guess in the intermediate step what you re looking to accomplish is this in brokerage or do you tend to see a lot more of the tech enabled stuff or it does sound like it s going to be more impactful for the drivers so maybe you re approaching a little bit differently than what we ve seen so far in the market eric fuller president and chief executive officer yes i would say we re approaching it a little differently and really focused around on the asset side of our business so if you look at a typical order there could be as many as 15 gates and those 15 gates are points in the order in which either they are some sort of data entry point or some sort of decision has to be made some of those decisions are being made by office employees and that entries being entered by office employees some of those gates are actually managed by the drivers so it creates a level it s a couple of issues one when you re every time you have to enter data there s a chance that you re going to have errors so being able to completely take that data entry piece off the table can reduce the amount of errors i have on my system but then also by optimize and then i can optimize those gates and make better decisions and make sure that i m making an optimal decision every time and then also by optimizing and potentially even automating the gates on the driver side i can reduce the amount of friction and frustration that the drivers have so the drivers aren t constantly having to send information back into us on things going on with them or in their order that we can automate a lot of that and so for us we believe it s probably more impactful on the driver turnover side so as the drivers job become easier and they don t have that friction in their day to day we can drive the driver the driver turnover down and we think it s going to be extremely impactful as we go through the year admittedly we started this process what about three or four months ago i can tell you today we re at 0 frictionless but we believe over this next year we ll start to drive some of those gates out to where we can automate them and we re going to make things a lot easier for the drivers and also a lot easier for office employees as well brian ossenbeck j p morgan analyst ok and i just want a quick follow up is this an internal process where you re dealing with the u s x folks or you have consultants is this more off the shelf what s how s this all structured and being handled eric fuller president and chief executive officer it s mostly internal we have worked a little bit with some consultants here and there but for the most part we re doing this internal and so that s where we think we re going to get the biggest benefit and we think it will be a differentiator operator our next question is from david ross of stifel please go ahead david ross stifel financial corp analyst yes so just a follow up there on the technology costs is there any lumpiness to the investments that you are making in the technology around the frictionless order or other and is it going to flow through mainly in capex or opex eric peterson chief financial officer yes thanks for the question this is eric peterson i look at this more of a continuation of what we ve been working on if you track back to our s 1 this is launched last june two of our four strategies were technology and we were using words like ai and graph databases and we were doing that back then and then kind of as we ve evolved and we ve had these initiatives around the fleet management the customer service the load planning part of those initiatives had a technology component and as these initiatives evolve you start putting the investment where you re getting the largest return and what we found right now is that on the technology component to those initiatives they re all ultimately driven around to see the tractor utilization rate and cost is where how we focus our initiatives we see that as we re putting extra investment to the technology piece that we re getting a larger return and so as we mentioned the core part of that was a consultant component and then part of that now is bringing some of that talent and ideas in house to augment the team with perspectives we haven t had before so right now we re not talking about a significant capex investment that we re making but to the extent that we re walking in trying to enhance the enterprise value and we have a discovery on this initiative where an investment might make a lot of sense relative to the return then we would do that but right now i don t have a plan in place that says this is how much i m going to have this big lumpy spend in the next month and then it s going go away we re just focused on the technology and investing in it as we go along david ross stifel financial corp analyst ok so no lumpiness in the opex or anything it just flows through and then eric peterson chief financial officer correct david ross stifel financial corp analyst what s the current average fleet age for the tractors and trailers eric peterson chief financial officer yes we re in that mid 27 month range right now and i think the important with this capex here to point out as we plan on exiting the year at 18 months on the tractors and so when you re and that s why that investment looks heavy in 2019 but i think what really sets us up for the 2020 is having a really young fleet lower operating cost and a chance to really enhance our earnings as we migrate down to 18 months over that remaining seven months of the year david ross stifel financial corp analyst and what about the trailer side eric peterson chief financial officer i don t have that exact number in front of me david ross stifel financial corp analyst ok and you talked about the event recorders what percent of the fleet now has those event recorders and when is it going to be 100 eric fuller president and chief executive officer i mean we re pretty much at 100 there are some straggler out there but for the most part we re at 100 and have been since mid summer of last year david ross stifel financial corp analyst ok and last question is just a clarification when you talked about a couple customers moving freight from your brokerage division in house were they moving it in house to their own private fleet in house to their own in house brokerage or in house to manage under contract with another carrier eric fuller president and chief executive officer not moving into another carrier in most cases moving it in house to manage through potentially their own brokerage david ross stifel financial corp analyst ok excellent thank you very much operator this concludes the question and answer session i d like to turn the floor back to management for any closing comments eric fuller president and chief executive officer ok we appreciate everybody s time and we ll see you in a couple of months thank you operator duration 54 minutes call participants brian baubach senior vice president corporate finance eric

icd earnings call for the period ending march 31 2019 independence contract drilling icd 1 04 q1 2019 earnings call 12 00 p m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks operator good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the independence contract drilling first quarter 2019 financial results conference call please note that this event is being recorded at this time i would like to turn the conference over to philip choyce executive vice president and chief financial officer please go ahead sir philip choyce executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today to discuss icd s first quarter 2019 results with me today is anthony gallegos our president and chief executive officer before we begin i would like to remind all participants that our comments today will include forward looking statements which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties a number of factors and uncertainties could cause actual results in future periods to differ materially from what we talk about today for a complete discussion of these risks we encourage you to read the company s earnings release and our documents on file with the sec in addition we refer to non gaap measures during the call please refer to the earnings release and our public filings for a full reconciliation of net loss to adjusted net income ebitda and adjusted ebitda and for definitions of our non gaap measures and with that i ll turn it over to anthony for opening remarks 10 stocks we like better than independence contract drilling when investing geniuses david and tom gardner have a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has quadrupled the market david and tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and independence contract drilling wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of march 1 2019 anthony gallegos president and chief executive officer good morning everyone i m pleased to say we are following up our better than expected fourth quarter results with very good results for the first quarter this year especially considering a pretty challenging market brought about by the oil price decline in the fourth quarter of last year and our customers response in fact we are reporting adjusted net income for the second consecutive quarter these results were made possible because of the intense focus on safe operations on our continued successful integration and on cost control and synergy realization which drove better than expected financial performance in our cost lines again during the quarter during the first quarter we averaged 30 3 operating rigs which represents 95 utilization of our marketed fleet during the quarter we had several wins in the form of contracts renewed and new and incremental contracts with existing customers overall fleet utilization tracked our expectations very closely and i m pleased with how things are shaping up the recent commodity price issues that resulted in a reduction in our customers operating budgets as well as our customers focus on operating within free cash flow had not materially affected the utilization of our pad optimal fleet while first and second quarter utilization is choppy it is still robust as pad optimal rigs with good performance have and will continue to find follow on work as the industry adjusts drilling programs and reallocates drilling rigs accordingly so really what we have experienced and will experience in the second quarter is just transitory downtime as we reshuffle the deck and redistribute the pad optimal fleet across our customer base in our target markets with summary contracting opportunities being driven by fleet high grading and some based on incremental rig ads philip will provide more detail on his prepared remarks regarding first quarter financials however i d like to provide some additional color we exited 2018 with 32 rigs contracted during the first quarter we signed 6 contract extensions and dealt with three rigs where operators were not continuing the rigs drilling program which resulted in the expected transitory downtime during the quarter two of these rigs were quickly recontracted and have already recommenced operations during the second quarter the third rig is being upgraded to 300 series specifications and will be equipped with 25 000 feet racking capacity and one million pounds hookload when the upgrade is complete the rig already had three mud pumps and four engines this rig was a legacy sidewinder rig and a very good example of perhaps an underappreciated value point associated with the organic earnings and free cash flow growth we can achieve from the sidewinder fleet acquired in the combination once this 300 series upgrade is complete this rig s specifications will be the highest in the industry and should earn leading edge dayrates in the market and the total incremental capex for us to complete the upgrade for this rig is only 1 3 million on which we will earn sub two year paybacks and superior investment returns our target date for this rig to reenter our operating fleet is the beginning of the third quarter we have six additional legacy sidewinder ac rigs operating today that can be upgraded to these specs at similar capex levels again more low risk organic high return free cash flow generating growth opportunities that we can execute upon with respect to the second quarter we continue to experience some transitory downtime issues but it also appears to be the trough as rig inquiries over the past 30 days have increased we have a very good line of sight on numerous recontracting opportunities and i fully expect transitory issues to resolve during the back half of the year and most likely in the third quarter as we deal with the few remaining rigs we need to reallocate among our customer base some have already been recontracted and for the remaining we have multiple opportunities for mid to late may or june reactivations as we sit here today we only have three idle uncontracted rigs including the rig undergoing the 300 series upgrade i previously discussed so fleet utilization for the quarter should remain robust troughing around 90 or so one final item on this topic before i move on as we reposition our fleet among our customer base we are experiencing some labor cost inefficiencies as we maintain staffing while rigs are in transition philip will go through the details but while this allows us the opportunity to internalize many costs and perform operations we might normally outsource when our rigs are in full effect of utilization it does create some inefficiencies and i do expect higher daily operating cost during the second quarter for this reason but fully expect us to return to first quarter daily opex levels or lower during the back half of this year moving on to the pricing environment as mentioned on our prior conference call lower commodity prices and our customers reduced budgets and continued focus to operate within free cash flow have put some modest pressure on dayrates and contract tenders more so on recontracting idle rigs than with respect to contract extensions compared to march and april of last year dayrates for icd have improved but have declined slightly from where leading edge rates were prior to the oil price decline that began late fall 2018 so we are still seeing dayrate improvements on renewals of older contracts but not the dayrate momentum we were hoping for 6 months ago in this environment most of our new contracts and renewals are on a shorter term basis six months or less with a few exceptions this does reduce our reported backlog number but it also sets us up nicely to fully participate in what we believe will be a more constructive recontracting environment at the back half of this year once transitory utilization issues resolve and our customers budgets begin reacting to the improving commodity price environment this contracting strategy is a slight change from icd s prior precombination strategy when we were operating a smaller fleet but one we re very comfortable with given our fleet size strong balance sheet and more importantly our very strong customer base in that regard over two thirds of our rigs are contracted today with the top 30 operators in the united states as measured by rigs under contract in fact one third of our rigs are working for the top six customers these customers are focused on optimizing well and fuel efficiencies through complex multiwell pad drilling which we believe will drive incremental demand for our pad optimal shaledriller fleet and i believe these customers recognize the value that icd provides them not only through best in class rigs but superior service delivered by our top notch personnel supported by industry leading systems and processes in fact in february of this year energypoint research rated us the top plan contract driller for service and professionalism based upon their most recent customer surveys ahead of our larger competitors prior to the sidewinder combination we were too small to be considered for this survey of course most of our customer base is comprised of leading publicly traded e ps which continue to talk about their commitment to capital discipline to live within cash flow but they have been slow to ramp up drilling operations in response to recent commodity price improvements which limits drilling rig demand visibility somewhat during the back half of this year but i believe robust economic and industrial activity in the united states combined with supply shortcomings in certain oil producing countries and continued discipline on the part of opec should continue to provide an upward bias on oil prices the question is how much our customers will adjust their drilling plans in response to the higher commodity prices regardless i believe the pad optimal fleet will again reach full effect of utilization during the back half of this year most likely during the third quarter as high grading continues and budgets are adjusted albeit slower than in past cycles in response to improved oil prices now looking at this market and what it means for icd strategically over the next couple of quarters as i previously mentioned things are playing out much as we laid out on our prior conference call we expect to hit the trough during the second quarter but recover the full effect of utilization and a more constructive pricing environment during the back half of the year in this environment i do not expect our capital budget to materially change we still expect to continue planned third mud pump additions were justified economically and will pursue other 300 series upgrades similar to the one we have in progress as opportunities present themselves with respect to our planned scr to ac conversions the first delivery of long lead time items from nov will occur in a couple of weeks so we will be ready from that point forward to begin completing those conversions when opportunities present themselves before i close my prepared remarks i want to provide an update on our integration efforts i m extremely pleased with our progress we ve successfully hit every one of our critical integration milestones and remain confident that we will achieve our target for synergies of 10 million or more and be at that run rate as we enter the third quarter of 2019 now as i close my prepared remarks i want to reiterate where i believe icd is positioned strategically not only operationally but with respect to our ability to generate sustained earnings free cash flow growth and financial returns for our stockholders on an absolute and per share basis and not just in strong markets but even in choppier market environments such as the one we are experiencing today today i believe we are only one of two u s land based contract drillers actually reporting adjusted net income for the quarter or for that matter over the past two quarters philip will provide additional details in his remarks but from a free cash flow basis even in a choppy market that exists today icd s free cash flow generation especially when looking at our current stock price is very strong and will only improve as we move toward the back half of this year operationally we have the right assets are working for the right customers and the right basins and continue to provide exceptional services that are necessary to assist our customers in maximizing efficiencies and productivity in their overall drilling programs and finally we re beginning to execute on the high return free cash flow generating organic growth investment opportunities that are embedded in the sidewinder rigs we acquired in the combination i want to assure you we are focused on the big picture with a returns focused orientation applied to all decisions which we make and these investments will generate superior returns and be made while maintaining robust free cash flow and without stressing our balance sheet our board management team and shareholders are all aligned in this regard in fact you may have read in our recently filed proxy some of the executive compensation changes that we made post sidewinder combination including increasing performance of board rating and tying a large portion of those incentives to meeting and exceeding return on capital metrics as you ve heard me say before while nothing has changed everything is different here at icd and with that i ll turn the call over to philip so he can walk us through the details philip choyce executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks anthony during the quarter we reported adjusted net income of 2 9 million or 0 04 per share and adjusted ebitda of 15 8 million representing the second consecutive quarter in which we have reported positive adjusted net income the quarter included a 2 5 million or 0 03 per share tax benefit excluding that benefit adjusted income was 0 01 per share merger and related asset disposal impairment cost on nonstaired equipment acquired in the sidewinder merger are excluded when arriving at adjusted net income and ebitda with respect to the other items during the quarter revenue per day of 20 755 and rig utilization of 95 came in consistent with our guidance reflecting a small amount of idle time associated with transitioning rigs between customers sequential pricing improvements relate to improved pricing on contract roles cost per day of 13 302 came in below our guidance sequential increases in cost from the fourth quarter of 2018 relate to seasonal payroll tax items and a shorter quarter of which to absorb fixed operational support costs sg a of 4 5 million including noncash compensation expense of 400 000 came in consistent with guidance with sequential improvement in cash sg a being driven by continued realization of merger synergies depreciation and interest expense came in consistent with our guidance as we mentioned we did record a tax benefit during the quarter associated with the application of our estimated effective tax rate for the year to the unadjusted net loss we reported during the quarter tax expense for the year will be comprised of louisiana tax and texas margin tax as i ve discussed previously given our nol position and the full step up in basis we received on the acquired sidewinder assets we acquired in the combination another i believe underappreciated free cash flow generating facet of that transaction we do not expect to be a cash taxpayer for federal tax purposes in the near term cash payments for capital expenditures net of disposals insurance recoveries and capital lease additions were 9 3 million during the quarter our overall 2019 capital budget of 29 million remains unchanged as discussed on our prior call capex is skewed somewhat toward the first half of the year thus once working capital normalizes at the end of the second quarter post integration we expect our ebitda to free cash flow conversion during the back half of the year to normalize and substantially improve moving on to our balance sheet at march 31 we reported net debt excluding capital leases of 122 4 million up slightly from year end relating to continued payment of accrued transaction expenses and other seasonal working capital investments there will be additional accrued transaction expenses between 4 million and 5 million that will flow through our cash flow statement during the second quarter at which time we expect our working capital items to normalize at march 31 we had total liquidity comprised of cash on hand and availability under our revolver in term loan accordion of 51 million our backlog at march 31 stood at 102 4 million representing 13 2 rig years of work as anthony mentioned terms on recent contracts and extensions have been predominantly short term in nature now moving on to guidance for the second quarter of 2019 we expect to see the following operating days approximating 2 580 days during the quarter revenue per day is expected to be approximately flat with the first quarter cost per day during the second quarter will range between 13 700 and 13 900 sequentially higher than the first quarter the increase does not represent a true cost increase but rather relates to maintaining our existing employee base during the transitory idle periods anthony discussed in his prepared remarks we expect our cost per day to return to levels experienced during the first quarter or lower once those issues are behind us and our rig fleet reapproaches full effect of utilization right now we re expecting that to occur during the third quarter sg a expense will be approximately 4 3 million during the quarter including 500 000 of noncash stock based compensation estimated decreases in cash sg a are directly associated with continued realization of transaction synergies depreciation and interest expense should be flat with the first quarter tax expense is tricky to predict for the reasons previously discussed but right now we would expect a small benefit realized during the second quarter and finally we will incur some additional merger related expenses principally severance during the second quarter as we close out the integration process we expect those to be in the 1 5 million range and with that i will turn the call back over to anthony anthony gallegos president and chief executive officer thanks phil i have no further comments at this time operator let s open up the line for questions questions answers operator thank you sir your first questions will be from kurt hallead of rbc please go ahead kurt hallead rbc capital markets analyst i appreciate those insights and your views on what s transpiring and the company s positioning within it i think the focal point i think i might want to take here initially is as you look through the remainder of 2019 and you mentioned you re getting increased inquiries and expecting to get back to kind of full utilization when you kind of think about a full year kind of ebitda and kind of full year kind of free cash flow how do you see that evolving and do you think you can potentially kind of get to a 70 million ebitda number for the full year philip choyce executive vice president and chief financial officer the answer will be yes we can get there it s going to be second quarter is the trough the third and fourth quarter we expect to get better pricing than what we re getting today our capex is going to be lower than what we did this quarter some of it is front ended and we did have some working capital investments really related to the merger and we re going to have some of that in the second quarter so back half of the year i expect when i look at our free cash flow i measure it really by our net debt number and you re going to see that go down as we enter the third and fourth quarter it s already starting you don t see that at the company now but so the answer is we believe we can get there kurt hallead rbc capital markets analyst ok that s great appreciate that specificity maybe an additional follow up shortly after i think and actually looking at your most recent investor deck here you indicated some potential outcomes on free cash flow generation looking at synergies and adjusted backlog for dayrates and scr conversions etc potentially with free cash flow somewhere between 80 million to 100 million given what s transpired over the course of the past couple of months is there any reason to think that that range that potential range of 80 million to 100 million of free cash is any lower or are you pretty comfortable with that range still anthony gallegos president and chief executive officer no kirk that s a great question appreciate that just to be clear though i think what we signaled and put in those in that powerpoint was an ebitda in the range of what you re talking about and the take away from that and the point we wanted to convey was in order for this company to generate 100 million plus of ebitda we will not need dayrates in the upper 20 type range meaning i think the benchmark that we used when we did that calculation was 23 000 a day type dayrates obviously a normalized apex number a rationalized g a to support that you start backing away from the ebitda you generate the free cash i m sorry the capex investment that when we acquired from a maintenance standpoint and you calculate your free cash flow yield it s obviously very very attractive that was the point we were trying to make in that deck but to answer your question yes we can see when we get out into 2020 and certainly beyond assuming the commodity holds up demand is still there for the equipment that we do think that s very realistic and very doable and that s the path that we re headed down kurt hallead rbc capital markets analyst that s awesome thank you for that appreciate it thank you operator the next question will be from taylor zurcher of tudor pickering holt please go ahead taylor zurcher tudor pickering holt and company analyst anthony i thought some of the commentary provided on pricing for the contract renewals be more steady than or excuse me for extensions being a little bit more steady than for rigs changing hands which maybe is intuitive but a couple of questions there one if that dynamic continues to play out do you see any of your e p customers today i guess starting to become keen to that fact and starting to play the spot market a little bit more with multiple drilling contractors and then secondarily when you talked about inquiries increasing for i think you said may and june type time frames what sort of e p operators are driving that sort of uptick is it operators that have dropped rigs over the past couple of months or maybe some of the larger privates coming back any color there would be helpful anthony gallegos president and chief executive officer yes no problem thank you for the questions taylor on the renewal situation just to give you a little color maybe help understand that issue a little bit better when we re negotiating a rollover contract with an existing customer obviously we re in a different position because often times the rig has been with that customer for quite some time there are certain efficiencies that have been gained from the relationship the rig the crews know the drilling program likewise the customer understands the rig and its capabilities so we re just in a different position when we re negotiating a contract extension with an existing customer on a situation where we re pursuing new work with a new client obviously your customer is going to look at hs e how you performed that s kind of the first box that has to be ticked second does the rig meet their equipment specification and suffice to say with the drawdown in rig count over this year there are other rigs out there that have capabilities similar to what our rigs would have so you re just in a much more competitive situation and dynamic when you re negotiating that contract from the incremental rig to go to work for that customer so that s really the difference and the reason for the delta in those kind of rates and certainly we ve been fortunate or unfortunate depending are expected to perhaps negotiate both of those kind of opportunities here in the first quarter but if you look at where we are in terms of the utilization in light of what s happened across the industry over the last four five months i think we ve done pretty well the marketing team works really hard every day to make sure that we re aware of opportunities out there to contract our rigs and that most importantly we re able to secure those contracts with regard to your second question in the inquiries i would say where we re seeing the what we re seeing in the market is the public guys they continue to stick to the mantra of living within free cash flow even though i think most people would assume that free cash flow will be higher in the back part of the year than what they budgeted for the most part the guys have kind of stuck to their guns on that so there have been some high grade opportunities where we ve been able to replace a lower performing rig with a customer you won t see that in rig count but it would be incremental to icd and also the privates the large privates is an area where we do see opportunities not only from icd rigs but possibly incremental rigs to the overall rig count hopefully that answers your question taylor zurcher tudor pickering holt and company analyst it did it did and one follow up which you touched on there is just the drilling efficiency dynamic that s i think been a common theme with the e ps are q1 is that it feels like a lot of them are still realizing incremental drilling efficiencies and to me there s a positive in that you sort of need this high end rig and the negative is obviously that more rigs are getting dropped as a result and so curious with your fleet are you still seeing incremental drilling efficiencies year to date in 2019 and overall how do you see that dynamic playing out maybe over the next 12 months anthony gallegos president and chief executive officer yes i think from an equipment standpoint the shaledriller rigs the rigs that we own are as good and in some attributes in many cases even better than the standard industry offering out there i think when you look across basins and even within basins where you might see productivity not be where you would think it would be is really more driven by the particular program the particular wells that are being drilled for example you look out there there s customers continue to test the limits of how long is too long for a lateral for example it s just an economic equation to drill more footage the expectation is they earn more dayrate but oftentimes the further out you get in a lateral it can become more complicated not just from a drilling standpoint but also from a completion standpoint so i really would say it s inefficiencies to the extent they exist are going to be tied more to a particular drilling program in a particular well than maybe a particular customer and certainly a rig taylor zurcher tudor pickering holt and company analyst understood and i ll try to squeeze one more in probably for you phil which is on the free cash flow front you laid out why that s likely to start ramping or improving in the back half of the year from a use of cash perspective i suspect that pay down is probably near the top of the priority list should we expect you to build cash in the balance sheet in the back half of the year or start whittling down that debt balance either late 19 or early 20 philip choyce executive vice president and chief financial officer the term loan is prepayable so we can pay that down as we generated free cash flow i think we d probably do a little bit of both the board will make that decision with anthony and i talking to them back half of the year but i think paying down debt will be certainly part of that taylor zurcher tudor pickering holt and company analyst ok great guys i ll turn back good luck operator the next question will be from connor lynagh of morgan stanley please go ahead connor lynagh morgan stanley analyst i was wondering if you could verify or to give your commentary on spot rates so it seems like some of your competitors over the past few weeks have kind of identified what i would guess would be your equivalent to your 300 series rig having rates in the mid 20s do you agree with that and if so can you help frame for us how much of a mark to market opportunity you have in your fleet in terms of just rolling to higher leading edge rate anthony gallegos president and chief executive officer yes no problem obviously there s a premium in dayrate when you are able to bring to market kind of rig like we re talking about in 303 the rig we re upgrading right now that will be available here in just a few weeks i do think that premium is 2 000 a day plus i think when you look at icd and you think about where we are i mean everybody can do the math i think you look at average dayrate for the company today it s largely a function of legacy contracts contracts that were put in place some time ago the market can change quickly it can change dramatically which is what we ve seen over the last six months so we re in this interesting situation where certainly on a year over year basis you should continue to see our average dayrate increase i think quarter to quarter at least here in the first part of the year it s going to move more sideways but obviously with the expectation for increased demand in the back part of this year and certainly rolling into 2020 we would expect to see that continue its upward momentum connor lynagh morgan stanley analyst that s helpful and you had alluded to high grading opportunities before i m curious are customers willing to pay so much for the efficiency that they would fund an upgrade like scr to ac conversion or something like that or is this more incremental as we here and there how do you think about that anthony gallegos president and chief executive officer yes not seeing opportunities where they would fund especially on the front end the conversion cost what i referred to high grade opportunities connor really what i was referring to is if a guy s got 20 rigs running and he s always going to have some really really good rigs and he s probably going to have some rigs that aren t doing as well if there s a hot rig that s being released from another customer even if it s owned by another contractor with great performance he s going to do like any of us would do and that s make the decision to drop his lower performing rigs and pick up something that may be higher performing certainly if it s more capable that s even better for his perspective the question is is he willing to pay for that and that s what we re feeling through right now obviously we believe that there is a premium that the customer is willing to pay for and that s why we moved forward with the 303 upgrade which is under way right now i do want to point out we that s a very modest amount of capex we invested in that rig it was a big rig to begin with it already had three mud pumps already has four generators but we have six more just like it that depending on where the market goes assuming customers continue to be willing to pay for the high end equipment those are very easy levers that we ll pull over the next year one and a half years and move those through the fleet as well philip choyce executive vice president and chief financial officer and connor our four when we talked we talked about the 4 scr rigs three of them are drilling and one of them is idle and then we have the one other the 34th rig is an ac rig and when we bring those out those can easily have these 300 series features on them as well connor lynagh morgan stanley analyst understood thanks for the call operator the next question will be from daniel burke of johnson rice please go ahead daniel burke johnson rice analyst good morning guys i guess i just wanted to dig a little bit more deeply into the utilization outlook for q2 and then the transition into what s expected to be a little bit more of a robust second half of the year so it looked like you guided to give or take 3 5 idle rigs in q2 you have three idle today i guess i m just is the delta between three and 3 5 and i know i m parsing this pretty finely is that just a safety allowance or do you have line of sight that you d still might have another one or two rigs returned by your operators here in q2 anthony gallegos president and chief executive officer no we have three idle rigs right now but what happened we had some rigs come back to us right at the end of the first quarter and then it takes us a month days we don t wind up exactly on the recontracting so it might be one it feels like to me it s like we get these rigs it takes us one to two months three months on the long end it seems to get the rig and back out so it s really a matter of it s just the timing so we had some rigs in april that we ve recontracted that we have idle times on so that s really it s not really a safety allowance it s what we think about what we re going to do and so it s really just there s a lot of ins and outs in there right now there s probably five rigs that we re dealing with in the second quarter and that most of them have been recontracted or we know when they re going out and it s just kind of where that s where the dust settles daniel burke johnson rice analyst ok got it and that s helpful i know it s easy to put it together in any greater detail than the way you already have i guess other question i would ask anthony maybe and as much as right now there is a lot of focus on returning some of the rigs to service when you think about the scr conversions and you re now about to start receiving some of the long lead time items i mean do you have any level of customer discussions going on regarding those conversions at this point anthony gallegos president and chief executive officer yes as a matter of fact we do daniel it s this is a really exciting project for the company it s exciting to me from an investment perspective of being able to take these rigs that are good rigs in their own right but really moving them to the next level without having to spend just an absurd amount of capital to make that happen and these rigs with just a little bit of incremental capex we can take them to as philip indicated the highest specification in the industry so there s some interesting work out there in other basins outside of it the one that we talked about today where a rig like that would bring a lot of value a standard 1 500 horsepower rig with two pumps wouldn t be able to do so obviously we re spending a lot of time on those opportunities but also talking to existing customers because there are scenarios and situations where we can displace competitor rigs or possibly even high grade rigs that we may have with the customer and do something with that particular rig and put it with someone else so i m really optimistic and positive obviously about the opportunity that the 300 series and even the remaining ac conversion rates that we have present for the company daniel burke johnson rice analyst ok got it all right guys well i ll leave it there operator the next question will be from thomas curran of b riley fbr please go ahead thomas curran b riley fbr inc analyst anthony now that you re two quarters into integration could you give us an update on how you re thinking about longer term technology priorities so for new initiatives where will your focus be will it be on new apps for your software platform automation an extension of services you provide with the rig or perhaps on the hardware side related to specific systems or components on the rig i realize that the 300 series is still relatively new in terms of design but i d love an update on how you re thinking strategically about technology going forward anthony gallegos president and chief executive officer yes so thank you for the question tom so the first thing we talked about this before that we had to nail and get right was the integration of these two companies and i think we ve been pretty open with people we confirmed that what we did every one of our critical milestones we re going to bag every bit of the synergies which have been raised once already in terms of our expectation and we re going to be we are integrated now and we re going to be at a run rate incorporating the synergies as we roll into the third quarter as we think longer term certainly we have to make sure we have the right platform and we believe we do in terms of the equipment the rigs that we have are obviously very capable some of them the subset have the opportunity to be upgraded even further and we ve got a line of sight on that in the plan we just we want to make sure we get paid for it but as we think longer term icd is a bit unique as it relates to how we re going about this we ve got competitors much larger competitors that have gone out and invested a lot of money trying to go at it at their on their own with their own solution to the problem but our strategy has been to leverage off of a lot of good work that s going on in the industry with third parties and be able to get to the same place with our rigs and i m confident that we re going to be able to do that there s already work under way on that front i can t talk about it at this time but we will not be left behind in this regard but i do want to emphasize we have to have the right rig to be able to deploy that type of technology and be able to provide that kind of value to your customer and we have that in place now thomas curran b riley fbr inc analyst and to the extent you could share some additional color on the path you re pursuing is it going to be more like a partnership an alliance will it just be a standard vendor relationship anthony gallegos president and chief executive officer i think it d be more of a collaborative type relationship we re not going to go out and buy anybody or anything like that to execute on our strategy so i ll look at it more as a collaboration thomas curran b riley fbr inc analyst ok and then on the contracting dynamics front are you starting to have any customers come to you guys and proactively explore new commercial models new structures for how you re compensated how you price work or determine the revenue for drilling a well or sections of well once it s been completed anthony gallegos president and chief executive officer unfortunately not i wish i can say we have where we ve had those conversations and we re trying to tom like a lot of people we re having to instigate those conversations we re having to put ideas in front there s the question in the industry is how much value will be created by this technology or these types of technologies and then what s the proper compensation and there s all kinds of ways you can get there but i think right now suffice to say the industry is very curious i think there are some early adopters out there that are willing to take the ball and run but i believe for the most part right now most guys are kind of sitting back waiting to see how this plays out and we ll jump on the bandwagon down the road thomas curran b riley fbr inc analyst ok thanks for taking my questions anthony gallegos president and chief executive officer and i was referring to customers by the way thomas curran b riley fbr inc analyst got it makes sense operator and ladies and gentlemen that will conclude our question and answer session i would like to hand the conference back over to anthony gallegos for his closing remark anthony gallegos president and chief executive officer ok guys we really appreciate everybody dialing in today looking forward to seeing you guys on the road we ve got some investor conferences coming up i m looking forward to talking to you again here in a couple of months as we talk about

there are many reasons most journalists and other democrats have focused on additional witch hunts on president trump and why they seek to destroy a g barr while they lie to the public that they are trying to unite us here is a small sample of topics they need the voting public to ignore or not hear about they don t want to talk about their continuous lie about russian collusion with no evidence while trump told the truth from the start they don t want to admit that the obama administration spied illegally on many americans including trump they laughed at trump when he truthfully said he was spied on they don t want to discuss all the scandals cover ups and criminal activity by people throughout the obama administration including obama himself they don t want the public to learn how punitive to people socialism is while rewarding their political leaders they certainly don t want to talk about rep omar saying the u s is who is causing the problems in venezuela they certainly will not talk about how ignorant biden was when he said china is not a threat to the u s they don t want the people to learn the truth about what trump said about charlottesville they need the despicable race card to gin up hate to keep minorities voting for them they don t want the public to learn the truth about the crisis on the border and what they have said in the past that is similar to what trump truthfully says today they won t talk about how government policies encouraged and caused the massive run up in student debt they will not talk about how the tax cuts have helped almost everyone they will continually spread the lie that the tax cuts benefited only the rich they will not admit that capitalism allows people to move both up and down the economic ladder while continually trying to get people to hate the rich they will pretend medicare for all will reduce medical costs and completely ignore that they said the same thing about obamacare which caused a massive increase in premiums deductibles and out of pocket expenses i can t think of any government monopoly that has reduced costs they will ignore the fact that health insurance premiums have stabilized after trump got rid of the individual mandate and gave the people freedom of choice again this is the opposite of what the public was told would happen they don t want to talk about the number of murders and other crimes illegal aliens commit they will not tell the truth about the stupidity of the green new deal and how it would destroy the economy while creating massive government bureaucracy they will not admit that when alexandria ocasio cortez beto and others are saying we have only a few years to act they are just making it up to scare the people they will ignore the fact that previous warnings of looming disaster have all been 100 wrong and based on inaccurate manipulated fraudulent computer models that have no basis in reality they absolutely do not want to talk about how trump told the truth that the economy could grow 3 we were told repeatedly by journalists and other so called experts that trump was wrong they will ignore the fact that obama s stifling tax and regulation policies gave us the slowest economic recovery in seventy years why would people vote for those pathetic results if they were told the truth before trump was elected and throughout last year we were told we were heading into a recession and there was just a sugar high because of the tax cuts these media pundits were essentially campaigning for democrats and rooting for a slower economy instead of telling the public the truth they will ignore that last year the federal reserve was on automatic pilot raising interest rates mindlessly despite lower interest rates throughout the world and low inflation thank goodness we have trump to teach them what they should do while allowing them to operate independently of course the media and other democrats said how bad trump was when he was jawboning the fed it is such a shame that trump watches out for the american people and the private sector instead of watching out for big government and democrats want big government there will be little focus on the 263 000 new jobs for april or the 50 year low in the unemployment rate at 3 6 we will be told by the democrats running for president how they are going to fix or remake the economy for the middle class and the puppets posing as journalists will pretend moving toward bigger government will be good they will ignore or significantly bury that black hispanic women s and the less educated s unemployment rates have all reached record lows during trump s two years we have been told by the experts that we couldn t get this low an unemployment rate and if we did we would have higher inflation they were 100 wrong despite trump helping minorities women and others move up the economic ladder he will continue to be portrayed falsely as a sexist and racist facts don t matter to journalists and other democrats only political power how could the experts miss that lower taxes and fewer regulations would give businesses more room to raise wages without causing inflation and that the faster economy will increase productivity that shows a complete lack of understanding of how economics works isn t it amazing that as most of the world s economies slow down the economy under trump has sped up besides 5 7 million new jobs there are around 1 million fewer part time jobs shouldn t we give credit to trump for 6 7 million full time jobs there are 500 000 new manufacturing jobs when we were told they are gone for good and 600 000 new construction jobs wages are rising faster than any time during obama especially for those at the lower end of the income scale so much for the lie that trump wants to help only the rich the democrat campaigns will be a series of false and misleading attacks on trump and will be fully supported by most journalists the manipulation of the public by the american media in order to get votes for democrats is much more dangerous than anything the russians or any other country has done the spying by the obama administration where they used the false dossier funded by hillary and the dnc as a pretense is the biggest political scandal i have seen in my 66 years but instead of most journalists caring about the absolute abuse of power they have supported it every step of the way photo credit r nial bradshaw

today on the call i will review our operating highlights and business updates rob will then discuss our business and markets in more detail afterwards dave will follow up with further information on our financial results balance sheet and outlook following our prepared remarks we will open the lines for questions while 2019 started with the same muted buyer interest that characterized much of the second half of last year solid momentum across our national home building platform began to build as the quarter progressed by the end of the quarter we were experiencing an overall stabilization in demand trends along with better affordability across our business this welcome uptick has continued into the second quarter in the first quarter of 2019 we increased home sales revenues by 33 to 523 million and grew net new home contracts by 35 to a record 1 858 homes this progress was largely driven by our successful expansion into lower price point homes operationally we continued focusing our efforts on streamlining operations and process improvements to improve core profitability while expanding wade jurney homes asset light fast turning business model into new as well as existing geographies looking more closely at our operating metrics our improved first quarter revenues were driven by a 77 increase in deliveries to 1 663 homes versus 941 a year ago excluding the impact of the wade jurney homes acquisition deliveries from our century communities branded business increased 13 year over year this substantial improvement in revenues helped us increase our gross margin dollars to 104 million despite the increasing costs of home construction and incremental incentives as one of our primary focus areas we made further progress managing down sg a which as a percent of home sales revenues improved 120 basis points to 13 2 in the first quarter 2019 compared to 14 3 in the prior year quarter this improvement is the result of our national platform and expanded scale which has allowed us to drive enhancements throughout our business as a reminder sg a as a percent of home sales revenues is seasonally highest in the first quarter and will decline as the year progresses assuming stable market conditions in the first quarter we executed a record 1 858 net new home contracts compared to 1 378 net new home contracts in the prior year quarter our homes in backlog increased 35 to 2 376 homes at the end of the first quarter with a dollar value of 718 million down slightly year over year and consistent with the shift in our business to more entry level product mix we achieved a 25 decline in asp over the same period last year in line with our expectations given increased entry level offerings in our legacy offerings and the continued regional expansion of our wade jurney homes brand as a supplement to our core business the continued penetration of our mortgage title services and insurance offerings to create a one stop solution for century s home buyers remains one of our key focus areas for 2019 even with the recent slowdown that the industry has experienced we remain confident about underlying housing fundamentals and the overall economic conditions the years of double digit price increases are over however we believe we are well positioned for continued success due to our diverse national geographic footprint and our concentration of affordable homes at lower prince points these strong attributes are reinforced by the proven ability of our experienced and cycle tested team to source land control costs and strategically deploy capital into sound investments with attractive returns as we move into the second quarter we will continue to generate core profitability streamline century s operations in our legacy and wade jurney homes businesses and prudently invest capital to further enhance returns to our shareholders i d now like to turn the call over to rob to discuss our markets and business in greater detail rob francescon co chief executive officer thank you dale and good afternoon everyone our markets continue to exhibit solid fundamentals and we are encouraged by the improving trends in traffic and contracts as the months progressed in the quarter lower interest rates have helped to mitigate some of the affordability challenges across the country although some markets remain more constrained primarily parts of california and the southeast we continue to employ the use of incentives where we feel it is necessary however indicators such as household formations employment and population numbers all remain healthy encouragingly the average month s supply across our legacy markets decreased to 2 3 months since our last earnings call these positive economic indicators give us confidence in the longer term housing story now looking more closely at our markets starting with our texas region houston was a significant driver of the excellent results we saw in this region during the first quarter helping to generate a 54 improvement in net contracts a 33 year over year increase in home sales revenues and a 54 increase in deliveries in texas during the quarter our absorption pace increased over 110 and we closed out a number of communities throughout the region which will be replaced by new larger and lower price point communities opening throughout the balance of the year the success in our texas region continues to validate our company wide strategy to pivot to lower price point homes in regard to the mountain region our home sales revenues and deliveries increased 10 and 7 respectively year over year in the first quarter this region followed the national trend experienced month by month sequential improvement in traffic and contracts as the quarter progressed our las vegas and colorado markets have held up well as has salt lake city which john burns recently highlighted as one of the top performing markets in the country throughout our mountain region we expect to open 11 new communities during the second quarter that will positively affect our net new contracts as the year progresses in our west region lower interest rates have helped to improve the tight affordability we saw earlier this year and in the later portion of 2018 year to date demand has improved throughout the region particularly in the bay area and seattle where employment growth is promising in higher paying job sectors in our bay area division alone we are scheduled to open three new communities during the second quarter which will collectively generate nearly 1 100 closings over the next few years southern california which is our smallest division in the region has a focus on growth to achieve operational scale we have and will continue to open a number of new communities that will position us to capitalize on what we view as stabilizing improvement of homebuilding activity in the west in the southeast region our home sales revenues and deliveries increased by 20 and 60 year over year respectively during the first quarter charlotte and nashville have seen steady improvements in traffic while atlanta has seen lower than usual seasonal activity which we believe is temporary we have continued to utilize incentives to drive demand in this region where new community openings have been most impacted by weather we continue to invest capital and other resources into wade jurney homes asset light entry level business line to support its growth as discussed last quarter this includes process enhancements and geographic expansion in fact generated closings during the first quarter in the new markets of texas arizona and indiana where phoenix has been particularly strong and the existing markets demand in the carolinas continues to be very positive on our last call we also provided updates on changes to our sales approach and our wade jurney homes brand whereby we are now selling homes later in the construction cycle this change to our sales strategy is progressing well and we continue to believe that it will not have a material impact to the timing of closings in this spec based business model as evidenced by a 15 year over year increase in deliveries we continue to anticipate that our implementation of enhanced systems processes and procedures including the back office conversion will be largely completed by the end of the third quarter throughout 2019 we will continue to focus heavily on creating additional efficiencies in our operations maintaining consistent strength in our balance sheet sourcing accretive investments building and closing homes on our nearly 38 000 owned and controlled lots and expanding wade jurney homes into carefully selected areas i will now turn the call over to dave who will provide greater detail on our financial results and outlook david messenger chief financial officer thank you rob during the first quarter of 2019 our adjusted net income was to 18 4 million or 0 60 per diluted share compared to 0 75 per diluted share in the prior year quarter net income for the quarter was 17 1 million or 0 56 per diluted share we experienced benefits from our continued efforts to streamline our operations despite margin and bottom line pressure driven by increasing home costs to higher incentives and integration initiatives ebitda in the first quarter increased by 11 to 38 6 million adjusted ebitda in the first quarter of 2019 was 40 4 million compared to 42 3 million in the prior year quarter gross margin for the first quarter was 17 1 primarily due to the use of incentives and incurring the remaining 1 7 million of purchase accounting charges pertaining to the wade jurney homes acquisition adjusted homebuilding gross margin percentage was 19 8 compared to 23 2 in the prior year quarter which benefited from a particularly favorable product mix when we look at our backlog of deliveries for the next couple of quarters we see adjusted gross margins trending upwards such that we see the full year adjusted gross margin to be in the range of 20 to 21 sg a as a percent of homebuilding revenues improved to 13 2 in the first quarter compared to 14 3 in the prior year quarter the 110 basis point improvement was primarily due to process enhancements tighter cost controls and scale benefits derived from our expanding homebuilding platform compared to the fourth quarter our variable costs were consistent at 3 6 of homebuilding revenues and our fixed spend was only 700 000 higher sequentially due to certain legal settlements severance costs and the start of the wade jurney homes back office system conversion reducing our sg a as a percent of homebuilding revenues remains one of our primary focus items for the remainder of 2019 and we expect that it will improve as the year progresses such that we see improvement on a year over year basis in the first quarter of 2019 our financial services business continued to scale and contributed 1 6 million in pre tax income compared to 1 2 million of pre tax income in the prior year quarter now turning to our balance sheet and liquidity as of march 31 2019 we had total long term debt of 1 1 billion with total liquidity of 416 million including 63 million of cash and 353 million of availability on our unsecured revolver with 875 million of stockholders equity our net homebuilding debt to net capital ratio stood at 53 6 at march 31 due to the typical sequential buildup of work in process and backlog and certain land investments we are targeting our net homebuilding debt to net capital ratio to be in the upper 40 range by year end with greater visibility following the first quarter we are introducing our full year 2019 outlook we expect deliveries to be in the range of 7 000 to 8 000 homes and home sales revenues to be in the range of 2 2 billion to 2 5 billion in regards to our tax rate for 2019 we expect to incur an income tax rate of approximately 26 5 compared to 25 in 2018 we expect to deliver another year of earnings improvement as we utilize our expanded scale to drive operational efficiencies in our business while strengthening our current positions in legacy markets we have a strong backlog of homes and land positions to achieve our strategic growth objectives for 2019 in closing we are confident in our outlook for growth in 2019 and are well on the path to capturing another solid year of profitability and improvement across our national footprint operator please open the lines for questions questions answers operator our first question comes from the line of thomas maguire with zelman associates please proceed with your question thomas maguire zelman and associates analyst hey guys great job really strong results this quarter i guess just first on the wade jurney side of the business just to revisit some of the transitory repositioning you called out there last quarter that s waiting on the orders just where we are in digesting it was it less of an impact this quarter versus last quarter and when should we be all the way through that and then i guess if we just take a step back i mean timing issues aside how do you guys feel about demand in that piece of the business and is the 15 closings growth the right way to think about the longer term volume potential there dale francescon chairman and co chief executive officer thomas this is dale the impact of that change in the sales is actually going to continue to a certain extent through the third quarter and then by that time it will be all washed through we still think that s the right decision the 15 closing growth was nice to see as we go forward we re going to expect to see more increase in that as we continue to expand into new geographies and continue getting closings out of those as far as the business i mean we still remain completely bullish on it we think that there is a tremendous growth opportunity for us in this area and we re continuing to deploy resources to enhance the business and grow the business thomas maguire zelman and associates analyst got it thanks and then just on the incentive environment and how that affects margins understanding that you re still using them kind of per the prepared comments but can you talk about how incentive levels trended through the quarter and maybe where we are versus what you guys would think about normalized and then just on the pickup in march and expected through the year is that a function of incentives having been peeled back year to date or what s driving that dale francescon chairman and co chief executive officer as things progress for us through the quarter i think it is probably relatively similar to what other people have said that they saw but each month of the quarter sequentially improved both from a standpoint of actual number of net sales as well as sales absorptions january was by far the worst month we were year over year off by about a third and then it continued to build from there and has continued into april and when we look at our absorptions in april they were consistent with april of 2018 which was a pretty strong comp so when we looked at that while we are still having some cautiousness in the market overall we have felt that we have been able to reduce incentives so we have done that and so we ve slowed them down we still have them as we need them on a case by case basis but overall we re certainly feeling much better about the marketplace thomas maguire zelman and associates analyst got it thanks have a good one operator our next question comes from the line of michael rehaut with jp morgan please proceed with your question michael rehaut j p morgan analyst thanks good afternoon everyone congrats on the results first question i just wanted to perhaps talk about wade jurney from another angle and i don t know if it s the right one obviously there s still growth but when you look at and still expected a good amount of growth obviously as the opportunity geographically kind of still presents itself but i m just kind of looking at closings over the last three quarters now plus or minus 600 and i m just kind of wondering if that s kind of a good annualized quarterly run rate and then on top of that you would add perhaps that 10 perhaps a little bit better type of growth is that the right way to think about the trajectory there or given that at points wade jurney has had more of even a stronger growth rate or a step function we could expect something bigger because obviously the law of numbers and you re rolling this out and you don t want to perhaps bite off more than you can chew just trying to think about the right way to think about the trajectory dale francescon chairman and co chief executive officer michael i think as we re continuing to grow that platform we re going to continue to see growth somewhere in the 10 to 15 range going forward and we feel very confident that that number s achievable over the next several quarters michael rehaut j p morgan analyst secondly on the community count i guess you ended the quarter at 125 obviously ex wade jurney how should we think about that number through the end of the year david messenger chief financial officer hi mike this is dave i think as we said on our last call that while we haven t provided any specific guidance on community count we definitely have lots under development and communities under development that we re going to be looking to open throughout the course of 2019 as rob mentioned we have double digit communities opening up here in the west and in the mountain region in the second quarter of this year and so we are looking to see growth but a lot of that is really going to be contingent on timing of when we do close out some of the legacy communities that we opened in years before but we do expect to see some sort of growth in our overall community count through the balance of 2019 michael rehaut j p morgan analyst i guess just another couple of quick housekeeping items here just to clarify when you said before that january was down by roughly a third was that referring more specifically to sales pace just wanted to make sure i got that right david messenger chief financial officer that s our net sales our net sales are down by about a third from january 2019 compared to january of 2018 but then we saw it sequentially improve each month throughout the quarter so we finished the quarter strong michael rehaut j p morgan analyst ok all right great thanks so much operator our next question comes from the line of alex rygiel with b riley fbr alex rygiel b riley fbr inc analyst great quarter gentlemen can you give us a little bit of help in appreciating or understanding directionally where asps will go as wade jurney continues to expand dale francescon chairman and co chief executive officer i think if you look at our backlogging and see our backlog today it s just a tad over 300 000 at 302 000 as an asp i think that you re going to seeing this based on whatever the mix is for the quarter being somewhere in that 300 to 320 type range for an asp that we re looking to do so depending on each quarter in terms of what percentage of the overall closings come out of the wade jurney homes brand versus the central communities brand will really dictate that but as you can see we ve been pretty diligent about it in the century brand bringing that price point down and looking to be bringing on lower price product and then obviously with the way journey brand it definitely helps us drive that price point down alex rygiel b riley fbr inc analyst and then coming back to your comments on adjusted home sales gross margin can you go back through directionally what you were guiding us toward david messenger chief financial officer yes from an adjusted gross margin basis we re looking at we think we ll finish the year between 20 and 21 so in the first quarter we had 19 8 and as we look at our backlog as it sits today we think that 20 to 21 is achievable for the balance of for all of 2019 alex rygiel b riley fbr inc analyst and lastly there s been a number of new entrants in the carolina marketplace have you seen any increased pressure on pricing has it changed your strategy in the carolinas at all dale francescon chairman and co chief executive officer no not really when we look at it the carolinas both in our wade jurney homes business as well as our century business where we re just in the charlotte market we ve really not seen additional pressure coming in beyond what we re just experiencing on a more national level but when we look at charlotte charlotte has rebounded from the very beginning of the year just as the rest of our business has alex rygiel b riley fbr inc analyst that s very helpful thank you operator our next question comes from the line of nishu sood with deutsche bank please proceed with your question tim daley deutsche bank analyst thanks for the time this is actually tim on for nishu thanks for the time my first question is you all were discussing the texas strategy pivoting to some more new entry level communities we noticed a few weeks ago that you were all were offering floor plans under the century flag around 160 000 which seems much more priced in line with wade product than century s so thinking about the community openings that you ll have this year how many will be offering floor plans with that level of i guess relative affordability and how are you achieving kind of the underwriting of your margins with prices that low it s really kind of more i guess century traditional style community dale francescon chairman and co chief executive officer it starts with the land positions we re buying and to answer the first part of that yes our new offerings that are coming up as we mentioned they re all generally speaking going to lower price point offerings and so they will be in that range now the 160 000 that would be on the low end of that range they would go from there to the low 200 000s and the basic focus of our strategy within houston is to keep within that low price point band as far as the offerings they re very efficient plans that have been designed specifically for that market as well as some of our other markets where we re offering the low price point of the century complete brand and we started doing this about i don t know 18 months ago or so and it s really ramping up now with the new communities that have been opening the success we re getting and as we mentioned we have several new communities that are ready to open over the second third and fourth quarter of this year that would fit that same profile tim daley deutsche bank analyst and then i guess the next question is we also noticed that you guys did i think i believe had your first national open house the weekend of kind of march 23 and 24 just focusing more on finish spec side of things so just curious how did that go how many closings in the quarter came from that and did that weigh on the margin the gross margins that you guys delivered this quarter or just kind of the general margin profile that came out of that event dale francescon chairman and co chief executive officer yes in terms of closings for the quarter they really had no impact just given of the timing of when that was and i think you ll see as we ve enhanced our marketing efforts you ll see more national campaigns that we ll be rolling out on a consistent basis that ll have different themes and that s just as we ve continued to grow and evolve as a company it starts making sense to be able to do things on a national scale as opposed to just doing it on an individual market basis so you ll see us do more and more of that tim daley deutsche bank analyst and then just one final one if i could wade jurney has a pretty unique lot acquisition strategy picking off some lots and parcels from kind of more outlying areas that maybe more traditional builders would maybe shy away from so just curious during the volatility of the past few months we ve heard of anecdotes builders may be taking a pause in their land acquisition strategy particularly in further out markets where this kind of wade model really does work so were you able to kind of maybe scoop up some additional lots this quarter or find any or in general kind of was the land market receptive to maybe lowering prices or giving better terms as you kind of shift toward this asset right strategy dale francescon chairman and co chief executive officer when we look at on the wade jurney home side i don t know that i would say we ve seen a specific impact over the last say 90 or 120 days we ve been very active in the land market adding to our positions we re very specific on the types of deals that work there they need to be finished lots they re typically done on a rolling option basis so that we re not bringing them on balance sheet and so in that area we really haven t seen much of a change on the broader business we have seen some flexibility on land sellers in terms of in some cases pricing in some cases terms and it really kind of is case by case and market by market and depends on the needs of the seller and what their motivations are tim daley deutsche bank analyst got it thanks for the time operator we now have a follow up question from the line of michael rehaut with jp morgan please proceed with your question michael rehaut j p morgan analyst hey thanks again just a couple of points of clarification dave the purchase accounting in the gross margin did i hear it right that that s now fully exhausted and going forward that adjustment is not going to be necessary david messenger chief financial officer that s correct michael rehaut j p morgan analyst and then also circling back to wade jurney with the transition and the sales process i was curious if you guys had any sense they booked still obviously pretty healthy number of orders 627 in the quarter i was curious if you had any sense of what that number might have been without the changes to the sales process what those changes might have done from in terms of suppressing a potentially bigger number david messenger chief financial officer obviously it impacted it because there s a lot of homes that we could have sold that we didn t to what that extent is we really haven t spent any time trying to figure that out because once we made the decision from a business perspective make that change we just knew that the sales were kind of going to be what they re going to be and we ve really been focusing on making sure that we get our closings and that we don t have inventory that remains unsold and that hasn t changed at all so as i indicated earlier i mean we re still committed to that strategy we think it s the right strategy and how many more sales we could have we haven t really focused on it we re really more focused on selling homes when we can close them

highest first quarter revenue in cra s history not only this q1 build on the highest annual revenue of 2018 but it is a continuation of the strength and consistency demonstrated over the past five years q1 s year over year growth rate of 6 4 is consistent with our long term growth targets and the continuation of our strong revenue performance we completed the first quarter of fiscal 2019 with strong performance across our portfolio of practices once again demonstrating the continued dedication and hard work of our entire team we delivered 75 companywide utilization while headcount increased by 6 2 translating into 7 9 year over year revenue growth on a constant currency basis on the bottom line we delivered non gaap net income of 4 5 million or 0 54 per diluted share these results were negatively affected by a foreign currency loss which reduced our non gaap net income and earnings per diluted share by approximately 600 000 and 0 07 respectively chad will discuss this in greater detail in a few minutes looking more closely at the first quarter we exhibited strength across our geographic footprint our north american operations grew 6 and european operations led by the antitrust competition economics practice grew 7 9 year over year we continued to enjoy broad based contributions across our service portfolio with particularly strong performance in our auctions and competitive bidding finance financial economics forensic services intellectual property and life sciences practices as these results demonstrate we continue to see strong demand for our services first quarter lead flow and new project originations were up more than 5 and 10 respectively year over year in fact the past six months represents the strongest such period of activity in cra s history while the timing and size of these new projects cannot be determined in advance cra s business fundamental and strategy position the firm for continued success within legal and regulatory our forensic services practice was certified under international organization for standardization for information security management earlier in q1 to our knowledge cra is the first forensic services practice in the nation to achieve this certification and it underscores our commitment to complying with exacting information security standards in the healthcare sector the forensic services practice was appointed by the u s department of health and human services for specific right to serve as an independent monitor for one of the nation s largest nonprofit healthcare provider networks stemming from its multiple potential violations of the health insurance portability and accountability act in the cyber incident response space the practice helped numerous clients respond to malicious cyberattacks determine the sources of intrusion provide threat intelligence assist with the remediation efforts and prepare responses to the appropriate data protection authorities and regulators in our finance practice the team assisted the cigna versus anthem merger litigation in delaware chancery court cra s senior consultant richard ruback provided expert testimony on damages and cra vice president monica noether provided expert testimony on antitrust issues in addition the practice continued to work on matters alleging spoofing and other types of market manipulation brought by government agencies and civil plaintiffs cra clients in these matter include corporations financial institutions and traders our intellectual property practice continues to provide damages and valuation expertise for all types of ip assets the practice has experienced an increase in trade secret work across a broad range of industries as more cases are being filed under the defend trade secrets act which provides a federal cause of action for trade secret misappropriation during q1 our auctions and competitive bidding practice continued to support our global dairy trade which surpassed 24 billion in dairy products transacted on the platform since its inception among other services it provides the practice also designs and manages auction and rfp processes for regulated utilities and utility commissions as well as other clients in q1 the practice conducted nine auctions in rfp processes for clients such as firstenergy ohio and pennsylvania utilities duke energy ohio dayton power and light company and duquesne light company our life sciences practice s q1 performance was boosted by projects across both our legal and regulatory and management consulting services offerings in legal and regulatory the team has been retained on a large project dealing with the reasonableness of commercialization efforts for a global product launch the work included an assessment of the global commercialization efforts in consideration of the damage model and in another matter cra litigation consultants developed theoretical and empirical models to challenge class certification in a patent settlement antitrust dispute involving an attention deficit hyperactivity disorder drug the models were a first step in the litigation that will include evaluation of antitrust liability economic product market and damage estimations for a joint defense group that includes brand and generic manufacturers in management consulting cra s life science consultants helped the biotech client design a patent centric advanced analytics data warehouse in three key therapeutic areas which integrate data and insights across all stakeholders in the pharmaceutical industry it will evolve our clients capabilities to support their patient value model vision and strategy using agile approaches and collaboration tools such as ms teams miro flock trello cra paired the supporting analytic data warehouse design with the development of end user centered and flexible business intelligent dashboards and click sets ultimately the integration of data and advance analytics user experience and agile platform development will enhance the clients return on information and enable effective response to dramatic shifts in the u s healthcare market and now i ll turn the call over to chad for a few additional comments chad holmes chief financial officer thanks paul as a reminder more expansive commentary on our financial results is available on the investor relations section of our website under prepared cfo remarks before we get to your questions let me provide a few additional metrics related to our performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 in terms of headcount we ended the quarter with 687 consulting staff which consisted of 123 officers 387 other senior staff and 177 junior staff this is a net increase of 40 consultants or 6 2 growth compared with 647 total headcount we reported at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2018 non gaap selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue excluding the 3 2 attributable to commissions to nonemployee experts was 18 3 for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with 18 2 a year ago as paul mentioned we incurred approximately 750 000 foreign currency loss in the first quarter resulting from the revaluation and realized gains and losses on working capital balances these losses are included in interest and other expense on our consolidated statement of operations and arose mainly from fluctuations in the euro and pound exchange rates which were affected by the ongoing political uncertainty surrounding brexit the effective tax rate for the first quarter on a non gaap basis was 23 4 compared with 17 4 on a non gaap basis for the first quarter of 2018 the higher rate in the first quarter of 2019 was primarily attributable to a smaller benefit arising from the accounting for stock based compensation in the current quarter relative to last year turning to the balance sheet dso at the end of the first quarter was 111 days compared with 104 days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 dso in the first quarter consisted of 72 days of billed and 39 days of unbilled compared with 74 days of billed and 30 days of unbilled in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 we concluded the first quarter of fiscal 2019 with 15 million in cash and cash equivalents with the majority residing internationally as a result in the first quarter we borrowed on our line of credit in the amount of 39 million the first quarter is typically a period of lower cash levels as it coincides with the timing of a significant portion of our annual bonus outlays turning to our capital allocation strategy we remain committed to maximizing long term value per share by reinvesting in the business and returning capital through both share repurchases and quarterly dividends during the first quarter of 2019 we returned 6 million of capital to our shareholders consisting of 1 7 million of dividend payments and 4 3 million for share repurchases of approximately 87 000 shares at an average price of 50 25 finally we announced earlier today that our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0 20 per common share payable on june 14 2019 to shareholders of record as of may 28 2019 that concludes my prepared remarks rob we would now like to open up the call for questions questions answers operator our first question comes from tim mchugh with william blair tim mchugh william blair analyst paul i wonder if you could just elaborate on i think you made the comment that last six months are kind of the best new business period i guess one is that on an absolute basis or i guess i m trying to think of a growth rate i guess because you obviously have been growing so i guess the bigger you get each new period should be the biggest and then trying to translate you not to give us the numbers about the kind of 5 to 10 growth in the lead flow in new projects how those growth rate of 5 to 10 compare to what you ve been seeing one year ago or two years ago in terms of just the growth rate not the absolute level paul maleh president and chief executive officer sure tim i m not trying to be nice to you in any way tim but that s a good question with it so i think the foundation of the question is that cra has been achieving all time highs basically on a quarterly basis so 2018 was the best year this firm has ever experienced and q1 has been more of the same so from that perspective i guess it shouldn t be a surprise that the lead flow both in project leads and new project originations were also at all time highs as those tend to be precursors to the actual revenue so my comment is that these last six months on an aggregate basis are higher than any other past six months we have achieved on both lead flow and new project originations so i wasn t just making a year over year comparison but more of an absolute statement with respect to what that entails for future revenue typically lead flow and new project originations are correlated and oftentimes strongly correlated with future revenue the difficulty there tim is it s hard for me and hard for the firm to exactly know the timing of that new revenue but if we see lead flow continue at the rates we re observing now you should again see a high correlation between the rates of change of those and our rate of change of revenue all things being equal there tim mchugh william blair analyst ok and then i guess maybe just to ask on cash flow i guess i understand that this is obviously a seasonally weak period i guess but if i look at a trailing 12 month free cash flow number or even kind of trailing 24 month it s a little lower than i thought is there anything happening and i missed the dso number you gave chad but i guess just as we think about cash conversion is there anything happening as we think about that going forward here that we need to be aware of i guess chad holmes chief financial officer sure when i think about the cash generating capacity of the business although we start with ebitda i will look at the forgivable loan issuances and expense that occurred during a quarter and if you actually look at these two measures and compare them to year ago measures we re actually generating more cash flow in q1 of 19 than we were in q1 of 18 so there s nothing systemic happening within the firm to say that it is less profitable relative to the same time a year ago our dsos are a little higher than we would like around at 111 we need to get busy on that our goal is still to try to have dsos under 100 days so there ll be some additional cash generation from those collections but we really haven t seen any kind of market shift in the profit generating capacity of this firm tim mchugh william blair analyst and then last question just is bit of a high level question always but it s relevant i think in this type of economy which is the competition for talent and i guess both junior talent but i guess the cost necessary to recruit senior talent out of competitors in terms of the transfer kind of market if you will chad holmes chief financial officer yes i think cra has and continues to be an attractive destination for top talent the one thing is with the recruitment of top talent from competitors often times it does require a capital payment for those individuals and it also requires a little bit of patience as they transition and ramp to more of their historical levels so when we recruit top talent is always with that value lens on how we do it and i think we ve done a pretty good job history shows of generating a positive value on these recruitment efforts and that s what we re striving to do with every hire operator our next question comes from marc riddick with sidoti marc riddick sidoti and company analyst wanted to touch on the new hires a little bit it seems as though the concentration over the last few quarters has been in the senior levels and i was wondering if you could shed a little light on that it certainly seems as though the opportunities out in front of you and the lead flow would talk to that but i was wondering if you could shed a little light on maybe some areas of if there was any particular of focus within the new senior hires and what we might be looking at as far as potential headcount changes over the next couple of quarters paul maleh president and chief executive officer sure thanks marc with respect to the new senior hires the one thing i think this firm has done really well for the last number of years has been able to grow the top line and also grow profits at a commensurate rate but as i commented to tim oftentimes senior hires require a little bit of an upfront capital investment in which we ll take multiple periods to recoup so you always need to keep that in mind the activity during q1 is no different than the activity that we ve done in prior quarters and years on that so it will be active we try to manage the hiring of consulting staff to not get too far ahead of demand so i think if you also have gone back through our history and quite frankly q1 of 2019 is no different you ll see revenue growth rates to be roughly commensurate with that headcount growth rates and you see that consistency again in this quarter so you should expect to see headcount growth at or slightly above the revenue guidance we have provided for 2019 if we see revenue materialize little more quickly we will be more active in the secondary market marc riddick sidoti and company analyst ok great that s very helpful and then wanted to switch gears on the growth you re seeing in actually instead of going in that direction i was wondering if you could sort of give an update we talked in the past about a potential acquisition to what the pipeline and valuations look like i was wondering if you could touch on that and maybe what you re seeing there if they happen to be any more attractive looking internationally than they are here in the states paul maleh president and chief executive officer i see no real difference in the level of attractiveness of recruiting opportunities whether they re individual group hires or acquisitions between here domestically and internationally so a lot of the hiring that has been done particularly over the last 12 months have been focused on in the u s but that by no means says that we don t have an active pipeline internationally with that so i m really happy with our portfolio the consistency of this portfolio in terms of the growth the profit contributions as quite frankly i know i m biased has been quite remarkable over the past five years so i am willing to invest in each of our practices and each of our geographies they have demonstrated the ability to create value for our shareholders and thus warrant investments as opportunities arise marc riddick sidoti and company analyst and then one other things that you and thanks for giving us much detail as you did as to some of the practice areas and what you re seeing there i was wondering if you could are there a couple practice areas that may be we don t talk about as much publicly that that you think of growing opportunities that might be bigger contributors that they re kind of on the horizon but maybe you re kind of under the radar that that would be good to call attention to paul maleh president and chief executive officer what i m really excited about q1 of 2019 is you ve heard us highlight some practices that may be have been unable to push themselves to the top given the exemplary performance of some of our main state practices so you heard me talk about my our intellectual property practice you heard me talk about our auctions and competitive bidding practice and that s really you require that kind of broad based contribution to achieve the consistency that we ve done practices like our life sciences practice our forensic services practice have enjoyed our energy practice have enjoyed really exceptional growth over the past number of years and we are trying to be as creative as possible to try to continue to fund of those leaders in their pursuit for providing even broader client services marc riddick sidoti and company analyst ok then last one for me i was wondering if you re see any are there ongoing lingering effects of the government shutdown from earlier this year and any of the practices that are still going or are we pretty much completely past that at this point paul maleh president and chief executive officer i don t know whether i would say there are any ongoing lingering effects you clearly saw a little bit of softness in the month of january of this calendar year now i just put an asterisk on that because january is typically a slower month in our calendar year as people like that the holidays and get ramped up again so january was a little softer but i m pretty pleased with the way the company is performing exiting that month and i don t see any lingering weaknesses there in terms of our demand profile operator at this time we ve reached the end of the question and answer session i would now like to turn the conference back over to mr maleh for any closing or additional remarks paul maleh president and chief executive officer again thanks to everyone for joining us today before we conclude i want to pause for a moment to reflect on the passage of someone very special to this organization earlier this week frank fisher passed away at the age of 84 frank was a towering force in the field of antitrust economics microeconomics and industrial organization and his accomplishments are many he received a phd in economics from harvard in 1960 and embarked on a teaching career at mit influencing generations of students he received many accolades and awards including the 1973 john bates clark medal cra was fortunate to have frank as a colleague since 1967 frank served as a senior consultant and member of our board for 40 years including a 10 year as chairman and vice chairman frank has left an indelible mark on cra with his intellect his collegiality and compassion and we will miss him dearly we appreciate your time and interest in cra we ll be meeting with investors in the coming months and we look forward to updating you on our progress on our second quarter call this concludes today s call thank you everyone

president emmanuel macron made a televised address to the nation last week on 25 april following a two month long nationwide grand debate at town hall style meetings all over france macron wants to show he is listening after 23 weeks of protest by the yellow vests against his government of the rich but his speech was more of a slap in the face than an olive branch nothing for les miserables macron s speech was delayed due to the fire at notre dame which occurred on the intended week of his address he opportunistically called for the french to come together in the aftermath of this national tragedy clearly hoping to divert attention away from the continuing injustices of french society and the foment in the streets the gilets jaunes were unimpressed by this many expressed grief at the damage to notre dame but they were also enraged at macron s hypocrisy and that of capitalists pouring millions into the cathedral s restoration having shrugged their shoulders for years when it came to investing in social services and providing decent wages and pensions millions for notre dame but nothing for les miserables was the slogan on the streets donations for notre dame included 200m from l oreal and 100m from total the oil giant in all a billion euros were raised in a few days showing just how much money lies in private hands and how easy it would be to solve the pressing issues in society if this was put to use genevieve legay 73 suffered severe injuries at the hands of the riot police who prevented her from getting medical attention image europalestine outrage at this double standard reinvigorated the yellow vests somewhat whose numbers have been waning partly due to brutal state repression the riot police have shown them no mercy inflicting maimings with several people losing eyes hands and fingers to stingball grenades and rubber bullets at least one death and thousands of arrests macron has also deployed the army to back up the police in paris on one occasion recently genevieve legay a 73 year old woman who attended a yellow vest march carrying a peace sign suffered a skull fracture and broken ribs at the hands of the riot police who then blocked medics from reaching her macron s only response to this horrific incident images of which circulated widely on social media was that he hope she learned some wisdom his dismal approval rating which has recovered slightly but is still barely 30 percent is well earned this is not to mention judicial repression the civil courts have become a revolving door where sentences are dispensed on yellow vest protestors with little in the way of due process all while the bourgeois media celebrates macron s tough treatment of these hooligans this was the backdrop against which macron delivered his speech macron more of the same the script for macron s speech was actually leaked in advance meaning there were few surprises on the day beginning his two and a half hour address at the champs d elysée on a conciliatory note he assured viewers he had learned much from the grand debate and recognised the profound sense of fiscal social and provincial injustice behind the yellow vests protest i want the french to know i felt it in my flesh what they were saying and expressing macron said this period has changed me but these were empty words and he immediately performed an about turn defending his two year programme to liberalise the french economy with austerity tax breaks for the wealthy attacks on collective bargaining and layoffs in the public sector i asked myself should we stop everything that was done over the past two years did we take a wrong turn i believe quite the opposite in fact he said these counter reforms should not just be preserved but pursued and intensified for instance he justified the abolition of the isf wealth tax on high earners one of the sorest policy points for the yellow vests as a way of boosting investment not a gift for the most fortunate to most people it s hard to see the difference he also pledged to press on with cuts to the public sector and welfare macron s obstinate refusal to budge from his programme is not just a symptom of stupidity or cruelty it flows from the economic situation he needs to smash the unions create a more flexible i e casualised labour market and privatise the public sector so that he can better compete in europe where france has long since lagged behind the other major economies particularly germany smoke and mirrors additionally the crisis of french capitalism which had an especially weak recovery after the 2008 recession means that there is no layer of fat in the economy to provide genuine concessions this gives macron no option but to try to placate the yellow vests by recycling existing policy or dressing up attacks as reforms just like in his last big televised address last year macron s speech was all sleight of hand to disguise counter reforms as concessions which will force the masses to shoulder the burden of the capitalist crisis image révolution for instance he pledged 5bn worth of cuts in personal income tax for low and middle income workers partly by closing tax loopholes for big companies but mostly through spending cuts i e more austerity he also added that to earn their reward the french would have to work harder even this tiny crumb was met with fury by french bosses organisations which shows the impossibility of carrying out actual concessions in these conditions macron also promised france would return to a system of linking pensions to inflation starting with those below 2 000 a year in 2020 and then all pensions by 2021 but he said that french workers would have to toil beyond the official retirement age of 62 as many already do even with this caveat the proposal was all sleight of hand the government had already been forced in parliament to delay its plan to under index pensions for the next two years so basically macron has promised to undo a policy that was never decided upon and told the french they have to work into their dotage just like in his last big televised address last year in which macron promised a minimum wage increase of 100 which was actually just an existing revaluation of the minimum wage this was political smoke and mirrors tinkering around the edges the rest of macron s proposals were pure demagogy he addressed the yellow vests hatred of the political establishment embodied in their demand to abolish the national assembly by promising electoral reform including greater proportional representation in assembly and senatorial elections and cutting the number of parliamentarians he also suggested he would make it easier to carry out public referenda touching on a popular demand to expand usage of the citizens initiative referendum by which theoretically the constitution allows any matter of public interest to be submitted to a popular vote as we have explained previously there was always a danger that this proposal could be co opted in a limited fashion by the french state to divert the yellow vests fight for citizens control down safe channels when what is really needed is workers control of the government and economy this manoeuvre and macron s other proposed reforms to the existing state apparatus is precisely as we warned the bourgeoisie want to give the impression of granting the people more of a say without relinquishing an inch of actual authority and leaving all the old levers of state power intact demagogy and division macron attempted to play on divisions in french society to weaken the movement against him for example he emphasised the split between the provinces where the yellow vests movement started and the metropolitan elite promising greater decentralisation of powers from paris to local authorities all this really means is he will pass the buck of carrying out austerity to mayors saying that there would be no new closures of schools or hospitals without the authority of local bodies he has also promised to close down the ecole nationale d administration ena a prestigious grande école private university seen as a breeding ground for state bureaucrats and politicians that macron himself attended presumably this will result in hundreds of staff being laid off and have absolutely no impact on ordinary people as the yellow vests lose momentum macron is trying to divide and isolate them image kriss toff macron also leaned on racism and nationalism in his speech likely noting the rising popularity of marine le pen s national rally he stated that the wonderful schengen zone no longer works and promised to completely reform immigration policy he also drummed up islamophobia in his defence of secularism against people who in the name of a religion pursue a political project that of a political islam that wants to secede from our republic there have been many attempts in the bourgeois press to slander the yellow vests as racists or nationalists but at its height the movement united very wide layers of french society in common struggle from all walks of life however a lack of leadership from workers organisations meant it remained a popular anti establishment movement with confused middle class and reactionary elements with the yellow vests tiring and weakening macron hopes to appeal to more backward layers to undermine and divide them whether this has any effect remains to be seen with his nationalist rhetoric macron also sought to isolate the yellow vests from wider french society where support for the movement is starting to fall though 50 percent of the french still back it he said france was not a society of individuals with separate demands but a nation of citizens who needed to rediscover the art of being french the implication was that the yellow vests are an unpatriotic minority fringe of selfish violent radicals bent on smashing up national and private property a common theme in press coverage of the movement in the same breath as pandering to islamophobia he also pointedly drew attention to a handful of antisemitic incidents on the yellow vest protests which spokespersons have already disavowed in an attempt to further discredit them this two pronged attack of division and slander must be cut across with socialist demands for a decent living wage fair pensions expropriation of the one percent and dismantling of the whole rotten edifice of the french state in favour of workers governance these should be taken up by the leaders of the mass organisations like the cgt and france insoumise led by the rank and file activists who have shown consistent solidarity throughout the yellow vests movement macron démission macron s speech was a calculated exercise in throwing dust in the masses eyes his proposals were all counter reforms that will continue to reward the wealthy while forcing ordinary workers to shoulder the burden of cuts and austerity the masses can see this as one yellow vest commented in the washington post does not have the willingness to announce real measures that are actually strong he s stayed with his original programme in fact macron s authority and social base have been shattered by the yellow vests movement now the masses have to finish the job image fair use despite his defiant tone macron is in a weak position his inability to offer any proper reforms will deepen the exasperation of the french masses and his en marche party may lose to national rally in the european elections which will be seen as a referendum on macron s presidency however despite their determination a combination of repression and a lack of direction means the yellow vests are beginning to tire it is possible that macron s pseudo concessions may have a certain effect on more demoralised and exhausted layers the fault for this lies with the leadership of the labour movement who have failed to expose macron s manoeuvres and provide the programme necessary to translate the yellow vests movement into a rolling general strike to bring down the government still the french masses have demonstrated their revolutionary traditions are alive and well they have come a long way macron s authority and social base are shattered now they have to finish the job
opinions remain divided about whether government debt constitutes a serious problem putting aside the simpler issue of future tax burdens should we be worried about whether government debt bogs down america s economy federal reserve chairman jerome powell said he is very worried about the growing amount of u s debt university of chicago economist harald uhlig meanwhile recently argued that debt will not be a serious problem as long as the interest rate paid on it does not exceed the economy s growth rate mosads separately an ongoing discussion continues about whether the u s growth rate which has averaged around 2 percent in recent years can ever return to its earlier rate of 3 percent our recent research looks at both issues and shows that excessive debt does indeed reduce economic growth this reduction is not just a vague possible problem for the future but rather a reality we live with today in fact the effect of debt explains the difference between 2 percent and 3 percent growth u s gdp was lower by 175 billion dollars in 2017 because of it it is true that the problem is less severe if economic growth is large relative to debt interest payments however debt and growth are not independent from each other think of it like a bell curve at first small increases in debt can add to economic growth by financing productive government investments such as basic research and infrastructure which can help the economy however there is a threshold at which point further debt increases start to reduce growth the united states and other organization for economic cooperation and development countries are on the wrong side of the line and have already seen the reduction interest rates are one source of major confusion they ve remained low relative to their long run average causing some analysts to conclude that debt is not a problem but if the u s government were expected to default rates would rise to compensate bond holders however slower growth is the more immediate problem and it has already arrived without an increase in interest rates politicians biased as always toward satisfying today s voters over shoring up tomorrow s finances have come to rely more and more on debt finance and switched government spending away from investments that pay off in the future they favor entitlements that provide current benefits particularly related to an aging population discretionary government spending which includes basic research and infrastructure has declined dramatically relative to mandatory spending which is dominated by entitlements such as social security medicare and medicaid discretionary spending which was once 70 percent of the budget has dropped to 30 percent in recent years u s fiscal institutions demonstrated order and discipline until about 1968 debt was relatively stable relative to the size of the economy increasing during wars and decreasing after wars however since 1968 the debt to gdp ratio has increased steadily the baby boom beginning in 1945 was a critical juncture congresses and presidents should have anticipated an increase in social security and medical expenditures kicking in about 65 years later in 2010 and adjusted revenue and benefits accordingly instead government officials repeatedly refused to act resulting in a chaotic debt policy that has shackled the american economy other countries have faced debt problems and many have responded by adopting some form of debt rule switzerland adopted a debt brake in 2003 that limits spending to expected tax revenue over the business cycle rep kevin brady r texas has introduced a similar bill maximizing america s prosperity act after a debt crisis sweden adopted a balanced budget and reform of its national pension program in 1997 debt has already reached a level that is slowing the rate of economic growth lacking a coherent answer the united states would benefit from a well designed debt rule however the optimal rule will depend on u s institutions which differ from those of switzerland or sweden the future is now the longer the delay the larger the losses of output per year will be economists thomas grennes qingliang fan and mehmet caner are the authors of the recent mercatus center study new evidence on debt as an obstacle to u s economic growth

that this event is being recorded at this time i would like to turn the conference over to philip choyce executive vice president and chief financial officer please go ahead sir philip choyce executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today to discuss icd s first quarter 2019 results with me today is anthony gallegos our president and chief executive officer before we begin i would like to remind all participants that our comments today will include forward looking statements which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties a number of factors and uncertainties could cause actual results in future periods to differ materially from what we talk about today for a complete discussion of these risks we encourage you to read the company s earnings release and our documents on file with the sec in addition we refer to non gaap measures during the call please refer to the earnings release and our public filings for a full reconciliation of net loss to adjusted net income ebitda and adjusted ebitda and for definitions of our non gaap measures and with that i ll turn it over to anthony for opening remarks more from the motley fool anthony gallegos president and chief executive officer good morning everyone i m pleased to say we are following up our better than expected fourth quarter results with very good results for the first quarter this year especially considering a pretty challenging market brought about by the oil price decline in the fourth quarter of last year and our customers response in fact we are reporting adjusted net income for the second consecutive quarter these results were made possible because of the intense focus on safe operations on our continued successful integration and on cost control and synergy realization which drove better than expected financial performance in our cost lines again during the quarter during the first quarter we averaged 30 3 operating rigs which represents 95 utilization of our marketed fleet during the quarter we had several wins in the form of contracts renewed and new and incremental contracts with existing customers overall fleet utilization tracked our expectations very closely and i m pleased with how things are shaping up the recent commodity price issues that resulted in a reduction in our customers operating budgets as well as our customers focus on operating within free cash flow had not materially affected the utilization of our pad optimal fleet while first and second quarter utilization is choppy it is still robust as pad optimal rigs with good performance have and will continue to find follow on work as the industry adjusts drilling programs and reallocates drilling rigs accordingly so really what we have experienced and will experience in the second quarter is just transitory downtime as we reshuffle the deck and redistribute the pad optimal fleet across our customer base in our target markets with summary contracting opportunities being driven by fleet high grading and some based on incremental rig ads philip will provide more detail on his prepared remarks regarding first quarter financials however i d like to provide some additional color we exited 2018 with 32 rigs contracted during the first quarter we signed 6 contract extensions and dealt with three rigs where operators were not continuing the rigs drilling program which resulted in the expected transitory downtime during the quarter two of these rigs were quickly recontracted and have already recommenced operations during the second quarter the third rig is being upgraded to 300 series specifications and will be equipped with 25 000 feet racking capacity and one million pounds hookload when the upgrade is complete the rig already had three mud pumps and four engines this rig was a legacy sidewinder rig and a very good example of perhaps an underappreciated value point associated with the organic earnings and free cash flow growth we can achieve from the sidewinder fleet acquired in the combination once this 300 series upgrade is complete this rig s specifications will be the highest in the industry and should earn leading edge dayrates in the market and the total incremental capex for us to complete the upgrade for this rig is only 1 3 million on which we will earn sub two year paybacks and superior investment returns our target date for this rig to reenter our operating fleet is the beginning of the third quarter we have six additional legacy sidewinder ac rigs operating today that can be upgraded to these specs at similar capex levels again more low risk organic high return free cash flow generating growth opportunities that we can execute upon with respect to the second quarter we continue to experience some transitory downtime issues but it also appears to be the trough as rig inquiries over the past 30 days have increased we have a very good line of sight on numerous recontracting opportunities and i fully expect transitory issues to resolve during the back half of the year and most likely in the third quarter as we deal with the few remaining rigs we need to reallocate among our customer base some have already been recontracted and for the remaining we have multiple opportunities for mid to late may or june reactivations as we sit here today we only have three idle uncontracted rigs including the rig undergoing the 300 series upgrade i previously discussed so fleet utilization for the quarter should remain robust troughing around 90 or so one final item on this topic before i move on as we reposition our fleet among our customer base we are experiencing some labor cost inefficiencies as we maintain staffing while rigs are in transition philip will go through the details but while this allows us the opportunity to internalize many costs and perform operations we might normally outsource when our rigs are in full effect of utilization it does create some inefficiencies and i do expect higher daily operating cost during the second quarter for this reason but fully expect us to return to first quarter daily opex levels or lower during the back half of this year moving on to the pricing environment as mentioned on our prior conference call lower commodity prices and our customers reduced budgets and continued focus to operate within free cash flow have put some modest pressure on dayrates and contract tenders more so on recontracting idle rigs than with respect to contract extensions compared to march and april of last year dayrates for icd have improved but have declined slightly from where leading edge rates were prior to the oil price decline that began late fall 2018 so we are still seeing dayrate improvements on renewals of older contracts but not the dayrate momentum we were hoping for 6 months ago in this environment most of our new contracts and renewals are on a shorter term basis six months or less with a few exceptions this does reduce our reported backlog number but it also sets us up nicely to fully participate in what we believe will be a more constructive recontracting environment at the back half of this year once transitory utilization issues resolve and our customers budgets begin reacting to the improving commodity price environment this contracting strategy is a slight change from icd s prior precombination strategy when we were operating a smaller fleet but one we re very comfortable with given our fleet size strong balance sheet and more importantly our very strong customer base in that regard over two thirds of our rigs are contracted today with the top 30 operators in the united states as measured by rigs under contract in fact one third of our rigs are working for the top six customers these customers are focused on optimizing well and fuel efficiencies through complex multiwell pad drilling which we believe will drive incremental demand for our pad optimal shaledriller fleet and i believe these customers recognize the value that icd provides them not only through best in class rigs but superior service delivered by our top notch personnel supported by industry leading systems and processes in fact in february of this year energypoint research rated us the top plan contract driller for service and professionalism based upon their most recent customer surveys ahead of our larger competitors prior to the sidewinder combination we were too small to be considered for this survey of course most of our customer base is comprised of leading publicly traded e ps which continue to talk about their commitment to capital discipline to live within cash flow but they have been slow to ramp up drilling operations in response to recent commodity price improvements which limits drilling rig demand visibility somewhat during the back half of this year but i believe robust economic and industrial activity in the united states combined with supply shortcomings in certain oil producing countries and continued discipline on the part of opec should continue to provide an upward bias on oil prices the question is how much our customers will adjust their drilling plans in response to the higher commodity prices regardless i believe the pad optimal fleet will again reach full effect of utilization during the back half of this year most likely during the third quarter as high grading continues and budgets are adjusted albeit slower than in past cycles in response to improved oil prices now looking at this market and what it means for icd strategically over the next couple of quarters as i previously mentioned things are playing out much as we laid out on our prior conference call we expect to hit the trough during the second quarter but recover the full effect of utilization and a more constructive pricing environment during the back half of the year in this environment i do not expect our capital budget to materially change we still expect to continue planned third mud pump additions were justified economically and will pursue other 300 series upgrades similar to the one we have in progress as opportunities present themselves with respect to our planned scr to ac conversions the first delivery of long lead time items from nov will occur in a couple of weeks so we will be ready from that point forward to begin completing those conversions when opportunities present themselves before i close my prepared remarks i want to provide an update on our integration efforts i m extremely pleased with our progress we ve successfully hit every one of our critical integration milestones and remain confident that we will achieve our target for synergies of 10 million or more and be at that run rate as we enter the third quarter of 2019 now as i close my prepared remarks i want to reiterate where i believe icd is positioned strategically not only operationally but with respect to our ability to generate sustained earnings free cash flow growth and financial returns for our stockholders on an absolute and per share basis and not just in strong markets but even in choppier market environments such as the one we are experiencing today today i believe we are only one of two u s land based contract drillers actually reporting adjusted net income for the quarter or for that matter over the past two quarters philip will provide additional details in his remarks but from a free cash flow basis even in a choppy market that exists today icd s free cash flow generation especially when looking at our current stock price is very strong and will only improve as we move toward the back half of this year operationally we have the right assets are working for the right customers and the right basins and continue to provide exceptional services that are necessary to assist our customers in maximizing efficiencies and productivity in their overall drilling programs and finally we re beginning to execute on the high return free cash flow generating organic growth investment opportunities that are embedded in the sidewinder rigs we acquired in the combination i want to assure you we are focused on the big picture with a returns focused orientation applied to all decisions which we make and these investments will generate superior returns and be made while maintaining robust free cash flow and without stressing our balance sheet our board management team and shareholders are all aligned in this regard in fact you may have read in our recently filed proxy some of the executive compensation changes that we made post sidewinder combination including increasing performance of board rating and tying a large portion of those incentives to meeting and exceeding return on capital metrics as you ve heard me say before while nothing has changed everything is different here at icd and with that i ll turn the call over to philip so he can walk us through the details philip choyce executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks anthony during the quarter we reported adjusted net income of 2 9 million or 0 04 per share and adjusted ebitda of 15 8 million representing the second consecutive quarter in which we have reported positive adjusted net income the quarter included a 2 5 million or 0 03 per share tax benefit excluding that benefit adjusted income was 0 01 per share merger and related asset disposal impairment cost on nonstaired equipment acquired in the sidewinder merger are excluded when arriving at adjusted net income and ebitda with respect to the other items during the quarter revenue per day of 20 755 and rig utilization of 95 came in consistent with our guidance reflecting a small amount of idle time associated with transitioning rigs between customers sequential pricing improvements relate to improved pricing on contract roles cost per day of 13 302 came in below our guidance sequential increases in cost from the fourth quarter of 2018 relate to seasonal payroll tax items and a shorter quarter of which to absorb fixed operational support costs sg a of 4 5 million including noncash compensation expense of 400 000 came in consistent with guidance with sequential improvement in cash sg a being driven by continued realization of merger synergies depreciation and interest expense came in consistent with our guidance as we mentioned we did record a tax benefit during the quarter associated with the application of our estimated effective tax rate for the year to the unadjusted net loss we reported during the quarter tax expense for the year will be comprised of louisiana tax and texas margin tax as i ve discussed previously given our nol position and the full step up in basis we received on the acquired sidewinder assets we acquired in the combination another i believe underappreciated free cash flow generating facet of that transaction we do not expect to be a cash taxpayer for federal tax purposes in the near term cash payments for capital expenditures net of disposals insurance recoveries and capital lease additions were 9 3 million during the quarter our overall 2019 capital budget of 29 million remains unchanged as discussed on our prior call capex is skewed somewhat toward the first half of the year thus once working capital normalizes at the end of the second quarter post integration we expect our ebitda to free cash flow conversion during the back half of the year to normalize and substantially improve moving on to our balance sheet at march 31 we reported net debt excluding capital leases of 122 4 million up slightly from year end relating to continued payment of accrued transaction expenses and other seasonal working capital investments there will be additional accrued transaction expenses between 4 million and 5 million that will flow through our cash flow statement during the second quarter at which time we expect our working capital items to normalize at march 31 we had total liquidity comprised of cash on hand and availability under our revolver in term loan accordion of 51 million our backlog at march 31 stood at 102 4 million representing 13 2 rig years of work as anthony mentioned terms on recent contracts and extensions have been predominantly short term in nature now moving on to guidance for the second quarter of 2019 we expect to see the following operating days approximating 2 580 days during the quarter revenue per day is expected to be approximately flat with the first quarter cost per day during the second quarter will range between 13 700 and 13 900 sequentially higher than the first quarter the increase does not represent a true cost increase but rather relates to maintaining our existing employee base during the transitory idle periods anthony discussed in his prepared remarks we expect our cost per day to return to levels experienced during the first quarter or lower once those issues are behind us and our rig fleet reapproaches full effect of utilization right now we re expecting that to occur during the third quarter sg a expense will be approximately 4 3 million during the quarter including 500 000 of noncash stock based compensation estimated decreases in cash sg a are directly associated with continued realization of transaction synergies depreciation and interest expense should be flat with the first quarter tax expense is tricky to predict for the reasons previously discussed but right now we would expect a small benefit realized during the second quarter and finally we will incur some additional merger related expenses principally severance during the second quarter as we close out the integration process we expect those to be in the 1 5 million range and with that i will turn the call back over to anthony anthony gallegos president and chief executive officer thanks phil i have no further comments at this time operator let s open up the line for questions questions answers operator thank you sir your first questions will be from kurt hallead of rbc please go ahead kurt hallead rbc capital markets analyst i appreciate those insights and your views on what s transpiring and the company s positioning within it i think the focal point i think i might want to take here initially is as you look through the remainder of 2019 and you mentioned you re getting increased inquiries and expecting to get back to kind of full utilization when you kind of think about a full year kind of ebitda and kind of full year kind of free cash flow how do you see that evolving and do you think you can potentially kind of get to a 70 million ebitda number for the full year philip choyce executive vice president and chief financial officer the answer will be yes we can get there it s going to be second quarter is the trough the third and fourth quarter we expect to get better pricing than what we re getting today our capex is going to be lower than what we did this quarter some of it is front ended and we did have some working capital investments really related to the merger and we re going to have some of that in the second quarter so back half of the year i expect when i look at our free cash flow i measure it really by our net debt number and you re going to see that go down as we enter the third and fourth quarter it s already starting you don t see that at the company now but so the answer is we believe we can get there kurt hallead rbc capital markets analyst ok that s great appreciate that specificity maybe an additional follow up shortly after i think and actually looking at your most recent investor deck here you indicated some potential outcomes on free cash flow generation looking at synergies and adjusted backlog for dayrates and scr conversions etc potentially with free cash flow somewhere between 80 million to 100 million given what s transpired over the course of the past couple of months is there any reason to think that that range that potential range of 80 million to 100 million of free cash is any lower or are you pretty comfortable with that range still anthony gallegos president and chief executive officer no kirk that s a great question appreciate that just to be clear though i think what we signaled and put in those in that powerpoint was an ebitda in the range of what you re talking about and the take away from that and the point we wanted to convey was in order for this company to generate 100 million plus of ebitda we will not need dayrates in the upper 20 type range meaning i think the benchmark that we used when we did that calculation was 23 000 a day type dayrates obviously a normalized apex number a rationalized g a to support that you start backing away from the ebitda you generate the free cash i m sorry the capex investment that when we acquired from a maintenance standpoint and you calculate your free cash flow yield it s obviously very very attractive that was the point we were trying to make in that deck but to answer your question yes we can see when we get out into 2020 and certainly beyond assuming the commodity holds up demand is still there for the equipment that we do think that s very realistic and very doable and that s the path that we re headed down kurt hallead rbc capital markets analyst that s awesome thank you for that appreciate it thank you operator the next question will be from taylor zurcher of tudor pickering holt please go ahead taylor zurcher tudor pickering holt and company analyst anthony i thought some of the commentary provided on pricing for the contract renewals be more steady than or excuse me for extensions being a little bit more steady than for rigs changing hands which maybe is intuitive but a couple of questions there one if that dynamic continues to play out do you see any of your e p customers today i guess starting to become keen to that fact and starting to play the spot market a little bit more with multiple drilling contractors and then secondarily when you talked about inquiries increasing for i think you said may and june type time frames what sort of e p operators are driving that sort of uptick is it operators that have dropped rigs over the past couple of months or maybe some of the larger privates coming back any color there would be helpful anthony gallegos president and chief executive officer yes no problem thank you for the questions taylor on the renewal situation just to give you a little color maybe help understand that issue a little bit better when we re negotiating a rollover contract with an existing customer obviously we re in a different position because often times the rig has been with that customer for quite some time there are certain efficiencies that have been gained from the relationship the rig the crews know the drilling program likewise the customer understands the rig and its capabilities so we re just in a different position when we re negotiating a contract extension with an existing customer on a situation where we re pursuing new work with a new client obviously your customer is going to look at hs e how you performed that s kind of the first box that has to be ticked second does the rig meet their equipment specification and suffice to say with the drawdown in rig count over this year there are other rigs out there that have capabilities similar to what our rigs would have so you re just in a much more competitive situation and dynamic when you re negotiating that contract from the incremental rig to go to work for that customer so that s really the difference and the reason for the delta in those kind of rates and certainly we ve been fortunate or unfortunate depending are expected to perhaps negotiate both of those kind of opportunities here in the first quarter but if you look at where we are in terms of the utilization in light of what s happened across the industry over the last four five months i think we ve done pretty well the marketing team works really hard every day to make sure that we re aware of opportunities out there to contract our rigs and that most importantly we re able to secure those contracts with regard to your second question in the inquiries i would say where we re seeing the what we re seeing in the market is the public guys they continue to stick to the mantra of living within free cash flow even though i think most people would assume that free cash flow will be higher in the back part of the year than what they budgeted for the most part the guys have kind of stuck to their guns on that so there have been some high grade opportunities where we ve been able to replace a lower performing rig with a customer you won t see that in rig count but it would be incremental to icd and also the privates the large privates is an area where we do see opportunities not only from icd rigs but possibly incremental rigs to the overall rig count hopefully that answers your question taylor zurcher tudor pickering holt and company analyst it did it did and one follow up which you touched on there is just the drilling efficiency dynamic that s i think been a common theme with the e ps are q1 is that it feels like a lot of them are still realizing incremental drilling efficiencies and to me there s a positive in that you sort of need this high end rig and the negative is obviously that more rigs are getting dropped as a result and so curious with your fleet are you still seeing incremental drilling efficiencies year to date in 2019 and overall how do you see that dynamic playing out maybe over the next 12 months anthony gallegos president and chief executive officer yes i think from an equipment standpoint the shaledriller rigs the rigs that we own are as good and in some attributes in many cases even better than the standard industry offering out there i think when you look across basins and even within basins where you might see productivity not be where you would think it would be is really more driven by the particular program the particular wells that are being drilled for example you look out there there s customers continue to test the limits of how long is too long for a lateral for example it s just an economic equation to drill more footage the expectation is they earn more dayrate but oftentimes the further out you get in a lateral it can become more complicated not just from a drilling standpoint but also from a completion standpoint so i really would say it s inefficiencies to the extent they exist are going to be tied more to a particular drilling program in a particular well than maybe a particular customer and certainly a rig taylor zurcher tudor pickering holt and company analyst understood and i ll try to squeeze one more in probably for you phil which is on the free cash flow front you laid out why that s likely to start ramping or improving in the back half of the year from a use of cash perspective i suspect that pay down is probably near the top of the priority list should we expect you to build cash in the balance sheet in the back half of the year or start whittling down that debt balance either late 19 or early 20 philip choyce executive vice president and chief financial officer the term loan is prepayable so we can pay that down as we generated free cash flow i think we d probably do a little bit of both the board will make that decision with anthony and i talking to them back half of the year but i think paying down debt will be certainly part of that taylor zurcher tudor pickering holt and company analyst ok great guys i ll turn back good luck operator the next question will be from connor lynagh of morgan stanley please go ahead connor lynagh morgan stanley analyst i was wondering if you could verify or to give your commentary on spot rates so it seems like some of your competitors over the past few weeks have kind of identified what i would guess would be your equivalent to your 300 series rig having rates in the mid 20s do you agree with that and if so can you help frame for us how much of a mark to market opportunity you have in your fleet in terms of just rolling to higher leading edge rate anthony gallegos president and chief executive officer yes no problem obviously there s a premium in dayrate when you are able to bring to market kind of rig like we re talking about in 303 the rig we re upgrading right now that will be available here in just a few weeks i do think that premium is 2 000 a day plus i think when you look at icd and you think about where we are i mean everybody can do the math i think you look at average dayrate for the company today it s largely a function of legacy contracts contracts that were put in place some time ago the market can change quickly it can change dramatically which is what we ve seen over the last six months so we re in this interesting situation where certainly on a year over year basis you should continue to see our average dayrate increase i think quarter to quarter at least here in the first part of the year it s going to move more sideways but obviously with the expectation for increased demand in the back part of this year and certainly rolling into 2020 we would expect to see that continue its upward momentum connor lynagh morgan stanley analyst that s helpful and you had alluded to high grading opportunities before i m curious are customers willing to pay so much for the efficiency that they would fund an upgrade like scr to ac conversion or something like that or is this more incremental as we here and there how do you think about that anthony gallegos president and chief executive officer yes not seeing opportunities where they would fund especially on the front end the conversion cost what i referred to high grade opportunities connor really what i was referring to is if a guy s got 20 rigs running and he s always going to have some really really good rigs and he s probably going to have some rigs that aren t doing as well if there s a hot rig that s being released from another customer even if it s owned by another contractor with great performance he s going to do like any of us would do and that s make the decision to drop his lower performing rigs and pick up something that may be higher performing certainly if it s more capable that s even better for his perspective the question is is he willing to pay for that and that s what we re feeling through right now obviously we believe that there is a premium that the customer is willing to pay for and that s why we moved forward with the 303 upgrade which is under way right now i do want to point out we that s a very modest amount of capex we invested in that rig it was a big rig to begin with it already had three mud pumps already has four generators but we have six more just like it that depending on where the market goes assuming customers continue to be willing to pay for the high end equipment those are very easy levers that we ll pull over the next year one and a half years and move those through the fleet as well philip choyce executive vice president and chief financial officer and connor our four when we talked we talked about the 4 scr rigs three of them are drilling and one of them is idle and then we have the one other the 34th rig is an ac rig and when we bring those out those can easily have these 300 series features on them as well connor lynagh morgan stanley analyst understood thanks for the call operator the next question will be from daniel burke of johnson rice please go ahead daniel burke johnson rice analyst good morning guys i guess i just wanted to dig a little bit more deeply into the utilization outlook for q2 and then the transition into what s expected to be a little bit more of a robust second half of the year so it looked like you guided to give or take 3 5 idle rigs in q2 you have three idle today i guess i m just is the delta between three and 3 5 and i know i m parsing this pretty finely is that just a safety allowance or do you have line of sight that you d still might have another one or two rigs returned by your operators here in q2 anthony gallegos president and chief executive officer no we have three idle rigs right now but what happened we had some rigs come back to us right at the end of the first quarter and then it takes us a month days we don t wind up exactly on the recontracting so it might be one it feels like to me it s like we get these rigs it takes us one to two months three months on the long end it seems to get the rig and back out so it s really a matter of it s just the timing so we had some rigs in april that we ve recontracted that we have idle times on so that s really it s not really a safety allowance it s what we think about what we re going to do and so it s really just there s a lot of ins and outs in there right now there s probably five rigs that we re dealing with in the second quarter and that most of them have been recontracted or we know when they re going out and it s just kind of where that s where the dust settles daniel burke johnson rice analyst ok got it and that s helpful i know it s easy to put it together in any greater detail than the way you already have i guess other question i would ask anthony maybe and as much as right now there is a lot of focus on returning some of the rigs to service when you think about the scr conversions and you re now about to start receiving some of the long lead time items i mean do you have any level of customer discussions going on regarding those conversions at this point anthony gallegos president and chief executive officer yes as a matter of fact we do daniel it s this is a really exciting project for the company it s exciting to me from an investment perspective of being able to take these rigs that are good rigs in their own right but really moving them to the next level without having to spend just an absurd amount of capital to make that happen and these rigs with just a little bit of incremental capex we can take them to as philip indicated the highest specification in the industry so there s some interesting work out there in other basins outside of it the one that we talked about today where a rig like that would bring a lot of value a standard 1 500 horsepower rig with two pumps wouldn t be able to do so obviously we re spending a lot of time on those opportunities but also talking to existing customers because there are scenarios and situations where we can displace competitor rigs or possibly even high grade rigs that we may have with the customer and do something with that particular rig and put it with someone else so i m really optimistic and positive obviously about the opportunity that the 300 series and even the remaining ac conversion rates that we have present for the company daniel burke johnson rice analyst ok got it all right guys well i ll leave it there operator the next question will be from thomas curran of b riley fbr please go ahead thomas curran b riley fbr inc analyst anthony now that you re two quarters into integration could you give us an update on how you re thinking about longer term technology priorities so for new initiatives where will your focus be will it be on new apps for your software platform automation an extension of services you provide with the rig or perhaps on the hardware side related to specific systems or components on the rig i realize that the 300 series is still relatively new in terms of design but i d love an update on how you re thinking strategically about technology going forward anthony gallegos president and chief executive officer yes so thank you for the question tom so the first thing we talked about this before that we had to nail and get right was the integration of these two companies and i think we ve been pretty open with people we confirmed that what we did every one of our critical milestones we re going to bag every bit of the synergies which have been raised once already in terms of our expectation and we re going to be we are integrated now and we re going to be at a run rate incorporating the synergies as we roll into the third quarter as we think longer term certainly we have to make sure we have the right platform and we believe we do in terms of the equipment the rigs that we have are obviously very capable some of them the subset have the opportunity to be upgraded even further and we ve got a line of sight on that in the plan we just we want to make sure we get paid for it but as we think longer term icd is a bit unique as it relates to how we re going about this we ve got competitors much larger competitors that have gone out and invested a lot of money trying to go at it at their on their own with their own solution to the problem but our strategy has been to leverage off of a lot of good work that s going on in the industry with third parties and be able to get to the same place with our rigs and i m confident that we re going to be able to do that there s already work under way on that front i can t talk about it at this time but we will not be left behind in this regard but i do want to emphasize we have to have the right rig to be able to deploy that type of technology and be able to provide that kind of value to your customer and we have that in place now thomas curran b riley fbr inc analyst and to the extent you could share some additional color on the path you re pursuing is it going to be more like a partnership an alliance will it just be a standard vendor relationship anthony gallegos president and chief executive officer i think it d be more of a collaborative type relationship we re not going to go out and buy anybody or anything like that to execute on our strategy so i ll look at it more as a collaboration thomas curran b riley fbr inc analyst ok and then on the contracting dynamics front are you starting to have any customers come to you guys and proactively explore new commercial models new structures for how you re compensated how you price work or determine the revenue for drilling a well or sections of well once it s been completed anthony gallegos president and chief executive officer unfortunately not i wish i can say we have where we ve had those conversations and we re trying to tom like a lot of people we re having to instigate those conversations we re having to put ideas in front there s the question in the industry is how much value will be created by this technology or these types of technologies and then what s the proper compensation and there s all kinds of ways you can get there but i think right now suffice to say the industry is very curious i think there are some early adopters out there that are willing to take the ball and run but i believe for the most part right now most guys are kind of sitting back waiting to see how this plays out and we ll jump on the bandwagon down the road thomas curran b riley fbr inc analyst ok thanks for taking my questions anthony gallegos president and chief executive officer and i was referring to customers by the way thomas curran b riley fbr inc analyst got it makes sense operator and ladies and gentlemen that will conclude our question and answer session i would like to hand the conference back over to anthony gallegos for his closing remark anthony gallegos president and chief executive officer ok guys we really appreciate everybody dialing in today looking forward to seeing you guys on the road we ve got some investor conferences coming up i m looking forward to talking to you again here in a couple of months as we talk about our second quarter results i hope everybody has a safe day and again thank you for your time today operator duration 43 minutes call participants philip choyce executive vice president and chief financial officer anthony gallegos president and chief

cleveland fed president loretta mester and dallas federal reserve president robert kaplan which aired live across cnbc s business day programming today friday may 3rd the interviews took place at the hoover institution annual monetary policy conference in stanford ca videos of the interviews on cnbc com are linked below all references must be sourced to cnbc first on cnbc hoover institution s john taylor on cnbc s squawk box m f 6am 9am steve liesman thank you andrew yeah we ve got a bunch of guests but none better than john taylor eminent professor of finance monetary policy at stanford university john i almost want to skip the jobs number and get to the broader discussion we were having about productivity because at the end of the day monthly jobs don t matter for wit if you have this strong productivity because that changes things when you look at these numbers how do you judge what yesterday was 3 6 for the first quarter and you had a 1 8 for the fourth quarter which was higher than trend john taylor i think productivity is key right now it s what we ve been hoping that s why we were hoping growth was going be higher it s not a sugar high it s because we re getting some good productivity numbers coming in it s significant and i m glad people are talking about that we re talking about it out here all the time steve liesman if these numbers are higher the productivity numbers are higher and we re not really necessarily going to change the demographics because t what happened 30 years ago determines the populations we have now to work essentially what happened to potential growth is it potential growth potentially higher john taylor absolutely we ve been arguing you ll go from a lousy 2 to above 3 and that s what s been happening the last few years it s been going up and up and up and now 3 2 for the most recent numbers and that consistent with the productivity numbers the demographics are important remember bls was forecasting declines and it s flat that s a positive thing steve liesman a victory to have a flat participation rate john taylor i think so yeah steve liesman because you do have the retirements john taylor absolutely steve liesman so the idea that it s john a 3 6 unemployment rate you re doing 200 000 plus jobs a month is the fed in the right place john taylor i think they made some good changes since they ve started to normalize i think that s a good thing i think that s actually one of the positives people forget that to get a normalized fed is good for the economy good for the world steve liesman rates up at this point you re saying john taylor i think that s good they re in a better place at this point in case something happens i think they ll probably continue to adjust but we ll see what happens to the rest of the data steve liesman it s hard not to get too wonky about this but we had an interesting conversation last night about the relationship of productivity to interest rates if productivity is higher economics would suggest interest rates should be higher can you explain that to the audience john taylor well i think in terms of the fed it s the other way around they want to see the potential of the economy to grow we all do of course steve liesman right john taylor and once that happens the need for rate increases is diminished because you ve got productivity you ve got the potential of the economy growing rapidly steve liesman so they don t have to raise rates in light of higher productivity or lower unemployment john taylor well there are other things but certainly the productivity number the real question you re raising is what s this normal interest rate steve liesman right john taylor and a lot of people we re going to be talking about this at this conference a lot and has it come down is it going back up again i think it s probably too early to say that i ve been a little skeptical that it s come down as far as people think so maybe we ll get some better estimates steve liesman fed chairman jay powell says the fed is in a good place with this current policy rate do you think it s in a good place john taylor i think as long as it keeps adjusting i think again what s going to be on the table here today is these policies strategies rules and as long as they are doing that i think a big change in the last couple years really has been as more rules based policy more strategies are being considered steve liesman where s the inflation john everybody thought we were going to have rising inflation instead we have inflation the core pce is down three four months in a row john taylor i think to some extent it s because the supply side of the economy is picking up remember these are productivity and labor forces supply side steve liesman deregulation and tax cuts or supply side john taylor both of those deregulation and the tax reform are both absolutely i think bring the financial side in bring the fed in as well to that steve liesman okay john we have to leave it there because we have some other imminent guests and warren buffett et cetera going from that conference there john taylor thanks for joining us this morning andrew back to you first on cnbc st louis fed president jim bullard on cnbc s squawk on the street m f 9am 11am steve liesman yeah thanks carl and i have a special guest who can help us understand it i m joined by st louis fed president james bullard so jim it isn t every day that we have a vice president on talking about the fed the fed and fed policy and i get to throw it at president a voting member of the fomc who says you ought to be lowering rates and maybe not considering the employment mandate just have an inflation mandate take it away james bullard i actually have supported single mandate for the fed in the past i ve said that it would clarify what the fed can actually do over the medium term i don t think actual policy would change very much we would still react to the economy and everything but it would clarify in people s minds that the only thing the fed can do over the medium term is try to control the inflation rate steve liesman do the president and the vice president have a point that growth is strong inflation is low and the fed ought to be cutting rates and if it did cut rates the economy would soar james bullard i think the way you think about the current situation you have to step back a little bit there has been a sea change in u s monetary policies since january 4th when the chair was at in atlanta at the aa meetings that sea change has altered the structure of interest rates and you can really see it in the ten year the ten year was trading at 325 last fall now it s trading low 250s you re talking 75 basis points on the ten year i would attribute the lion share of that to changed fed policy we know there are long and variable legs you ve got to wait and see how big an impact this has on the economy so i think we re in great shape today we have a great jobs report inflation is a little bit low and we can talk about that but we already made a gigantic change in policy one which i welcomed and supported most of the committee came to my view about the flat rate outlook and this has had a big impact steve liesman so you re saying you already eased through what is sort of derived something we call open mouth operations by changing your stance on the forward outlook james bullard policy is not just the rate it is the expected path of the rate over the next two years and we used to be saying you know 50 100 basis points on that path now we re saying zero or close to zero steve liesman and that s brought ten year down and real rates and the economy down james bullard absolutely steve liesman let s talk about this jobs number i mean did your eyebrows sort of go up towards the top of your forehead when you saw 260 james bullard it is a good number it sounds like since the first of the year we re about 205 or something on average a little bit lower than last year so this is consistent with the idea that 2018 was going to be faster growth than 2019 i think the news in the last just in the last month the news is that we re not going to get this slowdown to below 2 gdp growth instead we re going to slow down to 2 5 which is you know more moderate type of slowdown in 2019 compared to what people were expecting steve liesman i mean i get that but it looks more like we re closer to 3 i mean we did 3 in the first quarter james bullard and there is upside potential that you could just steve liesman talk about that risk james bullard you could just stay at 3 you have this good productivity number which i love looks like productivity is picking up there could be supply side effects here kicking in possibly because of the tax acts so i think some good things are happening and it could be that you get even higher growth in 2019 than the numbers i just said steve liesman okay we re going get to sara in just a second sara if you would just bear with me if you have a 2 5 forecast with a 3 upside is 2 4 the current funds rate the right rate for that environment and that potential james bullard well i think we re a little tight on the rate not too much but a little bit tight i think the global safe real interest rate short term is about zero and if you steve liesman real rate james bullard real rate steve liesman so explain that to people james bullard the real rate is zero if you add the 2 inflation target to that you get to 2 we re at 240 sounds a little tight to me i don t think it is a something to really worry about but sounds tight and you ve got core pce inflation running at 1 6 it is making me a little nervous i think inflation expectations are a little on the low side steve liesman do you agree with that it is transient james bullard i would like to re center inflation take this opportunity to re center inflation expectations at 2 that would pay handsome dividends for the fed going forward steve liesman we ll come back to transient let s get sara s question in sorry about that sara sara eisen my question is on transient professor bullard steve liesman go ahead james bullard excellent steve liesman thought it might be sara eisen i was wondering what you made of the market reaction to the fed meeting i mean it seemed like there was real disappointment in market positioning around the fact that chairman powell describes inflation as transient or transitory and therefore suggested it is not persistent enough to make a rate cut james bullard yeah i think you know again we have made a big move in monetary policy over the last three or four months and i think it is time to wait and see how that is going to impact the economy going forward it is true that the the core pce numbers have come in a little bit light but of course there is noise in the data as the chair noted and you could look at the dow s fed trimmed mean which is a measure i ve liked in the past that is at 2 so i think this is a point where we probably want to be assessing the data steve liesman so jim if indeed we re going to be running 1 5 core pce which is the better measure you guys think of inflation how tight is the fed here do you think it ought to be cutting rates james bullard well like i say i m not averse to the idea that we should try to re center inflation expectations while the economy is good and make sure that we re centered at 2 they look a little light to me it looks like markets expect you know something below 2 inflation over the next five years and i don t think that s a good place for us to be there will be days in the future where the economy is not performing so well and those expectations will go down even further so i think it is a reasonable option is to try to re center inflation expectations on 2 steve liesman tell us how as a policymaker you react when you hear the president talk about what the federal reserve should be doing with interest rates james bullard well as you know all these discussions are very get very technical very quickly and so i think we have our mandate we re supposed to get full employment we re supposed to hit our inflation target keep inflation low and stable many factors come into that we get advice from all kinds of people including you and including other politicians who the chair goes before the senate banking committee house financial services committee they all comment on monetary policy so we get a lot of input from a lot of different angles we re used to that and we try to make the best decisions we can but we have this mandate we have to come back to that s a law steve liesman alright jim i want to see where your forecasts are here we re at 3 6 now on the unemployment rate how low does it go and at what level does it make you more nervous about the potential for inflation james bullard you know i think we have talked about this before but the empirical philips curve is very very weak in this environment you might be talking about a ratio of 10 to 1 so you need 100 basis points of gap to get ten basis points on inflation and you know what do you think 3 6 is that 100 basis points below the natural rate i don t know a lot of people think not how much inflation are you thinking you re going to get out of the low unemployment rate in this environment steve liesman and then before we go real quick your gdp number for this year james bullard i would be at 2 5 sitting here today steve liesman great jim bullard thanks very much for joining us james bullard alright thanks a lot steve liesman and we ll check back with you at the end of the year james bullard okay first on cnbc cleveland fed president loretta mester on cnbc s the exchange m f 1pm 2pm steve liesman kelly thanks very much here at the hoover institution annual monetary policy conference it s become quite a deal right practically the whole committee you could take a vote in there on interest rates now if you wanted to loretta mester a lot of people listening to this conference exactly steve liesman loretta thank you for joining us let s talk about the jobs report this morning 260 000 plus jobs created are you ready to go raise rates because the economy s running so hot loretta mester no you know i fully support our patient approach to looking at what the data is telling us as it comes in the job market is strong and today s report just reinforces that we have a strong labor market which is great we have inflation a little bit below our target but stable prices we have productivity growth growing which is a good positive for the economy and growth has came in in the first quarter a little bit stronger than people had anticipated now grant you some of that was inventory building so we ll have to look to see what it implies for the second quarter but growth is good so i think we re in a really good place our interest rate policy i think is exactly appropriate for now and we ll just see how the economy evolves steve liesman 3 6 unemployment do you worry that the employment market s too tight loretta mester no i think we have to take on the ground you know we don t see inflationary pressures building we do see people getting back to work labor force participation is growing over time although it was down a little bit in this last report people are working wages are not accelerating but they re growing so that s a good thing they re growing in line with productivity growth so this is a strong economy these are good numbers steve liesman can you put more detail on that when you say growing in line because the vice chairman clarida said that today as well 3 2 is in line more or less with recent productivity numbers or whatever as long as it s not above the combined productivity and inflation you don t worry that that pushes inflation up higher loretta mester yeah because usually you d see in the longer run that wages are going to be going with productivity growth and inflation as long as it doesn t go above that then there s no real feed through to price inflation steve liesman so i can factor in the future if it s 4 that s still okay as long as it s below those two numbers loretta mester yeah as long as well productivity growth rising is a good thing for the economy right steve liesman did you see the recent decline president mester of the core inflation numbers as being transitory or something to worry about loretta mester so again you don t want to overreact to one report i do think that we have to take seriously our 2 inflation goal and work to try to get inflation back to our goal over time but i also agree that we need to be patient about it and we need to look at the data and underlying data to understand what s going on i would be concerned if inflation and expectations were falling if aggregate demand was falling if the signal of low inflation was that growth was going down but there s no evidence of that the economy s in a really strong place so i m willing to be patient right on the inflation on the down side as well as inflation on the upside steve liesman does patient mean you want to do something eventually do you have an idea of where you d like policy to go would you be loretta mester no i honestly think we re in a good we re well calibrated right now and of course we always have to be forward looking but it s got to be based on where we think the economy is going steve liesman but you would not prefer for example there were some people who had a neutral rate of 3 you would not prefer to get there but you re just patient in getting there loretta mester no because as you know and what clarida talked about today is that those numbers are measured with a lot of confidence bands around them so they re estimates and so you always have to be taking the signals from the market signals from the real economy signals from the price data to calibrate where your policy is we re about at a neutral rate because we can see that in the economy we don t have building pressures inflation we have growth a little bit above trend and that s a good economy to be in steve liesman so that growth above trend is interesting we did 3 last year we did a surprise 3 in first quarter but there s some stuff in there loretta mester right steve liesman what s your best guess for what we do this year loretta mester yeah so i m at a between 2 and 2 5 the first quarter came in a little bit stronger than i thought it was going to so i m probably in the upper part of that range now steve liesman so 2 5 loretta mester yeah probably i would say steve liesman is the risk to the up side or the down side would you say or would you loretta mester i think it s balanced right now i think there s good reason to think that some of the upside if you know some of the uncertainty on trade come offs that would be an upside surprise so you know i m seeing balanced risks out there steve liesman how about the global risks that are out there chairman powell talked on wednesday that some of that has subsided do you have less concern now about what s happening in europe loretta mester i think some of it has subsided we do have more positive numbers out of china brexit was postponed so that was an uncertainty there postponed but again i think we have to watch the data we have to see how it s going in europe there are weaker numbers coming in on certain parts of europe and stronger numbers in other so basically we re in this sort of monitoring the economy now steve liesman president mester thank you for joining me today loretta mester thank you steve liesman kelly back to you where things are remarkably cool here in san francisco dallas federal reserve president robert kaplan on cnbc s closing bell m f 3pm 5pm steve liesman yeah wilf thanks very much we have enough fomc members here to hold a meeting and raise rates if you wanted to not in the cards robert kaplan not in the cards steve liesman robert kaplan dallas fed president joining us what did you make this morning of this very strong jobs report today robert kaplan consistent with an economy that s i think growing at a solid rate maybe not as well as last year but still solid rate of growth and we expect that to continue into 2019 steve liesman did you were you surprised by the strength of the number robert kaplan i think it s still my view that we re running out of capacity in the workforce we you know we keep saying that the unemployment rate s now 3 6 steve liesman running out of capacity running out of capacity running out of capacity we do 200 200 200 we re not running out of workers at all robert kaplan well we re bringing people in off sidelines but we re starting to approach prime age participation pre crisis we re reaching pre recession lows on discouraged workers in a good way i would expect it s going to slow down but i don t think that would be necessarily a bad sign in that it s just a fact when you ve got this low rate of unemployment but we re going to grow we think at solid rates we would like to see ways to continue to grow the workforce and we may have to start looking at other alternatives and that may be you know transportation issues child care and yes immigration even though it s a sensitive issue steve liesman you don t get worried about inflation when the unemployment rate falls to 3 6 robert kaplan so you know the trimmed mean measure that we use at the dallas fed is hovering around 2 it s not quite as steve liesman hold on because jerome powell made that famous on wednesday talking about the dallas trimmed mean and what you do is you get rid of the all the noise on the top and bottom robert kaplan the outliers steve liesman the outliers and it s not just food or energy could be one thing one month one thing another month robert kaplan it tends to change month to month i like that measure better and i think it s a better indicator steve liesman it s been doing what exactly robert kaplan it ended last year around 2 it slipped a little bit early this year 1 8 1 9 it s now around 2 and so the point is it s not that we don t have any inflation but the reason though and you ve heard me say this before inflation forces i think are going to continue to be muted is technology technology enabled disruption and to some extent globalization businesses have less pricing power today and this comes through in corporate earnings reports it comes through in all my conversations businesses just don t have pricing power to the extent they have wage pressure or cost pressure it s going to come out of margins more likely than being translated to prices steve liesman so at 2 4 are you at a neutral rate do you think right now are you still stimulating the economy with your balance sheet and with the funds rate robert kaplan i mean in my own view yeah at the rate we are 2 25 2 5 we re in the neighborhood of neutral right now and so i think sort of the performance of the economy reinforces to me that we re in the neighborhood of neutral steve liesman how so robert kaplan i think potential growth for the u s economy let s say we get a little improvement in productivity i still think it s around 2 we think we re going to grow around 2 25 and i think all that s consistent with a policy setting that s probably in the neighborhood of neutral steve liesman did somebody sara or wilf have a question i thought i heard something sara eisen i can ask a question steve thank you president kaplan good to see you steve liesman go ahead sara i had something in my ear i wasn t sure what it was sara eisen probably a producer president kaplan when you see jobs numbers like today and when you talk about a pretty decent outlook for the economy see us outgrowing the world how much do you think it is the tax cuts that we saw adding sort of an extra jolt of stimulus this late in the recovery robert kaplan so our own view in our work at the dallas fed is there were three elements of the fiscal stimulus one of them was an individual tax cut one of them was a big spending bill and then the third was corporate tax reform and i would say at this point we think those first two items are waning but the corporate tax reform probably we think will have some sustainable positive impact and i think that s likely to help here wilfred frost president kaplan sara said it in her question the u s is outgrowing the rest of the world the developed world at least how concerned are you about a prolonged or further strengthening u s dollar and what that might do to growth prospects in the 18 months ahead or so robert kaplan so it s listen i ve learned from 30 years in the markets it s hard to forecast what the currency s going to do i do worry though on your point i worry that weak growth outside the united states particularly in europe we re not immune to it and some of that is spilling over and particularly that s the case because you know almost 50 of s p 500 earnings and profits come from outside the united states so i think that s a bigger issue that i think will have some muting effect on gdp growth here steve liesman let me follow up on wilf s question what other things concern you corporate leverage inside the united states it doesn t seem like at this conference which i ve been to now for five or six years there s a pressing issue on the table of something that must be done or addressed right now robert kaplan so to me the big issues are it s still the case our workforce is ageing and workforce growth is slowing and we still think that s going to be an issue to deal with for the next number of years we re getting a good bout of pulling people back into the workforce we ve still got an aging issue and also our skills of our labor force math science and reading are lagging we re not investing enough in our human capital skills training and education and then our third thing you ve heard me talk about corporate debt corporate debt is at record levels triple b debt has tripled over the last ten years leverage loans have doubled and i think in a downturn if we slow more that could be a bit of an amplifier to the slowdown and so i still i think it s worth continuing to talk about that steve liesman president kaplan vice president mike pence this morning on our air questioned whether the fed ought to be following the dual mandate and said maybe it should just be following inflation what do you make of that robert kaplan yeah my own view and i was a market participant for a long time and now i ve been on the fed close to four years there are periods in our history where we re very glad we ve got a dual mandate where we worry about employment and inflation there are periods where it seems like because right now we re at near or past full employment we worry a bit more about inflation i think the key is our framework needs to stand the test of time it can t be the framework that s right for the next six months or the next 18 months it has to be a framework that works for the foreseeable future on a sustainable basis so i m glad for one that we ve got a dual mandate steve liesman so texas doesn t have its own district for nothing it s a major major i mean as a country it would be a stand alone country with a major economy two issues are huge in texas right now that are huge for the u s economy immigration and trade if i could put those as one and oil and gas is what s happening at the border now hurting the texas economy is it helping the texas economy robert kaplan the issue at the border because it hasn t been that widely reported the migrant issue is a very real issue and i was just down at the border last week in that we have a record number of migrants moving up from central america what border patrol is doing is diverting personnel to deal with that and so a lot of the commercial traffic we re hearing from businesses is being impeded so for example the average number of trucks across the el paso border our contacts tell us is 3 000 a day commercially it s down to 1 500 this is affecting logistics and supply chains not just in texas and the southwest but also in the midwest the issue is does it go on right now it s not gone on for long enough to have a material impact on texas steve liesman it could robert kaplan it could and it s something we re watching steve liesman let s leave it there president kaplan and we ll come back and ask you about the energy and oil and gas business next time robert kaplan thanks steve steve liesman dallas fed president from the hoover institution monetary policy conference in stanford
staff writer telegram gazette washington there are times when it seems we re worrying about things that aren t worth worrying about a good example these days is inflation amazingly the complaint is that it s not rising fast enough in march the consumer price index or cpi had increased 1 9 over the past year the gain of another inflation indicator the deflator of the personal consumption expenditures or pce was 1 5 what s not to like despite criticism from donald trump all this qualifies as good news prices have hardly risen indeed technical difficulties in measuring inflation for example how to account for new products such as smartphones suggest that that actual inflation could be close to zero some prices go up new vehicles 0 7 over the past year other prices go down televisions 19 the pce is the federal reserve s preferred inflation indicator for workers this means that if their wages and fringe benefits rose by more than 1 5 over the year they would ve received a modest boost to their real inflation adjusted incomes and yet many respected economists worry that inflation is too low to those of us including me old enough to have lived through the double digit inflation of late 1970s and early 1980s this is crazy high and uncontrolled inflation annually it peaked at 13 in 1979 was a scourge it sowed almost universal anxiety and was wildly unpopular people felt they had lost control of their lives government seemed powerless to stop it why would anyone want to re create this anarchy three reasons are typically given for starters critics complain that the fed isn t hitting its own inflation target which is 2 on the pce this suggests incompetence if the fed can t hit its target the assumption goes what else can t it do frankly this is fear mongering the fed simply isn t powerful enough to hit a precise target as long as reported inflation stays between zero and 2 the fed is delivering a crude price stability a more realistic concern involves the fed s ability to respond to a recession typically the fed cuts interest rates to reverse an economic downturn but interest rates reflecting inflation are already low the fear is that the fed won t be able to cut rates enough to prevent a recession from getting worse consider the so called fed funds rate the rate on overnight loans and the rate most influenced by the fed is now set at about 2 5 by contrast it was 5 25 in 2007 the start of the last recession and higher earlier if the fed can only cut rates modestly before they hit zero then the next recession could be lengthy and stubborn that s the argument this brings us to the most serious of inflation s alleged shortcomings paradoxically it s deflation or falling prices of course some prices are falling even when the overall price level is rising to take an obvious example computers and other tech products have experienced massive price cuts no one is against these by contrast deflation signifies declines in most prices and this prospect can do enormous economic damage the most terrifying example is the great depression of the 1930s when the wholesale price index fell a staggering 33 from 1929 to 1933 the result was to prolong the depression deflation causes people to delay major purchases they think that prices will go even lower deflation also makes it harder for debtors to repay their loans the economy gets caught in a vicious circle of deflation weak consumer spending and more loan defaults in the 1930s annual unemployment peaked at around 25 higher inflation is cast as the antidote to deflation it s an extra cushion of protection this sounds sensible but it overlooks the likely reality that the transition to higher inflation would create a new set of problems involving interest rates exchange rates consumer and business uncertainty and the stock market to name just a few moreover it presumes that deflation would quickly attain depression like proportions when a more likely outcome would be modest deflation probably many americans wouldn t notice slight price declines others might seize on them as an opportunity to go bargain hunting indeed the combination of rigid wages and falling prices would enhance consumer purchasing power and could stimulate an economic recovery we have a case study in the probabilities japan it s been grappling with deflation for years but price declines have been puny from 2001 to 2010 the average annual decline was 0 3 that s one third of 1 says the international monetary fund millions of americans are unaware of our disastrous experience with double digit inflation they have either forgotten or weren t yet born the fed says it won t abandon its current inflation target of 2 that s a promise the fed needs to keep robert j samuelson is a columnist for the washington post writers group
by traderstef via crushthestreet connect with traderstef via twitter or at traderstef s website the big apple is in a fiscal crisis and facing another potential bankruptcy back in 1975 new york city was over 200 million in debt with a 1 5 billion deficit and a 12 billion budget the city s lawyers were prepared to file a bankruptcy petition with the state supreme court the police were mobilized to serve papers to its creditors in the banking industry and mayor beame drafted a statement to announce default and emergency measures to divert available cash flows to vital services such as police and fire protection nyc was once ravaged by urban blight the city was practically bankrupt and hemorrhaging population subway trains were covered in graffiti inside and out crime was rampant women were warned to remove jewelry while walking the streets for fear that their necklaces would be ripped from their necks vast areas of the bronx and upper manhattan were torched where nannies and their baby carriages gather today on the upper west side s sherman square drug pushers worked the spot they called needle park tompkins square park in the east village and bryant park by the main library were permanent encampments for junkies prostitutes and drifters people feared to wander in large portions of central park even during daylight hours streeteasy apr 2019 a records collection from the municipal assistance corporation which was the state authority created in 1975 to issue bonds and oversee the city s fiscal affairs and documents and oral history assembled by jack bigel the behind the scenes labor advisor negotiator and financial planner reveals how the city saved itself from bankruptcy during the great stagflation bigel convinced numerous union leaders including the united federation of teachers to use their retirement funds to back loans for the city in a recent report published by boston college approximately 25 of private pension funds will go bankrupt within the next decade state pension funds are in much worse shape with an estimated 6 trillion in unfunded liabilities and ballooning every year despite one of the longest stock bull markets in american history since the great financial crisis it did not halt the deterioration of pension funds across the country those retirement programs relied upon optimistic financial projections for decades and the administrators are realizing how much more they owe than previously thought longer life expectancy for public employees also equates to higher costs and not just for pension plans many state and local governments have promised to pay for the health care of their retired workers and few have the money set aside to fulfill those obligations i am sure that progressive sanctuary metropolises across the nation are thrilled to support tens of thousands of illegal immigrants state pension unfunded liabilities nearly 6 trillion if net pension assets are determined using more realistic investment return assumptions pension funding gaps are significantly wider than even the large sums reported in state financial documents ceo mar 2019 meanwhile only 39 of americans have enough savings to cover a 1 000
