as the 2010s draw to a close the global economy is in a very different place at the decade s end than at its beginning many of the sociopolitical events that took place around the world were reflective of the financial world analysts say the election of donald trump in 2016 was the catalyst for significant change in the u s economy and the global economy but his rise was as much an effect of broader forces at work as it was a cause of these movements and moments that reshaped the economy over the last 10 years eurozone in crisis in the wake of the recession unsustainably high deficit and debt levels in several european countries led to a crisis requiring the intervention of third party financial institutions such as a 2012 bond buying program implemented by the european central bank to tamp down interest rates on sovereign debt which were rising as investor confidence shrank the crisis was most acutely felt in greece which had its bond rating slashed slashed to junk status after it was revealed that the government had seriously misrepresented its debt burden leaders agreed to sharp austerity measures in return for bailouts from the union and the international monetary fund in the subsequent backlash and public protests against greek austerity measures there was speculation that the country might leave the eurozone entirely some say these events were a precursor to and a catalyst of britain s 2016 vote to leave the eurozone brexit is kind of the natural outcome of when greece was basically held hostage said brad mcmillan chief investment officer at commonwealth financial network they were forced into a multi year depression in order to save the euro obviously brexit opens up the possibility more concretely that european countries can leave their union and i m sure that s going to have all kinds of ramifications said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics with nationalism growing in prominence he predicted that the eurozone will face a continuation of these challenges in the coming decade nationalism hits trade the 2010s were marked more broadly by a surge of populist and nationalist sentiment both in the u s and elsewhere around the world a sentiment that is fundamentally reshaping trade between countries and changing the calculus for multinational corporations we ve seen this rise of nationalism which is a political issue reshaping financial markets tremendously said joseph heider president of cirrus wealth management for roughly half a century business and industry labored to build manufacturing and production facilities and supply chains to take advantage of the availability of raw materials cheap labor and lax environmental regulations all in a relentless drive for efficiency now that commercial infrastructure is under strain trump s decision to pull the united states out of the trans pacific partnership and start a trade war with china is the most visible and consequential manifestation of this trend with his on again off again threats to impose tariffs on europe mexico and other trading partners a close second politics is now taking primacy over economics over the past several decades we ve been building an economically optimized world right now that is no longer the case mcmillan said political economy is now being prioritized over economic efficiency and that s something we haven t seen for decades that takes us back to the 50s fed intervenes to prop up the economy in the wake of the financial crisis the federal reserve initiated monetary policy with little precedent in modern times it held interest rates at zero for an extended period of time and undertook enormous quantitative easing programs to pump liquidity into financial markets the decade was really remarkable in the sense that for the first six years of the decade we had zero percent interest rates and for the first five years we had quantitative easing said dan north chief economist at euler hermes north america characterizing the central bank s activities as a wild monetary policy experiment some market observers defend the fed s interventionist streak particularly at the start of the decade with the financial crisis still fresh in people s minds the biggest thing in the last 10 years is the continuation of quantitative easing without quantitative easing i think everything would be drastically different way worse than things are now said mitchell goldberg president of clientfirst strategy in hindsight some question whether the fed was too accommodative a stance that could have ramifications for the next recession when the fed cut interest rates to the unprecedented level of zero to 0 25 percent nobody expected it was going to last the seven years that it did mcbride said we ve had way too much easy money for way too long and at some point it s going to come back and get us north said this leaves the fed with fewer tools at hand to boost the economy he said we re leaving very little room for the next recession tax cuts lead to buybacks republicans sweep of the 2016 election facilitated the passage of a massive corporate tax cut financial experts say the passage of the tax cuts and jobs act at the end of 2017 had positive results initially but those short term gains could come at the cost of long term pain trump got elected and went on a path of reducing regulation north said i think honestly the reduction in regulation has helped the economy and i think the tax cut helped the economy as well he said but he added that since economic growth fell far short of republicans forecasts the stimulative effects of the tax cut have faded and the national debt has ballooned a risky combination it s putting america on a less stable financial future because of the structure of this unfunded non sustainable tax cut crowley said proponents of the the tax cuts predicted that companies would spend their windfalls expanding and investing in production facilities technology and human capital instead the cuts spurred a wave of corporate stock buybacks which helped propel the market to new record highs but also potentially limited the broader impact the tax cuts were intended to have it s in part a reflection of the fact that there may be in some sectors more than others limited investment or acquisition opportunities or a lack of appealing valuations on those that make a buyback a more palatable way to boost earnings per share said greg mcbride chief financial analyst at bankrate com every dollar that s going into buybacks is a dollar that s not being used for another form of expansion he said share repurchases have also contributed to stock valuation gains but investing experts warn that this inflation can distort markets more dollars chasing fewer stocks because of all the buybacks isn t something you want long term investors to hang their hat on said john lynch chief investment strategist at lpl financial stock market highs the increase in buybacks is one factor that has contributed to the record long bull market a meteoric rise virtually no one would have predicted 10 years ago when 2010 began the stock market had already begun the long climb out of its recession era hole but the mood was still pessimistic the decade started off very ominously zandi said we began the decade not knowing that the crisis was over we d just suffered the worst economic downturn since the 1930s depression the recession was over officially by june 2009 but it wasn t quite clear that we were out of it since then of course stocks have smashed through one record high after another with valuations boosted by both monetary and fiscal policy mcbride said the fed s trio of rate cuts in 2019 reversed the correction that took place at the end of last year sustaining the bull market for a record setting 10th year that helped cushion the broader economy but it s also helped juiced the equity markets lower interest rates make other investments less appealing he said that enhances the appeal of equities relative to bonds or cash
by john mauldin ignoring problems rarely solves them you need to deal with them not just the effects but the underlying causes or else they usually get worse the older you get the more you know that is true in almost every area of life in the developed world and especially the us and even in china our economic challenges are rapidly approaching that point things that would have been easily fixed a decade ago or even five years ago will soon be unsolvable by conventional means there is almost no willingness to face our top problems specifically our rising debt the economic challenges we face can t continue which is why i expect the great reset a kind of worldwide do over it s not the best choice but we are slowly ruling out all others last week i talked about the political side of this our embrace of either crony capitalism or welfare statism is going to end very badly ideological positions have hardened to the point that compromise seems impossible central bankers are politicians in a sense and in some ways far more powerful and dangerous than the elected ones some recent events provide a glimpse of where they re taking us hint it s nowhere good and when you combine it with the fiscal shenanigans it s far worse simple conceit central banks weren t always as responsibly irresponsible as my friend paul mcculley would say as they are today walter bagehot one of the early editors of the economist wrote what came to be called bagehot s dictum for central banks as the lender of last resort during a financial or liquidity crisis the central bank should lend freely at a high interest rate on good securities the federal reserve came about as a theoretical antidote to even worse occasional panics and bank failures clearly it had a spotty record through 1945 as there were many mistakes made in the 20s and especially the 30s the loose monetary policy coupled with fiscal incontinence of the 70s gave us an inflationary crisis paul volcker s recent passing rip reminds us of perhaps the fed s finest hour stamping out the inflation that threatened the livelihood of millions however volcker had to do that only because of past mistakes recently reader mourad rahmanov who has thought provoking and sometimes lengthy reactions to almost every letter kindly sent me some of his personal favorite john mauldin quotes one was this passage which succinctly captures my feelings about the fed context this was part of my response to ray dalio s comments on modern monetary theory beginning with greenspan we have now had 30 years of ever looser monetary policy accompanied by lower rates this created a series of asset bubbles whose demises wreaked economic havoc artificially low rates created the housing bubble exacerbated by regulatory failure and reinforced by a morally bankrupt financial system and with the system completely aflame we asked the arsonist to put out the fire with very few observers acknowledging the irony yes we did indeed need the federal reserve to provide liquidity during the initial crisis but after that the fed kept rates too low for too long reinforcing the wealth and income disparities and creating new bubbles we will have to deal with in the not too distant future this wasn t a beautiful deleveraging as you call it it was the ugly creation of bubbles and misallocation of capital the fed shouldn t have blown these bubbles in the first place the simple conceit that 12 men and women sitting around the table can decide the most important price in the world short term interest rates better than the market itself is beginning to wear thin keeping rates too low for too long in the current cycle brought massive capital misallocation it resulted in the financialization of a significant part of the business world in the us and elsewhere the rules now reward management not for generating revenue but to drive up the price of the share price thus making their options and stock grants more valuable coordinated monetary policy is the problem not the solution and while i have little hope for change in that regard i have no hope that monetary policy will rescue us from the next crisis let me amplify that last line not only is there no hope monetary policy will save us from the next crisis it will help cause the next crisis the process has already begun radical actions in september of this year something still unexplained at least to my satisfaction although i know many analysts who believe they know the reasons happened in the repo short term financing market liquidity dried up interest rates spiked and the fed stepped in to save the day i wrote about it at the time in decoding the fed story over no the fed has had to keep saving the day every day since then we hear different theories the most frightening one is that the repo market itself is actually fine but a bank is wobbly and the billions in daily liquidity are preventing its collapse who might it be i have been told by well connected sources that it could be a mid sized japanese bank i was dubious because it would be hard to keep such a thing hidden for months but then this week bloomberg reported some japanese banks badly hurt by the boj s negative rate policy have turned to riskier debt to survive so perhaps it s fair to wonder whatever the cause the situation doesn t seem to be improving on dec 12 a new york fed statement said its trading desk would increase its repo operations around year end to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample and to mitigate the risk of money market pressures notice at the link how the ny fed describes its plans the desk will offer at least 150 billion here and at least 75 billion there that s not how debt normally works lenders give borrowers a credit limit not a credit guarantee plus an implied promise of more the us doesn t yet have negative rates but the fed is giving banks negative credit limits in a very precise violation of bagehot s dictum we have also just finished a decade of the loosest monetary policy in american history the partial tightening cycle notwithstanding something is very wrong if banks still don t have enough reserves to keep markets liquid part of it may be that regulations outside the fed s control prevent banks from using their reserves as needed but that doesn t explain why it suddenly became a problem in september necessitating radical action that continues today here s the official line from minutes of the unscheduled oct 4 meeting at which the fomc approved the operation staff analysis and market commentary suggested that many factors contributed to the funding stresses that emerged in mid september in particular financial institutions internal risk limits and balance sheet costs may have slowed the distribution of liquidity across the system at a time when reserves had dropped sharply and treasury issuance was elevated so the fed blames internal risk limits and balance sheet costs at banks what are these risks and costs they were unwilling to accept and why we still don t know there are lots of theories some even make sense whatever the reason it was severe enough to make the committee agree to both repo operations and the purchase of 20 billion a month in treasury securities and another 20 billion in agencies they insist the latter isn t qe but it sure walks and quacks like a qe duck so i and many others call it qe4 as we learned with previous qe rounds exiting is hard remember that 2013 taper tantrum ben bernanke s mild hint that asset purchases might not continue forever infuriated a liquidity addicted wall street the fed needed a couple more years to start draining the pool and then did so in the stupidest possible way by both raising rates and selling assets at the same time i don t feel good saying i told you so but well i did having said that i have to note the fed has few good choices as mistakes compound over time it must pick the least bad alternative but with each such decision the future options grow even worse so eventually instead of picking the least bad they will have to pick the least disastrous one that point is drawing closer ballooning balance sheet underlying all this is an elephant in the room the rapidly expanding federal debt each annual deficit raises the total debt and forces the treasury to issue more debt in hopes someone will buy it the us government ran a 343 billion deficit in the first two months of fiscal 2020 october and november and the 12 month budget deficit again surpassed 1 trillion federal spending rose 7 from a year earlier while tax receipts grew only 3 no problem some say we owe it to ourselves and anyway people will always buy uncle sam s debt that is unfortunately not true the foreign buyers on whom we have long depended are turning away as peter boockvar noted this week foreign selling of us notes and bonds continued in october by a net 16 7b this brings the year to date selling to 99b with much driven by liquidations from the chinese and japanese it was back in 2011 and 2012 when in each year foreigners bought over 400b worth thus it is domestically where we are now financing our ever increasing budget deficits the fed now has also become a big part of the monetization process via its purchases of t bills which also drives banks into buying notes the fed s balance sheet is now 335b higher than it was in september at 4 095 trillion again however the fed wants to define what it s doing market participants view this as qe4 with all the asset price inflation that comes along with qe programs it will be real interesting to see what happens in 2020 to the repo market when the fed tries to end its injections and how markets respond when its balance sheet stops increasing in size it s so easy to get involved and so difficult to leave declining foreign purchases are in part a consequence of the trade war the dollars china and japan use to buy our t bills are the same dollars we pay them for our imported goods but interest and exchange rates also matter with rates negative or lower than ours in most of the developed world the us had been the best parking place but in the last year other central banks started looking for a nirp exit higher rate expectations elsewhere combined with stable or falling us rates give foreign buyers who must also pay for currency hedges less incentive to buy us debt if you live in a foreign country and have a particular need for its local currency an extra 1 in yield isn t worth the risk of losing even more in the exchange rate i know some think china or other countries are opting out of the us treasury market for political reasons but it s simply business the math just doesn t work especially given the fact that president trump is explicitly saying he wants the dollar to weaken and interest rates go even lower if you are in country x why would you do that trade you might if you re in a country like argentina or venezuela where the currency is toast anyway but europe japan china the rest of the developed world it s a coin toss the fed began cutting rates in july funding pressures emerged weeks later coincidence i suspect not many factors are at work here but it sure looks like through qe4 and other activities the fed is taking the first steps toward monetizing our debt if so many more steps are ahead because the debt is only going to get worse as you can see from the gavekal chart below the fed is well on its way to reversing that 2018 quantitative tightening louis gave wrote a brilliant essay recently behind their pay wall but perhaps he will make it more public considering four possible reasons for the present valuation dichotomies i ll quote the first one because i believe it is right on target 1 the fed s balance sheet expansion is only temporary the argument the fed s current liquidity injection program is not a genuine effort at quantitative easing by the us central bank instead it is merely a short term liquidity program to ensure that markets and especially the repo markets continue to operate smoothly in about 15 weeks time the fed will stop injecting liquidity into the system as a result the market is already looking through the current liquidity injections to the time when the fed goes cold turkey once again this explains why bond yields are not rising more why the us dollar isn t falling faster and so on my take this is a distinct possibility but then as milton friedman used to say nothing is so permanent as a temporary government program the question here is why did the repo markets freeze in mid to late september was it just a technical glitch or did the spike in short rates reflect the fact that the appetite of the us private sector and foreign investors for short dated us government debt has reached its limit in short did the repo market reach its wafer thin mint moment if it was a technical glitch then the fed will indeed be able to back off come the spring however if as i believe the repo market was not the trouble but merely a symptom of a bigger problem excessive growth in us budget deficits then it is hard to see how six months before a us election the fed will be able to climb back out of the full on us government monetization rabbit hole in which it is now fully immersed in this scenario the markets will come to an interesting crossroads around the ides of march at that point the fed will have to take one of two paths 1 the fed does indeed stop its non qe qe program in this scenario us and global equities are likely to take a nasty spill in an election year that will trigger a twitterstorm of epic proportions from the us president 2 the fed confirms that the six month temporary liquidity injection program is to be extended for another temporary six months at this point bond yields everywhere around the world will shoot up the us dollar will likely take a nasty spill global equities will outperform us equities and value will outperform growth etc looking at the us government s debt dynamics i believe the second option is much more likely and it is all the more probable since triggering a significant equity pull back a few months before the us presidential election could threaten the fed s independence still the first option does remain a possibility which may well help to explain the market s cautious positioning despite today s coordinated fiscal and monetary policies ex china just this week congress passed and president trump signed massive spending bills to avoid a government shutdown there was a silver lining both parties made concessions in areas each considers important republicans got a lot more to spend on defense and democrats got all sorts of social spending that kind of compromise once happened all the time but has been rare lately maybe this is a sign the gridlock is breaking but if so their cooperation still led to higher spending and more debt as long as this continues as it almost certainly will for a long time the fed will find it near impossible to return to normal policy the balance sheet will keep ballooning as they throw manufactured money at the problem because it is all they know how to do and or it s all congress will let them do nor will there be any refuge overseas the nirp countries will remain stuck in their own traps unable to raise rates and unable to collect enough tax revenue to cover the promises made to their citizens it won t be pretty anywhere on the globe luke gromen of forest for the trees is one of my favorite macro thinkers like louis gave he thinks the monetization plan will get more obvious in early 2020 those that believe that the fed will begin undoing what it has done since september after the year end turn are either going to be proven right or they are going to be proven wrong in q1 2020 we strongly believe they will be proven wrong if when they are the fftt view that the fed is committed to financing us deficits with its balance sheet may go from a fringe view to the mainstream both parties in congress are committed to more spending no matter who is in the white house they will encourage the federal reserve to engage in more quantitative easing so the deficit spending can continue and even grow as i have often noted the next recession whenever it happens will bring a 2 trillion deficit meaning a 40 trillion dollar national debt by the end of the decade at least 20 trillion of which will be on the fed s balance sheet my side bet is that in 2030 we will look back and see that i was an optimist my 2020 forecast issue which you ll see after the holiday break i m planning to call the decade of living dangerously sometime in the middle to late 2020s we will see a great reset that profoundly changes everything you know about money and investing crisis isn t simply coming we are already in the early stages of it i think we will look back at late 2019 as the beginning this period will be rough but survivable if we prepare now in fact it will bring lots of exciting opportunities more on that in coming letters this is an article from mauldin economics thoughts from the frontline john mauldin s free weekly

president trump shattered republican orthodoxy on an extraordinary range of economic policies in 2019 setting up a more populist record for him to tout during a 2020 campaign in which democrats already are accusing him of abandoning working people from trade to spending from the federal reserve to paid parental leave trump has embraced policy changes that historically are more in line with the approach of democrats establishing a forceful role for government in setting the terms of the economy than of republicans it is a sharp contrast to his first two years when his main achievements included cutting regulations and a significant tax overhaul that emphasized reducing corporate tax rates traditional bastions of policymaking for the gop trump has still pursued cuts to government spending that pinch poorer americans tightening rules on food stamps and allowing states to reduce medicaid enrollment for instance that have fueled constant democratic accusations he has betrayed voters advertisement but the breadth of trump s break with the gop is striking at a dec 21 event hosted by conservative student group turning point usa president trump said the united states and china would very shortly sign a pact video reuters on trade trump has reached a phase one trade deal with china that reportedly includes promises to buy far more in u s exports he has completed a revamp of the north american free trade agreement with mexico and canada that some liberals are cheering for labor protections and pharmaceutical policies trump co opted a demand from the left to urge the fed to cut interest rates despite the relatively strong economy a position the central bank ultimately adopted after seeing signs the economic expansion might waver the president has blown away traditional gop concerns over the rising federal deficit cutting bipartisan deals to expand government spending and even extend a new paid leave benefit to the federal workforce he unilaterally implemented a farm bailout that could prove more expensive than the auto bailout was a decade ago a move that conservatives had criticized as wasting taxpayer dollars and while taking action against former president barack obama s health care law in court the trump administration has avoided moves to immediately blow up the law while pushing to allow states to import cheaper prescription drugs a longtime liberal position opposed by many republicans trump s steps away from conservative economic orthodoxy have been building since the 2016 presidential campaign when he shocked gop elites on his way to a blowout victory in the republican primary but in many ways they appeared to reach their culmination in 2019 advertisement the administration this year has appeared to change its focus away from working with congress on more typical republican proposals and toward an increasing focus on populist priorities said g william hoagland senior vice president at the bipartisan policy center and former republican staff director for the senate budget committee some analysts say the emphasis on populist economics could upend the 2020 presidential election as the issues that may have helped give democrats control of the house in the 2018 midterms particularly the attempt to repeal obamacare and the republican tax law could recede while other white house initiatives become more prominent the trump administration is likely to continue its aggressive trade actions in its fourth year turning to negotiations with the united kingdom europe and possibly india and vietnam said peter navarro assistant to the president for trade and manufacturing policy in an interview advertisement these economic priorities contrast with the highly partisan politics of impeachment which is expected to play out with a senate trial early next year democrats maintain that trump sold out his working class base to the gop donor class after his election but the attack may grow less potent as the tax cut in particular loses its immediacy celinda lake a democratic pollster at lake research partners said that democratic elites such as lawmakers think tank leaders and consultants have been alarmed by trump s economic populism typically republicans offer things like the deficit and the stock market the upscale economic agenda but trump is trying to include the semblance of a working class economic agenda she said it isn t real when you look underneath the hood but it sure looks real absent an alternative advertisement trump s policy shift also illustrates his power over congressional republicans two core party constituencies for decades free market traders and deficit hawks are at risk of being effectively exiled from the gop as some republican lawmakers quietly fume at being sidelined repeatedly over policy matters share this article share i see the restraints coming off all over the place it s been a less cautious approach as trump has realized he doesn t have to pay attention to traditional republican advisers said ed dolan an economist at the niskanen center a libertarian leaning think tank there don t seem to be any conservative voices around him anymore that disagree with him less trade uncertainty lower interest rates and more government spending will mean an economy growing faster than it otherwise would even if expectations remain for modest 2 percent growth in 2020 that could be a boon to the president s reelection prospects though democrats say americans are still hurt by stagnant wages and widespread economic anxiety advertisement trump s policies could still create longer term risk the surge in federal deficits and cuts to interest rates may limits the tools the united states has to respond to an economic downturn should one arrive in the final year of trump s first term or later and politically trump could remain vulnerable on health care a top concern among voters having overseen a rise in costs and the number of people without insurance i really say it s mostly lip service dean baker an economist at the left leaning center for economic and policy research said of trump s populism while in office if you look at his big changes it s really the tax cut that went to the top 1 percent and there s no dispute from that the rich have really benefited and everyone else gets a show trump may point to steady economic growth and historically low unemployment numbers but critics say those are largely disconnected from his populist economic policies advertisement most of the jobs that have been created are in the services type industries his constituency in the middle of the country may not be helped by a lot of these policies said chris rupkey chief financial economist at mufg union bank and trying to change these forces of globalization it won t have an impact for 10 or 20 years if it happens at all these are very slow moving forces kayleigh mcenany a spokeswoman for trump s reelection campaign said in a statement trump promised to change decades of failed trade policy revive manufacturing and bring relief to middle class families he has done all that and more trump s presidency began with an unsuccessful effort to undo obama s 2010 health care legislation which would have cut federal spending but also cost millions of americans their health insurance republicans then united successfully around a more than 1 5 trillion tax cut advertisement when trump first came into office the priorities he agreed with the tax bill repealing obamacare required legislation and so he needed hill republicans led by orthodox conservative paul d ryan said douglas holtz eakin a republican economist and former director of the congressional budget office but since democrats gained control of the house starting in 2019 the white house has had to compromise with speaker nancy pelosi d calif or act unilaterally what changed this year is that for the policy issues on the table he could move unilaterally and he did holtz eakin said these are nontraditional republican positions and they have come to the fore in the past year among the most serious clashes with his party has been one over trade republicans have traditionally resisted tariffs and supported large business groups in their quest for expanding international markets democrats have typically led the charge to crack down on china trade practices and revamp nafta advertisement trump flipped this dynamic upside down after blasting the united states trade relations with foreign nations as a presidential candidate trump took action on the issue by launching a trade war with china and slapping increasingly aggressive tariffs on other countries business groups that had been strongly supportive of the tax overhaul criticized trump for raising prices for american consumers and disrupting global supply chains trump s advisers were in the meantime willing to agree to significant concessions to house democrats and labor groups to seal a new trade agreement with canada and mexico angering some republicans but also earning the pact bipartisan cover trump s unique brand of populism is essentially an economic nationalism based on an america first perspective applied to both domestic policies and the international trade arena said navarro the trump trade adviser this revolution has repositioned the republican party into the party of the working class in the past he said republicans were willing to sacrifice our economy on the altar of national security but if you do that you wind up losing both perhaps just as surprising is how trump has upended the gop positions on both monetary and fiscal policy the president demanded fed chair jerome h powell reverse course and back off raising interest rates at the same time the president has rejected fed nominees pushed by traditional conservatives who probably would have raised rates it seems that appointments are fully on board for the critique leftists have been making about monetary policy said sam bell founder and policy director of employ america a left leaning organization advocating on economic policy a spending splurge under trump may mark an even more dramatic retreat in conservative economic policy as annual deficits have risen to close to 1 trillion despite the sustained run of economic growth trump campaigned on preventing cuts to social security and medicare largely bucking long standing gop calls to reduce the national deficit by targeting the two large government programs in practice his administration has gone even further than avoiding cuts to those programs expanding federal spending in multiple budget deals while opportunistically using them to win concessions on other priorities such as the space force trump s policy opportunism may be novel for american politics but his grab bag of economic positions fits a bigger global trend of conservative populists such as british prime minister boris johnson who has pledged to increase spending on britain s national health program populist forces are a global phenomenon said pippa norris a political scientist at harvard they cut across the traditional left right cleavage many populists aren t traditional free market neoliberals or fiscal conservatives in their economic policies whether that will permanently remake the republican party on the other hand remains an open question
economic and monetary developments overview based on the assessment of the economic and inflation outlook for the euro area also taking into account the latest eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections the governing council decided at its monetary policy meeting on 12 december to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged and to reiterate its forward guidance on policy rates net asset purchases and reinvestments incoming information since the last governing council meeting in late october points to continued muted inflation pressures and weak euro area growth dynamics although there are some initial signs of stabilisation in the growth slowdown and of a mild increase in underlying inflation in line with previous expectations ongoing employment growth and increasing wages continue to underpin the resilience of the euro area economy against this overall background and in the light of the subdued inflation outlook the governing council reiterated the need for monetary policy to remain highly accommodative for a prolonged period of time to support underlying inflation pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term in addition the governing council s forward guidance ensures that financial conditions adjust in accordance with changes to the inflation outlook in any event the governing council continues to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation moves towards its aims in a sustained manner in line with its commitment to symmetry economic and monetary assessment at the time of the governing council meeting of 12 december 2019 global real gdp growth excluding the euro area weakened during the first half of 2019 but signs of stabilisation started to emerge towards the end of the year the weak growth momentum was characterised by slowing growth in both manufacturing and investment which have been reinforced by rising policy and political uncertainty particularly amid escalating trade tensions and brexit related developments more recent information however points to a stabilisation in global growth as confirmed also by survey based data in particular the purchasing managers indices pmi point to a moderate recovery in manufacturing output growth and some moderation in services output growth looking ahead the recovery in global economic activity is projected to be shallow reflecting a moderation of growth in advanced economies and a sluggish recovery in some emerging economies global trade softened this year and is projected to expand at a slower pace than global activity in the medium term global inflationary pressures remain contained and the balance of risks to global economic activity continues to be tilted to the downside although risks are becoming less pronounced since the governing council meeting in september 2019 euro area long term risk free rates have increased and the forward curve of the euro overnight index average eonia has shifted upwards with markets currently expecting no further cut in the deposit facility rate in line with an improvement in global risk sentiment euro area equity prices have increased and corporate spreads have tightened euro area long term sovereign yields also largely reflect the rise in risk free rates in foreign exchange markets the euro remained broadly stable in trade weighted terms euro area real gdp growth was confirmed at 0 2 quarter on quarter in the third quarter of 2019 unchanged from the previous quarter the ongoing weakness of international trade in an environment of persistent global uncertainties continues to weigh on the euro area manufacturing sector and is dampening investment growth at the same time incoming economic data and survey information while remaining weak overall point to some stabilisation in the slowdown of economic growth in the euro area the services and construction sectors remain resilient despite some moderation in the latter half of 2019 looking ahead the euro area expansion will continue to be supported by favourable financing conditions further employment gains in conjunction with rising wages the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance and the ongoing albeit somewhat slower growth in global activity this assessment is broadly reflected in the december 2019 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area these projections foresee annual real gdp increasing by 1 2 in 2019 1 1 in 2020 and 1 4 in both 2021 and 2022 compared with the september 2019 ecb staff macroeconomic projections the outlook for real gdp growth has been revised down slightly for 2020 the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook related to geopolitical factors rising protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets remain tilted to the downside but have become somewhat less pronounced according to eurostat s flash estimate euro area annual hicp inflation increased from 0 7 in october 2019 to 1 0 in november reflecting mainly higher services and food price inflation on the basis of current futures prices for oil headline inflation is likely to rise somewhat in the coming months indicators of inflation expectations stand at low levels measures of underlying inflation have remained generally muted although there are some indications of a mild increase in line with previous expectations while labour cost pressures have strengthened amid tighter labour markets the weaker growth momentum is delaying their pass through to inflation over the medium term inflation is expected to increase supported by the governing council s monetary policy measures the ongoing economic expansion and solid wage growth this assessment is also broadly reflected in the december 2019 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area which foresee annual hicp inflation at 1 2 in 2019 1 1 in 2020 1 4 in 2021 and 1 6 in 2022 compared with the september 2019 ecb staff macroeconomic projections the outlook for hicp inflation has been revised up slightly for 2020 and down slightly for 2021 mainly driven by the expected future path of energy prices annual hicp inflation excluding energy and food is expected to be 1 0 in 2019 1 3 in 2020 1 4 in 2021 and 1 6 in 2022 in october 2019 the annual growth of broad money remained robust while lending to the private sector continued its gradual recovery broad money m3 growth stood at 5 6 in october 2019 unchanged from the previous month sustained rates of broad money growth reflect ongoing bank credit creation for the private sector and low opportunity costs of holding m3 at the same time favourable bank funding and lending conditions continued to support loan flows and thereby economic growth the annual growth rate of loans to non financial corporations increased to 3 8 in october up from 3 6 in september the governing council s accommodative monetary policy stance will help to safeguard very favourable bank lending conditions and will continue to support access to financing across all economic sectors and in particular for small and medium sized enterprises the aggregate fiscal stance for the euro area is expected to remain mildly expansionary in 2020 thus providing support to economic activity the stance is expected to remain expansionary in 2021 and to stabilise in 2022 mainly on account of a declining but still positive primary balance in view of the weakening economic outlook governments with fiscal space should be ready to act in an effective and timely manner in countries where public debt is high governments need to pursue prudent policies and meet structural balance targets which will create the conditions for automatic stabilisers to operate freely all countries should intensify their efforts to achieve a more growth friendly composition of public finances monetary policy decisions based on the regular economic and monetary analyses the governing council decided at its monetary policy meeting on 12 december to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged and to reiterate its forward guidance on policy rates net asset purchases and reinvestments first the governing council expects the key ecb interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it has seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to but below 2 within its projection horizon and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics second after restarting net purchases under the ecb s asset purchase programme app at a monthly pace of 20 billion on 1 november the governing council expects them to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of the key ecb interest rates and to end shortly before it starts raising those rates third the governing council intends to continue reinvesting in full the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the app for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key ecb interest rates and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation the comprehensive package of policy measures that the governing council decided in september provides substantial monetary stimulus which ensures favourable financing conditions for all sectors of the economy in particular easier borrowing conditions for firms and households are underpinning consumer spending and business investment this will support the euro area expansion the ongoing build up of domestic price pressures and thus the robust convergence of inflation to the governing council s medium term aim looking ahead the governing council will closely monitor inflation developments and the impact of the unfolding monetary policy measures on the economy the governing council continues to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner in line with its commitment to symmetry external environment while global real gdp growth excluding the euro area weakened during the first half of 2019 the latest available data point to a stabilisation in the second half the weak growth momentum was characterised by slowing growth in both manufacturing and investment which have been reinforced by rising policy and political uncertainty particularly amid escalating trade tensions and brexit related developments more recent data however point to a stabilisation in global growth in the third quarter as also confirmed by recent survey based data in particular the purchasing managers indices pmi point to a moderate recovery in manufacturing output growth and some moderation in services output growth looking ahead the recovery in global economic activity is projected to be shallow reflecting a moderation of growth in advanced economies and a sluggish recovery in emerging economies global trade softened this year and is projected to expand at a slower pace than global activity in the medium term global inflationary pressures remain contained while the balance of risks to global economic activity although less pronounced remains tilted to the downside global economic activity and trade while global growth excluding the euro area weakened during the first half of the year signs of stabilisation started to emerge towards the year end after having peaked in mid 2018 global growth entered a period of weakness which continued into the first half of 2019 marking the weakest period of growth momentum since the global financial crisis the slowdown has been characterised by weakness in both global manufacturing activity and investment exacerbated by increasing policy uncertainty amid recurring escalations of trade tensions and brexit related developments recent data however point to a stabilisation in global activity though at low levels real gdp continued to expand steadily in the united states and japan while real activity growth rebounded in the united kingdom in the united states in the third quarter a strong labour market and consumer spending and favourable financial conditions remained supportive of growth while in japan solid domestic demand was the main engine of growth in the united kingdom growth rebounded on the back of unexpectedly strong net export growth and solid growth in private consumption in china third quarter data confirmed the gradual slowdown in activity driven by slowing investment while growth has stabilised across other emes survey based indicators suggest that the stabilisation of global activity has continued in the fourth quarter the global composite output purchasing managers index pmi excluding the euro area was unchanged in the third quarter compared to the previous quarter pointing to a stabilisation in global activity available data for october and november confirm steady albeit subdued global gdp growth excluding the euro area in the fourth quarter at a sectoral level since july august the gap between the manufacturing and services output pmis at the global level has progressively narrowed pointing to a gradual recovery in manufacturing output growth and some moderation in services output growth chart 1 global composite output pmi excluding the euro area diffusion indices sources markit and ecb calculations notes the latest observations are for november 2019 long term average refers to the period from january 1999 to november 2019 the indices reported in the chart refer to the global aggregate excluding the euro area global financial conditions have eased further since the finalisation of the september 2019 ecb staff macroeconomic projections financial conditions have eased in both advanced and emerging economies in emerging markets the improvement in financial conditions is mainly accounted for by the fall in bond yields and the compression of spreads advanced economies on the other hand have benefited from higher stock valuations in particular in the united states and the united kingdom and the tightening of corporate spreads an easing of trade tensions lower brexit related uncertainty and further monetary accommodation have contributed to these developments looking ahead only a mild pick up in global growth is projected reflecting a deceleration of growth in advanced economies and china which is offset by a moderate recovery in emes developments in global growth are shaped by three main forces a slowing cyclical momentum in most advanced economies and the gradual transition of china to a lower growth path will weigh on global growth conversely a favourable base effect due to a stabilisation of activity in those emes that experienced a severe recession will contribute to the recovery compared to the september 2019 macroeconomic projection exercise the global growth outlook is revised down over the projection horizon reflecting a less dynamic than previously expected recovery in some emes including in the light of domestic instability in some of them e g hong kong and chile economic activity is expected to remain resilient in the united states in the near term and to decelerate in the medium term activity expanded at 2 1 in annualised terms in the third quarter of 2019 broadly unchanged from the second quarter a strong labour market resilient consumer spending and supportive financial conditions remained the main drivers of growth while non residential investment continued to contract the net trade contribution was neutral with both imports and exports growing modestly annual headline consumer price inflation picked up marginally to 1 8 in october from 1 7 in the previous month largely on account of food and energy prices consumer price inflation excluding food and energy fell slightly in october to 2 3 over the medium term growth is projected to gradually return to the potential growth rate of just below 2 reflecting a maturing economic cycle and increasingly binding capacity constraints while consumer price inflation is expected to remain above 2 in china economic activity remains on a gradually slowing trajectory in the third quarter of 2019 annual gdp growth slowed to 6 0 from 6 2 in the second quarter driven by less supportive net trade investment surprised on the downside and is expected to remain weak while the trade conflict with the united states continues to weigh on trade looking ahead growth is projected to decrease further in 2020 reflecting slower exports and weak investment and to marginally pick up in 2021 and 2022 supported by policy actions overall the deceleration in economic activity reflects the past deleveraging efforts aimed at containing financial risks the government s focus on rebalancing the economy away from investment and the impact of the ongoing trade tensions with the united states implementation of structural reforms is projected to result in an orderly transition to a more moderate growth path that is less dependent on investment and exports economic activity remains muted in japan and is projected to grow moderately over the medium term real gdp grew by 0 4 in the third quarter of 2019 quarter on quarter compared to 0 5 in the previous quarter solid domestic demand supported by firms private non residential investment and frontloaded spending ahead of the 1 october value added tax hike was partially offset by weak exports and inventory adjustments as well as some payback for the relatively strong outcome in the second quarter partly as a result of the extended holiday period to celebrate the imperial succession while growth is projected to temporarily weaken following the value added tax hike and the natural disasters in october activity is expected to gradually return to a moderate growth path as japan continues to benefit from a highly accommodative monetary policy robust labour market conditions and the preparations for the tokyo 2020 olympics the recent announcement of a significant fiscal stimulus package by the japanese government still to be approved by parliament is also likely to provide support to growth further ahead at the same time a maturing business cycle amid increasingly binding labour and capacity constraints is expected to limit the pace of growth real gdp growth recovered modestly in the third quarter in the united kingdom but the outlook remains subdued despite a reduced risk of a disorderly brexit after contracting in the second quarter 0 2 quarter on quarter real gdp expanded by 0 3 in the third boosted by unexpectedly strong net export growth growth in private consumption remained solid 0 4 quarter on quarter reflecting stronger real wage growth over the course of 2019 with further support from government consumption 0 3 quarter on quarter while investment and inventories continued to be a drag on growth brexit related uncertainty remained high constraining growth over the short term longer term growth prospects remain heavily dependent on the nature of the eventual post brexit trading arrangements still to be agreed between the united kingdom and the eu inflation declined strongly at the start of the fourth quarter with uk annual cpi inflation falling to 1 5 in october down from 1 8 in the third quarter the fall reflects the impact of lower sterling denominated oil prices compared with last year lower import prices owing to the appreciation of the pound sterling since september and a strong downward impact on domestic energy prices as a result of the decrease in the regulator s energy price cap which is likely to be reversed in the spring of 2020 real gdp growth is projected to remain buoyant in central and eastern european countries over the projection horizon economic activity continues to be supported by solid consumer spending underpinned by tight labour markets while investment is forecast to soften against the backdrop of a more advanced phase of the eu funds cycle over the projection horizon growth is expected to moderate from above potential rates albeit remaining robust economic activity in large commodity exporting countries is projected to rebound modestly from the weakness experienced in the course of 2019 in russia the feed in of contaminated oil into a key export pipeline led to large scale disruptions but a quicker than anticipated restoration of output resulted in better than expected gdp and export outcomes in the third quarter of 2019 going forward the medium term outlook will be shaped primarily by fiscal and structural policy implementation global oil market developments specifically the commitment by the opec group of major oil producers to sustain oil production cuts and the scope of the international sanctions regime under which russia will be operating in brazil despite some improvements since early 2019 growth remains fragile owing to a tight fiscal situation including budget freezes an uncertain external environment e g trade tensions and crises in argentina and other latin american countries and idiosyncratic shocks e g a dam collapse in the country while the recently approved pension reform was critical in boosting confidence the degree to which additional necessary fiscal reforms are implemented will significantly influence growth in the medium to long term in turkey growth is projected to remain mildly positive in 2019 before gradually recovering in the medium term following the sharp contraction in gdp in the second half of 2018 the economy rebounded in the first half of 2019 owing to fiscal stimulus ahead of the local elections in march stronger household consumption and net exports while investment continued to contract growth is expected to remain mildly positive in 2019 assuming continued resilience in household consumption while the external environment could be somewhat less supportive economic activity is expected to gradually accelerate towards the end of the projection horizon global trade has declined significantly in the course of 2019 amid recurring escalations of trade tensions and slowing industrial activity after contracting in the first half of 2019 the latest available data point to a stabilisation in global trade for the rest of the year though at very subdued levels across advanced economies trade returned to moderate growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2019 supported by a normalisation of imports in the united kingdom after the exceptional stock building at the start of 2019 and a pick up in imports in central and eastern european eu countries following a temporary slowdown in the second quarter across emes trade continued to contract in the third quarter owing to trade headwinds in china the economic slowdown in india and political turbulence in latin america but there are signs of stabilisation in the fourth quarter according to cpb data global merchandise imports excluding the euro area increased by 0 8 in the third quarter of 2019 relative to the second quarter after three consecutive quarters of contraction and despite the sharp monthly fall in september see chart 2 as survey indicators on new export

area recent developments in the us trade policy stance provide mixed signals about a potential dissipation of trade tensions the resumption of the us china bilateral trade negotiations in early october paved the way for a phase 1 trade deal triggering hopes of some de escalation of the trade conflict however at the cut off date for this commentary trade talks continued amid political skirmishes between the two countries and it remained unclear by when a trade deal could be signed in view of this progress the united states has delayed indefinitely its 15 october tariff hike furthermore a us decision on whether to impose tariffs on eu car and car part imports initially due by mid november has been postponed however trade tensions have recently escalated vis à vis other countries in early december the us administration threatened to reinstate tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium from argentina and brazil in response to their currency policies at the same time following the conclusion of an investigation initiated by the us trade representative into the digital services tax enacted by france in 2019 the united states has threatened to impose tariffs on selected imports of french products as this tax was found to be discriminating against us companies while the overall volume of trade potentially affected by these tariffs is not large these recent escalations do not bode well for a potential dissipation of trade tensions global imports are projected to increase gradually over the medium term and to expand at a more subdued pace than global activity the further escalation of trade tensions the effects of which will continue to be felt into 2020 coupled with a more gradual than previously projected recovery in emerging economies and the structural rebalancing of the chinese economy will contribute to a delay in the recovery in trade as a result the elasticity of trade to economic activity is projected to remain below the unit value over the projection horizon according to the december 2019 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections global imports excluding the euro area are expected to decelerate markedly from 4 6 growth in 2018 to zero growth in 2019 before recovering to 0 8 in 2020 2 4 in 2021 and 2 7 in 2022 euro area foreign demand which expanded by 3 7 last year is expected to slow down to 0 7 in 2019 before increasing

0 9 percentage points in 2020 and 0 4 percentage points in 2021 in addition to the impact of the tariffs announced at the end of august and weaker data outturns these revisions also reflect a broad based weakness in import momentum across both advanced and emerging economies on the back of a subdued growth outlook the balance of risks to global activity remains tilted to the downside but risks have become somewhat less pronounced a further escalation of trade disputes would be detrimental to global trade and growth and cause disruptions to global supply chains moreover a no deal brexit scenario could have more adverse spillover effects especially in europe a sharper slowdown in china s economy could be harder to counteract with effective policy stimuli and might prove a challenge to the ongoing rebalancing process in china repricing in financial markets might dent risk appetite globally while a further escalation of geopolitical tensions could also adversely affect global activity and trade upside risks concern a swifter recovery in global trade and a more benign resolution of current political uncertainties global price developments oil prices have increased amid improving market sentiment concerns about weak global oil demand remained a predominant market force until mid october when us china trade talks resumed since then oil prices have recovered on the back of more buoyant market sentiment and have been further supported by the agreement by opec on 6 december to implement more substantial production cuts in the december 2019 eurosystem staff

mainly by the expected future path of energy prices which has been revised upwards for 2020 but downwards for 2021 owing to higher oil prices in the short term and a slightly more downward sloping oil price futures curve after a moderate rise by the end of 2019 hicp inflation excluding energy and food will move sideways at 1 3 in the course of 2020 and increase to 1 4 in 2021 and 1 6 in 2022 the upward path of hicp inflation excluding energy and food is expected to be supported by strengthening economic activity by relatively robust wage growth amid tight labour markets and by recovering profit margins as activity regains pace aided among other things by the ecb s september 2019 monetary policy measures rising non energy commodity prices are also expected to provide some support to

money remained robust while lending to the private sector continued its gradual recovery the resilient growth of m3 mainly reflected the very low opportunity cost of holding money favourable bank funding and lending conditions continued to support loan flows and thereby economic growth net issuance of debt securities by non financial corporations nfcs increased in the third quarter of 2019 from an already robust outturn in the previous quarter bond market conditions continue to support debt securities issuance broad money grew at a robust pace in october the annual growth rate of m3 was unchanged at 5 6 in october see chart 18 slightly exceeding the rate of around 5 observed between 2015 and 2018 when net asset purchases under the asset purchase programme app were positive broad money growth was supported by the very low opportunity cost of holding monetary instruments while weaker economic growth acted as a drag on it the interest rate constellation is also affecting the composition of m3 as it incentivises the concentration of volumes in the most liquid instruments as in previous quarters therefore m3 growth continued to be driven by the narrow aggregate m1 comprising overnight deposits and currency in circulation the annual growth rate of m1 increased in october to 8 4 from 7 8 in september continuing the recovery observed since the start of the year chart 18 m3 m1 and loans to the private sector annual percentage changes adjusted for seasonal and calendar effects source ecb notes loans are adjusted for loan sales securitisation and notional cash pooling the latest observation is for october 2019 overnight deposits were the main contributor to money growth the annual growth rate of overnight deposits increased further to 9 0 in october from 8 5 in september stable developments in currency in circulation do not point to an accelerated substitution of deposits with cash in view of the negative interest rate environment short term deposits other than overnight deposits i e m2 minus m1 made a positive contribution to m3 growth in october which was mainly attributable to stronger growth in saving deposits at the same time marketable instruments i e m3 minus m2 continued to make a small negative contribution to broad money growth as a result of the relatively low remuneration of these instruments credit to the private sector remained the main source of broad money creation in october credit to the private sector made a sizeable contribution to broad money growth see the blue portion of the bars in chart 19 the acceleration in broad money growth since early 2019 however is mainly due to developments in external monetary flows see the yellow portion of the bars in chart 19 this development reflects greater interest on the part of foreign investors in euro area assets at the same time the end of net asset purchases under the app at the end of 2018 implied that the contribution from general government securities held by the eurosystem was marginal see the red portion of the bars in chart 19 furthermore the drag from longer term financial liabilities remained small see the dark green portion of the

includes mfi loans to the private sector and mfi holdings of debt securities issued by the euro area private non mfi sector as such it also covers purchases by the eurosystem of non mfi debt securities under the corporate sector purchase programme the latest observation is for october 2019 the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector picked up slightly consolidating its gradual recovery the annual growth rate of mfi loans to the private sector adjusted for loan sales securitisation and notional cash pooling increased slightly to 3 7 in october compared with 3 6 in september see chart 18 this development was mainly due to an increase in the annual growth rate of loans to nfcs which rose to 3 8 in october compared with 3 6 in september therefore consolidating its stabilisation at levels around 4 since mid 2018 lending to firms in the services sector including firms providing real estate related services accounts for the largest share of the growth in lending to nfcs annual growth in loans to households continued on its gradual upward trend benefiting in particular from favourable lending conditions and housing market developments the annual growth rate of loans to households increased slightly to 3 5 in october compared with 3 4 in september the growth in loans to firms and households continues to be characterised by considerable heterogeneity across countries see chart 20 reflecting inter alia cross country differences in economic growth over time variations in the availability of other funding sources the level of indebtedness of households and non financial corporations and heterogeneity in house price developments across countries chart 20 mfi loans in selected euro area countries annual percentage changes source ecb notes loans are adjusted for loan sales and securitisation in the case of nfcs loans are also adjusted for notional cash pooling the cross country dispersion is calculated on the basis of minimum and maximum values using a fixed sample of 12 euro area countries the latest observation is for october 2019 banks debt funding conditions remained favourable the composite cost of debt financing for euro area banks which has decreased since the start of the year in line with market rates remained at very low levels in the third quarter of 2019 see chart 21 this development reflects a considerable trend decline in bank bond yields although there has been a slight rebound in bond yields since september reflecting a broader increase in risk free rates at the same time euro area banks deposit rates recorded new historical lows in october while developments in banks debt funding costs were largely simultaneous in the largest euro area countries reflecting the monetary policy measures of the ecb the level of bank funding costs remained heterogeneous in their responses to the ecb s october 2019 euro area bank lending survey euro area banks reported that the resumption of net asset purchases under the app is expected to facilitate a further easing of market financing conditions thereby contributing to further improvements in funding conditions moreover the downward pressure on euro area banks loan deposit margins which exerts a dampening impact on bank profitability is being compensated for by increasing lending volumes and the overall effect on net interest income as the product of lending margins and volumes has been slightly positive despite the progress made by banks in consolidating their balance sheets for instance by reducing non performing loans euro area bank profitability remains low by international and historical standards and this can challenge banks capacity to intermediate and transmit monetary policy signals against this background some of the non standard monetary policy measures introduced recently by the ecb such as tltro iii and the two tier system for reserve remuneration are geared towards supporting bank based intermediation chart 21 banks

deposits is calculated as an average of new business rates on overnight deposits deposits with an agreed maturity and deposits redeemable at notice weighted by their corresponding outstanding amounts the latest observation is for october 2019 favourable lending rates continue to support economic growth in the last few months composite bank lending rates for loans to nfcs have remained broadly unchanged in line with developments in market reference rates while the equivalent rates for loans to households for house purchase have continued to decline in october 2019 the composite bank lending rate for nfcs see chart 22 stood at 1 56 only marginally above its historical low while the composite bank lending rate for housing loans fell to a new historical low when it declined to 1 44 see chart 22 competitive pressures and more favourable bank funding costs have dampened lending rates for loans to euro area nfcs and households overall composite bank lending rates for loans to nfcs and households have fallen significantly since the ecb s credit easing measures were announced in june 2014 between may 2014 and october 2019 composite lending rates on loans to nfcs and households for house purchase fell by around 140 and 150 basis points respectively chart 22 composite lending rates in selected euro area countries percentages per annum three month moving averages source ecb notes the indicator for the total cost of bank borrowing is calculated by aggregating short and long term rates using a 24 month moving average of new business volumes the cross country standard deviation is calculated using a fixed sample of 12 euro area countries the latest observation is for october 2019 the annual flow of total external financing to euro area nfcs remained solid in the third quarter of 2019 overall as financing conditions are currently favourable debt financing flows to nfcs have remained quite resilient to the current economic weakness in this respect the survey on the access to finance of enterprises in the euro area safe shows that small and medium sized enterprises which depend critically on banks for financing report a sustained willingness of banks to lend to them external financing to firms edged up in the third quarter of 2019 benefiting from low and falling costs on financing instruments in the third quarter of 2019 the net issuance of debt securities by nfcs increased leaving issuance so far in 2019 close to record levels the increase in the net issuance of debt securities in the third quarter of 2019 occurred in a context of gradual recovery in overall credit to nfcs including mfi loans and a further improvement in corporate bond financing conditions that was more pronounced than the improvement in bank lending conditions from a medium term perspective the recovery in debt securities issuance in 2019 has brought annual net issuance flows in september back to the levels recorded in spring 2018 and well above the trough of december 2018 see chart 23 net issuance of listed shares was positive in september but remained negative for the whole third quarter of 2019 reflecting both sluggish merger and acquisition activity and an increase in the cost of equity financing over the period recent market data suggest that the net issuance of debt securities in october and november 2019 remained strong and was still dominated by investment grade issuers although high yield issuance activity also increased chart 23 net issuance of debt securities and quoted shares by euro area nfcs annual flows in eur billions source ecb notes monthly figures based on a 12 month rolling period the latest observation is for september 2019 in september 2019 the cost of financing for nfcs stood close to its historical minimum recorded in april 2019 in september the overall nominal cost of external financing for nfcs comprising bank lending debt issuance in the market and equity finance stood at 4 6 this was 9 basis points higher than in april when the cost of financing series was at its historical low but still very favourable by the end of november the overall cost of financing is estimated to have remained broadly unchanged from september this reflects a slightly lower cost of equity which was compensated for by a marginally higher cost of market based debt the lower estimated cost of equity was mostly driven by a decline in equity risk premia in turn supported by an improvement in global risk sentiment meanwhile the slight increase in the cost of market based debt was due to an increase in risk free rates while corporate bond spreads declined over the same period fiscal developments the euro area fiscal deficit is expected to increase steadily during the years 2019 21 on account of lower primary surpluses the decline in the primary balance reflects mainly a projected expansionary fiscal stance which provides support to economic activity the euro area government debt to gdp ratio is expected to remain on a downward path owing to a favourable interest rate growth differential and a positive even if declining primary balance however debt levels in a number of countries remain high in these countries governments need to pursue prudent policies and meet structural balance targets which will help create the conditions that will allow automatic stabilisers to operate freely in view of the weakened economic outlook governments with fiscal space should be ready to act in an effective and timely manner the euro area general government budget balance is projected to decline steadily during 2019 21 and to stabilise in 2022 based on the december 2019 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections the general government deficit ratio for the euro area is expected to have increased from 0 5 of gdp in 2018 to 0 7 of gdp in 2019 the deficit is projected to continue increasing in 2020 and 2021 and to stabilise thereafter at 1 1 of gdp see chart 24 the decline in the budget balance in 2019 21 stems mainly from a lower cyclically adjusted primary balance this is partly compensated by lower interest expenditure while the cyclical component remains largely unchanged over the projection horizon chart 24 budget balance and its components percentage of gdp sources ecb and december 2019 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections note the data refer to the aggregate general government sector of the euro area the euro area fiscal outlook for 2020 21 implies a somewhat more supportive fiscal policy than in the september 2019 ecb staff projections after a slight upward revision in 2019 the lower budget balance in 2020 and 2021 reflects additional fiscal loosening while the cyclical component and the interest payment projections remain broadly unchanged the aggregate fiscal stance for the euro area is assessed to be expansionary in 2019 21 and broadly neutral in 2022 the fiscal stance is estimated to loosen in 2019 and projected to remain expansionary in the years 2020 21 providing support to economic activity this is mostly on account of cuts in direct taxes in france and the netherlands higher transfers and public investment in italy and germany and higher government consumption in germany the netherlands and spain in 2022 the fiscal stance is projected to be broadly neutral with some limited further direct tax cuts in france and additional expenditure in germany and spain the euro area aggregate public debt to gdp ratio is projected to remain on a downward path according to the december 2019 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections the aggregate general government debt to gdp ratio in the euro area is expected to decline from 85 8 of gdp in 2018 to 81 1 of gdp in 2022 this reduction is supported by a favourable interest rate growth differential and primary surpluses that are however diminishing see chart 25 compared with the september projections the debt ratio is projected to be on a slightly higher path owing to upward revisions to historical data 0 5 of gdp in 2018 lower projected primary surpluses and less favourable interest rate growth differentials in 2020 21 chart 25 drivers of change in public debt percentage points of gdp sources ecb and december

countries it will continue to significantly exceed the reference value of 60 of gdp in some of them in those countries where government debt remains high governments need to pursue prudent policies and meet structural balance targets which will create the conditions for automatic stabilisers to operate freely governments with fiscal space should be ready to act in an effective and timely manner in view of the weakening economic outlook and the continued prominence of downside risks at the same time all countries should intensify their efforts to achieve a more growth friendly composition of public finances boxes the effects of tariff hikes in a world of global value chains prepared by philipp meinen in the context of the trade conflict between the united states and china global value chains gvcs are a potential factor amplifying the impact of higher tariffs on economic activity raising tariffs in a globalised world with international supply chains can have significant negative repercussions on economic activity in general global sourcing by firms implies that higher tariffs usually imposed to protect a domestic industry can lead to higher input costs for domestic producers in addition the effects of higher tariffs may be magnified by gvcs especially in the case of multistage production processes where goods move in a sequential manner from upstream to downstream with value added at each stage against this background this box provides some evidence of the adverse effects of tariffs on economic activity in the context of global sourcing and gvcs market reaction to the two tier system prepared by luca baldo cristina coutinho and nick ligthart on 30 october 2019 the ecb implemented a two tier system under which a portion of credit institutions excess liquidity holdings with the eurosystem are exempt from remuneration at negative rates the two tier system applies to excess liquidity held by banks in current accounts with the eurosystem and not to holdings

encompasses the substantial package of monetary policy measures adopted by the governing council on 12 september 2019 the package consists of five elements i a reduction in the interest rate on the deposit facility from 0 40 to 0 50 effective from 18 september while keeping the interest rates on the main refinancing operations mros and the marginal lending facility unchanged at 0 00 and 0 25

average eonia was also changed to calculate eonia by applying a fixed spread of 8 5 basis points to the str indicators of labour market conditions in the euro area prepared by vasco botelho and antónio dias da silva this box presents two complementary tools for assessing the performance of the labour market in the euro area the first is a visualisation tool in the form of a spider chart that displays 18 variables characterising the current euro area labour market conditions the second applies a principal component analysis to the variables displayed on the spider chart this approach summarises the available information on euro area labour market conditions in two synthetic indicators level of activity and labour market momentum the indicator for the level of activity compares developments in the labour market over time while the indicator for the labour market momentum assesses the rate of change in the performance of the labour market the analysis presented is for the euro area as a whole and does not fully show cross country labour market heterogeneity recent developments in social security contributions and minimum wages in the euro area prepared by ferdinand dreher omiros kouvavas and gerrit koester the behaviour of labour costs can be significantly affected by country specific changes in social security contributions and minimum wages an awareness of the nature and magnitude of such factors is important when assessing the strength of wage growth and its implications for producer and consumer price inflation this box examines how these two factors have affected aggregate euro area wage growth export activities of euro area smes insights from the survey on the access to finance of enterprises safe prepared by katarzyna bańkowska annalisa ferrando and juan angel garcia this box reports the responses to an ad hoc question in the latest round of the survey on access to finance of enterprises safe regarding the export activities of small and medium sized enterprises smes it has two aims first it provides an overview of the export activities of euro area smes both within and outside the euro area and second it explores the main characteristics of exporting smes and focuses on the analysis of some financial dimensions that are relevant to the decision to export as derived from the survey responses the review of draft budgetary plans for 2020 some implications for a reform of fiscal governance prepared by stephan haroutunian sebastian hauptmeier and nadine leiner killinger on 21 november 2019 the european commission released its opinions on the draft budgetary plans of euro area governments for 2020 together with an analysis of the budgetary situation in the euro area as a whole each opinion includes an assessment of the compliance of the relevant plan with the stability and growth pact sgp based on the commission s 2019 autumn economic forecast this review exercise also assesses whether countries have incorporated into their plans the country specific recommendations for fiscal policies that were addressed to them under the 2019 european semester as adopted by the economic and financial affairs council on 9 july 2019 the recommendations call on countries with high ratios of government debt to gdp to aim for a sufficiently fast reduction of these ratios some countries with room for budgetary manoeuvre are recommended to make use of this room including for achieving an upward trend in government investment the review of the draft budgetary plans identifies weaknesses in the follow up to the recommendations it is important that such shortcomings be addressed inter alia in the commission s forthcoming review of the six pack and two pack regulations which were implemented in 2011 and 2013 respectively in the aim of strengthening fiscal governance articles what does the bank lending survey tell us about credit conditions for euro area firms prepared by lorenzo burlon maria dimou anna camilla drahonsky and petra köhler ulbrich this article examines bank lending conditions for euro area non financial corporations nfcs making use of the wealth of soft information available in the euro area bank lending survey bls since its inception in 2003 one relevant question in this context is whether the tightening of the bank loan supply during the financial and sovereign debt crises has been offset by the easing of bank lending conditions for loans to nfcs since 2014 the article illustrates that the easing over this period has come mainly through a substantial loosening of the actual terms and conditions applied by banks to new loans to firms of average credit quality while the credit standards that banks have established for their loan approval decisions have eased by less the article also draws on the responses of individual banks to examine the differences in bank lending conditions for nfc loans over time and across bank business models this analysis reveals that the change in credit conditions of banks with business models more reliant on stable funding sources such as deposits is more muted in short it looks at additional aspects that enhance the regular assessment of bank lending conditions faced by firms based on the euro area bls the effects of changes in the composition of employment on euro area wage growth prepared by omiros kouvavas friderike kuik gerrit koester and christiane nickel until recently wage growth in the euro area has been low and under predicted looking at the period 2013 17 this weakness can be explained to a large extent by the factors traditionally captured in a phillips curve analysis such as economic slack and inflation expectations slack in the labour market can be measured by a broad range of different indicators which include narrow indicators e g the unemployment rate or more unconventional measures such as the broad unemployment rate the latter also includes euro area working age population marginally attached to the labour force i e those members of the labour force categorised as inactive but still competing albeit less actively in the labour market in general it seems that broader measures of labour underutilisation brought some marginal gains in explaining the subdued wage growth observed in the euro area over the period 2013 17 however the factors traditionally included in a phillips curve analysis do not paint the full picture the performance of the eurosystem ecb staff macroeconomic projections since the financial crisis prepared by kyriacos lambrias and adrian page this article evaluates the performance of the eurosystem ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area in the context of the elevated macroeconomic volatility and uncertainty that has prevailed since the financial crisis it finds that there has been considerable variability in projection errors over time with regard to real gdp growth projections errors that were substantial during the sovereign debt crisis have become more limited in recent years as for headline inflation unexpected fluctuations in oil prices which in the staff macroeconomic projections are assumed to follow the path of oil price futures played a dominant role in explaining the errors as was the case during the pre crisis years on the other hand hicp inflation excluding energy and food has been persistently overprojected since 2013 while these projection errors can also partly be attributed to errors in the conditioning technical assumptions other factors such as modelling errors changes in economic relationships or judgement have also played a key role at different points in time the forecast performance of the eurosystem ecb staff macroeconomic projections has been broadly similar to that of other international institutions and of private sector forecasters suggesting that projection errors have been mainly driven by common elements these may include economic shocks unforeseeable to any forecaster and developments that have become more prominent since the financial crisis including among other things structural reforms changes in the relationship between slack and prices globalisation and digitalisation the article is structured as follows section 1 explains how the staff macroeconomic projections are constructed compiled section 2 provides an overview of the errors made in projecting real gdp and hicp inflation since 2010 section 3 reviews some of the sources of the errors and section 4 provides a comparison with the forecasting performance of other institutions and private sector forecasters statistics
published friday 27 december 2019 print disqus daniel r amerman cfa on august 27th 2019 in an editorial published in bloomberg william dudley the former president of the federal reserve bank of new york did what had previously been considered unthinkable the foundation premise of the federal reserve is that it is supposed to be completely nonpartisan insulated from all political considerations however dudley wrote that donald trump was a threat to the federal reserve and the nation and urged fed officials to make decisions that would take into account the need to keep trump from being reelected the freezing up of the repurchase agreement repo market had nearly collapsed the u s financial system as one part of the financial crisis of 2008 however the market had enjoyed 11 years of relative calm since then three weeks after dudley s editorial during the week of september 16th 2019 the repo market returned to crisis mode and was likely saved only by emergency interventions on the part of the federal reserve a contributing factor was some major mistakes that were made by career officials at the new york fed dudley s former staff if the current related crises in the repurchase agreement market and with the funding of the national debt continue and get worse which is far from certain at this time crossing over into the wider markets interest rates and the economy it could become one of the defining political events of our lifetimes if the economy is in recession and the markets have crashed at the time of the november 2020 election then control of not only the presidency but likely the senate as well would be delivered to the democratic party this would give the democrats simultaneous control of the house senate and presidency during a time of financial emergency with a claim to a mandate which could very rapidly lead to some of the biggest political tax and economic changes of our lifetimes did a few career staff at the new york fed join the resistance and from the inside attempt a decisive strike to prevent donald trump from being reelected 3 weeks after being publicly called upon by their former boss to do so i am not going to attempt a definitive answer in this analysis as it likely can t be known with certainty by anyone except the insiders who were involved instead i will explore something that is little understood by the general public which is the extraordinary financial pressures that have created a situation where a few staff mistakes whether accidental or intentional could indeed change the economy the election and the values of everyone s retirement accounts and homes i will explore the sequence of what has been happening some interesting coincidences what is at stake and what the financial implications could be for individuals throughout i will always take two possibilities into account accidental mistakes versus deliberate intentions when the reader has finished this analysis you will have the information to make your own determination about which of those two you believe to be the more likely more details on the current crisis can be found in my analysis linked here the fed almost lost control of interest rates in a critical market and has since then relied on monetary creation just creating money effectively out of the nothingness though the actual process is much more complex to fund about 90 of u s government spending at very low interest rates and to thereby hold the economy stock and housing markets together the crisis has been escalating and the fed s emergency maneuvers have now reached the somewhat surreal point where up to 634 billion in new money will be created by the end of 2019 to prevent a potential deepening of this crisis that now threatens the financial system as explored in the analysis linked here i ve been analyzing and writing about related matters for years now and the speed with which this came up out of nowhere is almost surreal for comparison the total physical money outstanding in the united states as of january of 2008 before the financial crisis of that year was only 758 billion and the total assets of the federal reserve were less than 900 billion two valid explanations one of the issues with understanding what has been happening is that the rapid growth in the national debt has created so much pressure on the system that there are two perfectly valid explanations for what has been happening on the one hand there is the saying never ascribe to malice what can be explained by incompetence there is an enormous pressure on a very complex system and it grows every week month and year with the growth in the national debt we are in unchartered territory people make mistakes particularly with complex systems under enormous pressure and there is not one part of what has happened that can t be legitimately explained as an accident or well intended action one could even say that such an accident was almost inevitable at some point on the other hand what should be wildly speculative conspiracy theory isn t former new york fed president william dudley did quite publicly issue the provocative and unprecedented call for fed officials to prevent the reelection of trump that he did 3 weeks before the mistakes by his former staff helped to create a major crisis out of nowhere indeed as we will explore later in this analysis if the senior career staff executing monetary policy and understanding that complex system wanted to bring that system and the economy down from the inside without the knowledge and consent of the current federal reserve presidents and governors then three of the most critical places to strike are three places where critical operational mistakes were made during the week of september 16th in particular that is of course not definitive but it is one part of a series of interesting coincidences what both alternatives have in common is that neither one of them should exist in a normal healthy economy and financial system execution errors by senior staff should be of minor and fleeting consequence the big decisions are made by the federal open market committee and if there is a screw up at the staff level it could maybe lead to some issues for a week or even a month but there shouldn t be any lasting impact on the economy retirement account values home values or a presidential election the idea that career staffers could secretly do something that could bring down a robustly healthy economy or determine an election should be ludicrous under normal circumstances the underlying problem is that the fed s complex system for enabling the rapid growth of the national debt while keeping interest rates very low is under increasingly acute pressure as the debt grows and this introduces an element of fragility to the financial system and the economy that shouldn t be there it is this fragility that sets up this deeply abnormal situation where staff level mistakes whether accidental or intentional could actually materially change the direction of the markets and economy and thereby potentially determine the results of a presidential election it is this fragility that is the true cost of the 23 trillion national debt for the average american particularly when it comes to the currently elevated values of their retirement accounts and homes the rapid growth in the national debt is not some theoretical or purely political issue and the danger isn t just some potential default or bout of hyperinflation off in the distant future right now the federal reserve is on a weekly basis effectively creating 90 of the money to fund the government s deficit spending in the emergency attempt to contain crisis and if it fails the value of the retirement accounts and homes of the nation could be in grave peril within the coming year and even if the fed succeeds this time around the problem will still be there the pressure will continue to grow and the system will grow ever more fragile so long as the national debt continues to soar this analysis is part of a series of related analyses which support a book that is in the process of being written some key chapters from the book and an overview of the series are linked here a series of events 1 william dudley was president of the federal reserve bank of new york from january 27th 2009 through june 18th 2018 dudley was appointed by president obama in his first week in office which would seem to indicate that this was considered a politically vital appointment it should be noted that while there are twelve regional federal reserve banks they are not equal in their powers because the new york fed implements open market operations while regulating wall street itself it has a disproportionate degree of power and the president of the new york fed is widely considered the second most powerful person in the federal reserve after only the chairman 2 on august 27th 2019 dudley wrote an editorial in bloomberg link below saying that for the good of the nation the federal reserve should refuse to enable president trump or try to prevent the damage from the trade war from harming the economy he explicitly called for the fed to make decisions on a political basis saying that being apolitical was now untenable i understand and support fed officials desire to remain apolitical but trump s ongoing attacks on powell and on the institution have made that untenable dudley closed his opinion piece with the extraordinary paragraph below which seems to say that trump is a threat to the u s global economy and therefore the correct monetary policy for fed officials is for the federal reserve to treat the possibility of trump s reelection as a threat and to consider how their decisions will affect the political outcome in 2020 there s even an argument that the election itself falls within the fed s purview after all trump s reelection arguably presents a threat to the u s and global economy to the fed s independence and its ability to achieve its employment and inflation objectives if the goal of monetary policy is to achieve the best long term economic outcome then fed officials should consider how their decisions will affect the political outcome in 2020 note that dudley didn t reference the federal reserve governors or presidents taking formal action but simply for fed officials to take this into account when making decisions 3 staff at the federal reserve made a major mistake that was unprecedented in the post 2008 era they were well aware that the treasury planned to pull out more than 100 billion in cash from the financial system in a day on monday september 16th which would reduce the liquidity in the system however they thought that there was 200 to 300 billion in extra liquidity in the system per morgan stanley via the wall street journal so they took no precautions 4 on september 16th 17th about 3 weeks after dudley s advice to fed officials it turned out that a major mistake had been made there was not plenty of excess liquidity to handle the payments to the treasury and in the repo market there was a shortage of funds available on september 17th rates spiked upwards from around 2 up to as high as little below 10 very briefly creating an emergency situation 5 the initial attempt to create liquidity failed as a result of a staff mistake an execution error at the new york fed and repo loans had to be withdrawn and then reoffered later that day adding to the market turmoil 6 there were a series of oversubscriptions in the following weeks as the fed failed to provide sufficient liquidity to the market and the cash they injected into the markets rose from 75 billion up to over 200 billion 7 in october the federal reserve reversed course and began purchasing 60 billion per month in short term treasury obligations with created money thereby freeing the private market from doing so and helping to keep excess cash in the system 8 on december 12th the fed announced plans to offer up to 415 billion in repo lending to get the banking system through the end of the year in combination with treasury obligation purchases this took the total up to about 634 billion in commitments for funding all using created money and all either directly or indirectly funding the growth in the national debt 9 in a separate and unusual move on december 12th 2019 the federal reserve bank of new york announced major senior management changes in their markets and financial services groups simultaneously naming three new executive vice presidents to head key departments that actually implement financial and monetary operations the hack the potential damage the above may sound a bit on the technical side for many people and they may not see the implications for their own lives we live in a complex world full of complex technology complex systems and complex organizations because no one can understand everything we must place trust in things that we don t fully understand and this very much applies to the federal reserve the economy the national debt the value of retirement accounts the value of homes and even the very nature and value of money itself to understand how a few technical mistakes at the new york fed could indeed change all of our lives we need to understand several interrelated issues we have had very low interest rates for a number of years now and this is particularly true of the time since the financial crisis of 2008 for seven years thereafter the federal reserve forced zero percent interest rates on the nation in the attempt to contain the damage and get the economy going again interest rates rose a little bit but have consistently been far below historic averages and have rapidly been forced back down by 0 75 since july in the attempt to prevent a recession the above graph shows long term asset prices and valuations and how the averages since 2000 are far higher than in previous decades inflation adjusted home prices for comparable homes are up by 32 the price that investors pay for each dollar of corporate earnings is up by 49 and the price for a 10 year bond is up by 34 the graph just puts numbers on what most people are already quite well aware of we currently have the highest home and stock prices in history if we take stock prices bond prices and real estate prices then we also get most of the value of most retirement accounts what is understood by professionals in the area but less so by the general public is that the very low interest rates and the very high asset prices are two sides of the same coin the graphs above are from chapter one link here from a free book that i have been writing and what the book explores in much greater detail than can be covered in this one analysis is how the federal reserve forcing interest rates to record lows has led to the highest retirement account values and home prices that the nation has seen the flip side of this relationship is that if interest rates should rise substantially then home prices and retirement account values should plummet and if interest rates stay higher then there is no particular reason to expect a recovery so a homeowner could be underwater for many years with a house worth less than they paid for it and a retirement account investor could spend a decade in retirement without equity prices recovering to where they had been in inflation adjusted terms what could push up interest rates we have a rather enormous problem with the national debt which has recently passed 23 trillion and is now larger than the total u s economy that is borrowed money which has to come from somewhere and interest payments have to be made on that debt as i have written about extensively in the past heavily indebted nations require very low interest rates and the federal reserve creating very low interest rates has been the critical enabler that has allowed the u s national debt to grow as fast and as large as it has the dangerous part for the economy retirement accounts and home values is not so much the outstanding national debt but the deficits the weekly monthly and annual borrowing that the federal government is doing to cover spending that is above tax collections this is not at all theoretical but is real cash at the time the government spends it every bit as real as the money in your retirement account or checking account indeed if you are a federal government employee or if your employer relies on dollars from the federal government to pay you then your standard of living is to a large part supported by the federal government pulling the cash out of the financial system to make your paycheck there is a fantastic degree of pressure that is building when it comes to the conflict between the very low interest rates that retirement account values home values and the affordability of the national debt are all dependent upon and what can be seen in the graph above of the official deficit projections from the congressional budget office we just had a trillion dollar deficit for the last year and they are projected to continue for each and every year of the next ten years all that cash has to come out of the financial system and ultimately the u s economy unless the debt is being monetized i e being paid with created money as has recently been the case in a market based financial system steadily higher interest rates should have to be paid which traditionally then acts a brake on deficit spending and the growth of the national debt however those materially higher interest rates would also crash the stock bond and housing markets while sending the economy into a potentially deep recession what stands between the higher interest rates that a federal government voraciously sucking cash out of the system should trigger and the very low interest rates that the economy and markets currently depend upon is the federal reserve standing in the middle with its vast but little understood powers in a complex process that involves creating trillions of dollars of new money quantitative easing to keep interest rates low asset prices high the economy holding together and a rapidly expanding national debt funded at interest rates far lower than what rational investors would accept in a free market most importantly pressure is created at a rapid rate with the rapid growth in the national debt this can be thought of as a sort of ratcheting mechanism every week for the next ten years on average the federal government plans to pull another 20 billion in real cash out of the financial system without paying a free market interest rate which means that investors have to be forced to effectively fund the national debt at lower rates than they what they want this is an unnatural process and with each weekly ratchet the difference between what works for the government and what works for investors grows and so does the pressure on the complex systems deployed by the fed that maintains an artificial stability this process has been underway for many years and an extraordinary degree of pressure has already built up even as the pressure continues to build with each year of trillion dollar deficits as the pressure has built the chances for a mistake being made that would cause the fed to lose control and the markets to crash has steadily built as will as the pressure builds the size of the needed mistake that would crash the markets steadily grows a bit smaller each month and each year as the margin for error steadily shrinks as the pressure builds if we assume what is supposed to be unthinkable but is in fact a matter of publicly stated intent and desire the less it would take for an insider who knows how the mechanism works and is in a place to do something about it to subtly but deliberately sabotage the very complex mechanism in a way that could likely never be proven or understood at all by the average voter three pins that resist the pressure hold everything together when you come right down to it what holds everything together right now underneath all the complexity of the ratcheting system is three fairly basic and closely related things very low interest rates confidence that the markets are running smoothly and the market s confidence that the federal reserve has the situation completely under control should interest rates soar then a trap door opens up and the current very elevated values of the nation s stocks bonds retirement accounts and homes could all plunge downwards should the markets lose confidence in the federal reserve s ability to maintain both financial stability and very low interest rates then the way markets work is that they price in today what their expectations are for the future and if confidence is lost on a widespread basis that trap door can open up almost instantly in a matter of hours days or weeks a related but distinct problem with confidence is the lack of fear among market participants if fear gets started then it becomes self fulfilling and the fear of crisis causes an actual crisis this can particularly be a problem with liquidity the free cash floating around the system in search of an overnight home and it has been the most dangerous part of many previous crises for months and years there is lots of extra money floating around as lenders are eager to lend then one day something happens a number of lenders get nervous at the same time and they each decide to get cautious and stop lending this was covered in more detail in chapter 18 link here but a number of borrowers who were depending on the availability of the loans and had invested the money they had borrowed all of a sudden find as a group that they are hundreds of billions of dollars short of the money they need to repay their overnight loans which are due later that same day if they don t get the money they will default only nobody is willing to lend it to them bam interest rates spike upwards as they frantically seek cash instant crisis then seeing an actual crisis in process the lenders get even more nervous lend even less and the crisis gets still worse in some ways this could be likened to a form of a bank run the classic source of banking system collapse money is borrowed from depositors and invested too many people get nervous and demand their money back at the same time enough money isn t there because it has been invested the bank fails and the doors of a previously healthy bank are locked that same day a version of this when the repo market locked up in 2008 was one of the key risks that nearly brought down the entire financial system and the federal reserve had to create over 400 billion in a week to save the system in the first use of quantitative easing in the united states for the next eleven years while there were some interesting spots for the professionals in the market there were no emergencies in the repo market and the fed didn t have to intervene then the week of september 16th 2019 something happened the lenders fled borrowers were in crisis and the federal reserve would create 50 billion then 75 billion then 200 billion and then by december of 2019 announced a willingness to create up to 415 billion in new money to lend it out in the repo market thereby indirectly funding the growth of the u s national debt and also preventing a potential deep crisis in the financial system so if we take the hypothetical case of someone who really truly understands this complex system and its weaknesses such as dudley and his former staffers and pose the question how to bring it down with the least effort and in a way that can never be proven then a particularly effective answer would be a swift tap tap directed against two of the vital pins that hold the whole complex mechanism together the very low interest rates and the market s confidence that the federal reserve has the situation completely under control interestingly enough the mistakes first manifested themselves as an enormous spike upwards in interest rates from under 2 to almost 10 ver briefly in the systemically important repurchase agreement market and a series of awkward stumbles in execution that would make a person question whether the federal reserve had the situation under control at all tap tap going straight at two of the most important pins that were holding all the pressure back or at least the two of the most important pins that could be accessed by senior staffers without the approval of the federal reserve bank presidents and board of governors and while maintaining plausible deniability the most important question however is the origins of something happened this much is clear a major mistake was made by the fed it got the numbers spectacularly wrong on the amount of excess liquidity in the system and when the treasury department took out 100 billion in cash to fund government spending a crisis was set off this crisis created the fear loop lenders pulled back borrowers needed help the situation got worse and the fed kept increasing its interventions hopefully the fed will reestablish control but as of late december the numbers were still climbing as the federal reserve struggles to get the situation under control it has at least temporarily replaced its former complex and subtle system for making sure the deficits could be funded without raising interest rates with a form of blunt force as shown in the graph repeated above the federal reserve is effectively just creating the money to fund the government deficits week by week just taking the very low interest rates for itself and not attempting to make private investors do that in order to avoid risking failure indeed what the fed is doing by throwing so much newly created money at the markets up to 634 billion in 16 weeks is trying to make sure that no matter how fast the treasury is pulling cash out of the system there will be enough new free cash floating around that interest rates do not spike upwards so does the striking of the two pins and the major mistake on the amount of liquidity in the system mean that this is necessarily deliberate absolutely not as discussed in the beginning of this analysis this can all be explained on an innocent basis there is enormous pressure and complexity this is unchartered territory people screw up all the time and the staff at the new york fed could have been completely blindsided by the blowup of the repo market and could have then found themselves over their heads unable to keep up with events as they rapidly developed that said if someone who actually understood how this very complex system works were to be writing a novel about it or making an action plan striking those two weak spots while setting a fear based crisis in motion would be the absolutely perfect way to hit a system that was under great pressure so that what still might or might not become an economic crisis would happen before the 2020 election instead of after these would also be the exact places to strike if the plot or the plan required senior career staff to strike the blows with plausible deniability and without the knowledge or consent of the current political appointees at the federal reserve who are supposed to control such matters the theory that underlies the federal reserve and our economic system is that because the president of the federal reserve bank of new york is in charge of executing monetary policy something which can change the economy and elections that person is supposed to be scrupulously nonpartisan entirely above the fray acting only for the good of the entire nation for william dudley to publicly destroy that mantle of nonpartisanship and publish via bloomberg a call for fed officials to make decisions to affect the 2020 election with the goal of preventing the reelection of trump and then a mere three weeks later after eleven years of relative calm in the repo markets with nothing like this happening have his own former senior career staff make serious mistaken decisions that then triggered a massive repo market crisis is an astonishing coincidence now that doesn t prove that it isn t a coincidence but the timing is remarkable the perfect political kill shot so why would a prominent but clearly partisan economist such as william dudley advocate for fed officials to use their power in a way that could change the election results the reason is that it could be a perfect political kill shot something that could not only guarantee who wins in 2020 but that could change american politics for a generation or more trump is running for reelection primarily on the strength of the economy and the markets if the average voter in november of 2020 is looking at a raging national recession widespread unemployment devastating damage to their retirement accounts and having lost a big chunk of their net worth with the plunge in home prices how is that likely to impact the election trump is only the starting point the issue is that very few people fully understand what is discussed in this analysis oh economists like william dudley understand it perfectly well and what the consequences would be for the nation but the average person not so much so let s say this or another sophisticated form of economic sabotage from the inside were to work the average person would be facing devastating economic losses and possibly unemployment as well they wouldn t actually know anything about where any of this came from but they would know it was real they would know it was awful and life changing and wherever they turned they would be continually told who did it to them if i might be allowed to hypothesize that the media would not be strictly neutral but might actually have a preference as to who is president then the average person would be told 24 7 via television newspapers and social media just who is responsible for their pain and the destruction of their dreams and it wouldn t just be trump but the senators and representatives who supported him as well as his supporters in general in such a circumstance with so much economic pain and so much agreement as to the source then something much bigger than just beating trump becomes not only possible but downright likely control of the presidency the senate and the house in a time of national economic emergency and with the claim of a mandate from the people for massive change a series of radical economic tax and political changes like the nation has never seen could happen in months things that might seem improbable right now could become quite possible in a time of national emergency a mandate and a lack of checks and balances what makes it the perfect political kill shot is that almost nobody would ever know particularly if control over the narrative is maintained most of the people whose lives employment financial security and standard of living were severely harmed by the deliberate sabotage would go to their graves blaming the wrong side and being absolutely convinced that the source of their personal pain was donald trump again does the potential outcome prove that there was a deliberate strategy to make it happen no that can t be proven from this information and it remains true that everything can be explained by the combination of complexity pressure and normal human errors however if someone were writing a novel or action plan about how to use the little understood and supposedly nonpartisan federal reserve to take down a sitting president who is running based on a thriving economy this would be a potentially quite effective means of doing so it would be far more reliable than impeachment when it comes to not just to removing trump but to taking the senate as well with the accompanying vast potential increase in power when the presidency senate and house are all controlled at the same time whether the source is accidental or intentional the price for the nation would be enormous either way the consequences of what has been explored herein could be a life defining event particularly for retirees and for those who are near to retirement and this would apply regardless of their political affiliation the personal but universal price for a nation there are very good reasons why the federal reserve is supposed to in theory be completely nonpartisan and above politics deliberately tilting the economy into a recession in a way that voters would not understand and thereby determining the results of a presidential election is arguably always within the capabilities of the federal reserve although it should be much harder to do than it would be in our current circumstances of fragility and should require the coordinated efforts of a majority of the voting members of the federal open market committee fomc and not just a few senior staffers the issue with the weaponization of the federal reserve to win elections is that while it may have a political appeal to the party seeking power the costs to the nation as a whole are enormous and they are bipartisan a recession and potential market crash reaches out and hits everybody it can hurt many millions of people some of them quite badly and it does not discriminate on the basis of political affiliation i do believe that there are people in the world who if they had the power to do so would without hesitation trigger a recession and crash the markets if the bad people of the other side would be smashed into the ground and their side would come into power with overwhelming control of the powers of the government if they thought about the cost to the average person at all they might say that a year of recession and a couple of down years in the markets would be totally worth it and for the good of the nation so long as the awful people are thrown out and the correct thinking people take control based on his editorial this seems to be dudley s rationale even though he has to be fully aware of the costs however the risk is far more dangerous than an average recession and bear market specifically because of the very factors that have created the fragility that makes some minor issues how the fed conducts operations on a given day or in a given week able to potentially influence elections one source of extraordinary risk is what was previously explored our current very low level of interest rates and the resulting very elevated asset prices for stocks bonds and homes a fall from historically elevated asset prices is not a normal downturn or bear market instead the damage could be far worse it could be very long lasting and it could change many millions of lives and standards of living as an illustration in the analysis linked here i set up a hypothetical investor with a round number million dollar net worth 800 000 in retirement accounts with a 75 25 stock bond allocation and a 500 000 house with a 300 000 mortgage the idea behind the even 1 million was to make it very easy to multiply and adapt for one s own situation if we returned merely to long term averages then the losses from today s very high asset prices are shown above in step 2 this would include about 200 000 in stock losses 50 000 in bond losses 120 000 in home losses and a total loss in net worth of 370 000 for someone with 500 000 in assets it might be a 185 000 loss when we start with today s record or near record stock bond and home prices as shown in step 1 subtract the losses associated with a mere regression to the mean or return to average as shown in step 2 then we get what is shown in step 3 above what a round number net worth of 1 million today would be worth if we merely had average valuations in inflation adjusted terms it would be down to about 630 000 let me suggest that if someone was planning on supporting themselves for potentially decades in retirement based on their retirement accounts and home values today then a mere return to average could be quite life changing when it comes to their annual standard of living in retirement as well as their financial security when it comes to handling unexpected expenses or health events it should also be noted that what is shown above is in no way a worst case scenario because about half of long term history is of prices that are below the long term averages so if a crisis were to hit our current historically high asset prices then they might go well below what is shown above and then hopefully recover over time if the eventual recovery involved a return to long term average interest rates as well as to long term average valuations for stock pe ratios bond prices and inflation adjusted home prices then the result would be step 3 above again the fundamental conflicts and dangers are here anyway the question is if what is underway now does become a full blown crisis that spreads into the stock and housing markets as well as the economy itself it may not hopefully it will not and the most interesting part of all as explored in chapter one and throughout the rest of the book that i m currently still writing is that there is a very good chance that if the fed reestablishes full control it will use still lower interest rates to achieve economic stability and if that happens those still lower interest rates in a stable economy could create still higher stock prices than today possibly materially so and the same is true for home prices the nation does not have elevated stock and home prices in spite of the unnaturally low interest rates that the federal reserve imposed to contain the financial crisis of 2008 but specifically because of those artificially low interest rates we have never had anything close to average interest rates since 2008 and asset prices that are well above historic averages are the direct result counterintuitive as it may seem the containment of the problems with the national debt could lead to still higher stock and home prices for a while however that would just further increase the fundamental pressure the clash between an even larger national debt and even lower interest rates this would make the system ever more fragile and the stability of the value of retirement accounts and homes ever more fragile if that path is the path ahead then it would make much of the nation potentially very happy for a good while even happier than they are today until they weren t providing information not conclusions this is a very unusual analysis for me and i struggled a bit in terms of whether to write it and release it i m a financial analyst not a political analyst i am well aware that i have plenty of readers from both parties and i try to keep politics out of things once again i did not draw any firm conclusions there are some fascinating and troubling things going on but the only people who can know for sure are those insiders who participated in these events or have other insider knowledge the first reason for my deciding to release this analysis is that politics and human nature are ultimately the most likely sources of what could break down this complex system that is coming under ever increasing pressure and likely bring down today s highly elevated asset prices at least in inflation adjusted terms this is true regardless of the specifics of the source of what is in process right now there are limitations to that very complex process at least in its current form but i doubt that those theoretical limits are ever reached the bigger issue is that the larger the national debt gets the greater the pressure the more fragile the system becomes and the more vulnerable it becomes to international geopolitics international financial system risk domestic political risk and perhaps the biggest risk of all human error or possibly though hopefully not malfeasance or sabotage if someone sees something to be gained in terms of a great deal of wealth a great deal of political power or both hopefully the current crisis will be contained the economy will not crash and neither will stock or home prices but even if this desired outcome does happen the growth in the debt over the next year will make the system that much more fragile as will the growth in the national debt in the year after that the greater the fragility of this highly complex system the greater the exposure to political forces and human error and the greater the exposure of the economy and the value of everyone s retirement accounts and homes my second reason for deciding to release this information is that this is such a complicated and specialized area that relatively few people understand how the parts fit together in terms of how this could have been done if it was done how it could determine the election results and how it could end up being a determining factor when it comes to the standard of living in retirement that may in practice be experienced by many millions of people as the result of many years of study and research in closely related areas it happens that i do something that just kept coming back to me as i was wrestling with whether to prepare and release this analysis was that possessing this background professional knowledge was actually a quite separate thing from making the determination of what was believable or not when it comes to such things as motivations coincidences and how politics works in general it occurred to me that if i decided not to release then i would effectively be making the decision for others that none of those millions of people would have the information needed to make their own evaluations about something that could be one of the most important political and financial events of their lives that would be quite the presumption on my part maybe the better choice given just how important this might be was to just try to explain what i know and why it matters give two fair alternatives not draw any conclusions and then let people make their own evaluations so now you know the

rejected the request to print more money said rep sloh majority of the house members signed a resolution authorizing the executive to print l 4 billion conscience inspired boycott rep declined to confirm or deny reports that each of the signatories to the resolution received a signature fee of us 5 000 but defended his vote i boycotted because my conscience has not led me to printing additional banknotes in the absence of full accountability for the missing ld16 billion and the us 25 million mop up money the liberian people are smart they are watching the things we do with their money besides rep sloh crayton duncan unity party sinoe district 1 vicent willie independent grand bassa district no 4 thomas goshua unity party district no grand bassa county yekeh koluba independent district no 10 montserrado rastolyn suacoco dennis liberia transformation party district no 4 montserrado county larry yanquoi anc district no 8 nimba county richard nagbe koon unity party montserrado county district no 11 alex poure national union for democratic progress district no 1 river gee county richard koon unity party montserrado county district no 11 and dr george b samba independent district no 12 montserrado county late last week the cbl issued a statement assuring the public and its international partners that following the approval by the legislature authorizing the bank to print l 4 0 billion liberian dollars to ease the liquidity situation in the country the procurement process relating to the printing shipment and delivery of the money will be implemented in conformity with transparent accountable and credible procedures as well as in strict adherence to national laws internal regulations and acceptable professional practices and standards this has bolstered by the united states aid for international development statement thursday that it is partnering with the cbl in coordination with the government of liberia and international partners to sign off on a technical assistance program according to the statement the aim of the technical assistance program is to assist the cbl to more effectively perform its core functions of managing the liberian currency and creating the necessary monetary stability for broad based inclusive economic growth given liberia s current liquidity situation in which liberians are having difficulties acquiring sufficient liberian dollars ld and with many of the ld banknotes in circulation mutilated the central bank of liberia has determined that at least a limited amount of additional ld banknotes is needed to support the liberian banking system and its customers ordinary liberians who need to pay for school healthcare and other essentials while the cbl has been toeing the line on the issue explaining that the decision to print liberian dollar banknotes is in accordance with parts ii v of the central bank of liberia cbl act of 1999 skeptics are not sure many have been critical of the decision to print new money when the recommendations of both the usaid backed kroll and presidential investigative team report have not been carried out the cbl however says the provisions under which it is proceeding grants it upon approval by the national legislature to print and issue liberian dollar banknotes in the economy mutilated banknotes prompts new printing says cbl for liberia political observers say the lack of transparency and accountability in the voting process in the national legislature is allowing many elected officials to take their constituents for granted often making promises they can t keep to the detriment of those languishing at the bottom of the economic ladder looking to explain recent social media uproar regarding the photographs of plane bringing in money at the roberts international airport the cbl insists that the printing shipment and delivery of banknotes which are usually guided by standard procedures are normal operation of all central banks across the world the bank explains that the printing of liberian dollar banknotes has been triggered by the lingering liquidity squeeze in the financial sector potentially arising from the mismatch between fixed stock of liberian dollars in the economy over the last three years and the high liberian dollar liquidity demand this demand according to the cbl is also largely explained by the increasing volume of mutilated liberian dollar banknotes the introduction of a surrender policy on remittances of foreign exchange increased collections of duties taxes in liberian dollars other demand factors include the spiraling inflation that is fueling more need of spending in liberian dollars perennial lack of bank branches in few counties to mobilize deposits in liberian dollars and the demographic effects of newer age groups entering the labor force thus inducing demand for liberian dollars as a lender of resort of liberian dollar the cbl has the responsibility to ensure the smooth operations of the financial sector and effective implementation of monetary policy to support the economy at large with the aim of promoting macroeconomic stability the bank says ongoing reform will hopefully convince liberians that the upcoming process will be transparent and accountable the cbl reassures the public of its commitment to strengthening its internal processes as part of the much needed reform of the bank the cbl shall work with international audit experts with the objective of improving the cash control management and internal audit function of the bank as well as ensuring corrections of internal controls transparency lacking in tallying recording votes the cbl hopes that businesses and the liberian populace would be encouraged to be receptive to non cash means of payments for transactions the cbl believes that liquidity pressures can be eased with the general acceptability of electronic modes of payments such as mobile money and points of sale pos terminals the use of digital payments provides efficient benefits to the economy including economizing future cost of currency printing countering money laundering and terrorist financing strengthening efficiency of revenue mobilization and accelerating financial inclusion local and international investors are encouraged to bring their innovations to the fore by investing in financial digitization and the overall digitization of the liberian economy while many have embraced liberia s bourgeoning transitioning democracy the lack of transparency and accountability regarding how elected officials vote on key issues have been lacking frontpageafrica had to rely on information from the clerk s office to come up with the list of those who voted for or against the printing of new money a similar debate followed the decision by the legislature to impeach former associate justice kabineh j aneh a state of an equipment along with a public address system donated to the legislature in 2010 by the world bank and the national democratic institute in a bid to bolster transparency in the legislative branch and also allow the legislature to keep records of how its members voted on particular issues remains a lingering mystery a similar machine is used on the floor of the us congress where votes are compiled through the electronic voting machine by the house tally clerks under the direction of the clerk of the house in the senate floor votes are compiled through the senate legislative information system by the senate bill clerk under the direction of the secretary of the senate for liberia political observers say the lack of transparency and accountability in the voting process in the national legislature is allowing many elected officials to take their constituents for granted often making promises they can t keep to the detriment of those languishing at the bottom of the economic ladder
2x leveraged mreit etns have provided excellent returns the ubs etracs monthly pay 2x leveraged mortgage reit etn morl and later ubs etracs monthly pay 2xleveraged mortgage reit etn series b mrrl and credit suisse x links monthly pay 2x leveraged mortgage reit etn reml have been the primary instruments by which i have attempted to utilize my longer term macroeconomic interest rate outlook that rates would stay lower for longer than many were predicting from its inception on october 17 2012 through to december 24 2019 morl has had a total return of 139 59 assuming reinvestment of dividends that is an annualized return of 12 92 over that 7 19 year period the s p 500 spy had a total return of 154 06 also assuming reinvestment of dividends that is an annualized return of 13 85 over that 7 19 year period from its inception on july 13 2016 through to december 24 2019 reml has had a total return of 94 23 assuming reinvestment of dividends that is an annualized return of 21 22 over that 3 45 year period in contrast spy has had a respectable total return of 59 96 also assuming reinvestment of dividends that is an annualized return of 14 59 over that 3 45 year period from its inception on october 9 2015 through to december 24 2019 mrrl has had a total return of 121 65 assuming reinvestment of dividends that is an annualized return of 20 81 over that 4 21 year period in contrast spy had a respectable total return of 73 57 also assuming reinvestment of dividends that is an annualized return of 13 99 over that 4 21 year period mrrl is essentially an identical twin to morl reml is based on the ftse nareit all mortgage capped index of mreits that s the same index used by the ishares mortgage real estate capped etf rem as can be seen in the tables i and ii below the index that reml is based on is a slightly different index of mreits than that upon which mrrl and morl are based which is the mvisâ us mortgage reits index thus i have used reml as a somewhat interchangeable substitute for mrrl and morl i have also engaged in arbitrage between morl and either mrrl or reml when morl was trading significantly above its net indicative asset value i recommended morl the only 2x leveraged mreit etn in existence at that time in my first seeking alpha article federal reserve actually propping up interest rates what this means for mreits published june 21 2013 the reason for my view that interest rates would not increase as much as the consensus was based on the premise that the federal reserve was not artificially reducing interest rates as most believed but rather keeping rates higher than a free market in risk free securities would otherwise result in from june 21 2013 through to december 24 2019 morl has had a total return of 167 87 assuming reinvestment of dividends that is an annualized return of 16 33 over that 6 51 year period spy had a total return of 130 82 also assuming reinvestment of dividends that is an annualized return of 13 71 over that same 6 51 year period as described in my july 11 2013 seeking alpha article a depression with benefits the macro case for mreits a further macroeconomic rationale for investing in morl was based on the premise that government policies shifting the tax burden from the rich and onto the middle class result in much more funds being available for investment relative to productive uses for those investable funds that was another reason i concluded that interest rates would be relatively lower for longer than most market participants were predicting and i focused on securities with significant interest rate risk but not much credit risk what to do now with the 2x leveraged mreit etns holders and potential buyers of 2x leveraged mreit etns are more interested in what the future performance will be than what the past returns were additionally holders of morl have do decide what to do with regard to the ubs exchange offer on december 9 2019 ubs issued a press release parts of which are shown below ubs commences exchange offers for eight etracs etns ubs commences exchange offers for eight etracs etns december 9 2019 ubs ag announced today that it has commenced exchange offers exchange offers for eight etracs series a etns collectively the series a etns for corresponding etracs series b etns collectively the series b etns as set forth in table 1 below the full schedule of exchange dates and exchange offer settlement dates is listed in table 2 below ubs ag is offering holders of the series a etns the ability to voluntarily exchange their series a etns on a one for one basis for the corresponding series b etns which are intended to be economically identical each of the series a and series b etns subject to the exchange offers are currently listed on nyse arca each series b etn offered in the exchange offers is intended to provide the same economic exposure as the corresponding series a etn including identical underlying indices daily closing indicative values civs investor fees coupon amounts if applicable and payment formulas in each case as set forth in the prospectus and applicable annex related to the exchange offers dated december 9 2019 the prospectus the key difference between the series a etns and the series b etns is that ubs ag and ubs switzerland ag are each co obligors on all series a etns while ubs ag is the sole issuer and obligor on all series b etns ubs switzerland ag has no obligations with respect to the series b etns ubs ag is conducting the exchange offers in order to reduce the intercompany exposures of ubs switzerland ag to ubs ag in line with regulatory recovery and resolution guidance ubs ag has a contractual right to redeem all series a etns and within a few months after the final expiration date of the exchange offers ubs ag intends to exercise its contractual call right for any non tendered series a etns that were subject to the exchange offers following the completion of such redemptions no series a etns are expected to remain outstanding ubs has been advised by its tax counsel that holders that exchange their series a etns for series b etns should not recognize a gain or loss for u s federal income tax purposes as a result of the exchange holders should review the tax discussion set forth under the heading material federal u s income tax considerations in the prospectus related to the exchange offers dated december 9 2019 ubs is not providing tax advice to holders of series a etns that participate in the exchange and such holders should consult with their tax advisors regarding the tax treatment of the exchange for more information on the etns included in the exchange offers please see the prospectus related to the exchange offers dated december 9 2019 there are eight sequential exchange periods during which one can tender their old series a notes and receive the new series b notes at the end of that exchange period the final exchange period ends on may 1 2020 ubs ag had announced on november 11 2019 that it expects to exercise its contractual call right to redeem in full 13 etracs series a exchange traded notes within a few months following the final expiration of ubs ag s proposed exchange offers regarding the ubs exchange offer there are various categories of decisions that holders and potential buyers of ubs 2x leveraged mreit etns have to consider holders have to decide whether or not to tender their old series a notes and receive the new series b notes if they decide to tender then when to tender for me the most immediate decision is whether to buy old series a notes or the new series b notes when adding to my holdings the risks of not exchanging now seem fairly small liquidity in the old series a notes might decline however since they can always be redeemed in large amounts at net indicative asset value and will likely be called at net indicative asset value in 2020 the old series a notes should still trade very close to net indicative asset value for now my intention is to not make any decision regarding the exchange offer until close to the final expiration of ubs ag s exchange offers one consideration that should be considered is any fees that will be charged by your broker even though they have eliminated commissions on online transactions charles schwab told me that they would charge 39 as a tender fee on the ubs exchange offer as to buying additional notes i would now buy either old series a notes or the new series b notes depending on which is cheaper at the time the removal of ubs switzerland ag as a co obligor does not in my view impair the creditworthiness of the series b etracs etns as they are still obligations of the parent ubs ag in terms of arbitrage between the old and new series as described in my article sell morl buy mrrl until september 6 2018 morl and mrrl usually traded very close to each other and to their net indicative asset value which is identical for both the price relationship between morl and mrrl changed after september 6 2018 ubs then announced that it would no longer issue any new shares of morl since morl began trading then significantly higher than mrrl i said that those that own morl may want to take advantage of the historic spread and sell morl and use the proceeds to buy mrrl the spread has all but disappeared now however if either morl or mrrl were to trade higher than the other arbitrage between the old and new series could make sense the threshold spread required for such arbitrage is now lower for those accounts with zero commissions the impact of the zero commissions on the spreads involving 2x leveraged etns was discussed in the implications of the collapse in the morl mrrl spread the chart below shows the spread from the period after september 6 2018 through to december 24 2019 when the spread closed at a negative 08 the light blue shading shows where zero commissions began and the darker blue shows where the ubs press releases were announced morl mrrl zero commissions ubs press release while the saying never say never may apply it looks like the prospect of the old ubs series a etracs will be redeemed at net indicative asset value means that the spreads will disappear as both the old and new ubs series a and b etracs will trade very close to their net indicative asset values outlook for the 2x leveraged mreit etns i still believe that the macroeconomic conditions still favor mreits and especially the 2x mreit leveraged etns i have written about a portfolio where the most important constraint is to only include securities with current yields above 15 other constraints are the typical retail ira account restrictions which preclude the use of short selling margin borrowing most options strategies and futures contracts some brokerage firms also impose additional constraints on ira accounts i suspect that there are many individuals particularly those either partially or totally retired who either have somewhat similar constraints or they might possibly benefit from adopting them there is nothing magic about the 15 current yield threshold originally in 2001 it was a 10 current yield threshold it reached 30 in 2008 and 60 in march 2009 morl and later mrrl and reml have been the core instruments in my 15 current yield constrained portfolio these are the only 2x leveraged mreits high yield etns that i am aware of other than junk bonds and other securities issued by individual distressed entities in order to meet the 15 constraint my primary investment focus in the quest for 15 current yield has been and is on 2x leveraged high yield etns the current economic situation would seem to favor carry trades where most of the risk comes from the possibility that short term rates spike upwards at this point in time the possibility that short term rates spike upwards in the near term is extraordinarily low federal reserve officials have made it clear that it is highly unlikely that they will be raising their target short term rates anytime soon in business cycle terms even though the expansion is at a record length current conditions do not favor any tightening by the federal reserve unemployment is very low although there is some question about the data real gdp growth is running about 2 my view is that two opposing forces are contributing to the current economic conditions first is the harm to the world economy by the tariffs instigated by trump these are making almost everyone in the world poorer on balance some countries and some people are impacted more than others in america the weakness caused by trade restrictions that disrupt supply chains and raise consumer prices above what free markets would produce are offset by the stimulus provided by the trillion dollar federal budget deficits and relatively low interest rates the recent budget agreement that prevented a federal government shutdown assures that the deficits will exceed the trillion dollar level in the foreseeable future the trillion dollar federal budget deficits could be characterized as boosting private sector income and wealth today possibly at the expense of future generations additionally the rollback of environmental regulations could also be characterized as boosting private sector income and wealth today also possibly at the expense of future generations whatever one s view of the climate change issue clearly switching away from fossil fuels to alternatives makes almost everyone in the world poorer on balance an example is coal that provided 27 5 of america s electricity in 2018 about 60 000 people are employed in coal mining including both thermal and metallurgical wind and solar combined provided 8 of america s electricity in 2018 some claim that over a million people are now employed in wind and solar combined certainly in terms of productivity output per hours worked which is the ultimate source of increases in private sector income and wealth regulations requiring switching from coal to wind and solar reduce efficiency and productivity thus the rollback of those environmental regulations increases efficiency and productivity at least in the short run the negative impacts on efficiency and productivity from tariffs and the positive impacts of both fiscal stimulus from the trillion dollar deficits and rollback of environmental regulations impact different segments of the population differently more important is the fact that different segments of the population are very different in their ability to offset the negative impacts on efficiency and productivity from tariffs this is especially true in the current low interest rate environment the segments of the population whose wealth and income are primarily derived from labor are mostly unable to offset the negative impacts on efficiency and productivity from tariffs they generally must pay the higher prices that tariffs cause for all products made from steel and aluminum and many items that come from china such as bicycles and christmas tree ornaments furthermore the reductions in productivity and efficiency caused by trade restrictions that disrupt supply chains and raise input prices reduce the ability of most workers to obtain higher wages from their private sector employers for those segments of the population whose wealth and income are primarily derived from investments it is much easier to offset the reductions in productivity and efficiency caused by trade restrictions that disrupt supply chains and raise consumer and input prices for many investors the low interest rates caused in many cases worldwide by actions of central banks in response to the reductions in economic activity productivity and efficiency caused by trade restrictions boost the value of their fixed income securities lower interest rates also lift equity prices one group of investors that particularly benefits by low short term rates are those engaged in carry trade type strategies a carry trade is a strategy that involves borrowing at a low interest rate and investing in an asset that provides a higher rate of return buying 2x mreit leveraged etns is a carry trade that does not entail the risk of negative equity as is the case when someone explicitly borrows money for the purpose of buying an investment asset with borrowed proceeds in a margin account the asset could decline so much and so fast that the value of the investment asset is less than the amount owed thus the investor may have to come up with additional funds to repay the amount borrowed with etns not financed with borrowed funds the worst that could happen is they go to zero but they cannot create a liability for the investor while 2x mreit leveraged etns have some advantages over buying fixed income securities with borrowed funds including no possibility of the position having negative equity there are some other things to consider one consideration is that in contrast to many fixed income securities it is unlikely that 2x leveraged mortgage reit etns will pay their 25 face value at maturity they will pay whatever the net indicative asset value is at the maturity date that is not as scary as it might sound as is explained in applying net present values and internal rates of return to 2x leveraged etns yielding more than 20 that the net indicative asset value and dividends from a 2x leveraged high yield etn should be expected to decline over time can be a cause of concern or even scary however understanding that this is due to the fact that expenses and fees are deducted from the net indicative asset value of a 2x leveraged high yield etn rather than the income should alleviate some of the concern deducting the fees and expenses from income rather than principal would not impact the actual returns received from investing in 2x leveraged high yield etns the expected decline over time of the net indicative asset value and dividends is a consideration however once the magnitude of this factor is understood it should not be much of an impediment to investing in these 2x leveraged high yield etns lower libor rates tend to alleviate this concern since at current levels the implicit libor interest expense comprises most of the total expenses and fees that are deducted from the net indicative asset value of a 2x leveraged high yield etn the prospect of weaker economic growth has already caused the federal reserve to cut interest rates much sooner than many had forecast during the last eight years the next move by the federal reserve might be to further lower rates as was discussed in bank issues could impact 20 yielding etns a french court ordered switzerland s largest bank ubs to pay 4 5 billion euros 5 1 billion in fines and damages for helping wealthy french clients evade tax authorities it is not inconceivable that zealous government authorities could impose such draconian fines and penalties so as to cause the demise of one or more major financial institutions that could impact the world economy in a way similar to the collapse of lehman in 2008 also relevant is that ubs is the sole source of the interest and principal payments made by the etns it sponsors the etns are notes and thus obligations of ubs even without any enforcement action ubs could suffer such credit losses in a severe economic downturn so as to impair their ability to pay their obligations to the holders of 2x leveraged etns another concern relating to ubs is the negative interest rates in europe ubs is the world s largest asset manager the negative interest rates have caused ubs to charge large clients a fee to keep cash in their accounts some such investors have already taken their cash out of ubs and have literally put pallets filled with 500 euro notes into vaults analysis of the january 2020 morl and mrrl dividend projection my projected january 2020 morl and mrrl monthly dividend of 0 5877 is a function of the calendar most of the morl and mrrl components pay dividends quarterly typically with ex dates in the last month of the quarter and payment dates in the first month of the next quarter the january april october and july big month morl and mrrl dividends are much larger than the small month dividends paid in the other months thus the projected 0 5877 morl and mrrl dividend paid in january 2020 will be a big month dividend as can be seen in table i at the end of the article only three of the morl and mrrl components agnc investment corp agnc colony credit real estate clnc and armour residential reit arr now pay dividends monthly only one of the quarterly payers arbor realty trust abr will not have an ex date in december 2019 thus abr will not contribute to the dividend paid in january 2020 it might be noted that in december 2018 abr did have a special dividend of 0 03 as of december 26 2019 abr has not announced such a special dividend all of the other components will contribute to the dividend the calendar factors usually make the january monthly dividend the highest of the year for the 2x leveraged mreit based etns while typically called dividends the monthly payments from the 2x leveraged mreit based etns are technically distributions of interest payments on the etn notes based on the dividends paid by the underlying mreits that comprise the index pursuant to the terms of the indenture the table i below shows the ticker name weight price dividend and ex date for all of the components additionally the table includes the contribution to the dividend for the morl and mrrl components that will contribute to the january 2020 dividend there were two changes in the dividends paid by the individual components that will positively impact the january 2020 dividend invesco mortgage capital inc ivr increased

index as morl and mrrl mort pays dividends quarterly rather than monthly as a fund the dividend is discretionary by the fund management as long as it distributes the required percentage of taxable income to maintain its investment company status thus it does not lend itself to dividend projections as an etn like morl or mrrl which must pay dividends pursuant to an indenture analysis of the january 2020 reml dividend projection my projected january 2020 reml monthly dividend of 1 0464 is a function of the calendar as is the case with morl and mrrl most of the reml components pay dividends quarterly typically with ex dates in the last month of the quarter and payment dates in the first month of the next quarter the january april october and july big month morl and mrrl dividends are much larger than the small month dividends paid in the other months thus the 1 0464 reml dividend paid in january 2020 will be a big month dividend as can be seen in table ii at the end of the article only four of the reml components agnc arr orchid island capital orc and dynex capital inc dx now pay dividends monthly three of the quarterly payers will not have ex dates in december

etf rem is a fund based on the same index as reml rather than a note and does not employ the 2x leverage that reml does rem also pays dividends quarterly rather than monthly as a fund the dividend is discretionary by the fund management as long as it distributes the required percentage of taxable income to maintain its investment company status thus it does not lend itself to contribution by component dividend projections as an etn like reml which must pay dividends pursuant to an indenture conclusions and recommendations there were more dividend increases than decreases in the dividends paid by the underlying mreits that comprise the indices upon which the 2x leveraged mreit etns are based that is welcome news investors are in a much better position than non investors to offset the reduction in wealth and income resulting from the tariffs and trade restrictions enacted so far carry trades such as those involving 2x leveraged high yield mreit based etns seem a good way to offset such reductions in income there is some risk that trade restrictions could dramatically increase and cause much more harm than has taken place trump has threatened a major increase in tariffs if a final agreement with china is not implemented the initial agreement with china agreed to in december 2019 is a hopeful sign as is the passage of the new nafta which is not materially worse than the old nafta there are some ominous signs though as reuters reported on september 26 2019 the supreme court of world trade is close to breakdown after the united states turned down a last ditch petition to reappoint one of the four remaining judges at the world trade organization u s president donald trump has railed against the wto judges who have the final say on trade disputes his ambassador in geneva has accused them of overstepping their authority breaking their own rules and interfering in u s laws three judges are needed for each case and all 164 wto members must comply with their rulings the wto normally has seven judges but after a u s campaign to block appointments and reappointments only four remained wednesday s meeting of the wto s dispute settlement body was the last chance of reprieve for shree baboo chekitan servansing a trade judge from mauritius before his term expires on sept 30 if trump succeeds in preventing the wto from settling disputes it could eventually bring a breakdown in the whole world trading system that has brought such prosperity since the victorious allies set it up after world war ii that could be a tremendous risk to the equity markets and could also harm fixed income securities that have credit risk my view is that trump s removal would be a significant positive for the equity markets this appears very unlikely today however the trial in the senate could theoretically provide some surprises in nixon s case there were never any articles of impeachment actually enacted and thus no trial nixon resigned and was given a full pardon by president ford given the focus over the last year regarding the issue over whether a sitting president can be indicted a trump resignation in return for full pardon cannot be totally ruled out as with nixon if the facts lead some of trump s most ardent supporters to urge his resignation this could spare the country and financial markets the turmoil of a trial of course then the country and financial markets might start to worry about the possibility of the democrats enacting some of the harmful policies and social programs that have been tried and in many cases subsequently rejected in europe on balance i still tend to believe that the massive tax policy induced increase in inequality will cause increasing excesses of loanable and investable funds above commercially reasonable ways to utilize those funds this will eventually result in an over investment cycle with a recession and that should ultimately be very good for the mreits and 2x leveraged etns based on mreits some market participants recently seem not to believe that a possible recession will necessarily be good for mreits i believe that this misperception by the markets mostly present a buying opportunity and i am adding to my holdings of morl mrrl and reml depending on which is cheaper at any point in time however there are some real reasons why some market participants might be correct in their pessimistic perception of how mreits will behave in a recession this suggests diversification may be even more important than usual in any case it s always good to remember as keynes famously said the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent the phenomena of the old 2x leveraged high yield etn trading significantly above its net indicative asset value after new sales are suspended while the new one trades very close to its net indicative asset value appears to be ending as ubs redeems the old etns at net asset value however there could be no reason that causes

argentina s senate approved new president alberto fernandez s emergency economic package last week but will the chronically indebted country find a way out of an economic crisis that finished ex president macri he may not feel it but mauricio macri the former president of argentina might count himself a lucky man the first non peronist since 1983 to last his four year term he can now sit and watch his successor alberto fernandez grapple with the same perhaps irreconcilable forces fernandez faces demands from the left of the coalition that swept him to power on december 10 to increase social spending while investors want him to prioritize recalibration of argentina s chronic debt situation if the choice of fernandez s deputy former president cristina fernandez de kirchner is anything to go by fiscal fastidiousness is perhaps not on the cards read more argentina cristina fernandez de kirchner renounces presidential bid the plan fernandez s prime minister frente de todos s first legislative victory since taking office earlier this month was a package declaring a public emergency until december 31 2020 the package includes tax rises on the wealthier and tax relief for the poorest it also imposes a 30 tax on foreign currency transactions abroad while keeping a currency cap of 200 per person per month imposed by the macri administration the administration said 70 of the new revenues would be used for social programs including subsidizing free food vouchers for two million of the poorest argentinians and the rest for infrastructure and housing the number of people in poverty in the country is nearing 40 according to the world bank the economy already reeling from rising inflation which has topped 50 and ballooning external debt which is at about 90 of gdp is expected to shrink by 3 1 in 2019 the legislative package also hands the new president special powers to renegotiate debt terms fernandez wants to restructure the country s debt with private bondholders and the imf which agreed to a 57 billion 50 billion standby loan agreement with macri last year argentina s total debt stands at 332 billion including the imf loan outstanding debt with private bondholders is about 148 billion and talks with creditors have started to renegotiate 100 billion of this while the new administration has postponed payments on some of its short term debt the government still has to repay 66 billion pesos 1 1 billion 990 million of maturing debt before the end of this year is buenos aires flogging a dead horse under macri argentina announced a reprofiling of its debt payments and fernandez wants to follow suite it s not yet known what the restructuring would look like but the government is expected to focus on local debt which is less problematic for international legal reasons some 9 1 billion in payments on the local notes known as letes would be affected the letes reprofiling should be good for foreign currency bonds under foreign law as this reduces the government s financing needs in dollars said daniel chodos who heads latin america sovereign credit strategy at credit suisse about half of the total debt is in foreign currency forex and would be difficult to service given that the central bank holds just 43 5 billion in gross forex reserves bank deposit flight and investor outflows have already reduced currency reserves from about 66 billion before the primary election in october argentina s sovereign debt has been downgraded deeper into junk territory by moody s and to selective default by standard poor s fitch downgraded argentina to restricted default a credit rating applied to borrowers that have defaulted on one or more of their commitments while continuing to meet others delaying some of the government s sky high 70 billion of repayments due before the end of 2020 would lift a substantial burden nikhil sanghani a london based economist at capital economics told dw investors on board the new governing team has reportedly managed to appeal to some bondholders including pacific investment management to roll over maturing debt finance secretary diego bastourre and his deputy ramiro tosi met with pimco officials and local bondholders on december 18 and persuaded them to accept new notes in exchange for 24 5 billion pesos 410 million of bonds maturing in the same week argentina s fiscal underpinnings are temporarily in much better shape than they were just two months ago walter stoeppelwerth chief investment officer at portfolio personal inversores in buenos aires wrote in a note last week this is undeniably good news fernandez has promoted more fiscal spending to boost growth but argentina s economy still remains reliant onforeign investment which has largely dried up as investors await the new government s policy stance on spending and debt reprofiling what s to be done argentina has fallen back into crisis for the simple reason that not enough has changed since the last debacle mohamed a el erian chief economic adviser at allianz wrote in the guardian newspaper like brazil under then president luis inácio lula da silva in 2002 argentina needs to embark on a third path by developing a homegrown adjustment and reform program that places greater emphasis on protecting the most vulnerable segments of society a el erian said with government spending already running at about 40 of gdp fiscal consolidation would require cuts to social spending as well as pension reform the government has merely kicked the can down the road and maturity extensions alone will not be enough to resolve the debt problem sanghani said fernandez s plan to resolve argentina s debt crisis by growing the economy is not a realistic option he said adding that a large debt write down within a few years is inevitable maturity extensions would not address fundamental issues with argentina s debt dynamics sanghani said we don t think that the government s new economic plan will spur sustained economic growth without a credible plan to manage the economy and the public debt the government faces difficult and drawn out negotiations with private bondholders and the imf this is of course nothing new since 1950 argentina has spent 33 of the time in recession according to the world bank the country has had the highest inflation levels in recent history a median of 220 annually since 1980 according to estimates from the institute of international finance a washington based association of financial institutions

thirty years ago the socialist government of romania was overthrown in a military coup d etat industrialization had transformed the lives of millions of romanians during the country s socialist period but the later years were marked by strict rationing and frequent shortages as the government sought to pay off its foreign debt romanian people hoped that their lives would improve after 1989 but life today is much worse than even the most economically deprived times of the 1980s a 2010 poll revealed that 63 percent of romanians say that life was better under socialism romania s capitalist politicians search everywhere for a scapegoat to evade self incrimination the financial times states that romania has evolved into a democracy and strengthened ties with the west joining eu and nato but its transition was always incomplete what is meant by incomplete is never defined map of the socialist republic of romania in 1966 liberation graphic communists and executed president nicolae ceausescu in particular are the usual targets as part of the ongoing demonization campaign former military prosecutor dan voinea made a ludicrous statement to the financial times the communists remain in power until this very day but without the names a marxist approach requires us to understand the struggle between the working and owning classes when the communists came to power they dispossessed the wealthy nobility clerics and bourgeoisie of their property land was collectivized as well as all major industries and the economy was centrally planned millions of dwellings were built for workers and everyone had the right to a job the socialist romanian government transformed a largely agrarian society and made great gains in industrial production what s more they accomplished this feat within mere decades while under constant attack by the west the capitalist account of romania s history ignores the vast achievements of socialism only to focus on its problems and shortcomings many of which originated from the global situation at the time romania s socialist origins armed insurrection spurs red army s arrival unlike the popular revolutions in russia china cuba and others that brought communists to power the key factor to romania s socialist transformation was the victory of the soviet union in world war ii during the war romania had been ruled by a fascist military dictatorship in an alliance with nazi germany general ion antonescu was not a passive supporter of nazi germany his support was originally based on the fascist iron guard antonescu sent hundreds of thousands of ethnic minorities to their deaths in concentration camps this included jewish and roma people as well as communists romania s military was a key participant in the fascist invasion of the soviet union which eventually took 27 million soviet lives as the war went on internal resistance to the dictatorship grew even as communists were driven underground the soviet union began to turn the tide of war delivering defeat after defeat to the fascist alliance on aug 23 1944 a broad anti fascist coalition led by the communist party arrested the dictator general and locked him in a safe this insurrection sped the red army s advance into bucharest days later the romanian army switched sides in the war and now fought as an ally of the soviet union crowds cheer the entrance of the soviet red army into bucharest romania s capital in august 1944 source fototeca online a comunismului românesc cota 55 1944 like so many other countries in eastern europe post war governments were primarily shaped by the militaries that liberated them from fascism the soviet union in the east and the u s britain in the west the u s and british governments made clear that they would tolerate no governments other than those specifically chosen by the imperialists in their sphere this was evident in the cases of italy and greece in particular where the british military directly intervened to crush the communists who had led the partisan resistance to fascism and were already in control of many areas but instead of a capitalist government the soviet union oversaw the formation of socialist governments in eastern europe that would serve the interests of the working class the soviet union had been pushed to the verge of annihilation not just by the german military but by the resources and industrial capacity of essentially all of continental europe the nazi war machine had relied on the militaries of romania italy hungary slovakia and croatia as well as key agricultural and oil output from romania fascist resurgence was a possibility too deadly for the soviet union to allow after years of fascist dictatorship there was no pre war democratic government to go back to the largely discredited monarchy and bourgeois parties had the support of the west but these very parties had been responsible for romania s fascist takeover key support from the soviets whose red army remained in romania after the defeat of the fascists was given to the national democratic front a coalition led by the romanian communist party pcr the communist party s general secretary gheorghe gheorghiu dej had been a railway worker and pcr militant he was born in 1901 and began working at the age of 11 years old a situation all too common for youths of his time for his part in organizing strikes in 1933 he was sentenced to 12 years hard labor while in prison he was elected to the central committee of the pcr nicolae ceausescu another party leader was born in 1918 and was a shoemaker s apprentice in bucharest from the age of 10 he began revolutionary activity early and was in and out of prison organizing strikes and sabotage against the nazi allied government at age 22 ceausescu was in jilava prison when it was invaded by members of the fascist iron guard who slaughtered 64 of the other prisoners before they were stopped in 1946 nearly 7 million people voted for the national democratic bloc this election had the highest number of participants in the country s history the new government forced the abdication of the reactionary monarchy two years later the pcr would merge with the social democrats to form the romanian workers party pmr not just a dream industrializing an agrarian society the tasks of the country were enormous industrial output was halved by the war and the population had been reduced from nearly 20 million to less than 16 million more than 700 000 had died the vast majority of the people were peasants who worked on farms and had a life expectancy of 42 years at once the government set upon an electrification plan and laid the foundation for the development of industry farmland owned by a small rich minority was confiscated and collectivized extravagant castles and mansions were seized from the parasitic nobility and used for museums and other public institutions workers celebrate the production of their 1 000th locomotive in 1955 the result of romania s first 5 year plan source fototeca online a comunismului românesc cota 194 1955 four decades of socialist development would transform romania from a country that imported 90 percent of machinery to a country that manufactured its own social services and education radically improved health life expectancy increased by 30 years more than 5 million jobs were created and industrial output rose by more than 650 percent since 1950 housing was a major priority for the state by 1980 the socialist government had built 4 6 million homes for people scanteia newspaper reported how a communist of the old underground felt the need to touch and caress the bricks of the first apartment blocs to be built for steelworkers so he could convince himself that they were not just a dream pregnant women and mothers were accorded rights that even bourgeois reviewers noted as comprehensive and generous women were given fully paid maternity leave of 112 days and with no loss to benefits mothers were permitted to take a leave of absence from work to raise a child to the age of 6 or they could request half time work still a developing country suffering from centuries of underdevelopment romania strove to become a medium developed country and narrow the gap between it and the west for gheorghiu dej and ceausescu after him lessening ties with moscow was seen as necessary to attain that goal division in the socialist camp after the war the soviet union imposed war reparations on the country along with other formerly fascist states to repay part of the immense damage caused by the war although the aggregate reparations amounted to just one fifth the actual cost of destruction suffered by the soviet union these reparations strained the fragile economy of romania this likely did not improve the public view of the ussr there were still soviet troops in romania and moscow exercised a direct intervention in the economy through the sovrom joint stock partnerships over romania s major industries stalin s death in 1953 and the subsequent shifts in the soviet union impelled the divide further gheorghiu dej and ceausescu negotiated the buyout of the sovroms at great cost a worker in tattered clothes reads one of the first issues of scanteia newspaper romanian for spark source fototeca online a comunismului românesc cota 133 1944 but in 1955 romania joined the treaty of friendship cooperation and mutual assistance also known as the warsaw pact with the ussr and other countries of the eastern european socialist bloc at the same time romania s leaders began to establish economic ties with capitalist and imperialist countries in order to lessen ties with the soviet union in 1958 with chinese support gheorghiu dej negotiated the removal of soviet soldiers from romanian soil the only east european country to do so as the sino soviet split divided the socialist bloc between moscow and beijing bucharest maintained neutrality in 1964 the pmr adopted gheorghiu dej s theses that emphasized national independence and sovereignty equal rights mutual advantage non interference in internal affairs and observance of territorial integrity when gheorghiu dej died in 1965 ceausescu redoubled the steps towards nationalism the pmr renamed itself the romanian communist party pcr and the country became the socialist republic of romania to signify a step forward 1970s and 1980s maverick romania turns west the 1970s was a period of tremendous growth and development for the country vast natural resources paired with western trade concessions and foreign credit brought romania s most prosperous years since world war ii but in many ways the country s leadership held positions that were reactionary and opportunistic the independence put forward by gheorghiu dej and later ceausescu became more and more allied with u s imperialism romania recognized west germany and became the only socialist country to maintain diplomatic relations with israel when the cia overthrew the democratically elected socialist president of chile many socialist countries severed diplomatic relations yet romania maintained them these steps convinced the u s government that ceausescu could be influenced and worked with to a certain extent he was labelled a maverick by the u s press and internal cia documents they eagerly sought to distance romania from the soviet bloc in 1969 u s president richard nixon made a state visit to romania the first visit of a u s president to a socialist country three years before his famed visit to china romania would go on to join imperialist financial agreements including taking loans from the international monetary fund and world bank the u s welcomed each of these moves but other than high interest loans they gave romania nothing of substance in return what the u s really wanted was the overturn of the progressive social system and the return of capitalist exploitation and oppression but the coup d etat of 1989 could not have succeeded without an accumulation of errors on the part of the country s leaders the government s vacillation between the imperialist and socialist camps was one such example the late 1970s and early 1980s ushered in a series of crises that rocked the romanian economy a devastating earthquake hit bucharest in 1977 followed by the global economic crisis for much of the 1970s the romanian government had been able to export key commodities like oil at high prices but when prices slumped suddenly romania lost a significant source of revenue foreign credit that had previously offered an attractive path to development became an obstacle to the country s survival romania borrowed from the imf whose loan terms are designed to enslave governments in a cycle of debt by imposing crippling interest rates and severe austerity on the people they remain a key tool for imperialists today that limit a country s development for the romanian government foreign debt had become a trap from which they desperately worked to extricate themselves beginning in the early 1980s the romanian government rationed electricity heat gasoline and food the first time since the early postwar years agricultural goods were exported to pay down the loan rendering certain food items like meat and milk scarce people arrived home in the cold winter only to have the heat shut off after a few hours even radio and television transmissions were restricted to preserve energy these were difficult years for the romanian people other countries like poland and hungary which had taken out similar loans were not even able to pay the interest romania paid back the principal as well meanwhile the capitalist reforms in the soviet union gave fodder to reactionary elements across eastern europe at the same time the west s cultural cold war continued particularly enticing young people in the socialist camp with pro capitalist propaganda december 1989 and the military coup d etat by april 1989 the romanian government declared the country free of western debt the grand national assembly enacted a ban on taking on any further foreign credits yet the rationing of food and energy continued perhaps this was an effort to impel the economy further but these austerity measures were self defeating these decisions made by the country s leaders could only have further isolated much of the working class the imperialist media seized upon any sign of discontent in the socialist bloc so did the u s government which had financed counterrevolutionary organizations throughout eastern europe since the end of world war ii the imperialists carefully studied each manifestation a 1987 classified cia document outlined a number of possible situations that would lead to the downfall of the romanian government given the prospect of the coming winter stunningly one of the scenarios in this winter thinkpiece would play out almost exactly as occurred two years later in this scenario a group of striking workers would establish a national organization to coordinate protests pragmatic opponents of the ceausescus in leadership would remove him from office with support of the securitate or military the new government would ease restrictions on food and energy to placate most workers instead of a strike in a major factory the disturbances would arise around a reactionary hungarian cleric in the western city of timisoara and one such council of national salvation was formed not from any workers group but from the top military brass who began operating as a council six months before the coup timisoara is a cosmopolitan city in western romania near the hungarian border in 1989 there were 1 7 million hungarians who lived in the region bourgeois elements in hungary long promoted counterrevolutionary propaganda including alleged grievances against the hungarian minorities the eviction of a counterrevolutionary cleric on dec 16 sparked protests in timisoara confrontations ensued between rightwing protestors and security forces but there were few casualties there was no massacre as was repeated by the imperialist press the new york times published hysterical reports of mass graves in timisoara holding thousands of people and the hungarian media claimed that 60 000 had been killed all of this was later revealed to be false protests grew around the country on dec 20 the military foreshadowing its coming betrayal withdrew from timisoara this was a boon to the counterrevolution mobs of people ransacked the local communist party headquarters the unrest was serious enough for ceausescu to cut short a state visit to iran and return to the capital up to this time the clandestine counterrevolutionary council of national salvation had been operating for 6 months prior their pre december activities are not known and there were a number of such councils the most prominent included a former ambassador to the united states a disgraced pcr politician who would become the new government s president and at least 4 military generals including a retired general who had made previous attempts against ceausescu on dec 21 ceausescu appeared before a mass rally in bucharest he announced considerable increases in the minimum salary child subsidies and pensions he denounced the actions in timisoara of a group who wanted to place the country again under foreign domination in what would be prophetic words ceausescu spoke some would like again to reintroduce unemployment to reduce the living standards of the people and in order to dismantle romania to dismember romania to put our independent people and nation in danger his speech was interrupted by protestors and his disoriented response to the heckling was disproportionately publicized by the imperialist media people remained in the streets and clashes with the authorities took place imperialist propaganda outlets like radio free europe broadcasted false reports of a massacre in bucharest and workers from around the city poured into the streets the next day many of the people protesting had legitimate grievances that were built up over years of austerity but the protests quickly devolved into fascist violence when the military defected rightwing mobs set fire to the national archives and the university library crowds attacked ceausescu s home forcing him and his wife elena to flee the capital in a helicopter their pilot abandoned them on a country road where they were soon captured the military led nsf seized control of the television stations and declared themselves the new government military brass a historical source of counterrevolution were at odds with ceausescu s plan to integrate them into civilian work for years wrote rightwing academic vladimir tismaneanu in the new york times troops have been forced to engage in such demeaning activities as raising crops and supplying manual labor for grandiose ceausescu projects long held at bay by the socialist government the terror of the bourgeoisie raised its head on dec 25 1989 a secret military tribunal charged nicolae and elena ceausescu with fabricated crimes that included genocide and destroying the country s economic and spiritual values moments later as he was led to his death nicolae ceausescu sang the internationale he and his wife were executed by firing squad chaos ensued in the following days the entire leadership of the communist party was imprisoned communists were disappeared and even lynched in the streets some in the securitate whose origin came from the peasantry put up an armed resistance to the military coup they were hunted and executed privatization and poverty the american way within days the socialist nsf outlawed the communist party addendums to foreign treaties that called for states to guarantee full employment housing and education were abolished the u s government was quick to intervene as early as january 1990 washington instructed its bucharest envoy to take preliminary actions to encourage the process special attention was given to the bourgeois media the u s embassy issued an urgent request for up to date video equipment for the television station prior anti communist laws prevented the u s government from directly providing the equipment embassy cables gloated over how the counterrevolution has made it possible to pursue in numerous heretofore unthinkable ways our fundamental policy goals in romania one of those goals was the domination of romanian polity by u s legal norms the embassy s work plan included distributing 10 000 copies of the u s constitution in the romanian language to all members of the new parliament after the elections u s legal experts would advise romania in the creation of the new constitution and legal codes newly minted romanian politicians would be exposed to representatives from u s political parties and private businesses trade and economic meetings would convince romanian officials that the economic benefits the u s can offer were contingent on the new government adhering to the american view of elections and the upholding of so called individual rights to exploit the collective the u s military which already had planned military to military contacts would transform the romanian armed forces into a professional and non political corps based on a commander commanded relationship overnight independent and sovereign romania became a u s neocolony a new law approved 100 percent foreign ownership of investments state owned enterprises which had fueled the country s generous social services were sold to foreign capitalists gone was the law banning foreign debt negotiations with the imf began in 1993 with the requirement for the romanian government to enter its currency into the world market making romania more susceptible to the tumult of global capitalism by 1994 half of the population lived on less than 160 a month price controls over food were removed inflation hit 300 percent unemployment which previously did not exist haunted millions in desperation 4 million people turned to a pyramid scheme called caritas the pyramid scheme was allowed to operate by the new government and millions of families lost a collective 1 billion the leu romania s national currency sank to 1 748 to one dollar alleged discrimination of ethnic minorities was used to topple the socialist governments but the new capitalist governments relied on the support of the racist right wing fascist violence against roma ethnic hungarians and jewish people erupted across the country in a 1993 new york times article henry kamm detailed the quickly emerging racist attacks on the roma using a slur for the roma people kamm wrote the millions of gypsies of eastern europe have emerged as great losers from the overthrow of communism many of the economic and social protections that gypsies enjoyed in hungary romania and czechoslovakia collapsed permitting a revival of the open prejudice and persecution that have marked the history of the roma as gypsies prefer to call themselves capitalism restored social conditions deteriorate the coup plotters aim despite their claims of democracy and freedom was never to improve the standard of living for romanian workers as difficult as the years of rationing were the quality of life for romanians today is much worse more than 85 percent of all individual work contracts in romania pay less than the minimum needed for survival even as costs continue to climb many have left the country in search of an economic future since 1989 romania experienced the highest levels of emigration of all european countries 3 5 million people have fled more than 5 times the number of deaths in world war ii today the diaspora represents one fifth of the country s own labor force foreign corporations reap mega profits from the artificially low wages of romania the restoration of capitalism promised wealth and freedom for the country yet today romania remains among the poorest countries in the european union romania s economy and natural resources have been completely opened to foreign capital for exploitation almost every industrial measure peaked in mid to late 1980s and then bottomed out after the 1990s the romanian government today is loyal to u s empire there are now u s military bases in the countryside and in romania s principal ports when the u s demanded that all nato countries contribute 2 percent of their gdp romania was the first to raise military spending by u s accounts actions taken by the romanian government in the wake of the sept 11 attacks to support u s interests have been almost too numerous to list when the government was toppled in 1989 many romanian people looked to the u s government as a source of hope they were convinced that the years of austerity were finally over some believed that now they too would have access to abundant consumer goods and an american lifestyle this false image of abundance was intentionally cultivated by the imperialists to weaken the socialist bloc if the imperialists could convince workers in socialist states that the u s was the land of opportunity they could seriously weaken the stability of socialism defeat of the socialists in the cultural war was an important factor in the overthrow of socialist governments faced with the daunting task of industrializing agrarian societies socialist governments in addition had to produce consumer goods for its population while under technological and economic embargo and under constant threat of nuclear annihilation furthermore they had to do this within the span of just decades the bourgeoisie on the other hand had enriched themselves through centuries of capitalist exploitation including the enslavement of millions of africans and the indigenous history did not cease in 1989 capitalism s restoration in romania and the former socialist bloc has brought with it all its inherent contradictions it is bound to reignite mass struggle the words of the socialist internationale written 150 years ago and translated into nearly every language continue to inspire the fight of

the collapse of the central bank of lebanon following a major state scam plunged the country into an unparalleled economic and financial crisis the country is now paying for its 76 years of political dependence and 8 years of complete political vacancy the reality of its situation is very different from the perception of its citizens the central bank of lebanon has again authorized private banks to freely deliver lebanese pounds but still no dollars this exchange control is illegal in law because it has not been validated by parliament several large companies have already filed an application for interim relief before the courts the wheat oil and medicine import sectors are out of business all the others are in recession public debt stands at 154 of gdp the lebanese pound was depreciated by half its value in three months taking the syrian pound already mistreated during the war by the saudi and qatari counterfeit currency into its fall causes of the crisis this financial crisis led parliament to adopt a new tax that triggered the demonstrations that have paralysed the country since october 17 2019 in all likelihood it originated in a massive scam set up by the country s political leaders through the central bank before our very eyes meyssan thierry best price 29 44 buy new 24 97 as of 05 40 utc details a historical reminder is necessary here in fact lebanon has never been an independent state since its creation during the second world war 1943 france set up a confessional system there that allowed it to preserve its influence after decolonization by depriving the lebanese of any national political life the attempt by us secretary of state henry kissinger to settle the israeli question by making lebanon the homeland of palestinian arabs provoked a civil war 1975 1989 and ended in failure the saudi peace imposed by the taif agreement 1989 restored the confessional system and extended community quotas to all public service jobs the syrian military presence 1989 2005 validated by the international community made it possible to rebuild the country but did not solve any problems former prime minister rafiq hariri 1992 98 and 2000 04 looted lebanon by plundering 55 000 families then confusing the treasury with his personal fortune he had raked in 16 billion at the end of his life under the taif agreement rafiq hariri as a representative of the saudi royal family was protected by the syrian peace force present in the country to end the civil war during his assassination it was discovered that he had corrupted the two syrian officials responsible for overseeing peacekeeping the head of the intelligence services ghazi kanaan and vice president abdel halim khaddam the first committed suicide and the second fled to france where he made an alliance with the muslim brotherhood and prepared for the overthrow of president bashar al assad in 2005 the syrian peacekeeping force abruptly withdrew at the request of the lebanese population which saw it as a symbol of its own crimes during the civil war and held it wrongly responsible for the assassination of former prime minister rafiq hariri from 2006 to 2014 i e during the power vacuum and then the presidency of michel sleimane protected mainly from qatar and secondarily from france the lebanese political leaders did not establish any accounting documents lebanon and saudi arabia were the only two states in the world without an official budget it is now materially impossible to determine what taxes have been levied what international aid lebanon has received or what it has spent during this period central bank director riad salamé set up a ponzi scheme comparable to that of bernard madoff but for the personal benefit of political leaders dollar deposits earned twice as much interest as in other countries but the interest on these deposits was paid with the money of the new depositors with the agreement of the united states private banks agreed to launder the dirty money of south american drug cartels while a us bank bought a third of the capital of the main lebanese banks when a major depositor withdrew his money the system faltered political leaders had time to transfer their loot abroad before it collapsed thus last october former prime minister fouad siniora broke all records by secreting away between 6 and 8 billion ill acquired dollars in response to the disaster the acting president of the government saad hariri the legal son of the former requested an advance payment of 1 billion from the european union he then wrote to china egypt france italy russia saudi arabia turkey and the united states to ask them to guarantee unpaid amounts for the import of basic necessities which must be repaid as soon as exchange controls are lifted in response the main states involved in the economic rescue of lebanon met on december 11 in paris in the morning they discussed behind closed doors their political interest in saving lebanon or letting it sink then in the afternoon they received a lebanese delegation they made the appointment of a new pro western government and the establishment of effective control over the use of any money a condition for any assistance indignant at the idea of new foreign supervision over the country lebanese petitions have been sent to foreign donors to dissuade them from paying money to the central bank until the origin of the crisis has been established sunni government president saad hariri then addressed the imf and the world bank but they immediately questioned the authenticity of the central bank s balance sheet and the probity of its director riad salamé hitherto considered an exemplary banker this historical reminder highlights hezbollah s lack of responsibility for the crisis despite the fact that the western press claims the opposite similarly it is important to note that while hezbollah accepts the zakat muslim donation of drug traffickers in the bekaa valley and the shia diaspora in latin america it has always opposed drug cultivation when it came to government it proposed and implemented social assistance programs so that farmers could evolve and change their crops finally it should also be stressed that most of the lebanese dirty money does not come from local drugs but from the laundering of the income of south american cartels money laundering instituted by the united states and benefiting lebanese bankers mainly christians and sunnis identically this reminder highlights the apparent stability of the country since the election of the christian president of the republic michel aoun lebanon had never been able to simultaneously fill the functions of christian president of the republic sunni president of the government the unicameral assembly and the constitutional council from 2005 to 2016 impact of the crisis exchange controls which aim to stop capital flight have caused the economy to collapse at least 10 of the country s companies have gone bankrupt in the last 3 months most of the others have reduced their working hours in order to proportionally reduce the wages paid without having to lay off their employees the first companies affected are charitable foundations so the entire sector of aid to the poor is devastated foreign workers especially asian domestic workers who are paid in lebanese pounds have lost half of what they used to transfer monthly in dollars to their families thousands have already left the country everyone will have noticed that the demonstrations that have been taking place since october 17 are very coordinated the agitators are permanently connected by telephone to a mysterious hq the slogans are exactly the same throughout the country and in all communities which gives the demonstrators an illusory sense of the end of the confessional system the designation of the christian president of the republic michel aoun as the main target of the free patriotic movement cpl suggests that the movement is organised against him the united states position is ambiguous on the one hand the usaid administration blocked a 115 million grant to the lebanese army to purchase equipment while on the other hand secretary of state mike pompeo released the grant former us ambassador to lebanon jeffrey feltman testified before congress stating what he had written that is according to him every american must fight the iran herbollah cpl white house alliance the proposal to appoint businessman samir khatib as sunni president of the government was rejected by the grand mufti indeed in lebanon the christian president of the republic is appointed by the maronite patriarch the sunni president of the government by the mufti and the shiite president of the parliament by the mullahs and then they are confirmed by the single chamber it is the only country in the world with such a confusion of religious and political powers for their part the kateb maronite phalangists proposed diplomat and magistrate nawaf salam to make a good face in any case the mufti is in favour of a renewal of saad hariri but this time at the head of a government of technocrats who in any case will be chosen by the three presidents accused of prevarication the free patriotic movement cpl of the christian president of the republic michel aoun has already indicated that it would not participate in the next government he does not intend to be held responsible for future problems under the pretext of covering the embezzlement of funds for which it is accused and which it denies the clashes which took place on december 14 in beirut illustrate the emptiness of the unrest in the early afternoon young shia members of hezbollah and amal attacked groups linked to george soros who had set up tents in the city centre in the evening other young people from the groups that had been attacked shortly before tried to invade parliament and proclaim it the colourful revolution as they did in serbia georgia and many other countries for the lebanese haunted by the memory of the civil war the hundred or so wounded including the forces of order cause unbearable anguish the fact that the press speaks of the wounded lebanese but says nothing about the stateless palestinian or syrian national deaths speaks volumes about the country s violence we are therefore heading once again towards a wobbly system because the major powers have been playing with lebanon for 76 years and the lebanese have been submitting to it how to get out of the crisis contrary to the demands of the demonstrators there is no proper lebanese politician and there can t be any in a system like this at best they stole money to serve their community at worst to enrich themselves personally lebanon is one of the few countries in the world where billionaires suddenly appear without anyone knowing where their wealth comes from therefore it is not necessary to drive them all out but to rely on the former by encouraging them to serve the nation rather than their only community and to imprison the latter 9 11 the big lie meyssan thierry best price 7 89 buy new 54 80 as of 07 40 utc details lebanon s misfortunes are directly attributable to the lebanese themselves who for 76 years have accepted an abstruse constitutional system and fought for their community rather than for their country they have still not resolved the trauma of the civil war and continue to see their religious warlords as the only bulwarks against possible aggression from other communities these misfortunes will only end with a change of constitution and the adoption of a truly democratic system this implies the recognition of the most legitimate personality to lead the country to its destiny it doesn t matter what his confession is and in this case it is clearly sayyed hassan nasrallah after the victory of his network of resistance against the israeli invader who is indisputably the legitimate personality it will remain for the lebanese to hope that he will not use their trust to betray them for the benefit of the iranians for the moment it is impossible to change the constitution the parliamentarians who would be massively swept away are too attached to their seats and will not do so a referendum will not do this either because corruption is everywhere including among voters 45 of them admit to having been solicited to sell their vote in lebanon political parties are denominational they do not have a national ambition but they defend their community and distribute prebends to it it is therefore necessary to proceed gradually by creating a strong administration and therefore by decapitating the main corrupt agents within a short period of time this is what the sunni president of the government saad hariri had proposed and which was refused him by the demonstrators then it will be necessary to attack warlords from the civil war who must prove their usefulness today or leave public life the best of thierry meyssan
the bailout arguably the seminal moment in ireland s recent economic history in late 2010 the country was imploding financially the crash had sent the economy into reverse and blown a hole in the public finances unemployment had rocketed from 5 per cent to 15 per cent in just two years us economist paul krugman described ireland s 26 per cent growth rate in 2015 as leprechaun economics photograph franck robichon reuters however it was the government s infamous decision to guarantee the entire domestic banking system back in 2008 effectively putting the sovereign on the hook for 440 billion of bank liabilities that would seal the country s fate by september the guarantee had run out but ireland was locked out of the bond markets and unable to borrow and no one really knew just how big the problem in the banking system was whether the government chose the bailout route or was pushed as kevin cardiff former secretary general of the department of finance maintains is still a source of controversy the manner in which it was announced was a gubu moment read more after several denials by the government and various ministers the then central bank governor patrick honohan rang

900 million of deposits had flooded out of irish banks in one of the biggest one day exoduses on record the banks had in the words of minister for finance brian lenihan become too big a problem for the country on november 28th the government agreed to a 67 5 billion eu imf bailout programme with the european commission the european central bank ecb and the imf later known as the troika the three year financial aid programme was provided on the condition of exacting austerity measures that would cause great hardship the economy was in freefall in stark contrast with the heady days of the boom when ireland s tiger economy was an exemplar of growth and prosperity we were the sick man of europe headed for several years of swingeing cutbacks and another morale sapping period of emigration aib

bank that became synonymous with ireland s financial crash was once the poster boy of the industry here under the stewardship of seán fitzpatrick it had morphed from a fringe operator lending to corporates in the late 1980s to one of europe s most profitable banks by the mid 2000s it recorded an annual profit of more than 500 million in 2005 primarily on the back of what would later been seen as reckless lending to builders and developers its loan book trebled to 73 billion between 2004 and 2008 as it allowed clients double down on their existing loans by taking equity out of one project to fund another the bank and its clients epitomised the easy money culture of the celtic tiger era by mid 2008 shares in irish banks and anglo in particular were tanking as rumours circulated about their exposure to bad debts rumours were also circulating that wealthy businessman seán quinn had taken a large position in the bank via cfds contracts for difference which meant his name was kept off the share register as he didn t actually own the stock under the stewardship of seán fitzpatrick anglo irish bank had morphed from a fringe operator in the late 1980s to one of europe s most

bank lehman brothers anglo was the weakest link teetering on the brink of collapse later that year fitzpatrick and chief executive david drumm were forced to resign after hundreds of millions in directors loans kept hidden from auditors were uncovered not long afterwards the bank was nationalised and in march 2010 it reported losses of 12 7 billion for the 15 months to december 2009 the largest loss in irish corporate history drumm would later be jailed for his role in the provision of illegal loans to 10 developers to buy shares in the bank the so called maple 10 controversy the

officially ranked as the richest man in ireland with an estimated wealth of 4 7 billion relating in the main to his hugely profitable insurance and financial services business three years later he walked into a belfast courtroom and declared himself bankrupt crystallising the most calamitous fall in irish business history his bankruptcy was triggered by the collapse of anglo between october 2005 and july 2007 quinn built up a 28 per cent stake in the bank using cfds a financial instrument used to gamble on the bank s share price when anglo shares began what would become a steep nosedive the bank advanced quinn loans to allow him meet his cfd commitments but the gamble was going only one way when the bank collapsed the quinn family and their empire owed anglo 2 8 billion the calling in of these loans precipitated a series of court battles across several jurisdictions quinn s lawyers argued that anglo should never have been lent him the money as it was for the unlawful purpose of supporting the bank s share price the jewel in the quinn crown quinn insurance fell into administration on foot of a high court application from the central bank in march 2010 leaving irish motorists via a 2 per cent levy on all policies to fund a financial black hole in its accounts estimated at 940 million the wider quinn group including its manufacturing division which employed thousands in the border counties of fermanagh and cavan was later seized by anglo before having its debts restructured the process described as de quinning by local supporters provoked a violent backlash with individuals and company property targeted in a string of attacks the worst of which was a vicious assault on quinn industrial holdings director kevin lunney earlier this year quinn himself was jailed for three months in november 2012 for contempt of court and for his role in a scheme to put the family s 500 million international property empire beyond the reach of anglo when sentencing quinn ms justice elizabeth dunne said in my view he has only himself to blame earlier this year quinn s five adult children consented to a judgment for 440 million some 88 million each on foot of a long running battle with ibrc execution and registration of the judgment was stayed on condition they take steps to help secure the return to ibrc of valuable assets in their international property group seán dunne the fall of ireland s premier property tycoon the property developer s bold deal making and extravagant lifestyle epitomised celtic tiger exuberance but like many of his ilk the 2008 property crash left him with an unmanageable exposure to collapsing property values the most spectacular example of dunne s ambition was his plan for the redevelopment of the jurys and berkeley court hotel sites in dublin s ballsbridge dunne paid 380 million for the seven acre site in 2005 the deal amounted to 54 million an acre one of the highest amounts ever paid for land in europe his plan was to transform ballsbridge into the knightsbridge of dublin at the centre of the scheme was a dubai like office tower cut in the shape of a diamond it would have been the state s tallest building the

dunne and his wife former gossip columnist gayle killilea the two had met in the fianna fáil hospitality tent at the galway races in 2002 relocated to connecticut the national asset management agency nama which took over the bad property loans of the irish owned banks appointed receivers to several of dunne s irish properties in 2011 at around the same time ulster bank seized control of the ballsbridge site before petitioning the high court to have him declared bankrupt on foot of a 163 million judgment against him dunne countered by filing for bankruptcy in the united states stating he had debts of more than 1 billion and assets of just 55 million what followed was an extraordinarily drawn out bankruptcy process in two jurisdictions in which it was revealed that the developer had turned over millions of euro in assets to his wife to shield them from creditors the irish high court adjudicated dunne bankrupt in 2013 in 2018 however the high court extended his bankruptcy for an additional 12 years for what the court said was his wilful and deliberate failure to co operate with the trustee administering the process in a damning judgment ms justice caroline costello described dunne as being a deeply dishonest witness who had engaged in wholesale non compliance of his statutory obligations dunne was due to exit bankruptcy in july 2016 and will not now do so until april 2028 in june nama and ulster bank won a major victory in the years long legal battle when a us jury ruled that dunne had fraudulently transferred assets to killilea to hide them from creditors and ordered her to pay 18 1 million to sum up his fall from grace dunne told an american court in september that he earns just 200 a month us economist paul krugman described ireland s 26 per cent growth rate in 2015 as leprechaun economics photograph franck robichon reuters leprechaun economics dismissed as farcical for an advanced economy and famously mocked by us nobel winning economist paul krugman as leprechaun economics ireland s 26 per cent growth rate in 2015 later revised down to 25 per cent implied the economy here was growing at three times the rate of china the problem was it had little to do with underlying economic conditions and more to do with multinational transactions in particular the transfer of intellectual property ip assets here on foot of a global clampdown on multinational tax avoidance the story once again drew unwanted attention to ireland s low tax economy and the fact that it was being used to house billions of euro in multinational assets it also showed how woefully inadequate traditional measures such as gross domestic product gdp were at capturing economic growth in a small globalised economy while the year on year increase was put down to several phenomena including a spate of so called corporate inversions and the transfer of aircraft leasing assets here the real driver was the transfer of ip assets to ireland by large multinationals including apple on foot of an investigation by the european commission apple restructured its irish subsidiary in 2014 the iphone maker made one of its key subsidiaries irish resident for tax purposes as part of the restructuring the subsidiary apple operations europe was one of the three irish incorporated subsidiaries that were for years stateless for tax residency purposes and which facilitated apple in avoiding tax on tens of billions of euro in annual profits on its global sales the onshoring of these entities fuelled a 75 billion jump in exports either way the 26 per cent figure proved an embarrassment for the government and the central statistics office cso which later devised a bespoke measure of national income to combat the distortions at the heart of our national accounts apple s 13 billion tax bill the largest corporate tax fine in history was described by apple boss tim cook as total political crap in august 2016 following a two year investigation the european commission ordered apple to pay back a whopping 13 billion plus interest in back taxes to the government claiming the company had received illegal tax benefits over the course of two decades that constituted a breach of state aid rules both apple and the government are appealing it and the money sits in limbo in an escrow account technically it wasn t a fine the issue in dispute was the level of tax apple should or should not have paid nonetheless it once again shone a light on ireland s tax friendly regime in its ruling the commission concluded that two tax rulings in 1991 and 2007 issued by revenue had substantially and artificially lowered the tax paid by apple in ireland since 1991 which allowed the company funnel most of its european sales through an employee less shell head office attached to its subsidiaries in cork but non resident here for tax purposes the commission argued that apple s effective corporate tax rate on its european profits in 2014 was just 0 005 per cent albeit the government disputes the eu s interpretation of irish tax law in the appeal lawyers for the commission claimed ireland blindingly accepted proposals from apple when it came to how much of its profits could be taxed by revenue however lawyers for the company insist that the valuable ip that the commission has attributed to its branches in ireland actually lies in the us where the group s products and services are created either way the issue remains one of acute embarrassment for the government former anglo chief executive david drumm was jailed for his role in the provision of illegal loans to 10 developers to buy shares in the bank the so called maple 10 controversy photograph nick bradshaw david drumm s catch me if you can bankruptcy trial in june 2018 former anglo chief executive david drumm was sentenced to six years in jail after being found guilty on charges of conspiracy to defraud the public and of false accounting his conviction came almost 10 years after he resigned from anglo an institution he led through a period of unprecedented profitability but also to financial ruin it marked an end to one of the most high profile cases in irish financial history as the full extent of anglo s financial woes became clear drumm fled to boston where he filed for bankruptcy under us law a more lenient system than ireland s at the time catching authorities here by surprise however ibrc anglo s successor entity fought drumm s bankruptcy claim on the basis of loans he owed his former employer while alleging that he had transferred money and assets to his wife so they would not be seized in january 2015 the us court declared his application inadmissible ruling that he could be held liable for debts in ireland in a damning ruling the bankruptcy judge said the former banker was not remotely credible and that his conduct was both knowing and fraudulent the ruling paved the way for drumm to be extradited back to ireland in 2016 on separate criminal charges relating to the collapse of anglo he was eventually found guilty of falsification of the bank s assets back in 2008 when he presided over a series of circular transactions that made anglo s deposits look 7 2 billion larger than they were a desperate attempt to window dress the bank s ailing balance sheet and in relation to the maple 10 controversy drumm has railed against what he describes as the blame culture here which paints him as chief villain of state s financial crisis and the epitome of celtic tiger hubris the anglo tapes secret recordings from inside the bank which record him joking about how he and others lied to government about anglo s financial health at the height of the crisis convincing officials to invest in the failing bank with figures picked out of my arse did little to help his cause he has apologised for the language used in those tapes but insists the bank that broke the state never sought a blanket guarantee which he says was not in the best interests of the state aib back from the brink of extinction the most striking thing about aib s implosion in 2008 was the size of the financial crater it it left for the taxpayer some 20 8 billion it was much closer to anglo s bailout bill than many had thought and a multiple of the 4 7 billion used to support its rival bank of ireland while anglo is now a relic of ireland s financial burnout and a byword for banking failure aib remains one of the state s biggest banks and a significant plank of the financial establishment here aib holds the dubious honour of commanding the biggest bailout for a bank that survived the crash the trouble started in the mid 2000s when the bank then under chief executive michael buckley set up win back teams to regain market share from the likes of anglo it ramped up lending bankrolling big developers from liam carroll to ray grehan whose property empires failed during the crisis by the time the music stopped and global financial markets went into meltdown in 2008 almost 36 per cent of aib s irish loan book was out to the construction development industry with a further 29 per cent comprising of residential mortgages even late into 2008 when the tide had almost gone out on the irish banking system aib owned goodbody stockbrokers maintained a buy recommendation for its then parent in december 2010 the government was forced to take a majority stake in the bank to save it from collapse a shareholding that grew to 99 8 per cent the bank racked up 25 5 billion of losses between 2009 and 2013 aib has been profitable since 2014 and its return to financial health was franked by an oversubscribed initial public offering ipo in june 2017 when the government sold off 29 per cent of its stake for 3 4 billion it was the largest ipo in europe that year and marked a significant milestone in its and the state s financial rehabilitation tracker mortgage scandal it had been widely known for some time that there had been issues with how banks were treating customers with tracker mortgages before the central bank announced in late 2015 rather belatedly critics have argued that it was overseeing an industry wide examination of the issue few suspected however how big the scandal would ultimately turn out to be following much kicking and screaming and on occasion threats from both sides of legal action the central bank s final report into the matter published in july showed that 40 100 mortgage borrowers had either been wrongly denied their right to a cheap loan linked to the ecb s main rate or put on the wrong rate entirely it took the emotional testimony of four affected customers before the oireachtas finance committee in late 2017 to pressure regulators government and banks to deal decisively with the debacle permanent tsb chief executive jeremy masding ptsb was the first bank to be fined for its role in the tracker mortgage scandal when the central bank sent it a 21 million bill in may photograph brian lawless pa wire but even the final

services and pensions ombudsman ger deering completes his work reviewing complaints outside of the central bank review all told the country s banks have paid out almost 700 million in refunds and compensation but the actual bill is now well above 1 billion when other costs are included making it the biggest overcharging issue in the history of the state permanent tsb was the first bank to be fined for its role in the fiasco when the central bank sent it a 21 million bill in may the other four banks under investigation aib and its ebs unit bank of ireland ulster bank and kbc bank ireland can look forward to similar penalties in the next year or so the banks have set up an irish banking culture board to help raise standards in the industry as a direct result of the scandal and the

part economic pact part postwar alliance photograph adam ferguson new york times brexit the uk s divorce from the eu the uk s 2016 referendum wasn t mandatory it was held ostensibly to quell internal tory party divisions on europe its instigator former uk prime minister david cameron subsequently quit the scene leaving his successors to deal with the consequences and those consequences look set to play out for some time to come because of its close trading ties with the uk and its porous land border with the north the republic was always going to be one of the big losers from brexit in the immediate aftermath of the 2016 vote it was thought that the uk would opt for a soft option exiting but remaining in a close economic orbit to the eu the rise of hardline brexiteer boris johnson and the strength of his recent electoral victory might yet set the uk on a course for a hard brexit or even a no deal brexit which would have extremely damaging consequences for certain sectors of the economy here most notably the agrifood industry former uk prime minister david cameron who instigated the uk s 2016 referendum on membership of the eu photograph andrew winning reuters either way brexit will be the first fracturing of the eu since its inception in 1957 as part economic pact part postwar alliance at the heart of the ongoing saga is one intractable problem that supersedes all others namely the uk can t have full access to eu trade and travel while ditching what it considers the undesirable bits of the union namely immigration and having to pay into a central pot it has taken brexiteers an extraordinarily long time to realise that the promised land of an independent trade policy comes at a price and the price is impeded access to the eu single market what s left to decide is just what form of brexit it will be the free trade negotiations that will follow the uk s formal exit will determine this they could be as protracted as the current battle over the

risks which could stoke ecb rate cut bets and pressure the currency german economy outlook the german economy the largest in the eurozone only narrowly missed a recession this past year as demand from its eu neighbors faded amid a global slowdown and the us china trade war environmental regulations also hindered germany s auto sales a key factor in the export oriented economy if growth continues to slow and germany experiences a recession this could boost ecb rate cut bets and hurt the euro the ecb and lagarde s limits prior to being sworn in as the new ecb president christine lagarde said that there is still room to cut interest rates further into negative territory this comes as monetary authorities continue to expand the bank s balance sheet in an effort to push eurozone inflation figures

risen a little over 17 percent from its all time low reading at 1 1150 its ascent came as eurozone data began to rapidly improve and outperform economists estimates however brewing tensions between

qe indefinitely investors are questioning the effectiveness of additional stimulus in the case of a downturn while mrs lagarde has stressed the importance of european governments to increase spending the institutional rigidity of the eurozone makes it difficult for members states to exercise their own fiscal autonomy look at what happened in italy in 2019 when they tried side effects of hyper accomodative monetary policy while the ecb s ultra aggressive easing measures did help the eurozone recover the specter of its earlier actions may start haunting european markets with interest rates so low it has left yield starved investors searching for greater returns and often directing their capital to riskier assets this helps explain the recent explosion of the leveraged loan market and greater issuance of covenant lite debt obligations if a sizeable portion of high risk debt becomes delinquent it could trigger a regional equity selloff and pressure the euro the spread on the market itraxx europe crossover index which consists of 75 equally weighted credit default swaps cds on the most liquid sub investment grade european corporate entities is hovering at all time lows however the cost of insuring these debt obligations could skyrocket and may be reflected in a wider spread on the cdss if regional risk aversion pressures european stock markets this may then stoke ecb rate

central bank governor w d lakshman pic by lasantha kumara newly appointed governor of the central bank dr w d lakshman yesterday in his first media briefing following the december monetary policy review outlined his first impressions on the new job as well as plans and objectives following are excerpts of dr lakshman s address a privilege an honour to have been appointed to the esteemed and celebrated position of great consequence coming as the 15th in the wake of a long succession of great men who decorated this position over the last 69 years this succession of governors started indeed from john exeter the author of the monetary law act of 1949 the enabling legislation of the central bank and sri lanka s pioneer central bank head the central bank was established replacing its predecessor the currency board system in the 1950s with the objective of adding to the country s regained sovereignty the independent decision making authority in monetary and financial affairs it is now an institution carrying a great deal of prestige respect and credibility having managed the monetary affairs of sri lanka with responsibility for six decades i am committed to sustain and add to this institutional greatness i hope to do my best to uphold the great traditions of the central bank built up over nearly seven decades i must make particular reference to my immediate predecessor dr indrajit coomaraswamy who has contributed a great deal to re establish the bank s respect within our socio economic system in general and the country s financial community in particular his contribution to firmly establish procedures and practices in central bank governance is acknowledged to be extremely helpful and facilitating for his immediate successor let me express my thanks and gratitude to his excellency the president the prime minister and the secretary to the president for selecting and appointing me to this highly responsible and exalted position as expected of me i will make every effort to safeguard its reputation and prestige and to fulfil the confidence placed on me by appointing authorities my work experience has so far been academic studied and taught central banking as part of courses in economics and development studies both at undergraduate and graduate levels i am therefore familiar with central banking theory and practice as academic disciplines i am also familiar with the historical debates covering the role of central banking and how different schools of thought viewed that role this is however the first time i am trying my hand as a practical central banker i very much look forward to learn from my colleagues within the bank while working and hope will also be able to in the process make my own contribution to sri lankan central banking the bank s large pool of competent committed and highly trained human resources i am sure will provide me the required support in carrying out the functions of my office as the head of the apex financial authority in the country the central bank was established replacing its predecessor the currency board system in the 1950s with the objective of adding to the country s regained sovereignty the independent decision making authority in monetary and financial affairs it is now an institution carrying a great deal of prestige respect and credibility having managed the monetary affairs of sri lanka with responsibility for six decades i am committed to sustain and add to this institutional greatness i hope to do my best to uphold the great traditions of the central bank built up over nearly seven decades the objectives of the central bank as specified in the mla in 1949 1 the stabilisation of domestic monetary values maintenance of price stability 2 the preservation of the par value or the stability of the exchange rate of the sri lankan rupee maintenance of exchange rate stability 3 the promotion and maintenance of a high level of production employment and real income in sri lanka 4 the encouragement and promotion of the full development of the productive resources of sri lanka however in keeping with i the worldwide trends in central banking and ii the rapid changes in international financial markets the central bank embarked on a modernisation programme in 2000 objectives were adjusted accordingly bringing them down to two core objectives reflecting the abandonment of the real economy objectives 3 and 4 in the mla of 1949 1 the maintaining of economic and price stability 2 the maintaining of financial system stability these statutory objectives show that the central bank has an important stabilisation role as well as a facilitation role in the economy the country has been struggling with below 5 growth for several years and growth has now slowed down to below 3 although inflation has been contained from the demand side weather related food price volatility and dependence on imported commodities constantly threaten cost of living statistics on unemployment appear acceptable but they hide issues such as underemployment low labour force participation high unemployment amongst educated youth an ageing labour force and low productivity and these need to be addressed if the government is to realise its goal of eliminating poverty through effective utilisation of labour resources in the external sector sluggish export performance large trade deficits persistent current account deficits dependence on debt inflows in the absence of alternative levels of fdi inflows as well as high foreign financing needs are major concerns in addition we need to be watchful of developments in the global economy and financial markets as well in this context we hope to engage with the imf and other multilateral agencies while remaining within the framework of national policy to ensure that the country reverts to a sustainable path of reserve accumulation a prerequisite for exchange rate stability as well i must make particular reference to my immediate predecessor dr indrajit coomaraswamy who has contributed a great deal to re establish the bank s respect within our socio economic system in general and the country s financial community in particular his contribution to firmly establish procedures and practices in central bank governance is acknowledged to be extremely helpful and facilitating for his immediate successor the government is aware of the need for fiscal consolidation and in addressing longstanding issues in the fiscal sector while supporting the revival of the economy in the monetary sector we have seen credit flows coming to virtually a standstill monetary and regulatory measures taken so far as well as the measures that are being contemplated by the government including the moratorium on capital repayments of bank loans by smes supported by improving business confidence will result in an acceleration of credit flows in the period ahead this will also help address the increased npl ratios of the financial sector with the revival of economic activity we expect economic growth to accelerate to around 4 4 5 and inflation to remain below 4 in 2020 beyond 2020 with necessary reforms annual growth is expected to accelerate to over 6 5 while inflation will be managed between 4 6 in the present context of subdued growth and development continuing prevalence of poverty pockets despite poverty alleviation policies of over several decades in the past and prevalence of unemployment and under employment at worrying levels the fiscal and monetary authorities and decision makers in different real sectors of the economy are confronted with the challenge of searching and identifying alternative policy sets of greater efficacy than the neo liberal policy set i hope to be able to make my contribution in this search for alternatives together with the other authorities the monetary policy announcements made today we hope will be of positive impact helping and supporting the various measures announced from time to time by fiscal and other authorities it is in this overall context that the monetary board decided to maintain its accommodative policy stance unchanged at yesterday s meeting we hope to be proactive and the central bank will assess the developments in the market and the economy closely and take appropriate action as necessary to maintain economic and price stability as well as financial system stability which is our mandated objective within the overall policy framework of the government this is a time of important changes in sri lankan development policy and practice questions are being raised extensively about the validity and relevance of washington consensus type or neoliberal type policies to achieve the desired goals of inclusive sustainable and shared development this questioning may also apply to central banking nowadays i am extremely excited about the opportunity i have gained at a time like this to make my active contribution to sri lanka s search for an alternative policy approach to achieve the desired development objectives let me also recognise the important role of mass media in educating the public and improving economic and financial literacy media has performed the vital role of questioning the governments and the central bank s actions in the economy and the financial market and we hope media will continue to play the role of a balanced intermediary between the government and the general public which will help us achieve the ultimate goal of improved social welfare through appropriate policy measures

2019 closed out a lost decade for the world s tropical forests with surging deforestation from brazil to the congo basin environmental policy roll backs assaults on environmental defenders abandoned conservation commitments and fires burning through rainforests on four continents the following review covers some of the biggest rainforest storylines for the year 2019 closed out a lost decade for the world s tropical forests with surging deforestation from brazil to the congo basin environmental policy roll backs assaults on environmental defenders abandoned conservation commitments and fires burning through rainforests on four continents the following covers some of the biggest rainforest storylines for the year the list isn t exhaustive so if there are important things missing feel free to add them via the comment function at the bottom 10 years of annual reviews 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2009 global forests a team led by matt hansen of the university of maryland updated their annual tree cover loss dataset and added a new dataset on primary forest loss a breakthrough development for monitoring global forests according to the data the tropics lost around 12 million hectares around 46 300 square miles of tree cover last year of which 3 64 million hectares was primary forest the most biodiverse and carbon dense type of forest 2018 s tree cover loss was down nearly 30 percent from its 2016 high but 2019 may well break that record given the extent of forest fires across the amazon indonesia and africa this year ecosystem services from forests several studies highlighted the potential of forests to help in the battle against climate change research published in proceedings of the national academy of sciences pnas calculated that young forests those under 140 years old are sequestering carbon at a faster rate 1 17 to 1 66 billion metric tons per year than old growth forests 950 million to 1 11 billion metric tons of carbon per year that trend is expected to accelerate as old growth forests continue to be diminished in extent a concern underlined by a study in science advances which concluded the carbon footprint of intact tropical forest loss was six times greater than earlier estimates due to unaccounted effects of forest degradation fragmentation and wildlife loss a study published in nature geoscience estimated the carbon sequestration value of forest elephants concluding that pachyderms increase carbon storage by changing forest structure we found that at a typical density of 0 5 to 1 animals per square kilometer elephant disturbances increase aboveground biomass by 26 to 60 tons per hectare said simone aparecida vieira one of the authors of the study via a press release but hunting is having a huge impact on animals in tropical forests reducing populations of large mammals by 40 on average according to work published in plos biology a journal of tropical ecology paper confirmed that plantations do not replace natural forests when it comes to ecosystem services or biodiversity even long after abandonment plantations agroforestry plots and other planted forests are also a poor substitute for natural forests when it comes to carbon sequestration said scientists writing in the journal nature and regrowing forests in the amazon aren t recovering to the extent needed to match the carbon sequestration of old growth forests found another study published in ecology plants rely on carbon dioxide for growth but scientists have long warned that higher temperatures and reduced rainfall could diminish the capacity of forests to keep pace with rising atmospheric co2 levels a study published in march in biogeosciences provided further confirmation for this concern finding that the carbon uptake of global forests isn t keeping up with co2 emissions from human activities several studies looked at the importance of forests beyond carbon sequestration a paper published in the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences found that deforestation in malawi diminished access to clean water the country s 14 percent loss of forest 2000 and 2010 effectively reduced access to safe drinking water by 9 a study published in plos one reported that climate change could reduce humidity in tropical cloud forests and high elevation páramo grasslands potentially dooming these biodiverse ecosystems research published in environmental research letters provided further evidence that forests reduce the intensity of cyclones brazil s lack of hurricanes is often cited as an example of this phenomenon with the amazon rainforest effectively sapping tropical storms of their strength before then can develop into more damaging hurricanes tipping point for the amazon as 2019 closed out two eminent scientists carlos nobre and thomas lovejoy warned that the amazon rainforest has reached a critical tipping point much sooner than expected meaning the future of the biome is now at stake due to changes in precipitation patterns caused by the combination of deforestation degradation fire and climate change what we predicted is now being observed in real life said nobre a researcher at the university of são paulo it s no longer a theoretical forecast about the future nobre and lovejoy made their dire statement in a commentary published december 20 in science advances pointing to recent research showing that the amazon is in the midst of a sustained drying trend and that amazon tree communities are shifting from rainforest species to drier forest species that raises the prospect that the amazon is already transitioning from rainforest to wooded savanna a scenario that numerous studies have warned could be the outcome if deforestation and climate change reached critical thresholds the development would have major implications for climate change given the amount of carbon stored in the amazon s tropical vegetation and soils it would also affect rainfall patterns across south america and beyond since the amazon functions as a giant regional water pump potentially putting regional agriculture and power generation at risk the impact on wildlife in the world s most biodiverse forest would be immense a separate paper published in may forecast a 1 5 degree celsius rise in temperature in the amazon region by 2050 due to forest loss fires in the amazon are also reducing water security by increasing the rate of glacier melt in the tropical andes by depositing black carbon or soot on ice surfaces according to a paper in nature scientific reports a separate paper published in water by wwf brazil and imazon found that the amazon basin has been losing an average of 35 000 hectares of surface water per year since 1985 due to dam construction deforestation and dry trends floodplains and lagoons which function as critical habitats for a range of species are particularly affected review the americas brazil brazil is the world s largest tropical rainforest country appropriately it also accounted for a large share of the rainforest news in 2019 after the election of president jair bolosnaro in late 2018 who campaigned on the idea of seizing indigenous territories and national parks in the amazon and turning these lands over to miners and ranchers indigenous peoples and the conservation community were braced for a difficult 2019 their fears proved astute deforestation jumped to levels not seen in over a decade murders of environmentalists surged and the bolsonaro administration laid the groundwork for an all out assault on earth s largest rainforest including opening up protected areas to mining and agricultural conversion dismantling environmental law enforcement and actively encouraging deforestation within 100 days of taking office bolsonaro fired a large number of staff at brazil s environmental agency ibama reduced its authority to enforce environmental laws and required the agency to make public announcements including the time and location in advance of planned raids on illegal loggers beyond the substantive efforts to undercut environmental protections the bolosnaro administration launched petty feuds with celebrities gisele bundchen leonardo dicaprio greta thunberg and world leaders who expressed concern about the impact of its policies e g bolsonaro mocked the physical appearance of french president emmanuel macron s wife and rejected fire fighting aid from france environmentalists didn t go down without a fight however their rights and territories threatened indigenous communities put up heated resistance while eight former environmental ministers condemned bolsonaro s policies a group of brazilian lawyers took steps to indict bolsonaro at the international criminal court for encouraging genocide against indigenous people while scientists expressed alarm that bolsonaro s policies could quickly push the amazon to a critical tipping point within a few months of bolsonaro taking office it was clear that the situation on the ground in amazon was fast deteriorating for its forests and native peoples when data from brazil s national institute of space research inpe showed a surge in deforestation bolsonaro disputed the numbers claiming without evidence they had been manipulated and sacking inpe director ricardo magnus osório galvão on august 2 shortly thereafter the agency suspended publication of deforestation data in the midst of rumors that bolsonaro was seeking a private tender to replace brazil s world class deforestation monitoring system while bolsonaro tried silence his nation s space agency and deny the rise in deforestation he couldn t hide from satellites which confirmed a jump in forest destruction still the world wasn t paying a lot of attention to these issues until a weather phenomenon drove smoke from fires burning in the amazon over sao paulo blackening the skies mid day the apocalyptic scene above one of the world s largest cities made global headlines provoking internal outcry criticism of bolsonaro s policies intensified the e u threatened to cancel a long negotiated trade deal while germany suspended aid and norway s largest pension fund klp threatened divestment from brazilian companies associated with deforestation the fires caused a wide range of companies with prodding from activists to examine and re evaluate their supply chains for deforestation and fire risk including for products that move through china like cattle leather and soy a number of celebrities also pledged support to groups working in the amazon ngos with amazon in their name saw a wave of donations while ecosia an eco friendly search engine alternative to google experienced an explosion in traffic prayforamazona trended widely on twitter facing this escalating backlash as well as protests at home and threats of global boycotts of brazilian business bolsonaro backtracked on some of his inflammatory remarks and sent in the military to assist with firefighting but bolsonaro stopped short of taking any meaningful policy measures to undo his damage and soon returned to blaming environmentalists and ngos for the fires without offering evidence for the claims his misinformation campaign was echoed by supporters domestically and abroad while bolsonaro faced condemnation from some political leaders especially in europe he found support from politicians in amazon states the united states and china in a september meeting with nine amazon state governors the governors of acre roraima tocantins rondônia amazonas mato grosso and amapá backed opening up larger parts of the amazon to deforestation agribusiness mining and new roads and railways in another september meeting bolsonaro and president donald trump cut a deal to promote private sector development in the amazon using a 100 million biodiversity conservation fund and president xi jinping of china didn t seem too outwardly concerned about fires or deforestation during in an october meeting with bolsonaro despite china s recent posturing as a leader on climate and its plan to host the u n convention on biodiversity cbd next year in october brazil s national development bank bndes suspended new projects under the amazon fund citing the decision by germany and norway to freeze contributions to the fund in august the european countries took the step after brazil said it would shift foreign aid from amazon conservation projects to cattle ranchers and soybean farmers no one was surprised when brazil in november announced a sharp uptick in deforestation for the year ending july 31 2019 reaching the highest level since 2008 official data published by brazil s national space research institute inpe showed deforestation in the brazilian amazon between august 1 2018 and july 31 2019 amounted to 9 762 square kilometers an increase of 30 percent over the prior year but those numbers didn t even encapsulate the peak deforestation season so the expectation is next year will be far worse analysis of the areas burned during this year s fire season showed that most of the burning visible by satellites occurred in areas where trees had been recently chopped down agricultural landscapes and drier transition forests however the actual on the ground impact is still untold given that sub canopy fires aren t easily detectable by satellite sub canopy fires are particularly damaging in the amazon greatly increasing tree die off and the likelihood of future fires and deforestation after the official deforestation numbers came out bolsonaro again accused ngos of starting fires blaming volunteers of brigada de alter of starting fires in the alter do chão reserve but observers said land grabbers who have a history of forest clearing in the area had a much stronger motive for setting the fires the brigada de alter volunteers were eventually released without charges bolsonaro did face some resistance to his policies from courts public prosecutors and lawmakers for example in may the lower house of congress restores the indigenous affairs agency funai s land demarcation powers though that measure didn t stop land invasions or increased violence against indigenous brazilians invasions of indigenous territories increased from 109 for the whole of 2018 to 160 through the first nine months of 2019 according to the catholic indigenous missionary council in november bolsonaro disappointed environmentalists when his administration revoked a decree that barred new sugar cane plantations from the amazon but at climate talks in spain in december environment minister ricardo salles told the associated press brazil would accept financial aid from rich countries to help rein in rising deforestation peru a report from global witness revealed that over 60 percent of the timber inspected by peru s agency for the supervision of forest resources and wildlife osinfor in the loreto and ucayali regions is illegal in december 2018 the peruvian government attempted to move osinfor under the ministry of environment but was strong armed by the u s government into keeping it as an independent agency an analysis released by the monitoring of the andean amazon project maap found that deforestation from illegal gold mining hit records in 2017 and 2018 when more than 18 000 hectares of forest was destroyed in february the government declared a state of emergency in madre de dios and sent in 1 500 police and military officers to crackdown on wildcat mining in march the government opened a military base in the region to support the operation the peruvian palm oil producers association junpalma pledged to eliminate deforestation for palm oil production by 2021 if the deal holds peru will be the second country in south america after colombia to establish a zero deforestation commitment for palm oil the commitment was secured by the national wildlife federation in collaboration with the local government growers and local ngo sociedad peruana de ecodesarrollo colombia colombia registered the first drop in deforestation since the 2016 peace deal with the farc fuerzas armadas revolucionarias de colombia reporting 198 000 hectares 489 269 acres of forest loss in 2018 down 10 percent from 2017 the peace agreement brought stability to areas that were once off limits to agribusiness due to the threat of violence technology giant apple disclosed more details on a carbon conservation project it s supporting in a colombian mangrove forest in september colombia hosted a summit between seven amazon countries bolivia brazil colombia ecuador guyana peru and suriname agreed to a pact that establishes a disaster response network coordinates satellite monitoring of forests and works to strengthen the participation of indigenous peoples but observers said the deal lacked specifics at climate talks in madrid in december norway germany and britain committed up to 366 million over five years to help colombia reduce deforestation over 80 percent of the money is coming from norway bolivia in june the municipality of ixiamas established the 1 5 million hectare bajo madidi municipal protected area the landscape includes savannas wetlands and rainforest in northwestern bolivia that together with madidi national park in bolivia and tambopata national reserve in peru contributes to a protected area network covering 2 9 million hectares according to the andes amazon fund which worked with the wyss campaign for nature conservation international bolivia and the asociación boliviana para la investigación y conservación de ecosistemas andino amazónicos aceaa to establish the protected area in july bolivian president evo morales signed legislation that weakened restrictions on fire setting and deforestation in the eastern lowlands once the dry season started fires quickly burned out of control especially in the chiquitano forests that transition between the dry chaco forest and the humid amazon rainforest overall an area of land larger than costa rica burned outrage over fires and the slowness of morales to respond provoked large scale protests that contributed to the president s resignation ecuador in april a provincial court ruled that the ecuadorian government could not auction the oil rights to traditional waorani lands because the tribe had not been sufficiently consulted the decision could affect auctions of oil blocks covering nearly 3 million hectares of indigenous territories mesoamerica mexico s indigenous lacandon continue to battle settlers in the last remaining tropical rainforest in north america deforestation in laguna del tigre guatemala s largest national park appeared to surge this year according to data from global forest watch forest clearing also seems to be on the rise in río plátano biosphere reserve in honduras drug traffickers who clear land to establish cattle ranches as a mechanism for money laundering are reported to be a factor in both parks at cop25 climate talks in madrid the governments of all eight members of the central american commission for environment and development ccad belize costa rica the dominican republic el salvador guatemala honduras nicaragua and panama proposed the 5 great forests initiative to protect and restore the five large remaining forests in central america under the plan the countries would end all illegal cattle ranching within the forests work to ensure that no wildlife species in the great forests goes extinct and improve the livelihoods of forest dependent peoples the 5 great forests initiatives covers 10 million hectares africa congo basin nations deforestation remain on an upward trend in the congo basin driven by increased clearing in the democratic republic of congo drc and cameroon as well as expansion of logging road networks which grant access to remote forest areas across the region work on a major road project that would link cameroon and the republic of congo continued despite concern on the impact on forests and wildlife in early 2019 reuters broke the news that former drc president joseph kabila in december 2018 awarded an oil drilling license inside salonga national park a unesco world heritage site republic of congo opened nouabalé ndoki national park to oil exploration but also secured 65 million in funding for forest conservation from the central african forest initiative the contrast between the policy developments was difficult for critics to digest despite ongoing political turmoil gabon secured up to 150 million from norway for maintaining a low deforestation rate over the next ten years while gabon has been heralded in conservation sectors for its commitment to establishing protected areas the country has seen increased interest from the agribusiness sector for industrial plantations drc s virunga national park reopened to visitors again after 8 month closure due to violence including the killing of seven park rangers buzzfeed investigated allegations that conservation rangers trained by wwf committed atrocities against suspected poachers and community members in cameroon and drc several reports highlighted rising deforestation in cameroon due to rubber palm oil and charcoal although a deforestation ban implemented in december 2018 by rubber supply group halcyon agri on a concession controlled by its subsidiary sudcam in cameroon seems to be holding a study published in nature climate change reported the dry season in the congo rainforest is getting longer and more intense raising concerns about the future of the ecosystem madagascar andry rajoelina took over as madagascar s president in january given the environmental carnage that occurred during his first stint in power which followed a 2009 coup d état conservationists expressed deep concern about the fate of the island nation s fast disappearing forests and increasing threatened wildlife but so far rajoelina s administration has surprised the conservation community by calling for international assistance in combatting forest fires laying out an ambitious reforestation plan and withdrawing its request to cites to sell its rosewood stocks the president is said to be considering conservation priorities laid out in a resolution put forth by the association of tropical biology and conservation atbc at a meeting madagascar hosted in july asia pacific and australia indonesia indonesia and norway agreed on a first performance based payment from a 1 billion redd deal signed back in 2010 it took nearly a decade to indonesia to work out the legislative and policy frameworks to make the deal a reality the indonesian military took over construction of the controversial trans papua road which will cut through lorentz national park a unesco world heritage site in december 2018 19 construction workers were killed working on the project which has exacerbated tensions in the region and raised concerns about increased deforestation and social conflict joko widodo popularly known as jokowi was re elected as president of indonesia siti nurbaya bakar stayed on as environment and forestry minister but activists expressed concern that some of the new cabinet members were associated with oligarchs political elites and the national security apparatus and would therefore push for weakening environmental protections and increasing investment in plantations mining and energy crops in march a senior indonesian minister warned that indonesia might pull out of the paris climate accord if the european union moved to phase out incentives for palm oil based biofuels critics noted that such a move would be self defeating given the projected impacts of ongoing deforestation and climate change on the country indonesia seemed to change tactics later in the year when it announced a plan to create a new palm oil agency to conduct audits of its palm oil certification scheme in an effort to boost the reputation of the product in december indonesia moved forward with a world trade organization lawsuit against the e u over its proposed phase out of palm oil based biofuel due to environmental concerns authorities seized more than 400 containers of illegally logged timber from maluku and papua in a five month period exacerbating concerns about the country s svlk timber certification scheme svlk is the system the e u relies upon to verify timber imports from indonesia are legal indonesia published its first ever map of customary forests as part of a constitutional court mandated process to recognize traditional land claims the map identifies some 470 000 hectares of untitled land as hutan adat or customary forests used or claimed by indigenous communities but indigenous rights group

customary forest the government puts the figure much lower the controversial batang toru dam which scientists say puts the survival of the world s most recently discovered ape in jeopardy the tapanuli orangutan remained in the headlines throughout 2019 backers of the dam including the indonesian government continued to make a case for the project but interest from mainstream financiers waned as concerns about the project continued to mount a scandal emerged when when a researcher claimed his signature was forged in a document used to obtain a permit for the dam activists say dam proponents are using heavy handed tactics against critics a concern that gained wider attention after the suspicious death of golfrid siregar a 34 year old environmental activist and legal aide who was involved in a lawsuit against the project jokowi s administration made a national moratorium on forest clearance permanent but observers noted that the moratorium s many loopholes have allowed deforestation to persist at high levels since it was first established in 2011 jokowi announced indonesia would move its capital from jakarta to east kalimantan on the island of borneo environmentalists immediately expressed concern about increased deforestation and just a few months later wildfires were spotted burning at the site of the new capital which was chosen in part because it was believed to be at low risk from fires and other disasters a provincial court in central kalimantan fined a supplier of palm oil giant musim mas group 18 5 million for fires that burned on its concession in kalimantan in 2015 but there are doubts the government will ultimately collect the money given that only 5 5 million of 223 million in judgments have been collected since 2015 indonesia s supreme court held the government liable for the 2015 fires that burned hundreds of thousands of hectares of forest and peatlands the court ordered the government to take steps to mitigate forest fires the ruling came down as fires began to burn in sumatra and kalimantan the fires went on to burn for months while initial analysis concluded that most of the fires burned scrub and degraded areas rather than healthy rainforests because they burned on peatlands they are thought to have released twice as much carbon as this year s fires in the amazon jokowi called the fires a national embarrassment and the world

pointed to the weakening of forest protection laws as a key factor in soaring deforestation in new south wales and queensland the board of the wet tropics management authority which works to protect the unesco world heritage rainforest in north queensland issued a dire statement in april that the region s rainforest was in accelerating decline due to deforestation degradation and the impacts of climate change the board noted australia s tropical rainforests faced greater risk of fire those fears became realiity in august 2019 when fires started to burn across wide swathes of the east coast of australia by the third week in december some three million hectares of land had burned across the country including old growth forests 20 of the blue mountains world heritage area went up in flames consumption researchers writing in the journal global environmental change argued that a shift away from meat and dairy production to plant based alternatives could curb demand for agricultural land by 11 percent worldwide reducing pressure on forests and other ecosystems a senior executive at nestlé said humankind will need to cut down on meat consumption if it hopes to address issues like

app s competitor april is also sourcing from the suppliers after research showed that brazilian meatpacking giant jbs circumvented the amazon cattle agreement by continuing to buy from ranchers who illegally cleared forests the company moved to conceal information about its supply chain and sourcing practices palm oil in 2019 palm oil prices remained low relative to the past decade though there was a run up in the price at the end of the year low prices dampened enthusiasm for developing marginal projects but palm oil does remain the most profitable form of agricultural land use in much of the tropics so forests and peatlands continued to be converted for plantations the biggest palm oil story of the year was the dispute between the european union and palm oil producers malaysia and indonesia over the european commission s criteria for sustainable biofuels in march the european commission effectively limited use of palm oil in its renewable fuels standard due the emissions generated by conversion of rainforests and peatlands to oil palm plantations despite intense lobbying by the palm oil sector and the malaysian and indonesian governments most palm oil based biodiesel now does not qualify as a low emissions biofuel in europe malaysia and indonesia reacted angrily to the decision with indonesia threatening to pull out of the paris climate accord and later filing a world trade organization lawsuit against the e u malaysia said it would take steps to improve the environmental performance of its domestic palm oil production including announcing it would allow plantation maps to be made public a move that could boost the roundtable on sustainable palm oil rspo a certification body a study published in world development found that conversion of forests to oil palm plantations has mixed benefits for local communities in borneo with forest dependent communities seeing the least upside from palm oil including a drop in relative economic well being cifor published a report that attributed 39 of forest loss in borneo since 2000 to palm oil rainforest foundation norway warned that the aviation industry s proposed shift toward biofuels could drive deforestation for feedstocks like soy and palm oil blackrock the world s largest fund manager found itself under fire for its investments in sectors that drive deforestation including palm oil in southeast asia and agribusiness in the amazon cocoa the spotlight was on the cocoa sector in 2019 pressuring cacao producers and buyers to commit to reducing their environmental footprint in march côte d ivoire ivory coast ghana and several major chocolate and cocoa companies released action plans to end deforestation under the cocoa forests initiative which launched in november 2017 at the un climate change conference in bonn germany mars mondelēz olam and nestlé were among the companies to establish zero deforestation policies for their supply chains improving the sustainability of cocoa will require a substantial overhaul of the current system for example the washington post found significant lapses in the compliance review process of utz the world s largest verifier of certified cocoa utz had certified nearly 5 000 farms that operated in protected areas in côte d ivoire the involvement of big cocoa companies also raised concerns among some groups in côte d ivoire who warned that the country s new forestry code increases the risk cocoa poses to west african forests potentially allowing the conversion of degraded protected forests and community agroforestry plots to cacao farms managed by international companies united states and tropical forests in september the california air resources board voted 7 4 to approve the tropical forest standard a framework for allowing entities in the state of california to offset some of their carbon emissions by supporting forest conversation projects in specific jurisdictions in tropical countries the measure had been championed for years by supporters of reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation redd a u n mechanism for compensating tropical countries for conserving their forests but faced opposition from some environmental and social justice groups that view offsets as letting polluters off the hook for their emissions the tropical forest standard includes a number of safeguards but its critics aren t convinced these will be enough to protect forests or their inhabitants the tropical forest standard could drive up to 1 billion in direct funding for tropical forests by 2030 and establish a model that could be followed by other states and countries california lawmakers failed to pass california deforestation free procurement act ab 572 legislation that would have required the state to

to gain traction in 2019 with a surge in interest in meat replacement options even fast food chains like burger king with the impossible whopper jumped on the bandwagon europe and deforestation in the tropics europe s role in driving deforestation garnered a lot of attention in 2019 one study calculated that one sixth of the carbon footprint of the average european s diet can be directly linked to deforestation in tropical countries palm oil soybeans beef timber cocoa and rubber are the main culprits palm oil was again a major source of tension between europe and major palm oil producers indonesia and malaysia france said it would stop deforestation imports by 2030 through stricter sourcing guidelines for agricultural commodities most often associated with tropical forest clearing

improve the effectiveness of zero deforestation commitments by functioning as an alert system and capturing data on biodiversity and forest health providing more information than satellites alone bioacoustics is a fast growing field in the conservation space a research team in brazil used lidar to discover the amazon s tallest tree a red angelim that stood 88 5 meters just over 290 feet tall a similar approach in malaysian borneo discovered the tallest tree in the tropics over 94 meters in height in 2016 xprize an organization that has held more than a dozen competitions on topics ranging

brazilian and argentinian corn farmers had to juggle many balls at once in 2019 and that will again be the case in 2020 as volatility caused by a devastating disease on the other side of the globe and domestic political scenarios is set to continue brazil and argentina benefited from good weather in 2019 during seeding and again during the development stage resulting in a bumper crop according to the us department of agriculture brazilian farmers harvest including the first and second crops topped 100 million mt of the cereal for the first time argentinian farmers also harvested a record crop of more than 50 million mt of corn for the first time in history brazil s 2019 20 total corn crop is expected by market analysts to be around 100 million mt but as the majority of the country s corn crop is planted after the soybean harvest and soybean seeding was delayed initially it is too early to say with confidence whether this volume will be repeated or surpassed the argentinian corn crop for the 2019 20 season is also expected to be very good at around 50 million mt according to usda corn planting was initially delayed by low soil moisture but has already reached the five year average of more than 50 of the expected area by mid december development conditions for january are expected to be favorable but the weather is still a risk to producers hopes domestic corn consumption in brazil increased in 2019 compared with previous years as a result of two factors that will remain front and center in 2020 swine fever firstly african swine fever outbreaks in asia increased demand for imported poultry and pork the higher demand combined with a stronger us dollar against the brazilian real led brazil to increase hog production for export which in turn boosted domestic corn demand second corn usage for ethanol production also rose during the past year with new corn only and flex sugarcane and ethanol mills in brazilian center west regions according to the corn ethanol national union unem five new plants will be ready in mato grosso by 2021 there are also projects planned in roraima and goias states according to private analyst agroconsult domestic corn consumption in brazil is expected to increase to 66 3 million mt in 2020 from 62 4 million mt in 2019 this increase is largely expected to be biased toward animal feed requirements which are expected to increase to 53 4 million mt from 51 1 million mt and ethanol production where demand is forecast to rise to 4 million mt from 2 7 million mt corn exports in 2019 posted fresh records in both south american countries the early harvest and the record yield from the second corn crop in brazil of more than 5 8 mt ha combined with a good crop size in argentina pressured fob prices attracting demand from elsewhere in the world in the first 11 months of 2019 brazil and argentina exported more than 70 million mt of corn between them as brazilian exports were strong at the second half of the year stocks are expected to end 2019 lower than usual and imports from other origins might be necessary to fulfill domestic demand before the harvest of the second crop in june and july 2020 according to market sources most of the imports will come from argentina and paraguay but additional origins such as the us are also possible brazilian corn exports are forecast to total 40 million mt between february 2019 and january 2020 according to conab the government s food supply and statistics agency but estimates from the market including conab and s p global analytics predict exports of between 30 million mt and 36 million mt in the following year in argentina producers have already sold a good volume of 2020 crop to exporters which could ensure a good start of the new crop export season in march and april as there are many uncertainties about the political situation in the country the maintenance of such strong export volumes in 2020 will be closely linked to farmers inclinations when it comes to sales argentinian corn producers consider their production as an asset valued in us dollars and might hold onto stocks if they believe there is more uncertainty ahead reducing the country s exports s p global platts analytics expects argentina to export 33 million mt of corn in the 2019 2020 marketing year march 2020 february 2021 compared with the usda s estimate of 36 million mt for the 2018 19 marketing year political change both of the two largest south american countries faced uncertain political situations over the past 12 months in brazil president jair bolsonaro took the office in early january and while his first year in the post has been controversial some economical advances were possible after months of negotiations congress approved pension reforms inflation became more manageable at less than 4 a year and official interest rates ended the year at the country s lowest ever level of 4 5 a year however brazil is still struggling to boost its gdp and was expected to end the year with a growth rate of slightly more than 1 despite slow economic growth the brazilian agribusiness sector is growing faster than other areas of the economy according to applied economic research institute ipea agribusiness gdp will expand 1 4 in 2019 and 3 2 to 3 7 in 2019 according to ipea and conab in december forecast a total grains production increase of 1 9 when drilling down for corn the forecast estimates an increase of 0 3 in the planted area but a 1 6 decrease on production due to a lower yield argentina s political situation was even more complicated the center left candidate alberto fernandez won the presidential election in the first round in october and took the office in early december uncertainties about commodity export taxes were rife the taxes were raised from 4 pesos to a fixed percentage of 12 by the new government in its first week on the job and could be raised an additional 3 before the end of the year observers say further shifts cannot be ruled out that forced argentinian exporters to hurry up their corn export registrations for 2019 and early 2020 loadings to pre empt any potential tax increases in the months ahead producers were more reticent to sell their remaining volumes as they had already made substantial sales and consider their commodities a reserve of value in us dollars despite some reports of a slowing of sales by farmers after the elections exporters will start 2020 with a large volume of corn bought for new crop loading in brazil the higher dollar and favorable prices in the local currency boosted sales for export in the second and third quarter of 2019 leading to a low availability of corn that could be sold on at the end of the year in the fourth quarter most of the origination was concentrated on the domestic market as the feed market heated up on favorable meat producing margins buyers were willing to pay a premium of up to 20 to the export market price to attract producers interest and to keep

26 12 2019 listen a colleague has asked my opinion on the subject ever increasing number of disadvantaged youths in liberia i used the cause and effect explanation of the implication in a blunt note i made academic and social inquiries on the subject immediately i ran through the perspective of aristotle when he dealt with the topic the purpose of the state the state aristotle tells us which originated for the sake of life continues for the sake of the best life in another academic inquiry this time the communist manifesto the materialist conception of history the foundation of marxist thoughts holds the belief that the mode of production in material life determines the general character of the social political and spiritual processes of life thus the economic structure of society is the real foundation on which rise the legal and political superstructures and which defines the character of the society it is important to sort this perspective as the two correspond with the foundation of my argument and opinion severe economic paralysis as of this writing the skyrocketing inflation is 28 per cent and this has several negative economic implications on the income of the rural poor peasants and the urban masses the world bank and the imf report the economic growth forecast for 2019 is now at 0 4 per cent from 4 7percent the budgetary deficit for fiscal year 2018 2019 has reached its peak of us 225 million the aftermath of which hamper progress in civilian goods government projects in road connectivity education healthcare infrastructure etc note the downtrodden masses suffer the most zero foreign direct investments maybe because of a lack of trust in weah led government unemployment is at its unprecedented level of 83 per cent especially among young people thus the bulk of the young people get themselves involved in unproductive activities banditry the liberian dollars is hotly devaluing against the united states dollars which has its root because we are not adding values to the commanding weight of our economy production and distribution activities can determine money value the country is fast retrogressing towards heavily indebted poor country as public external debt stock is calculated us 987 8 million what liberia faces is a giant size economic downturn in the making which tends to increase the crime rate and other crime related activities like some commentators in certain quarters would say a father who can t find job integrity is under threat the economy is on the verge of collapsing meanwhile the root cause of the static no growth economy from a broad outlook is imperialist capitalism which got imposed on liberia and african people by the west the features are based on the centralization financial and concentration of the commanding heights of a country s economy in the hands of globalized finance capital and transnational corporations more so some of the consequences of this economic model can be posed thus imagine there are no shortages of unoccupied arable lands in the rural areas yet we still order tomatoes rice from other countries including china the government continues to be aid dependent i invite the president and the entire government to read dambisa moyo zambian economist scholarly research book dead aid why aid is not working and how there is a better way for africa the book will widen he and his team understanding about the subject in the opening part of this work i put out two perspectives one from aristotle and the other from marxist thought liberia declared itself a republic which means citizens have equal status before the law i ask you what is equality when true economic freedom don t have meaningful livelihood the vast majority of the people stay in native reserves under economic living conditions aristotle was right the state originated for the sake of life continues for the sake of the best life since the economic structure of society the real foundation on which rise legal and political superstructures and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness if this so bad economic system practised in liberia is responsible for increase in disadvantaged youth which signals new criminal inflation fears it might be true that there are other factors that is not for me to detail since this is most economical gearing toward the ever green subject of disadvantaged youth this is not unique to disadvantaged youths all other sectors same stories with different names suffer the same because of the same root cause imperialist capitalism the economic power of any nation determines how the citizenry responds to social activities or general growth retributive approach and social justice it was estimated by the independent national commission on human rights inchr in august 2016 the total number of prisoners recorded across liberia were 2 354 1 960 in prisons and 394 in detention facilities inchr report indicates that the number of prisoners tripled daily particularly at the monrovia central prison mcp with this unprecedented and unwanted report it is probably better for one to employ wisdom in postulating the proper interpretation of the root causes it is worth noting that prison approach is obviously retributive as asserted in the breakfast section of this work liberia faces a huge economic downturn which has dehumanized its people and get them twisted spiritually mentally and physically thus increasing banditry or criminal activities within the country in return the government tends to use the retributive approach on the contrary some people have taken the decision to be bona fide gangsters and drugs users and gamblers rationally the assertion is not to morally justify criminal actions however due to it triple number one can generalize that the pyramid economic system is more criminal than the criminals in various prison systems therefore it is better for government to establish a country based upon a concept of practical social justice peace equality and justice for all the former promotes equilibrium that is every citizen will have an economic fair start whether he she is from extremely poor home or rich family this will wipe away the rotten system and set the stage for national transformation where do we go from here systematically liberia s problem is economical as well as political therefore it needs to be addressed politically and economically predicated upon this liberia needs to pinpoint toward the democratic socialism the democratic means of achieving socialism objectives the state must take ownership of the means of production and distribution imperialist capitalism has failed in liberia and the rest of africa it is only rational in this current dispensation to change the pattern of the means of production and distribution to create a robust economy for liberia we can achieve it through a mature revolutionary leadership of progressive forces progressive forces must inculcate consciousness in the minds of the masses especially in the hinterland they also need to place caution and emphasis on the dark days of politics as the african proverb goes the best time to plant a tree is twenty years ago the second best time is now the time for total transformation is now onward to african socialist revolution i write for history sallia s komala a student studying economics at

produce roughly five times the co2 emissions of all current global air travel as more power is required to cool these data centers the warmer the planet will become and as consumer electronics get cheaper and more disposable the more they will leach their minerals into our groundwater poisoning the future to achieve sustainability we will need to treat technological change and environmental

of our time is automation and by 2030 we ll be experiencing its full effects on our economy and society technology can improve lives it can also take away jobs this is in large part how we have already ended up in a world where 78 percent of people are living paycheck to paycheck most new jobs are contract or gig work and recent college graduates are drowning in debt while also being underemployed children are experiencing depression and loneliness at record rates because of smartphones and social media without understanding and getting ahead of much of this we ll end up at the mercy of the big tech companies we need to re evaluate the way we view work put people over profits and create an economy that works for us instead of the other way around i fear what will happen if

this past year for the u s economy was a year of ongoing growth but high uncertainty driven by trade policy along with weaker global demand a key element of the slowdown in u s gdp growth in 2019 was weaker business fixed investment dragged down by a weakening of the u s manufacturing sector due to weaker oil drilling activity the six week long gm uaw strike the cancellation of orders at boeing weaker global demand uncertainty about u s trade policy the strong dollar a flat automobile market and range bound residential construction activity despite weakness in both business investment and the manufacturing sector the consumer sector has been a key source of strength and stability for the u s economy over this past year consumer spending has been increasing at a faster rate than gdp for several quarters now supported by a tight labor market unfortunately the tight labor market has not given the economy the expected wage growth or inflation many have hoped for weaker than expected inflation has been an important factor in monetary policy with the fed initiating three consecutive 25 bps rate cuts in june due to softer global conditions and low inflation as announced at the

rttnews the major u s index futures are currently pointing to a higher opening on friday with stocks likely to see further upside after climbing to new record highs in the previous session stocks have moved steadily higher throughout much of the past month rarely showing significant moves to the upside but also refraining from the pullbacks typically seen as traders cash in on recent strength the perpetual advance comes as the news the u s and china reached an agreement on a phase one trade deal has helped lift some of the uncertainty hanging over the markets buying interest has remained somewhat subdued however as the details of the deal are still unknown and the trade dispute between the u s and china will persist even after the agreement is signed as the same time the somewhat stifled nature of the rally has made traders reluctant to take profits amid concerns about missing out on any further upside today s trading may reflect another in a long string of modest advances as traders look to do some further window dressing going into the end of the year nonetheless many traders remain away from their desks following the christmas holiday on wednesday and the new year s day holiday next wednesday potentially leading to some volatility a lack of major u s economic data may also keep traders on the sidelines as they attempt to deduce what is in store for the economy in the new year stocks moved mostly higher during trading on thursday although volume was relatively light following the christmas day holiday on wednesday the major averages climbed to new record closing highs with the nasdaq closing above 9 000 for the first time ever the major averages saw further upside going into the close ending the session at their best levels of the day the dow rose 105 94 points or 0 4 percent to 28 621 39 the nasdaq advanced 69 51 points or 0 8 percent to 9 022 39 and the s p 500 climbed 16 53 points or 0 5 percent to 3 239 91 the markets continued to benefit from recent upward momentum which has helped stocks continually reach new record highs in recent sessions the likely signing of a phase one u s china trade deal has helped to maintain positive sentiment on wall street over the past couple weeks stocks have continued to trudge higher despite a lack of major catalysts with traders seemingly reluctant to cash in on recent gains amid worries about missing out on further upside window dressing and the so called santa claus rally may continue to propel stocks higher even as trading remains subdued due to the christmas and new year s day holidays adding to the positive sentiment the labor department released a report showing a continued pullback in first time claims for u s unemployment benefits in the week ended december 21st the labor department said initial jobless claims fell to 222 000 a decrease of 13 000 from the previous week s revised level of 235 000 economists had expected jobless claims to drop to 224 000 from the 234 000 originally reported for the previous week jobless claims fell for the second straight week after reaching their highest level since september of 2017 in the week ended december 7th most of the major sectors ended the day showing only modest moves although gold stocks extended the rally seen over the two previous sessions reflecting the strength in the sector the nyse arca gold bugs index surged up by 1 5 percent to its best closing level in over three years the continued strength among gold stocks came amid a notable increase by the price of the precious metal with gold for february delivery climbing

the world s prominent organizations such as the international monetary fund imf the world bank and the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd foresee that trade wars global climate change threats disruptive technological developments and the war of hegemony between the great powers will continue to occupy the world s agenda in 2020 these four major and long term risks and threats are doomed to hit global politics that means international growth trade production and employment will be shaped by these negative developments the year 2020 is thought to be one of global injustice as the imbalanced use of wealth and the lack of equal access to natural resources will come forward sadly health services are another problem to solve and the insensitivity of superpowers such as the u s in particular toward pollution is another major problem at hand in the midst of all these injustices and inequalities the global economy will continue to witness trade and currency wars giant companies will try to swallow minor ones moreover the u k s divorce deal the eu s intra crisis nato s ambiguous future cybersecurity attacks the consumer malaise on a global scale and the endless greediness of the banking system worldwide will continue meanwhile the global debt spiral which is expected to approach 260 trillion at the end of the year triple the global national income will continue to be one of the priority agenda items the leading economists are worried that if the economically powerful countries attempt to postpone the problems of the global system with short term public finance i e budgetary measures and expansionary monetary policies in other words with temporary measures to save the day the world will be dragged into greater troubles for decades to come another concern for 2020 is the deterioration of economic outlook due to concerns of uncertainty about when global trade and exchange wars will end nevertheless 2019 is a candidate to go down in history as one of the years where risky assets earned the most in other words the global financial system professionals are trying to invite institutional and individual investors to invest in things like the orchestra which was playing until the last minute in the titanic which sank by running into an iceberg the year 2020 will also be one in which we need to carefully monitor global commodity prices especially oil and gold prices future and beyond the upcoming year will be a cornerstone to a decade where countries who are in intense competition with each other in the field of trade energy and transportation corridors face conflicts we have already observed the signs of this many times in 2019 the latest development was the decision to impose heavy sanctions on companies involved in the north stream 2 project between russia and germany which came into play when u s president donald trump approved the u s 2020 defense budget germany saw this step as a heavy intervention in the internal affairs of its country and of the european union on the other hand the u s side clearly states this message i lifted the 40 year ban on the export of energy from american lands at the end of 2015 i sold the first oil to italy and the natural gas to poland i also want to export energy to the biggest energy consumer europe so i want you to buy oil and natural gas from me not mainly from russia and iran another goal of the u s is undoubtedly to reduce russia s export revenue mainly coming from energy this is because russia which has a foreign trade surplus thanks to its energy exports can protect its value and economy against global manipulations and attacks with its strong central bank reserves while keeping new opportunities in the defense field and keeping hard power opportunities alive however does the u s and russia have interests in syria iraq even libya and the eastern mediterranean conflict conversely it largely overlaps the more the middle east is dragged into chaos and grapples with regional problems or the eastern mediterranean experiences severe tensions and uncertainty delaying the countries in the region from selling their energy derivatives to europe the better it is for the u s and russia therefore turkey who has assumed a meaningful and valuable initiative in the name of regional peace and tranquility especially for security in syria and iraq and stabilization of libya is also offering iraq lebanon jordan palestine israel and even egypt to act together in order to meet europe s energy needs greece and the greek cypriot administration on the other hand continues to seek ways to bypass turkey and meet the energy demand of europe siding with israel the historic agreement that was carried out between libya and turkey is of critical importance in terms of not only the regional energy corridors but also the regional trade corridors and regional transport corridors as the decade takes its shape we will always remember the importance of this geo strategic and diplomatic step
we asked this panel of san diego experts to predict what the economy will look like in 2020 look at the bottom of the article for detailed predictions question what economic indicator will you monitor most closely in 2020 advertisement chris van gorder scripps health answer gdp growth i would say that the most important economic indicator in 2020 will be the gdp growth rate while the u s economy has performed well in comparison to that of most other countries if the gdp growth rate continues to decline in 2020 we will likely be heading into a recession the most influential factors will be the resolution of the trade conflict with china and the outcome of the presidential election norm miller university of san diego answer several as usual i will monitor the economic signals that most closely tell the story of economic progress for average americans total employment wages productivity and labor participation i will closely watch the u s china trade talks which could spell more need to subsidize farmers and others hurt by tariffs any modifications to the salt limits which will matter to ca residents i will not watch consumer confidence which is a lagging indicator nor unemployment which are not reliable signals jamie moraga intellisolutions answer consumer confidence one to track would be the consumer confidence index consumers usually spend more money when they feel optimistic in their future financial outlook which helps fuel the economy when consumers are more pessimistic they usually restrict their spending and tend to save more which can impede the growth of the economy this monthly survey can be a good pulse of the u s economy and serve as a warning of turning points in economic activity advertisement james hamilton uc san diego answer german bond yields europe has been the weak sister that will fall first if there is a global downturn if europe goes into recession they could bring us down with them the depressed yield on german bonds is a sign that people are still afraid to invest in other european countries sweden has seen enough growth to escape from its negative interest rates and i hope the same will soon be true for the broader euro area phil blair manpower answer unemployment maybe it s because i am in the hr business but i think having a job is key to so many other issues we face in our daily life gas can be expensive housing can be high stocks can be low but if i have a job and feel like i can support myself and my family i am much more comfortable weathering just about anything that comes my way out of a job and

deliveries but trade employment election year economics and consumer confidence will play significant roles in 2020 this will be the most divisive election year we have ever seen and politics will play a large role alan gin university of san diego answer the unemployment rate while i don t expect the economy to go into a recession in 2020 i do think it will slow one impact of this will be slower job growth which will lead to an increase in the unemployment rate both locally and nationally employment is critical to the economy as it affects things such as the housing market retail sales car sales etc weakness in those areas due to higher unemployment could lead to more layoffs and a continuation of the cycle austin neudecker rev answer u s trade deficit i am interested to see what impact the various completed and looming trade negotiations will have on the balance of imports and exports especially with our core trading partners china canada mexico i am also interested in trade with the e u and how it might be effected by brexit advertisement david ely san diego state university answer nonresidential fixed investment after rising by 6 4 percent in 2018 real nonresidential fixed investment declined in the second and third quarters of 2019 uncertainty arising from trade tensions and concern over global economic growth caused businesses to take a more cautious approach toward investing if the passage of usmca and the u s china phase one trade deal lowers trade tensions then business investment should contribute more toward gdp growth in 2020 than it did in 2019 gary london london moeder advisors answer consumer spending i believe that consumer confidence expressed in our spending levels will determine economic trends over the next year and this is a huge part of our economy i am tempted to add manufacturing output which i believe will continue to decline since we are already in a full employment economy with little room to grow without much immigration but 2020 is shaping up to be the peak of the cycle coupled with this being an election year consumer confidence should drive the economy in one direction or the other kelly cunningham san diego institute for economic research answer inflation the economy continues to be propped up with extraordinary stimulus both monetary and fiscal this amount of stimulus usually follows steep economic downturns not during healthy growth interest rates have never been close to zero for so long with inflation near 2 percent the federal reserve has little leeway to further cut rates to bolster economic momentum

by mr sharma is an author global investor and contributing opinion writer after the turn of the millennium the united states suffered its weakest decade of economic growth in the post world war ii era and served as ground zero of the global financial crisis forecasters predicted a long american decline instead over the course of the 2010s the united states staged a comeback as an economic superpower and even more as a financial superpower the united states economy grew faster than other rich countries and navigated the decade without suffering a single recession a first since records began in the 1850s defying the declinists the united states was one of only two major countries alongside china to expand its share of the global economy in the 2010s with central banks consumers and investors around the world increasingly eager to hold dollars the greenback ruled global money flows as never before the american stock market rose 200 percent in the 2010s while the rest of the world

guide the 2020s will be anything but another american decade economic trends that define one decade rarely define the next this cycle has repeated itself throughout the postwar era america was the hottest story in the world economy and markets in the 1960s but gave way to emerging nations in the 1970s and japan in the 1980s before rising again in the 1990s after the turn of the millennium emerging nations made another strong run and by 2010 forecasters were predicting that emerging markets would be the story of the next century excluding china emerging countries as a group saw their share of the global economy shrink during the 2010s the average annual gain for emerging stock markets was close to zero their worst decade since the 1930s why does this cycle play out in such a predictable way the answer is straightforward after a good run national leaders grow complacent and start spending irresponsibly businesses and consumers run up debts investors end up overpaying for stocks and the dominant companies get lethargic and fall back into the pack the united states at the dawn of the 2020s is a complacent land with a rising government deficit spreading corporate debts and swollen prices not only for the stock of megacorporations like amazon and alphabet but also for financial assets of all kinds meanwhile many other countries particularly in the emerging world were forced by pressing financial circumstances to spend the last decade reducing deficits and debt and enacting reforms that should put their economies in a position to grow more rapidly quietly global economic forces are shifting in ways that could set the stage for a comeback by smaller nations and businesses in the 2020s the heads of major financial institutions addressed the financial crisis inquiry commission jan 13 2010 illustration by the new york times photograph by doug mills the new york times as the united states and china battle to contain each other their titanic struggle is scaring off trade and investment that is instead shifting to smaller countries including vietnam taiwan mexico the netherlands and ireland to insulate themselves from the superpower trade war nations like brazil and japan are signing regional and bilateral trade deals the big american tech companies in contrast face a global regulatory backlash against their monopolistic power these giants have bought out smaller rivals and driven many out of business but they also enable many others because their platforms allow millions of entrepreneurs to reach wide audiences often catering to specific national or regional tastes it used to be that big companies competed for limited shelf space in retail stores by winning consumer trust in multiyear multibillion dollar tv ad campaigns now internet platforms allow small companies to bypass stores win public trust instantly through consumer reviews and build a brand on cheap internet ads even free youtube videos globalization is thus gradually giving way to localization which makes this a promising time for countries with domestic markets large enough to support significant expansion in local businesses that s especially true of countries where the population is still relatively young and fast growing like indonesia the philippines egypt and mexico though stock markets worldwide are still dominated by mega caps companies with a market value or capitalization above 200 billion they face an emerging challenge from companies below that threshold in finance the hottest companies are digital payment apps and the small banks that back them in insurance the hot subsector is mobile internet insurance services insurtech the fastest growing american food and beverage manufacturers are small ones search ketchup an american staple once virtually synonymous with a single brand and you will find more than 680 results including local purveyors selling flavors such as bacon driven by apps that serve as gateways to food delivery services

for a century the gop has been bankrolled by big business and wall street president donald trump wants to keep the money rolling in his signature tax cut which was passed two years ago has helped u s corporations score record profits and the stock market reach all time highs to spur even more corporate generosity for the 2020 election trump is suggesting more giveaways acting white house chief of staff mick mulvaney recently told an assemblage of ceos that trump wants to go beyond his 2017 tax cut trump also wants to expand his working class base in rallies and countless tweets he claims to be restoring the american working class by holding back immigration and trade most incumbent republicans and gop candidates are mimicking trump s economic nationalism as former trump consigliere stephen bannon boasted recently we ve turned the republican party into a working class party keeping the gop the party of big money while making it over into the party of the working class is a tricky maneuver especially at a time when capital and labor are engaged in the most intense economic contest in more than a century because so much wealth and power are going to the top armed with deductions and loopholes america s largest companies paid an average federal tax rate of only 11 3 on their profits last year roughly half the official rate under the new tax law the lowest effective corporate tax rate in more than 80 years the tax cut has shifted more of the total tax burden to workers payroll taxes made up 7 8 of national income last year while corporate taxes made up just 0 9 the biggest gap in nearly two decades all told taxes on workers accounted for 35 of federal tax revenue in 2018 taxes on corporations only 9 almost nothing has trickled down to ordinary workers corporations have used most of their tax savings to buy back their shares giving the stock market a sugar high the typical american household remains poorer today than it was before the financial crisis began in 2007 trump s giant tax cut has caused the federal budget deficit to balloon even as pretax corporate profits have reached record highs corporate tax revenues have dropped about a third under projected levels this requires more federal dollars for interest on the debt leaving fewer for public services workers need the trump administration has already announced a 4 5 billion cut in food stamp benefits that would affect an estimated 10 000 families many at the lower end of the working class the administration is also proposing to reduce social security disability benefits a potential blow to hundreds of thousands of workers trump probably figures he can cover up this massive redistribution from the working class to the corporate elite by pushing the same economic nationalism tinged with xenophobia and racism he used in 2016 as bannon has noted the formula seems to have worked for britain s conservative party but it will be difficult this time around because trump s economic nationalism has hurt american workers particularly in states that were critical to trump s 2016 win manufacturing has suffered as tariffs raised prices for imported parts and materials hiring has slowed sharply in pennsylvania michigan and other states trump won and in states like minnesota that he narrowly lost the trade wars have harmed rural america which went for trump by reducing demand for american farm produce last year china bought around 8 6 billion of farm goods down from 20 billion in 2016 a new tentative trade deal calls for substantially more chinese purchases meanwhile health care costs continue to soar college is even less affordable and average life expectancy is dropping due to a rise in deaths from suicide and opioid drugs such as fentanyl polls show most americans remain dissatisfied with the country s direction the consequences of trump s and the republicans excessive corporate giveaways and their failure to improve the lives of ordinary working americans are becoming clearer by the day the only tricks left for trump and the republicans are stoking social and racial resentments and claiming to be foes of the establishment but bigotry alone won t win elections and the detritus of the tax cut makes it difficult for trump and the gop to portray themselves as anti establishment this has created a giant political void and an opportunity democrats have a historic chance to do what they should have done years ago create a multiracial coalition of the working class middle class and poor dedicated to reclaiming the economy for the vast majority and make democracy work for all robert reich is a former u s secretary of labor and professor of public policy at berkeley his columns are distributed by the tribune content agency
throughout history there have been a number of extremely meaningful volatility spikes across major financial markets each had defining characteristics that made them similar despite occurring in very different markets and for different reasons the continuity seen across these volatility cycles is a good thing because while it doesn t necessarily make a major volatility spike highly predictable historical precedence offer a blueprint for identifying conditions that are supportive for a potential vol event to occur and how they are likely to unfold once in motion this can be of great help in guiding trading decisions whether that is to steer clear of a potential vol blow up or move towards it with the appropriate strategy that can take advantage of the outsized price swings that come with unusual levels of volatility we will first discuss what a volatility event typically looks like in terms of the behavior of volatility itself then take a close look at some of the largest spikes ever witnessed in major financial markets get your report on the impact of market volatility here what is volatility in simple terms volatility can be defined as the variations at which a market fluctuates the morean asset s price moves the higher the volatility the less the price moves the lower the volatility paul robinson dailyfx in this piece we are looking at a short term measure of volatility two week duration called realized volatility which is volatility as it has already occurred it is also known as historical volatility what does a volatility event cycle look like in the lead up to a volatility spike there is often a build up period where volatility rises gradually indicating markets could be headed for significant dislocation and disruption the period of subtle unrest is followed by a sudden vertical move in volatility that reaches a climax before quickly reversing and normalizing through a gradual but bumpy decline towards pre event volatility levels the graph below is a composite of several past volatility cycles accounting for 100 days before and after the peak in volatility notice the build up period the volatility spike itself and the normalization phase as well as the asymmetry between the phases cycle of a volatility spike behavior of volatility differs among asset classes another aspect of market volatility to understand is that it doesn t behave in the same way across all asset classes nor necessarily even within the same asset class for example stock market volatility generally behaves much differently than it does in currencies and commodities stocks have an inherent long bias to them as they are generally an asset of appreciating value over the longrun market participants invest in company shares making the stock market almost an exclusively long market with limited short interest because of this bias volatility runs high in down markets when there is fear as a result of financial losses and selling and low in up markets where

as fiat currency is being created in the billions on what seems to be a daily dosage savvy investors are accumulating stocks of gold and miners of production central banks are buying gold like never before as countries across the globe move to diversify away from the dollar the dollar is weakening right alongside other currencies and those who possess gold will become wealthy the fear trade is on and these next 5 10 years will make millions for those of us who understand the history of money in 1967 senator paul fannin of arizona stated i am alarmed at the prospect of the american citizen being forced to accept completely fiat currency in the near future fannin was pushing back against federal reserve chairman chesney who was arguing to repeal the law that earmarked 25 gold backing of treasury notes if fannin were alive today he would have likely been an avid gold investor fifty two years have passed and since our educational institutions do not teach our citizens about real money there will be many who will miss the glowing investment opportunity in gold the current 1 500 price per ounce represents a 426 gain over the past 19 years as the price was 279 in 2000 january is a historically favorable month for gold and 2020 looks to be another year of monetary disorder featuring negative real interest rates and money creation the perfect recipe for a rise in gold his words would aptly describe the current state of fear of monetary conditions despite a temporary check in gold outflow the causes of foreign concern over the stability of the dollar not only still exist but grow ever more ominous senate congressional record august 29 1967 fannin might as well be speaking today as conditions are quite similar and physical gold is heading east toward asia and europe private u s investors and analysts are buying and recommending the shiny rare yellow metal on a daily basis i have never seen a period like this in my lifetime china and russia have expressed their desire to move away from danger they see in u s dollar excesses and the 2008 financial crisis was a sharp warning to countries dependent on the reserve currency of the world gold is a great diversification tool for central banks and investors alike central banks of russia china germany poland turkey india and hungary are purchasing large amounts of gold while diversifying their reserves away from the u s dollar that has been devalued through unrelenting printing and pernicious low interest rates set by the federal reserve savers receive very little interest on their deposits and are forced to invest in riskier stocks and bonds in search of higher returns the market signals sent by rising rates are squashed quickly by the federal reserve as though free markets no longer are trusted manipulation by centrally planned economies of china and russia operate in this same manner to see the champion of capitalism the united states engages in similar intervention is unsettling free markets send proper signals to direct capital to desirable assets manipulated markets can send the wrong signals to investors as fear and confusion rises the federal reserve abruptly ceased raising interest rates one year ago and is now easing we can expect more investors to seek safety in gold gold is not comparable to other commodities or metals it is primarily important as a monetary store of value senate congressional record august 29 1967 as gold historians are well aware paper money only began as a claim on gold today paper money is more a political tool of value backed by the faith of the issuing government that faith is weak and weakening across the country and the globe the u s ran a 1 trillion deficit in the fiscal year ending in september and the fed continues to flood the market with new currency to provide liquidity in the repurchase markets in what is referred to as temporary moves we are told this is not quantitative easing but as an economic analyst i must disagree if the fed creates money or purchases mortgage securities it is easing monetary conditions the billions of dollars of newly created currency speak louder than how the initiative is classified the fed and the u s treasury are creating mountainous debts and deficits former federal reserve chairman paul volcker recently said we are in one hell of a mess in every direction volcker referred to a loss of faith in our institutions and unease with how the fed has reacted with arbitrary and confusing decisions many citizens are feeling inflation in the form of higher prices for food housing real estate taxes healthcare insurance and out of pocket healthcare costs social security and pension payments are increasing rapidly with the u s population aging and this will exacerbate the crippling effects of excessive debt payments and actual inflation as opposed to that which is reported by government the fed recently stated that it would not likely raise interest rates anytime soon it will be difficult for the u s to raise interest rates since even a small rise will spike interest payments on current debt burdens it seems likely that a continuation of fiat currency devaluation currently occurring across the world will persevere any attempt at a significant increase in interest rates at this time of massive debts will likely create financial pressures that will be intolerable on multiple fronts we have 15 billion of gold in our treasury and we don t own an ounce foreign claims are 27 3 billion ronald reagan october 27 1964 a time for choosing at that time the country was in fiscal peril trying to meet the claims on our gold supply in 1971 president richard nixon closed the gold window and the united states defaulted on their obligations the u s could not meet the massive demand for gold redemptions from abroad and the federal reserve was able to proceed to expand the money supply without restraint gold no longer served as an anchor to the money supply gold is in high demand but only a small percentage of u s citizens are aware that gold is money that cannot be devalued through printing or creation it is rare and valued across the world as john hathaway of tocqueville gold fund stated recently there is just not much physical gold available not in london nor in vaults anymore central banks and investors are holding and adding gold and not lending as they have in the past the u s treasury reports that it has 8 134 tons of gold which is the largest reserve in the world i wonder if all of this gold is ours or do other countries hold claims on some of our gold as reagan detailed in 1964 former senator ron paul asked to audit the u s gold holdings several years back but his efforts were denied germany asked to repatriate gold held in the united states but was told that it would take several years if the u s did export gold back to germany it would seem that the treasury should have adjusted the gold holdings downward as it stands now one can only wonder if the u s treasury is reporting the actual physical gold held or perhaps satisfied with a rough estimate perhaps government officials are aware that so few people seem to be aware of the reason our country once used a gold standard namely to protect the people from profligate government spending investors in the shiny yellow metal will become wealthy as savvy investors return to real money

throughout history there have been a number of extremely meaningful volatility spikes across major financial markets each had defining characteristics that made them similar despite occurring in very different markets and for different reasons the continuity seen across these volatility cycles is a good thing because while it doesn t necessarily make a major volatility spike highly predictable historical precedence offer a blueprint for identifying conditions that are supportive for a potential vol event to occur and how they are likely to unfold once in motion this can be of great help in guiding trading decisions whether that is to steer clear of a potential vol blow up or move towards it with the appropriate strategy that can take advantage of the outsized price swings that come with unusual levels of volatility we will first discuss what a volatility event typically looks like in terms of the behavior of volatility itself then take a close look at some of the largest spikes ever witnessed in major financial markets get your report on the impact of market volatility here what is volatility in simple terms volatility can be defined as the variations at which a market fluctuates the morean asset s price moves the higher the volatility the less the price moves the lower the volatility paul robinson dailyfx in this piece we are looking at a short term measure of volatility two week duration called realized volatility which is volatility as it has already occurred it is also known as historical volatility what does a volatility event cycle look like in the lead up to a volatility spike there is often a build up period where volatility rises gradually indicating markets could be headed for significant dislocation and disruption the period of subtle unrest is followed by a sudden vertical move in volatility that reaches a climax before quickly reversing and normalizing through a gradual but bumpy decline towards pre event volatility levels the graph below is a composite of several past volatility cycles accounting for 100 days before and after the peak in volatility notice the build up period the volatility spike itself and the normalization phase as well as the asymmetry between the phases cycle of a volatility spike behavior of volatility differs among asset classes another aspect of market volatility to understand is that it doesn t behave in the same way across all asset classes nor necessarily even within the same asset class for example stock market volatility generally behaves much differently than it does in currencies and commodities stocks have an inherent long bias to them as they are generally an asset of appreciating value over the longrun market participants invest in company shares making the stock market almost an exclusively long market with limited short interest because of this bias volatility runs high in down markets when there is fear as a result of financial losses and selling and low in up markets where fear is minimal occasionally you will see stock market volatility rise in a bull market as participants collectively suffer from fomo but this isn t the norm and only happens towards the end of long powerful trends a couple of which we will look at here shortly vix demonstrates that volatility rises on selling declines on buying as shown in the graph above volatility typically runs opposite of

people who shied away from investing in stocks this year such as millennials scarred by last decade s crash missed the market s best performance in six years at 27 nick de león knows firsthand about the gulf between millennials and wall street de león graduated this year from uc berkeley with bachelor s degrees in political science and rhetoric with plans to start law school soon and he has an internship with a superior court judge in his hometown of san bernardino he s also intrigued by the stock market but de león won t be investing in equities any time soon saddled with 1 400 in monthly payments for student loans and for credit card debt from a failed business start up along with living expenses such as food his phone bill and and car insurance he s temporarily living with his parents and working at costco to make ends meet there s really no money for it right now de león said of the stock market i just don t have the cash to even think about it advertisement he s not alone although the market is poised to close a banner year hovering near record highs the rally hasn t helped half of the nation s millennials who either lack the means to knock on wall street s door or are wary of doing so in the last two years an average of 49 of millennials ages 23 to 38 held stock directly or through mutual funds exchange traded funds or retirement plans such as 401 k s at any given time according to polling data that gallup provided at the times request that s down sharply from an average of 61 of americans in the same age range in the 2001 08 period before markets were hammered by the financial crisis of 2008 09 an event that s still one reason many millennials steer clear of equities analysts said millennials now entering their prime earning period hold vastly less wealth than generations that preceded them and the wealth gap between older and younger generations is widening an analysis by the st louis fed showed that in 1989 the median wealth of households led by people ages 65 to 75 was nearly eight times as large as the wealth of families headed by 25 to 35 year olds by 2016 the median baby boomer led household had nearly 13 times as much wealth as the typical millennial household that s in part due to the financial crisis that shaped the economy during millennials formative years and the habits and fears they adopted at that time have to some extent kept them away from this year s runaway market success they ve been tarnished by the damage that wall street did 10 years ago and it s in their psyche said steve nielander a san diego state finance lecturer and a partner at wealth management firm cerity partners advertisement as a result they missed the market s best performance in six years and the 11th year of the ongoing bull market that followed the crisis investors bid up prices despite the ongoing u s china trade war political turmoil surrounding president trump and fears of an economic slowdown investors instead focused on the economy s continued expansion rising corporate earnings low unemployment low inflation and the federal reserve s decision to cut short term interest rates three times in 2019 the benchmark standard poor s 500 index has shot up 29 2 this year as of friday s close on track for its biggest gain since 2013 when it rose 29 6 the dow jones industrial average is up 22 8 this year and the tech heavy nasdaq composite index has surged 35 7 technology was among the market s strongest sectors along with financial communications services and industrial stocks according to s p dow jones indices although stocks are risky investments millennials who steer clear of them are missing potentially sizable gains during their peak earning years the average return price gains and dividends of the s p 500 index historically is about 10 a year though its annual movements vary widely as shown this year keeping money in cash such as a savings account or money market fund is safer but the value and purchasing power of cash are eroded by inflation that s one reason mutual funds and exchange traded funds that mimic stock indexes such as the s p 500 are popular among investors they provide a passive way to invest in the broader market often with less risk than trading individual stocks but that distinction made little difference during the financial crisis that today s millennials witnessed when all manner of stock investing was devastated in 2008 for instance the s p 500 plunged more than 38 advertisement katherine lovinger 36 a north hollywood biostatistician for a medical devices maker said she mainly invests in a diversified basket of exchange traded funds rather than individual stocks but keeps the majority of her cash in savings accounts in part because she s worried about the stock market s outlook i understand growth is very small with compared with the stock market but i don t trust that the growth in the market is going to continue she said my best guess is that within the next six to nine months we re going to see if not a full crash at least a guaranteed slowdown a stock market dive could contain a blessing for young people who have a long term investment horizon it would create an opportunity to plow money into stocks when prices are low but many analysts say high prices alone shouldn t be a barrier to buying stocks one technique for investing without being afraid of entering at a peak is to use dollar cost averaging buying the same dollar value of the same set of stocks at regular intervals on an ongoing basis regardless of where the market stands that way the investor ends up buying more shares when prices are low and fewer when they re high it s not just millennials who are less enamored with stocks than before the financial crisis americans in general have been less invested in equities since then over the last two years 55 on average of the adult population owned stocks directly or indirectly down from 62 before the crisis said jeff jones a gallup research analyst in the 18 to 29 age group alone stock ownership averaged 37 the last two years down from 42 before the crisis he said advertisement in response the nation s major online brokerages and some digital trading upstarts are making a push to attract more younger clients charles schwab corp said in october that it was eliminating trading commissions and others such as e trade financial corp and td ameritrade corp did the same then schwab announced last month that it was acquiring td ameritrade for 26 billion in stock schwab also announced in october that it would let investors buy and sell fractions of stock that enables younger investors in particular to trade a piece of say amazon com inc even if they can t afford to buy full shares of the company which closed friday at nearly 1 870 apiece competitors such as online brokerage firm robinhood markets inc likewise offer zero commissions fractional ownership and mobile apps robinhood says it now has 10 million customer accounts robinhood co founder baiju bhatt himself a millennial has said his company was created with investors his age in mind we had seen how the younger generation had felt really frustrated disenfranchised with the way that the system worked after the financial crisis and we saw an opportunity to build a product that really spoke to that generation he told cnbc s jim cramer this month for schwab attracting millennial investors now is key because millennials and the preceding generation x will inherit a massive transfer of wealth estimated at 30 trillion or more from their parents and grandparents in the coming decades said joe vietri a schwab senior vice president who heads its branch network it s a huge opportunity for us he said advertisement once the relationship is established schwab which also operates a bank hopes the customers who were first attracted by the zero commissions or fractional ownership eventually will pay for fee based services such as investment management banking services and retirement planning connecting with millennials requires a different approach vietri said that involves understanding how their finances differ from those of older generations nearly half of schwab s millennial clients have student loan debt americans total student debt load has mushroomed to 1 6 trillion as college educations jump in price and analysts agree that burden is another reason many millennials aren t investing in stocks so is the high cost of housing in certain urban areas combined with the fact that people in their 20s often don t yet have the earning power to invest part of their income in stocks vietri said millennials also place an abnormally high premium on low costs ease of online or phone app transactions and strong security against hackers millennials have shown they re comfortable with certain financial technology such as using digital payment apps such as venmo and even high risk investments some buy and sell bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies but when it comes to the stock market their wariness remains evident as the market was moving up one day recently cnbc s cramer tweeted younger people please start investing now dollar at a time the remark drew some skepticism invest at all time highs one twitter user responded another said he was 33 with school loan debt adding this is a valid reason as to why my generation is struggling to invest advertisement bankrate com did a survey this summer asking millennials what they believed was the best investment for the next decade the top response was real estate at 36 while cash and savings accounts were 18 and the stock market was 16 still millennials also lag behind preceding generations when it comes to buying a home a study by the urban institute found that the homeownership rate for millennials in 2015 was 37 eight percentage points lower than the rate baby boomers and gen x had at the same age mark hamrick bankrate s senior economic analyst questioned whether the brokerages move to zero commissions would make much difference in attracting more young investors to stocks after all he said commissions already had been tumbling in price in recent years and millennial stock ownership still fell the elimination of commissions doesn t do a lot for those individuals who are essentially scared out of their wits by their fear of what happened in the sell off a decade ago hamrick said older millennials also remember the dot com crash of technology stocks in the early 2000s which means they ve witnessed two huge market plunges in a 10 year period and that s never happened before nielander said these people grew up and watched that and saw the pressure on their parents of losing money in the stock market losing their homes and seeing the mass distrust of wall street he said advertisement vietri said schwab encounters that fear with millennial clients when you see your parents or others go through that type of adversity it does have a lasting effect he said nonetheless he said efforts to attract more millennials efforts that include both helping them pare debt and invest among other strategies are starting to pay off vietri said 57 of schwab s new retail clients this year were younger than 40 and that percentage is definitely on the rise schwab provides one snapshot of how millennials invest by surveying its clients who have self directed 401 k s and other retirement plans meaning they can choose investments beyond the typical core investment choices provided with such plans in the third quarter of this year schwab found that all generations allocated the largest percentage of their portfolios to mutual funds and individual stocks for millennials 34 went to mutual funds and 25 to stocks but millennials allocated more to exchange traded funds and cash 24 and 16 of their portfolios respectively than other generations the survey shows millennials modest appetite for stocks will be tested if the market turns south in 2020 and there are questions about whether stock prices will keep rising if economic growth slows the u s china trade fight worsens or concerns mount about how the presidential election will affect the markets the market also is getting a bit pricey which might lead to a pullback the s p 500 now trades for about 18 times its component stocks average earnings per share up from 15 early this year according to factset and that s also above its historic average of 15 5 to 16 advertisement but hamrick said everyone knows that a downturn is to be expected if not next year then later and that the bull rally won t last forever as with a recession it s not a question of whether the market will turn lower it s a question of when along with the depth and duration of that decline hamrick said whether that will grab the attention of millennials such as de león is questionable when talking to his friends he said the stock market just doesn t come up
volatility talking points in many regards the markets are still pricing in perfection for 2020 a low volatility steadfast growth for the global economy and financial system would be the outlier i cover some of the top grey swan low probability high impact events ahead what kind of trader are you take our dna fx quiz to gather insights on how to improve your analysis technique in trading circles there is exceptional appeal in trading so called black swans events that were wholly unpredictable have a severe impact on the market and tend to be unreasonably rationalized after their occurrence such extremes will naturally drawl an inordinate amount of attention owing to the impact that they have the snipe hunting that occurs among those overly ambitious traders boils down to the preternatural pursuit of volatility the tales of entering a market at a high or low and just before activity levels are about to shift seem widespread such a story has no doubt had an impact on all of our excitement to one degree or another at some time in our participation in the market and while black swans have stirred substantial moves even reversals in the past predicting them is a fool s errand of too many red herrings and false starts to be practical that public service announcement made there are events for which an intense impact is still a possibility but for which their occurrence is at least a possible blip on the radar they are still considered unlikely as that is where the market moving potential resides otherwise markets would adjust to the inevitability that is what i want focus on in this outlook for 2020 there are a number of different scenarios that could befall grace our newswires and charts but i want to focus in on events that combine a significant influence that also near the realm of probability i will list 5 of the most remarkable events on my list discuss the background assess my probability of its occurring and identify a market i feel is most likely to reflect the development s p 500 finally enters lasting reversal 50 this is perhaps one of the most heavily debated consideration year in and year out will the markets finally collapse the instrument you use to measure the markets is important as looking at a thermometer won t necessarily give you a good reading on whether an overinflated balloon is about to pop however i like to refer to the s p 500 as my metric given its default enthusiasm this past decade as one of the best performing benchmarks if it is committed to a decline the implications for the whole system are much clearer i have been a conscientious objector of the buy and hold view on markets since 2015 that does not mean i won t position with a long risk bias rather i do not believe in the steadfastness of the climb and will not simply hold a long term momentum position that aligns to risk on the reason for this is the deviation from traditional scales of value like growth returns or other standards the market is happy to change its reasoning to suit as the saying goes markets can remain irrational longer than you can solvent but eventually the discrepancy will reach a breaking point since justification for greater exposure is adaptive the turn on the most hated bull market of all time will occur in sentiment rather through an event recognition of the stretch in speculative exposure the discrepancy with value and abundance of ready made fundamental landmines makes this a higher probability in my view than what the market is affording despite the general belief of inevitability no deal brexit at end of transition period 50 after the december 12 general election in the united kingdom confidence flooded back into the british pound a uniform view of how the uk negotiation team will deal its eu counterpart revived confidence after years of impasse between the own nation s government and parliament yet the sterling didn t hold onto that climb long after the polls were in that was owing to prime minister johnson s warning that he meant to push europe to compromise by suggesting he may preclude any extensions on the transition period which is set to end at the very close of 2020 december 31st 2020 recommended by john kicklighter get your free gbp forecast get my guide to this point much of the debate has been around the sudden cliff that comes with the inability to agree to the withdrawal the previously established withdrawal agreement is likely to be implemented come january 31st the deadline after the extension from october but this is a question of the work to make replacement trade deals after the agreement to split most economists agree that it is very unlikely the two sides can work out an alternative environment in so short a time which makes this a considerable risk on the other hand the event would come as less a sudden development given a clear deadline and plenty of debate beforehand what s more the pound is still historically low then again it can always fall further chart of gbpusd with 50 week moving average monthly chart created using ig chart platform president trump wins re election 40 markets generally do not reflect the typical favor or distaste for a politician that opinion polls reflect but they abhor uncertainty and policy that upends growth in economy and the financial system heading into the 2016 presidential election donald trump was the agent of change given his atypical political approach and his uneven approach that said it was quite the surprise for me that the us equity market responded to the surprise election results with a steadfast rally through the subsequent year that is certainly not the norm moving into this new election trump is up for re election and his policy stance is more transparent his support for tax cut driven growth was tested and fell short of a lasting lever for the us economy infrastructure spending which was a big part of his platform never garnered traction has not gained any tangible traction in the meantime trade wars aimed at rebalancing the global pace of growth has instead led to slower domestic and global growth a re election for the president would embolden his administration to push forward with the punitive trade policies that could push growth to stall speed given the ongoing impeachment proceedings it may seem that a second term is a low probability following the opinion polls for quantitative measurement but the bifurcation in american society that is mirrored so well in politics means extreme politicking is the norm with the

election will play a considerable role on future phases of the country s involvement in trade wars since march 2018 the trade barriers with china have grown to enormous proportion the two countries have imposed tariffs on over 450 billion in goods collectively further blacklists were raised blacklists were implemented and threats for further moves were warned the first and only meaningful de escalation took place this past month when both sides finally decided to verify intent to the phase one trade deal though details were worryingly spare despite the number of times previous breakthroughs were waved off it is somewhat surprising that the market took such an enthusiastic view of the outcome we have seen too many false dawns on this relationship front before it would be reasonable to maintain a cautious view of these two countries ability to find a genuine compromise however there is strong motivation on both sides to speed up and perhaps capitulate on the us side the approach of the election and the unflattering pace of economic activity may find a useful lever even if temporary in progressively backing out of the economic grip from trade wars for china there are multiple fronts of uncertainty emerging while the effort to transition to a more open market based economy to spread out risk is happening at the same time as a global struggle both sides have reason to find that middle ground if the us strikes an accord with its chinese counterpart earlier in 2020 it is likely that the white house positions the outcome as a win and attempt to double down on the populist fervor it attempts to ignite that being the case the next white whale for the us would be europe the two are already two steps into a mild trade ware of their own the us has slapped over 7 billion in tariffs on eu imports after the wto s ruling that europe unfairly subsidized airbus and the eu is anticipating an outcome for its own case sometime in january further france slapped a digital tax on the largest tech companies many being us and the trump administration responded with a plan of direct tariffs of its own this could readily escalate with little warning and the economic implications of the world s largest developed economies engaging would be far more disruptive some would prefer to watch risk trends or audusd more directly for this but i think usdcnh is the

chart platform major central banks change their standard policy mix 25 finally the more unorthodox and underappreciated grey swan in 2020 is a more systemic shift in monetary policy it is no secret that the world s largest central banks are failing to achieve the financial stability that they so desperately seek to inspire and that isn t even their stated mandate most of the major authorities are targeting inflation while some also have a more directly growth linked objective like employment given how suppressed inflation pressures have been throughout the post gfc great financial crisis recovery and the lackluster sheen of economic performance questions start to arise those concerns are born out of the knowledge that the world s largest central banks have collectively cut rates to virtually zero and flooded the market with stimulus qe and other such programs there is a problem when the technical goals are either reached by the central bank without the expected effect on the economy or worse the ammunition is expended without ever reaching the state goal what are the authorities to do they don t have many options they can simply hope that the world s economy simply grows out of its problems they could continue to push the same policies and expect a different outcome or they could change the stated goal regardless of the decision a change of course is necessary many would write this issue off as a wonky matter that will not have clear practical influence on markets however i believe it could materially change the balance of risk in the system and many investors

for a century the gop has been bankrolled by big business and wall street president donald trump wants to keep the money rolling in his signature tax cut which was passed two years ago has helped u s corporations score record profits and the stock market reach all time highs to spur even more corporate generosity for the 2020 election trump is suggesting more giveaways acting white house chief of staff mick mulvaney recently told an assemblage of ceos that trump wants to go beyond his 2017 tax cut trump also wants to expand his working class base in rallies and countless tweets he claims to be restoring the american working class by holding back immigration and trade most incumbent republicans and gop candidates are mimicking trump s economic nationalism as former trump consigliere stephen bannon boasted recently we ve turned the republican party into a working class party keeping the gop the party of big money while making it over into the party of the working class is a tricky maneuver especially at a time when capital and labor are engaged in the most intense economic contest in more than a century because so much wealth and power are going to the top armed with deductions and loopholes america s largest companies paid an average federal tax rate of only 11 3 on their profits last year roughly half the official rate under the new tax law the lowest effective corporate tax rate in more than 80 years the tax cut has shifted more of the total tax burden to workers payroll taxes made up 7 8 of national income last year while corporate taxes made up just 0 9 the biggest gap in nearly two decades all told taxes on workers accounted for 35 of federal tax revenue in 2018 taxes on corporations only 9 almost nothing has trickled down to ordinary workers corporations have used most of their tax savings to buy back their shares giving the stock market a sugar high the typical american household remains poorer today than it was before the financial crisis began in 2007 trump s giant tax cut has caused the federal budget deficit to balloon even as pretax corporate profits have reached record highs corporate tax revenues have dropped about a third under projected levels this requires more federal dollars for interest on the debt leaving fewer for public services workers need the trump administration has already announced a 4 5 billion cut in food stamp benefits that would affect an estimated 10 000 families many at the lower end of the working class the administration is also proposing to reduce social security disability benefits a potential blow to hundreds of thousands of workers trump probably figures he can cover up this massive redistribution from the working class to the corporate elite by pushing the same economic nationalism tinged with xenophobia and racism he used in 2016 as bannon has noted the formula seems to have worked for britain s conservative party but it will be difficult this time around because trump s economic nationalism has hurt american workers particularly in states that were critical to trump s 2016 win manufacturing has suffered as tariffs raised prices for imported parts and materials hiring has slowed sharply in pennsylvania michigan and other states trump won and in states like minnesota that he narrowly lost the trade wars have harmed rural america which went for trump by reducing demand for american farm produce last year china bought around 8 6 billion of farm goods down from 20 billion in 2016 a new tentative trade deal calls for substantially more chinese purchases meanwhile health care costs continue to soar college is even less affordable and average life expectancy is dropping due to a rise in deaths from suicide and opioid drugs such as fentanyl polls show most americans remain dissatisfied with the country s direction the consequences of trump s and the republicans excessive corporate giveaways and their failure to improve the lives of ordinary working americans are becoming clearer by the day the only tricks left for trump and the republicans are stoking social and racial resentments and claiming to be foes of the establishment but bigotry alone won t win elections and the detritus of the tax cut makes it difficult for trump and the gop to portray themselves as anti establishment this has created a giant political void and an opportunity democrats have a historic chance to do what they should have done years ago create a multiracial coalition of the working class middle class and poor dedicated to reclaiming the economy for the vast majority and make democracy work for all robert reich is a former u s secretary of labor and professor of public policy at berkeley his columns are distributed by the tribune content agency
robust economic reforms remittances received from expatriate community boost in exports coupled with the vision of country s leadership are major factors behind the turnaround of bangladesh s economy believes country s top official even in the face of global recession the country has recorded an estimated 8 1 gdp growth in 2019 bangladesh has also climbed up a spot to 135 among 189 countries in the 2019 human development index according to a report by the united nations development program it can be termed impressive as it is almost matching the performance of neighboring countries india 130 bhutan 134 and leaves behind others like myanmar 145 nepal 147 pakistan 152 and afghanistan 170 in the region in an exclusive interview with anadolu agency during his visit to ankara prime minister sheikh hasina s economic affairs adviser mashiur rahman explained factors behind successful transformation of bangladesh s economy he also spoke about bangladesh s current relations with two regional heavyweights india and china as well as explained several issues related to india and bangladesh such as trade deficit water sharing agreements and citizenship row in india s northeastern state of assam anadolu agency what are the major factors behind the recent outstanding economic performance of bangladesh mashiur rahman mr i think the biggest achievement is our former finance minister muhith he has his flaws everyone has but he had the ability to lead and guide and the main reason for our success is prime minister sheikh hasina s vision her emphasis on women empowerment in the overall development of society is a factor women form a large part of our society the prime minister believes that without the advancement of women the development of the country is not possible moreover another factor is the expansion of technology based learning if education is not spread in the country and if there is no technology based education then the progress of the country is not possible so it can be said that this is a success story together with the prime minister s policy vision commitment and the help of his colleagues we have achieved this level from middle income to developed country q what type of steps the bangladesh government is taking for the future of country s economy mr we have achieved and have already become a middle income country the next step is to reach to the level of a developed economy a better economic policy as well as structural reform are the paths to transform ourselves from a middle income group country to the level of advanced income country q what is your roadmap and preparations to cross this line mr that preparation is through social development for example to educate our people reduce discrimination create job opportunities for all people we give priority to boost exports and at the same time we also focus on our internal demand as a result a cushion is created for internal economy so that we can handle any outside push and secondly by focusing on exports we produce an inventory about demand of our goods and products in the external market and the internal consumption through this way we are gaining the ability to create demand in a comparatively larger market and another is remittance the money sent by bangladeshis living abroad those who go abroad work hard after experiencing many difficulties i will not say that they are living a pleasant life but the remittance they are sending is a big force for our economy about 15 16 billion remittances come to the country per year this is a major strength thanks to our remittance we always have foreign currency reserves of six to eight months if there is a reserve of six to eight months then any sudden shock can be dealt with for example if the price of something suddenly goes up we still have the money to import the item we do not have to run to anyone else like the world bank or the imf along with the foreign exchange reserves the increased demand in the domestic market exports and structural reforms these altogether create a virtual circle of growth and development q bangladesh borrows a large amount of money from various countries including china and india for infrastructure and other development projects especially for power projects is there any possibility that bangladesh can fall into a debt trap like neighboring sri lanka mr not just sri lanka pakistan has also fallen into the debt trap the strategy that bangladesh needs to protect itself from india and china s debt crisis is that the debt often long term needs to be repaid within 10 years or 15 years so that we can increase the overall growth and export in this time if exports and foreign currency receivables do not increase then we will have to fall into the date trap and if you talk about sri lanka and pakistan when these two countries took loans then they had internal problems there was a civil war in sri lanka for a long time pakistan had been in turmoil internally for many years but in our country we do not have this type of issue and i believe that no such kind of situation has been and will be created in our country india s nrc and bangladesh q india is your biggest neighbor historically bangladesh has very good political economic commercial and cultural relations with this country but india s northeastern state of assam has put forward a national register of citizenship that will likely make nearly two million people stateless and the most important issue is they are being called illegal bangladeshi migrants there is fear that all these people will flood to bangladesh once the nrc process is finalized how will this move in india affect the relations between the two countries mr our prime minister spoke to her counterpart in india and the indian prime minister s assurance is that no matter what the state government does the federal government has the powers to make the ultimate decision on citizenship the federal government is not seeing any situation that will bring undue pressure on bangladesh or neighboring countries in the future on the other hand we have to look at the constraints or limitations of all countries one of india s major constraints i think is that it has to maintain a good and healthy relationship with its neighbors india has historically bad relationship with pakistan for which a large part of india s budget has to be spent on defense we have to accept that india is a regional power if india wants to establish itself as a regional power then increasing unfriendliness with these neighbors will not be a reasonable thing for india on the other hand we think that the relationship we have with india will not deteriorate if our dependence and relationships increase the friendship will also get deeper for example we give them transit facilities to reach to the northeastern states of india the convenience of this transit is increasing india s dependence on us we are getting some electricity from india this connection of our business and the facilities of going to the northeast the benefits of shipping deepens the relationship and increase india s dependence on us a little bit in that sense i do not think india will move away from friendly behavior with us because if they move away from the friendly behavior with us then the maintenance of the mainland s relations with the northeastern states will be a very difficult problem for india for this reason it is important for india to maintain good relations with bangladesh in order to maintain its regional position and internal law and order water and trade issues with india q what steps bangladesh is taking to address both the trade deficit and water sharing problem with india mr there are two issues when it comes to water problems one is the teesta water treaty the teesta agreement was signed but for whatever reason it was not finalized failure to sign the teesta water treaty has created an emotional distance but the actual situation of the teesta is that we did not talk to india before the creation of the teesta barrage as a result there was no prior commitment from india second the water we get in the teesta barrage is for irrigation augment during the monsoon season there was no deal to give us water during the dry season the deal was that by 15 years we would measure how much of that water we would get in dwanei after they release the water from the gajoldoba barrage the main agreement of this deal was not signed so what i see for myself is that it is not feasible to do any kind of bore water detours within this area like our border 4 5 km from gazaldaoba therefore no water diversion of the borough can or will not be possible i have heard from those of us who work on the issue that the water we measure in dawani has not decreased over the period there are seasonal variations but on the whole has not decreased and even in the dry season it has not decreased at all the topography of sikkim is geographically such that no big barrage is technically feasible in ujiga therefore it is less likely to draw water from there however one thing has to be acknowledged that the failure to sign the teesta agreement has led to an emotional conflict secondly and what is important is the ganga water treaty the ganga water deal which is now in place will end in 2020 or 2021 the latest situation is that the two prime ministers have directed technical expert to examine the technical aspects of the project and give their opinion this project will be done jointly q and what about the trade deficit mr there is no reason to take this deficit with india seriously for example in our business with america we have a trade surplus and america has trade deficit q but india is your closest neighbor and it is a huge market should bangladesh not do more exports to this market mr yes the reason for the deficit with india is that we do not have such type of products to export to india the amount of goods we sell to india is increasing over the past few years and practically we are looking for new alternatives to the u s and european markets due to drop of prices and demand there importance of remittances inflow q bangladesh stands among top 10 remittance receiving nations while remittance inflow is crucial for bangladesh s economy as you mentioned there are reports that large number of foreigners are working in bangladesh resulting billions of dollars of remittance outflow while thousands of bangladeshi youths are unemployed how do you see this mr my explanation is that there is no inconsistency in the economy here because these people are hired by private entrepreneurs q but thousands are unemployed mr jobs are given by private entrepreneur if there is one skilled person among these thousands of unemployed that person will not be taken q so would you say that your unemployed youths are not skilled mr no not that we have lack of managerial skills and technical skills at mid level we have to accept it we have to hire people from outside because for what we lack we have this deficiency so we go outside for treatment if not we would not go q what is the solution then mr the solution is how fast we can increase technical and managerial skills if we do not increase then this deficiency will continue in my opinion the main reason for hiring these people from india or any other country is we do not have that amount of technically qualified and managerially competent people that our companies are needed at the mid level at least q so what are the steps government is taking to make people qualified and skilled mr the government is setting up vocational technical training schools and colleges and from there skilled people will come out slowly thus the shortage should be fulfilled within three to five years india s slow down economy q india s economic index has been down for a long time according to recent reports from various international organizations this slowdown will be prolonged how much of this economic downturn in india can have a negative impact on the bangladeshi economy and what is the preparation of your government to deal with it mr our exports to india were on an increasing trend if we predict that indian economic growth will decrease then maybe this export rate might face a little bit slow trend the main markets for our exports are europe and america maybe we will look for new markets to diversify it we need to find other markets some african countries and some muslim nations or countries in the middle east will be considered for new markets that means diversification of products and diversification of markets we will need both of these another question associated with this is how bad will india s economy be not only recently but many of those who were involved with india s policy were also saying that the economic condition of india is bad it seems to me that their economy is as bad as was predicted since the physical structure and the technical knowledge structure of india are stronger than ever they have ability to turn around i do not think that the indian government will be so irresponsible to not secure its economy because the indian government has shown courage in all the steps it has taken recently related to the economy so i do not think india s economy is going to be as bad as it is said the growth that we had in the trade may have been a little slower cybersecurity issues q bangladesh is getting digitized very fast it is also being realized in its economy and banking system in addition to digitalization cybersecurity is also important so if we want to know how much the government of bangladesh is giving importance to cybersecurity in its economy particularly after the cyber theft of 81 billion from the bangladesh bank in february 2016 mr in cybersecurity we need to be sufficient practically i cannot say whether or not we are all secure at the time of the bangladesh bank accident i was at harvard at a program on cybersecurity where cybersecurity experts from various countries were present i remember someone saying that one of the major problems with digitization or computerization is this you can never guarantee 100 protection because those who hack may be as clever as you and sometimes cleverer than you are so here is the only way change your system frequently q is there any strong step that your government has taken in this regard or do you have any advice from the economic circle mr i am not completely aware of it however during discussions i have seen that they are aware of cybersecurity q what is the status of current trade and economic relations between bangladesh and turkey

380 000 gyms and boutique fitness studios to close but the need for exercise has not slowed down instead gym goers have had to substantially rethink their workout routines forcing the industry to shift its focus away from in person workouts to at home options companies such as peloton tonal and hydrow whose entire offerings centered around at home fitness have seized the opportunity mirror which was recently acquired by lululemon for 500 million has also benefitted from the shift in exercise trends to stay competitive traditional gyms have been forced to rethink their appeal to

diets are moving from fringe to fad to mainstream two thirds of the world population is lactose intolerant and lactose intolerance is on the rise in the us leading to a growing market for dairy alternatives in food and beverages whether consumers are avoiding lactose or alcohol they still want something that is just as enjoyable as the original product and grocery shelves are only beginning to see new equally satisfying offerings moving away from meat examples plant based proteins lab grown meat alternatives why it matters beyond the individual health considerations eco conscious

of plant based meat to top 5 2 billion by 2020 brands like impossible and beyond meat captured the attention of wall street but the market is far from saturated and you don t necessarily have to invent a new product restaurant owners shouldn t let themselves get lapped by the likes of burger king and dunkin in offering diners more choices from the grill plus as food delivery has soared in popularity during the pandemic demand for meat alternatives has continued to rise between march 2 and march 16 sales for plant based alternatives rose 91 according to motley fool and in the 11 weeks

jobs in solar and wind are expected to grow at rates of 63 and 57 in the coming decade and the sector is expanding without the kind of federal subsidies that the fossil fuel industry enjoys battery

of the 2017 tax overhaul was the introduction of new rules for different business structures for business owners it may be smart to review how your current structure is treated under the law in addition as more companies like uber and lyft come under the scrutiny of state and local regulators the definition of independent contractor is liable to change and could have broad reaching

capital things didn t exactly go as investors expected given the lackluster performance of these startups there could be a greater emphasis on business fundamentals and sustainable growth equity

diversity examples diversity inclusivity access to capital opportunities for advancement why it matters reverberations from countrywide protests decrying police brutality and racism have rattled the professional sphere as companies face a reckoning for allegations of a lack of diversity and toxic office behavior as a result executives have either created further diversity initiatives or doubled down on preexisting ones critics of these efforts have called them empty measures as 40 years of equity minded town halls have failed to yield meaningful diversity in the workplace as the country continues to grapple with its collective racist history companies have made renewed promises to improve their diversity efforts their success or failure could play an important role in their ability

trends for entrepreneurs to watch in 2020 health and wellness examples at home fitness remote exercise equipment fitness influencers mental health why it matters the coronavirus has caused more than 380 000 gyms and boutique fitness studios to close but the need for exercise has not slowed down instead gym goers have had to substantially rethink their workout routines forcing the industry to shift its focus away from in person workouts to at home options companies such as peloton tonal and hydrow whose entire offerings centered around at home fitness have seized the opportunity mirror which was recently acquired by lululemon for 500 million has also benefitted from the shift in exercise trends to stay competitive traditional gyms have been forced to rethink their appeal to customers gyms are in a position where they will innovate or they will fail jeff halevy a 20 year fitness veteran and founder of apex human performance told business insider still as millions of health minded consumers try at home fitness services for the first time many are realizing the convenience afforded by this new normal working out at home can be cheaper safer and less time intensive

fitness for the first time during the pandemic and many won t go back to the gym health services and benefits dentists are some of the highest earning small businesses jim young reuters examples telehealth remote medicine network providers why it matters the coronavirus and its attendant stay at home measures have sparked a massive change in the way that patients access healthcare according to merrit hawkins surveys 48 of us physicians now report treating patients via telemedicine a huge leap from the 18 who said the same in 2018 this paradigm shift in one of the country s biggest industries healthcare has massive implications for medical practictioners and patients alike ryan mcquaid ceo and cofounder of virtual health platform plushcare told business insider that virtual visits will outpace in person visits within the next 10 years telehealth companies such as doctolib 98point6 and sweden s kry are among the many players in the rapidly expanding industry to cope with the surge in demand these once boutique brands have found themselves in a race to scale as quickly as possible hiring medical professionals at a rapid clip to meet consumer needs in turn network providers will have an opportunity to partner with these new operations to meet connectivity demands while still while still abiding by the country s rigorous healthcare security requirements health food without compromise examples vegan lactose free non alcoholic why it matters with all the concerns about health consumers are more careful than ever about what they put in their bodies plant based diets are moving from fringe to fad to mainstream two thirds of the world population is lactose intolerant and lactose intolerance is on the rise in the us leading to a growing market for dairy alternatives in food and beverages whether consumers are avoiding lactose or alcohol they still want something that is just as enjoyable as the original product and grocery shelves are only beginning to see new equally satisfying offerings moving away from meat examples plant based proteins lab grown meat alternatives why it matters beyond the individual health considerations eco conscious consumers are driving a boom in demand for more sustainable forms of protein the market for meat alternatives could be worth 140 billion by 2029 barclays estimates and gen z could drive global sales of plant based meat to top 5 2 billion by 2020 brands like impossible and beyond meat captured the attention of wall street but the market is far from saturated and you don t necessarily have to invent a new product restaurant owners shouldn t let themselves get lapped by the likes of burger king and dunkin in offering diners more choices from the grill plus as food delivery has soared in popularity during the pandemic demand for meat alternatives has continued to rise between march 2 and march 16 sales for plant based alternatives rose 91 according to motley fool and in the 11 weeks since faux meat sandwich sales have continued their hot streak averaging 72 more sales than in the 11 weeks prior cannabis marijuana may not be for big businesses just yet but small businesses could succeed where it s legal reuters blair gable examples legalized marijuana hemp cbd why it matters investors went wild over cannabis in 2019 but continuing us federal restrictions limit the options for big businesses but as state and local regulations continue to shift toward legalization the once black market industry presents significant opportunity for small business the numbers are hard to calculate but cbd industry in the us alone could become a 16 billion industry by 2025 according to an analysis from the investment bank cowen how the trends in cannabis will play out remain to be seen and permitting and capital constraints are substantial but many growers processors and sellers are seeing success with strategies that focus on local markets and organic growth alternative energy examples solar wind batteries why it matters unit costs for alternative energy are on par with or lower than the cost of fossil fuels and more homes and businesses are investing in their own systems jobs in solar and wind are expected to grow at rates of 63 and 57 in the coming decade and the sector is expanding without the kind of federal subsidies that the fossil fuel industry enjoys battery technologies will play a major role in this transition since sun and wind aren t always available and different regions of the country will naturally emphasize different technologies former aol ceo steve case is behind an investing strategy with a focus on lesser known locales revolution reaching new geographies examples innovation hubs big city diasporas venture capital heartland cities and towns why it matters sky high rents living costs and commuting times have made it harder to live and work in cities like new york and san francisco the coronavirus too has motivated many to abandon the city life for some emigrating from large metropolitan hubs is just a temporary reponse to the increased risk the virus poses in dense areas for others though the pandemic has thrown into light more sharply the perennial challenges of living in large cities accelerating migrations that are likely to be permanent companies and individuals are electing to leave the coasts and some states and cities are offering bonus payments for people to move there although the vast majority of venture funding is concentrated in just a few cities new investing strategies are specifically targeting the heartland with anchor institutions like research universities and large companies smaller cities around the us are becoming hubs of innovation for particular sectors of the economy and engines for middle class growth opportunity zones examples tax law enterprise zones community reinvestment act why it matters the opportunity zone program that began with the 2017 tax overhaul is the latest iteration of an approach to local development that has been around for a long time but this time the bipartisan program is bigger than ever and has the potential to reshape communities all over the country by bringing a silicon valley ethos to more than 9 000 distressed census tracts rethinking business structure examples partnerships s corps b corps networks why it matters another feature of the 2017 tax overhaul was the introduction of new rules for different business structures for business owners it may be smart to review how your current structure is treated under the law in addition as more companies like uber and lyft come under the scrutiny of state and local regulators the definition of independent contractor is liable to change and could have broad reaching implications for you or your business stephanie nadi olson founded a network of remote working marketing professionals courtesy we are rosie adapting to the future of work examples gig economy freelancer networks remote work work from home why it matters the transition to working from home might be the most visible ubiquitous effect of the coronavirus what first began as a necessity though has now become the preference of many companies and employees included according to an april metova survey 57 of respondents who are new to working from home due to the coronavirus said they would prefer to keep doing so in the future companies have also seen increased productivity from at home employees and eliminating rent and other infrastructural costs has helped companies save money by transitioning to remote work companies that embrace freelancers and remote workers can access a wider talent pool than those that require physical presence from 9 to 5 according to a survey by deloitte half of millennial and gen z respondents said they would leave their job within two years if they had a choice up from 38 in 2017 these trends present and opportunity for business owners who need additional work and for entrepreneurs who can creatively provide those services business services examples b2b government contracting why it matters some of the most successful businesses aren t household names in fact they may only have a handful of clients but if those clients are large enough think us government or fortune 500 company your business may focus on performing one niche service well such as event production or graphic design some services depend on scale to be effective but others are more individually tailored and being smaller in size could have the advantage of being more nimble and responsive ethan moose read says he made 225 000 reselling sneakers last year moose read resale market examples sneakers upcycling vintage why it matters with so many new consumer goods entering the market the secondary market has become an interesting opportunity footwear enthusiasts have turned a hobby into a business that some saying sneakers are the new gold online exchanges like stockx and other platforms like poshmark are evidence that for some products leaving the store is only made its first step in a long journey in the market mobility for people and things examples last mile transportation alternative modes delivery services why it matters just as people need to have places where they can settle down they also need ways to get themselves and their stuff there too big companies are generally better suited to tackle the national scale challenges in mobility but many gaps remain to be filled at a smaller local scale small businesses can partner with mega firms to develop better logistics strategies and transportation modes that lead to improved solutions for this growing demand new tools for ai and vr give new opportunities for tech savvy entrepreneurs reuters yves herman harnessing big data examples artificial intelligence virtual reality analytics why it matters the proliferation of sensors trackers and other data sources is expected to generate 175 zettabytes of data stored by 2025 according to research from idc combined with initiatives from tech giants that offer unprecedented new computational tools businesses that help companies and individuals harness the power of big data could be quite profitable the future of money examples fintech alternative finance cryptocurrencies why it matters traditional forms of lending and credit have been insufficient for many individuals and small businesses cash flow is one of the most commonly cited reasons that small businesses fail and the list of new sources of alternative capital is growing fast financial institutions and tech companies are racing to offer credit to small businesses not to mention the new forms of blockchain and cryptocurrencies these sources of capital could be a lifeline for your business when cash is tight but the regulations and protections are nowhere near as robust as they are with traditional banking just make sure to read the fine print and proceed with caution former banker cate luzio self financed her business that offers collaboration space and events geared toward professional women dominick reuter business insider organic growth examples bootstrapping self finance debt finance why it matters 2019 was supposed to be a banner year for ipos with billion dollar unicorns like wework charging to the public market on a wave of venture capital things didn t exactly go as investors expected given the lackluster performance of these startups there could be a greater emphasis on business fundamentals and sustainable growth equity investors may be more wary of pitches with hockey stick growth projections and entrepreneurs may find bootstrapping more appealing than selling ownership stakes of their companies prioritizing diversity examples diversity inclusivity access to capital opportunities for advancement why it matters reverberations from countrywide protests decrying police brutality and racism have rattled the professional sphere as companies face a reckoning for allegations of a lack of diversity and toxic office behavior as a result executives have either created further diversity initiatives or doubled down on preexisting ones critics of these efforts have called them empty measures as 40 years of equity minded town halls have failed to yield meaningful diversity in the workplace as the country continues to grapple with its collective racist history companies have made renewed promises to improve their diversity efforts their success or failure could play an important role in their ability to hire from an increasingly diverse workforce
people who shied away from investing in stocks this year such as millennials scarred by last decade s crash missed the market s best performance in six years at 27 nick de león knows firsthand about the gulf between millennials and wall street de león graduated this year from uc berkeley with bachelor s degrees in political science and rhetoric with plans to start law school soon and he has an internship with a superior court judge in his hometown of san bernardino he s also intrigued by the stock market advertisement but de león won t be investing in equities any time soon saddled with 1 400 in monthly payments for student loans and for credit card debt from a failed business start up along with living expenses such as food his phone bill and and car insurance he s temporarily living with his parents and working at costco to make ends meet there s really no money for it right now de león said of the stock market i just don t have the cash to even think about it he s not alone although the market is poised to close a banner year hovering near record highs the rally hasn t helped half of the nation s millennials who either lack the means to knock on wall street s door or are wary of doing so advertisement in the last two years an average of 49 of millennials ages 23 to 38 held stock directly or through mutual funds exchange traded funds or retirement plans such as 401 k s at any given time according to polling data that gallup provided at the times request that s down sharply from an average of 61 of americans in the same age range in the 2001 08 period before markets were hammered by the financial crisis of 2008 09 an event that s still one reason many millennials steer clear of equities analysts said millennials now entering their prime earning period hold vastly less wealth than generations that preceded them and the wealth gap between older and younger generations is widening an analysis by the st louis fed showed that in 1989 the median wealth of households led by people ages 65 to 75 was nearly eight times as large as the wealth of families headed by 25 to 35 year olds by 2016 the median baby boomer led household had nearly 13 times as much wealth as the typical millennial household advertisement that s in part due to the financial crisis that shaped the economy during millennials formative years and the habits and fears they adopted at that time have to some extent kept them away from this year s runaway market success they ve been tarnished by the damage that wall street did 10 years ago and it s in their psyche said steve nielander a san diego state finance lecturer and a partner at wealth management firm cerity partners as a result they missed the market s best performance in six years and the 11th year of the ongoing bull market that followed the crisis investors bid up prices despite the ongoing u s china trade war political turmoil surrounding president trump and fears of an economic slowdown advertisement investors instead focused on the economy s continued expansion rising corporate earnings low unemployment low inflation and the federal reserve s decision to cut short term interest rates three times in 2019 the benchmark standard poor s 500 index has shot up 29 2 this year as of friday s close on track for its biggest gain since 2013 when it rose 29 6 the dow jones industrial average is up 22 8 this year and the tech heavy nasdaq composite index has surged 35 7 technology was among the market s strongest sectors along with financial communications services and industrial stocks according to s p dow jones indices advertisement although stocks are risky investments millennials who steer clear of them are missing potentially sizable gains during their peak earning years the average return price gains and dividends of the s p 500 index historically is about 10 a year though its annual movements vary widely as shown this year keeping money in cash such as a savings account or money market fund is safer but the value and purchasing power of cash are eroded by inflation that s one reason mutual funds and exchange traded funds that mimic stock indexes such as the s p 500 are popular among investors they provide a passive way to invest in the broader market often with less risk than trading individual stocks but that distinction made little difference during the financial crisis that today s millennials witnessed when all manner of stock investing was devastated in 2008 for instance the s p 500 plunged more than 38 katherine lovinger 36 a north hollywood biostatistician for a medical devices maker said she mainly invests in a diversified basket of exchange traded funds rather than individual stocks but keeps the majority of her cash in savings accounts in part because she s worried about the stock market s outlook advertisement i understand growth is very small with compared with the stock market but i don t trust that the growth in the market is going to continue she said my best guess is that within the next six to nine months we re going to see if not a full crash at least a guaranteed slowdown a stock market dive could contain a blessing for young people who have a long term investment horizon it would create an opportunity to plow money into stocks when prices are low but many analysts say high prices alone shouldn t be a barrier to buying stocks one technique for investing without being afraid of entering at a peak is to use dollar cost averaging buying the same dollar value of the same set of stocks at regular intervals on an ongoing basis regardless of where the market stands that way the investor ends up buying more shares when prices are low and fewer when they re high advertisement it s not just millennials who are less enamored with stocks than before the financial crisis americans in general have been less invested in equities since then over the last two years 55 on average of the adult population owned stocks directly or indirectly down from 62 before the crisis said jeff jones a gallup research analyst in the 18 to 29 age group alone stock ownership averaged 37 the last two years down from 42 before the crisis he said in response the nation s major online brokerages and some digital trading upstarts are making a push to attract more younger clients advertisement charles schwab corp said in october that it was eliminating trading commissions and others such as e trade financial corp and td ameritrade corp did the same then schwab announced last month that it was acquiring td ameritrade for 26 billion in stock schwab also announced in october that it would let investors buy and sell fractions of stock that enables younger investors in particular to trade a piece of say amazon com inc even if they can t afford to buy full shares of the company which closed friday at nearly 1 870 apiece competitors such as online brokerage firm robinhood markets inc likewise offer zero commissions fractional ownership and mobile apps robinhood says it now has 10 million customer accounts advertisement robinhood co founder baiju bhatt himself a millennial has said his company was created with investors his age in mind we had seen how the younger generation had felt really frustrated disenfranchised with the way that the system worked after the financial crisis and we saw an opportunity to build a product that really spoke to that generation he told cnbc s jim cramer this month for schwab attracting millennial investors now is key because millennials and the preceding generation x will inherit a massive transfer of wealth estimated at 30 trillion or more from their parents and grandparents in the coming decades said joe vietri a schwab senior vice president who heads its branch network it s a huge opportunity for us he said once the relationship is established schwab which also operates a bank hopes the customers who were first attracted by the zero commissions or fractional ownership eventually will pay for fee based services such as investment management banking services and retirement planning advertisement connecting with millennials requires a different approach vietri said that involves understanding how their finances differ from those of older generations nearly half of schwab s millennial clients have student loan debt americans total student debt load has mushroomed to 1 6 trillion as college educations jump in price and analysts agree that burden is another reason many millennials aren t investing in stocks so is the high cost of housing in certain urban areas combined with the fact that people in their 20s often don t yet have the earning power to invest part of their income in stocks vietri said millennials also place an abnormally high premium on low costs ease of online or phone app transactions and strong security against hackers advertisement millennials have shown they re comfortable with certain financial technology such as using digital payment apps such as venmo and even high risk investments some buy and sell bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies but when it comes to the stock market their wariness remains evident as the market was moving up one day recently cnbc s cramer tweeted younger people please start investing now dollar at a time the remark drew some skepticism invest at all time highs one twitter user responded another said he was 33 with school loan debt adding this is a valid reason as to why my generation is struggling to invest advertisement bankrate com did a survey this summer asking millennials what they believed was the best investment for the next decade the top response was real estate at 36 while cash and savings accounts were 18 and the stock market was 16 still millennials also lag behind preceding generations when it comes to buying a home a study by the urban institute found that the homeownership rate for millennials in 2015 was 37 eight percentage points lower than the rate baby boomers and gen x had at the same age mark hamrick bankrate s senior economic analyst questioned whether the brokerages move to zero commissions would make much difference in attracting more young investors to stocks after all he said commissions already had been tumbling in price in recent years and millennial stock ownership still fell advertisement the elimination of commissions doesn t do a lot for those individuals who are essentially scared out of their wits by their fear of what happened in the sell off a decade ago hamrick said older millennials also remember the dot com crash of technology stocks in the early 2000s which means they ve witnessed two huge market plunges in a 10 year period and that s never happened before nielander said these people grew up and watched that and saw the pressure on their parents of losing money in the stock market losing their homes and seeing the mass distrust of wall street he said advertisement vietri said schwab encounters that fear with millennial clients when you see your parents or others go through that type of adversity it does have a lasting effect he said nonetheless he said efforts to attract more millennials efforts that include both helping them pare debt and invest among other strategies are starting to pay off vietri said 57 of schwab s new retail clients this year were younger than 40 and that percentage is definitely on the rise schwab provides one snapshot of how millennials invest by surveying its clients who have self directed 401 k s and other retirement plans meaning they can choose investments beyond the typical core investment choices provided with such plans advertisement in the third quarter of this year schwab found that all generations allocated the largest percentage of their portfolios to mutual funds and individual stocks for millennials 34 went to mutual funds and 25 to stocks but millennials allocated more to exchange traded funds and cash 24 and 16 of their portfolios respectively than other generations the survey shows millennials modest appetite for stocks will be tested if the market turns south in 2020 and there are questions about whether stock prices will keep rising if economic growth slows the u s china trade fight worsens or concerns mount about how the presidential election will affect the markets the market also is getting a bit pricey which might lead to a pullback the s p 500 now trades for about 18 times its component stocks average earnings per share up from 15 early this year according to factset and that s also above its historic average of 15 5 to 16 advertisement but hamrick said everyone knows that a downturn is to be expected if not next year then later and that the bull rally won t last forever as with a recession it s not a question of whether the market will turn lower it s a question of when along with the depth and duration of that decline hamrick said whether that will grab the attention of millennials such as de león is questionable when talking to his friends he said the stock market just doesn t come up

paris us political clouds coupled with wider climate and digital transformations point to a tricky 2020 for the world economy although experts say a lurch back to crisis is improbable the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd said last month that activity had been hobbled by weaker trade and investment in the past two years as us president donald trump pursued a trade war with china the oecd expects global growth to dip in the coming year to 2 9 per cent its lowest level since the world recession of 2009 trump appears to have struck a truce with china for now under a phase one pact announced this month but pre existing tariffs remain in place and it will take time to demobilise their effects more broadly the oecd contrasted proactive actions taken by central banks with the policy foot dragging by governments in the face of climate change and the march of technology industrialists and investors are having to correct their climate strategies even as trump sits firm in his policy of denial oil giant saudi aramco recently had to trim back the volume of its gigantic share offering the international monetary fund was a little more optimistic in its latest world economic outlook forecasting 2020 growth of 3 4 per cent but warning nevertheless of a synchronised slowdown and uncertain recovery at a time of populism and protests around the world politics will remain an economic wild card next year trump heads into the november presidential election under an impeachment cloud and britain s brexit divorce from the european union will likely be sealed next month following prime minister boris johnson s election triumph the rise of technological giants sitting on mountains of data is meanwhile challenging the distribution of wealth between governments and big business and has the potential to reshape the world of work as artificial intelligence exploits that data the online arena has emerged as another front for trump s trade wars after he threatened tariffs on france over its digital tax imposed on the likes of amazon facebook and google europe is threatening a collective response between heaven and hell ludovic subran chief economist of german insurance giant allianz sees a global purgatory of growth coming up any systemic shock next year will probably not be born in finance but will be exogenous for example a big regulatory shock on personal data or in relation to the climate he said if trump survives the impeachment process and wins a second term he could double the bet against china at the risk of military confrontation subran added trump and his potential challengers on the democratic left are united in their hostility to the free trade and liberalisation agendas that they argue hollowed out industrial america over the past decades the mistrust is felt well beyond the united states we re not worried about how to overcome a cyclical crisis we know what to do said ingo kuebler the staff representative at mahle a german automotive supplier that has already been forced to downsize as car buyers turn away from diesel engines the big issue is transformation digitalisation electric mobility he told afp fretting that an influx of cheap chinese car batteries means we are dreading the loss of many jobs the big income gap since the financial crisis a decade ago central bank policies have led to negative interest rates spreading in some countries squeezing bank profitability and inflating private debt with growth faltering the debate about wealth distribution will likely become still more acute anger at inequality runs like a thread through protest movements from rich hong kong to developing chile in 2018 according to oxfam 26 billionaires had as much money as the poorest half of the world even when people seem to enjoy basic material comfort they may still experience the same level of misery and unhappiness as the poorest french academic esther duflo said in october after she won the nobel prize in economics us investor steve eisman of the big short fame thinks that another global crisis is unlikely but the best that can be hoped for is a slow strangulation of growth what will happen next time whenever it does happen will be your normal garden variety of recession where the economy slows and goes negative and people lose money that ll be painful enough eisman told afp a systemic crisis once was enough for our lifetimes he said reflecting back on the implosion of 2007 2008 that made hundreds of millions for his hedge fund when he correctly foretold the us subprime collapse the prescient strategy of eisman and other investment mavericks was recounted in a book by journalist michael lewis and subsequent oscar winning movie
on christmas eve the trump campaign launched a website to guide its supporters in holiday political debates with their liberal snowflake relatives to assist any snowflakes on the receiving end of the campaign s falsehoods and blatant distortions of fact a point by point takedown follows the trump economy in demonstrating how strong the trump economy supposedly is the campaign s holiday debate guide highlights job growth since trump assumed office but job creation has slowed significantly since january 2017 despite trump s relentless self aggrandizing and bragging a whopping 1 million fewer jobs were created during trump s first 34 months in office compared to obama s last 34 period the trump campaign also points to record low unemployment in response snowflakes should show their trump supporting friends and relatives a graph of the unemployment rate over the last decade and challenge them to point out where exactly things magically changed when trump took over unsurprisingly trump supporters have no response unemployment has declined at a consistent rate since early 2010 meaning that nothing changed after trump became president trump is loudly taking credit for the obama administration s aggressive economic recovery measures which according to the experts saved the american economy moreover trump promised to bring manufacturing jobs back to the united states but the truth is that manufacturing now accounts for the smallest share of the american economy in 72 years thanks to trump s tariffs which amounted to the largest tax increase on americans in decades farm bankruptcies and farmer suicides have spiked meanwhile median household income an important economic measure has remained largely stagnant over trump s first three years in office trump administration spin aside increases in household income trail those under obama which grew steadily toward the end of his administration despite trump s overblown boasts about the economy his campaign is suspiciously silent on the most important economic measure of them all annual economic growth with trump s promises of 4 percent 5 percent even 6 percent economic growth his campaign s silence is not surprising growth will slow significantly this year demolishing trump s absurd predictions of 6 percent growth indeed trump will end his first term with a high of 2 9 percent growth in 2018 tying obama s economic record moreover stock market gains under trump lag significantly compared to those under obama and president clinton when it comes to the economy trump s schoolyard boasting is just louder and more relentless than his more humble predecessors immigration deportations are far lower at this point in the trump administration than they were during the obama administration the trump campaign s holiday debate guide also attempts to link immigration detention cages to the obama administration to be clear separating migrant families was a trump administration policy there was no blanket policy separating children from their parents under previous administrations military spending by allies trump often takes credit for persuading countries in the nato alliance to spend more on defense but our nato allies have been steadily increasing defense spending since 2014 when russia invaded eastern ukraine america is now the laughingstock of the world and with trump siding with authoritarians and dictators around the world american credibility and popularity on the international stage have plummeted to historic lows trade deals without relentless insistence by democrats on labor and environmental protections trump s u s mexico canada agreement would have been nearly identical to nafta this is not a win for trump health care trump and gop efforts to undo the affordable care act resulted in 1 1 million americans losing health coverage in 2018 this breaks a 10 year streak of rising numbers of insured americans two thirds of americans filing for bankruptcy do so because they cannot afford to pay medical bills often despite having health insurance perhaps worse america is seeing an alarming increase in deaths of despair particularly among the white working class citizens who came out in droves to vote trump into office perhaps their votes for the angry scapegoating candidate were grounded in a dramatic decline in their health economic fortunes and overall quality of life the trump tax cuts the trump campaign claims that trump s massive tax cuts his only legislative accomplishment are driving economic growth but a devastating analysis by the nonpartisan congressional research service found that the trump tax cuts had virtually no effect on the economy moreover the trump tax cuts did not boost workers wages instead they went to corporate stock buybacks which benefit the ultra wealthy this stunning lack of economic growth begs the question why are we racking up trillions of dollars in debt much of it bought up by china thanks to the massive trump tax cuts for the rich indeed as a direct result of trump s tax cuts 2018 was the first year ever that tax revenues actually declined in a relatively strong economy this paved the way for the trump administration to post the largest monthly deficit in u s history exploding the federal debt where is the tea party outrage on this while many commentators blame obama for skyrocketing debt during his administration they conveniently ignore that those increases according to the u s treasury were overwhelmingly due to the long term effects of the george w bush tax cuts for the ultra wealthy this graph makes it quite clear beyond trump s astronomical debt increases the only other discernible effect of the trump tax cuts appears to be an explosion in wealth and income inequality indeed inequality in america is now at levels not seen since 1929 when wall street greed caused the great depression for his part trump told his ultra rich friends that you all just got a lot richer immediately after his tax cuts were passed impeachment and quid pro quo given the facts there is zero doubt that trump withheld crucial military assistance to an ally at war for personal political gain that is the definition of corruption trump s own political appointees including his acting chief of staff and budget director widely respected diplomats a purple heart recipient foreign policy professionals career budget officials rightly concerned with obeying federal law and a leading fox news analyst have all made the president s corrupt intent an indisputable fact indeed why was critical military aid to ukraine halted just 91 minutes after trump s not so perfect call with the ukrainian president more importantly if trump did nothing wrong and has nothing to hide why is the white house refusing to let four key officials testify do innocent people go out of their way to bury the facts why are republicans supposedly impartial jurors in an impeachment trial engaging in total coordination with the accused in any other american court the judge would immediately order such jurors removed and replaced before going to trial it should hardly be surprising that 55 percent of americans support trump s impeachment and removal from office that number will only grow as more details of trump s corrupt actions emerge bonus fact trump was against providing lethal military aid to ukraine blowing up a favorite republican talking point joe biden and ukraine america s nato allies the european union the international monetary fund and ukrainian anti corruption activists all publicly called for the removal of a corrupt and ineffective ukrainian prosecutor to the relief of america s allies and patriotic ukrainians biden managed to get him fired importantly the ukrainian company that hired biden s son was not under investigation when biden intervened moreover there is zero evidence of wrongdoing by either biden on the contrary the removal of an ineffective prosecutor represented an enormous victory in the fight against endemic corruption in ukraine biden should be commended for his efforts trump on the other hand undercut and sidelined the most effective voices against corruption in ukraine for personal political gain the trump economy the environment and oil production the trump campaign s holiday guide claims that trump has taken important steps to restore preserve and protect our land air and waters could the campaign be referring to trump green lighting toxic emissions of mercury from coal fired power plants or perhaps the litany of ways the trump administration has dismantled laws and regulations protecting healthy safe and clean drinking water could the campaign be referring to trump exposing american workers to toxic particulates and dust the list goes on and on and it s not pretty as detailed above the rollback of these critical health and environmental regulations did not result in a spike in economic growth making their repeal utterly unnecessary not to mention dangerous for all americans lastly the trump campaign takes credit for the united states becoming the world s largest oil producer but this trend began in 2011 trump had nothing to do with it more importantly with a staggering 120 000 weather records broken in the u s this year alone and the world s top companies projecting at least 1 trillion in costs due to climate change trump has very little to crow about marik von rennenkampff served as an analyst with the u s department of state s bureau of international security and nonproliferation as well as an

the economic calendar will only marginally get busier in the coming week and trading volumes are not expected to pick up much as new year celebrations get underway however key manufacturing gauges out of china and the united states could spoil the festive rally in equities as trade deal optimism continues to support risk assets heading into 2020 meanwhile in fx markets the threat of another flash crash similar to the one seen in january 2019 will likely keep traders on edge no improvement anticipated in chinese pmis china s official manufacturing pmi will hit the markets on tuesday but with the economy still appearing to be slowing the data may not be how traders would want to bid farewell to 2019 on the last trading day of the year the non manufacturing pmi is also released the same day while the caixin markit manufacturing pmi is due on friday although both the official and caixin markit pmis have shown signs of stabilization in china s trade war hit manufacturing sector there are doubts as to how sustainable this improving picture is given that the phase one deal won t remove much of the tariffs imposed by the us on chinese imports and the global economy remains on a shaky ground the official manufacturing pmi is forecast to slip 0 1 points to 50 1 in december and the caixin markit is expected to dip by the same amount to 51 7 worse than expected numbers in the pmis could cause some new year jitters with the australian dollar being the main victim from any spike in risk aversion though it would probably require a big miss in the forecasts to offset the current positive sentiment the aussie hit a 5 month high this past week and with the currency looking a little overbought a sell off could see it tumbling back towards the 0 69 level quiet week in europe it will be another sleepy week in europe with the final readings of ihs markit s manufacturing pmis for december being the only highlight the lacklustre agenda may turn markets attention on domestic german data as investors fret about the health of the eurozone s growth engine the german data will start the week on monday with november retail sales up first followed by unemployment numbers for the same month on friday as well as the flash inflation print for december on thursday the final manufacturing pmis for december are published for the eurozone and the united kingdom no revision is expected to the eurozone s preliminary reading of 45 9 but the uk s pmi is predicted to be revised up slightly to 47 6 the uk will also see the release of the construction pmi for december on friday recent figures out of the eurozone have been mostly encouraging with increasing signs that the economic slowdown is bottoming out however neither is there any evidence that growth is about to kick off into full gear and recession risks persist particularly in germany recession fears are also lingering in the uk as the threat of a no deal or a hard brexit are keeping investors nervous about the outlook for the british economy as lawmakers prepare to rush through boris johnson s withdrawal agreement in parliament before the january 31 deadline hence next week s releases have the capacity to trigger some spikes in the euro and the pound if there are large deviations from the forecasts amid the still many uncertainties and the thin liquidity in the holiday period the pound has managed to stabilize from its steep selloff that was brought on from johnson setting a hard deadline to strike a post brexit trade deal with the eu and is on track to finish the year with more than 2 gains versus the us dollar however the euro s recent rebound hasn t been enough to recoup its year to date losses versus the greenback and is on track to end 2019 down by almost 3 spotlight on ism manufacturing pmi the us will have a somewhat busier seven days providing some excitement for the markets as the festivities begin to wind down the main spotlight will be on the closely watched ism manufacturing pmi on friday but the conference board s consumer confidence index due on tuesday will also be important the ism s purchasing managers index has been pointing to a contraction in the manufacturing sector since august and the consensus forecast is for a fifth straight reading below 50 in december however the pmi is projected to tick up slightly from 48 1 to 49 0 which would suggest an easing of the pace of decline in manufacturing activity any unexpected weakness could spark fresh worries about the american economy as well as raise doubts about the speed of any recovery now that a phase one trade deal is pretty much a done deal however as long as consumption data remain solid the reaction to poor manufacturing numbers is likely to be contained after last week s upbeat personal income and spending figures the consumer confidence indicator is expected to further reassure investors that consumption is still going strong in the us the index is forecast to increase to 128 5 in december from 125 5 in november before all that the chicago pmi for december and pending home sales for november will attract some attention on monday also to watch are the federal reserve s minutes of the december meeting on friday the minutes aren t expected to reveal anything new on the fed s current stance on monetary policy so traders will mostly be focusing on what the data will be telling about the state of the us economy as it enters 2020 the dollar has been on the backfoot since news of an interim trade deal with china first emerged as it s lost some of its safe haven allure standing firm only against the japanese yen another haven currency and although if there are more positive us reports in the coming weeks this should continue to limit dollar selling there is a risk of steeper declines if the trade optimism holds and the economic outlook for the rest of the world starts to brighten on the other hand if us data disappoint but it comes against a backdrop of weaker growth elsewhere this is likely to provide stronger support for the greenback as it would feed the narrative that the us has the least ugly economy in the world
stock market crash talking points after negotiating a series of economic and geopolitical risks in 2019 the s p 500 rounded out the year more than 30 higher although many risks have been resolved or put on pause key uncertainties remain global trade conflicts lackluster global growth political uncertainty and possible inflation will look to erode equity returns in the year ahead but can they overwhelm various tailwinds including the major global central banks when will the stock market crash equities in the developed world particularly in the united states rounded out the decade with a strong showing as key risks subsided and an accommodative monetary policy backdrop allowed stocks to soar with 2020 in focus there is evidence for a continuation higher what is a recession signs causes impact investors still some investors harbor concerns over the stock market s health and stability in the year ahead but can the headwinds work to outweigh the benefit of looser monetary policy and easing risk trends here are some of the themes that could spark a stock market crash in 2020 global trade conflicts slowing global growth much of 2019 was plagued with fears of slowing global growth a theme exacerbated by trade wars mainly between the us and china that worked to drive uncertainty and delay some businesses from making capital outlays in turn slipping global trade and prolonged policy uncertainty exerted further pressure on the already slowing economies of the world as growth forecasts tapered off the case for higher equity valuations was undermined as future profit outlooks fell beneath previous expectations that being said an initial phase one trade deal between the united states and china reached at the end of 2019 worked to assuage such fears and sparked the year end rally into the new decade similarly us economic data has hinted that the slowdown in the manufacturing and service sectors has leveled off further still data from factset suggests the s p 500 will see bottom up eps growth despite the headwinds it would be within reason then to suggest trade wars and slowing global growth will take a back seat as catalysts of risk aversion in 2020 however the fluidity and unpredictability of trade negotiations will likely keep them in the headlines and deserving of a spot on the risk radar nonetheless although trade headlines and tariffs may not cause the stock market to crash outright an expanded trade war perhaps one between the united states and the european union could work to compound other uncertainties that the dow jones and s p 500 will have to negotiate like the presidential election cycle political uncertainty the us election cycle another hot button issue that will dominate headlines and likely maintain a spot at the forefront of investor concern is the upcoming presidential election in the united states as candidates vie for the support of the american people their polling results and corresponding policy promises will surely spark stock market turmoil especially if an anti business candidate appears likely to enter the white house as it stands president trump is a relatively pro business president slashing corporate taxes and exploring further reductions for the middle class the president has given the equity market reasons to rejoice apart from his pressure for lower interest rates and quantitative easing but has also created a lot of turmoil through his trade policy still the trump administration has said its broader goal has been to expand the us economy and promote growth in part by balancing trade relationships with other nations read more stocks may turn defensive with us presidential election eyed therefore if a candidate that promises to raise taxes while aiming to reform sectors like healthcare and technology surges in the polls an adverse reaction in the broader market could be expected furthermore particularly acute damage could be dealt to the targeted industries to be sure the efficacy or greater good for the american populace produced by one policy framework versus another is up for debate but any indication a business friendly candidate president trump or otherwise will lose out to a candidate whose plan s will constrict growth will surely weigh on stock valuations thus the us election cycle will its spot as a top risk to watch as the year progresses the inflation threat finally and perhaps most importantly is the threat of inflation as the world s major central banks continue to inject money into their respective economies in pursuit of economic growth inflation has remained dormant fed chairman jerome powell has effectively taken rate hikes off the table until the united states sees a material and consistent rise in inflation consequently there is a very real possibility of further rate cuts if growth continues to disappoint and that potential has likely been factored into some analyst s equity price targets in 2020 therefore a sustained uptick in inflation could pull the rug out from under the major equity markets in 2020 as central banks shift their focus from promoting economic expansion to quelling inflation by raising interest rates as it stands many wall street analysts and talking heads have argued inflation is muted because it is simply being calculated incorrectly as many of the ingredients for rising inflation are present in the economy how to invest during a recession investments strategy low unemployment wage growth loose monetary policy and a substantial government deficit are typically contributing factors to rising inflation yet the fed s preferred measure of inflation core pce remains comfortably beneath the 2 target therefore should inflation rise the fed would likely be forced to consider higher interest rates which would undermine a main driver of the equity gains established in 2019 such a reversal in monetary policy could spark an abrupt shock to equity demand and valuations that being said there are few signs inflation is on the rise and that is precisely why it may pose such a threat since it is arguably an underappreciated risk an unexpected uptick could deliver the necessary spark to ignite a crash unlike the other themes that will likely offer persistent pressure but may be less likely to result in an abrupt reevaluation of growth forecasts and asset prices that would devolve into a crash will the stock market crash in 2020 at the onset of 2020 and the advent of the new decade however it seems unlikely such a crash will take place anytime soon as i discussed above a crash would likely require a collection of persistent pressures working to overcome the effects of accommodative monetary policy an unexpected rise in inflation or something completely unknown at present recommended by peter hanks download the 2020 equity forecast get my guide still years of low interest rates have distorted the traditional risk reward profile and could see an eventual crash create a greater unraveling in risk assets that being said it is nearly impossible to forecast such an event so investors should be mindful of their risk exposure and employ proper risk management techniques regardless of the shorter term equity outlook written by peter hanks junior analyst for dailyfx com follow peter on twitter peterhanksfx
