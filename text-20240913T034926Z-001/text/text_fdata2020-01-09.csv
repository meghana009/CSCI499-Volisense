currently the world s largest ipo owing shares of saudi aramco is a dream for most indians similarly owning shares of microsoft apple google and other fortune 500 companies are a big desire for indian investors owing to the growth opportunity that is offered by such corporates with the opportunity of investing in indian markets declining for various reasons the importance of investing in foreign currency assets or global assets and markets is gaining popularity for resident indian there is an opportunity under lrs where capital account transactions are permitted resident individuals to acquire shares of both listed and unlisted overseas companies or debt instruments investment in units of mutual funds exchange traded funds etfs venture capital funds and promissory notes as per rbi

of close relatives abroad business trip medical treatment abroad studies abroad purchasing real estate abroad investing in foreign equities and debt available to resident individuals us inr movements in the age of growing volatility across the financial products currency fluctuation over the years has been no different along with several other global currencies in the developing economies indian rupee too had its fair share of wild fluctuations against the us dollar a falling rupee against the us dollar plays spoilsport especially for indians planning to travel abroad hits the budget of parents looking to send their children for overseas education not just that the domestic hospitality sector also bears the brunt of high import prices of certain food and liquor items for the uninitiated the indian rupee has depreciated to the tune of 39 in the past ten years against the us dollar as a generation that has imbibed global aspirations such weakening rupee most of the times lead to higher pay outs or direct losses especially when the liabilities or payments need to be met or made in us dollars however despite the depreciation in the currency the dollar remittances by indians have increased over this period as more and more indians travel abroad for leisure employment business studies medical treatment etc or continue to invest in global markets assets or instruments the demand for us dollars will continue to strengthen the outward remittances from india have increased 10 times in the past 4 years alone indians remitted us 13 78 billion to overseas destinations in 2018 19 under the liberalised remittance scheme lrs building dollar dominated assets investing in foreign assets helps the individual to diversify their investment portfolio to cover up the risk associated with the fluctuating economy as they can spread out their assets across geographical diversification rather than sticking to conventional asset classes like domestic equities debt commodities having some investments in international stocks can help diversify your portfolio or assets in case your portfolio is relatively small then the best route to invest in foreign stocks is through a mutual fund registered in india putting all eggs in one basket is dangerous likewise building all assets in a single country focused basket can meet the same fate over a period some industry experts even recommend moving one s portfolio away from a single country and single currency risk in favour of a global portfolio on the other hand investing in foreign assets shifts risk and acts as insurance against such wild swings in the domestic market secondly companies listed on global capital markets are larger and have significant exposure to the developed markets and also exposure to several other emerging markets the earnings of these global giants is primarily dollar denominated sales or in other hard currencies such as euro pound or yen thirdly the profitability and valuations of these companies are different and dependent on broader factors as compared to indian listed firms and the doubts are laid to rest when one compares the returns from global indices as well as the dollar as compared to the prominent indian indices in the past 10 years the us dollar has appreciated by 51 7 4 26 cagr in terms of indian rupee equivalent at the same time nasdaq 100 has grown 287 14 65 cagr compare it to indian nifty 100 which in the past 10 years has grown 139 9 09 cagr even if india outperforms foreign markets the lack of perfect correlation between different markets itself reduces portfolio risk from a strategic asset allocation perspective as well the developed global markets are nearly 75 80 of world markets these are economies that are developed and

global economic growth is forecast to edge up to 2 5 per cent in 2020 a slight rise from 2 4 per cent in 2019 as investment and trade gradually recover from last year s significant weakness but downward risks persist the world bank said in a report on thursday growth among advanced economies is anticipated to slip to 1 4 per cent in 2020 from 1 6 per cent last year in part due to continued softness in manufacturing growth in emerging market and developing economies on the other hand is expected to accelerate this year to 4 1 per cent in 2020 from 3 5 per cent last year on the back of an improved performance of a small group of large economies which are shaking off economic sluggishness or stabilising after a recession about a third of emerging market and developing economies are projected to decelerate this year due to weaker than expected exports and investment with growth in emerging and developing economies likely to remain slow policymakers should seize the opportunity to undertake structural reforms that boost broad based growth which is essential to poverty reduction said ceyla pazarbasioglu world bank group vice president for equitable growth finance and institutions steps to improve the business climate the rule of law debt management and productivity can help achieve sustained growth the multilateral lender also mentioned a number of risks to the global economy this year including trade disputes and geopolitical tensions it said a sharper than expected growth slowdown in major economies such as china the united states or the euro area would similarly reverberate widely a resurgence of financial stress in large emerging markets as experienced by argentina and turkey in 2018 an escalation of geopolitical tensions or a series of extreme weather events could all have adverse effects on economic activity around the world according to the lender the report also highlighted mounting debt among emerging and developing economies over the past 50 years public borrowing can be beneficial and spur economic development if used to finance growth enhancing investments such as infrastructure health care and education it said and while currently low interest rates mitigate some of the risks high debt carries significant risks it can leave countries vulnerable to external shocks it can limit the ability of governments to counter downturns with fiscal stimulus and it can dampen longer term growth by crowding out productivity enhancing private investment the world bank said growth in the middle east and north africa is projected to accelerate to 2 4 per cent in 2020 largely driven by higher investment promoted by public sector infrastructure initiatives and stronger business climates the world bank said among oil exporters growth is expected to pick up to 2 per cent infrastructure investment and reforms to improve the business climate are seen as advancing growth among the gcc economies to 2 2 per cent in the uae growth is forecast at 2 6 per cent in 2020 and 3 per cent for 2021 and 2022 the world bank projected 1 8 per cent growth for the uae s economy in 2019 oil prices are forecast to decline slightly to an average of 59 a barrel in 2020 and 2021 us supply is expected to continue to increase in 2020 as new pipeline capacity comes on stream it said

and as quickly as it began the latest middle east crisis was over it appears president trump announced that no further action was to be forthcoming from the united states as iran s missiles caused no casualties in yesterdays attack iran for its part said yesterday that it was effectively one and done and just like that the next middle east crisis had gone in 60 seconds faster than a stolen ford mustang shelby gt500 over the horizon the massive rotation into haven positioning yesterday had already started to run out of steam in the european morning such is the attention span and the complacency of financial markets these days the logic being that if the united states didn t immediately push a button triggering an instant shock and awe air campaign retaliation then one wasn t going to happen the shocking ignorance of the logistics of war aside no surprise in this age of smart phone instant gratification financial markets got it right by luck not talent the nimble and the brave would have used yesterdays price action in asia to get on board the global growth fomo trade at better levels with president trump choice discretion over valour the haven sell off completely unwound as markets went into business as usual mode gold collapsed along with oil equities rallied into the green and the japanese yen and swiss franc longs were reversed and then some in yen s case the most relieved people on the planet overnight were the world s central bankers open hostilities between ithe us and iran would almost certainly have pushed the world into a recession as i have warned numerous times before their continuous feeding of the world s addiction to a zero per cent cost of capital has left monetary policy around the world in a box canyon the abject failure of the world s politicians and central banks to impose losses on anyone post the gfc has left interest rates at or near record lows across the globe when greece can issue 10 year debt at lower rates than the us government something is clearly still wrong with the world the world s central banks now have precious little ammunition left in their armouries as opposed to the us and iran to counter a war induced shock recession or any recession for that matter the world s central banks are drawing a huge sigh of relief today because like the us and iran they have dodged a bullet that all means that it will be back to business as usual i e getting long the asian post trade agreement recovery trade buying equities anywhere and generally hunting for yield in any form early indications from asia are that precisely that is happening with asian stock markets enjoying a robust start overnight data from the us saw the adp employment change outperform adding 202 000 jobs it sets up markets for another robust non farm payrolls number tomorrow evening around 165 000 lower than last month but still respectable australia s november balance of trade rose more than expected to a 5 8 billion the rise was driven by an increase in exports by two per cent and a fall in imports by three per cent unfortunately that was november going forward the effects of australia s bushfire crisis will start to be felt notably in agricultural exports but also in tourism receipts and domestic consumption thankfully after a total failure of leadership australia s federal government is starting to get its act together on the fiscal front to help offset those effects early estimates though suggest the lucky country s gdp will be shaved from 0 20 to 0 50 china s december inflation has just been released holding steady yoy at 4 50 food prices continue to be the main culprit for the elevated inflation read driven by the ravaging of china s pork stocks by african swine flu it has had a knock on effect on pork substitute prices those jumps though should start to fall out of the cpi data later in q1 and geopolitics aside china inflation should wane in the coming months looking ahead the data calendar is light for the remainder of the day tomorrow australian retail sales and malaysian industrial production could provide some short term volatility ahead of the week s main event the us non farm payroll data for the remainder of the day asia is likely to busy itself forgetting that yesterday ever happened equities the de escalation of us iran tensions overnight greenlighted equity investors to pile back into the long any stock anywhere fomo trade wall street s indices all finished dint he green as president trump declined further military action against iran for now in his speech the s p 500 rose 0 50 the nasdaq rose 0 73 and the dow jones rose 0 68 asian markets have proceeded directly to go this morning as well recouping all of yesterday s losses the nikkei is up 1 95 the kospi 1 15 and the shanghai composite by 1 0 over in regional markets the straits times has risen 0 35 the hang seng 1 30 with the australian all ords climbing 1 0 per cent the relief that business has returned to normal so quickly is palpable we expect that equities will continue to perform strongly this afternoon and into the european morning session currencies the safe haven rotation of yesterday has been aggressively unwound most notably in the japanese yen usd jpy climbed 150 points from its lows yesterday to finish 1 10 higher at 109 20 assuming no shocks on the geopolitical front usd jpy may well eye another test of multi month highs at 109 75 the market s other goto haven currency the swiss franc also fell against the dollar usd chf rose 0 50 to 0 9740 which is a daily resistance region a break higher implying further rallies to 0 9800 the off shore yuan rally has also resumed in earnest usd cnh falling to 9 9280 this morning from a high of 6 9600 yesterday usd cnh has support at 6 9000 followed by 6 8200 regional currencies have strengthened against the us dollar this morning a confidence returns most notably the korean won which is 0 30 higher at 1159 50 oil oil had its wildest day since the saudi arabia attacks last year after spiking aggressively as news of iran s missile attack hit the news wires oil gave back all of those gains to finish much lower on the day both brent and wti futures traded in a roughly 8 0 range yesterday brent crude hit 72 0 a barrel in early asia yesterday but ended the session lower than its open by 3 65 at 65 90 a barrel wti also spiked and traded at 65 40 a barrel in early asia yesterday but it also plunged as tensions eased finishing 4 0 lower from its open at 60 00 a barrel both contracts are unchanged this morning in asia which is hardly surprising the aggressive ranges of yesterday most likely flattening near all short term positioning at these levels both brent and wti are very near to daily support regions given the potential for headline driven spikes though and the clearout of speculative longs yesterday the street is likely to be reluctant to push oil significantly lower from here int he short term gold gold s day in the sun has ended as quickly as it began after touching 1611 00 an ounce on panic iran buying yesterday gold steadily gave up its gains president trump delivered the coup de grace by declining to retaliate militarily against iran gold falling all the way to 1552 00 an ounce before closing at 1557 00 an ounce a stunning fall from grace off course gold s rally had been driven by aggressive risk aversion buying since the us assassination of an iranian general last week with both sides apparently finished with posturing and chest thumping calling it a one all draw the reasons to own gold have diminished as fast as they occurred gold has support at 1550 00 an ounce with a move through this level implying further losses to 1525 00 some weeks end risk hedging has seen gold climb to 1561 00 an ounce this morning however the rally is tiny in the context of the recent day s ranges and short of another middle east conflagration looks more like a dead cat bounce looking at the price action in equities over the last 12 hours gold bulls should exercise caution at these levels

how well will china s economy perform in 2020 the popular view appears to be that real gdp growth will continue its downward trend sliding below 6 percent contrary to the popular view that china s growth will slow further we at deutsche bank think the chinese economy will likely bottom out in 2020 and gdp growth will pick up modestly from the second quarter of this year we see three main drivers for an economic recovery in 2020 growth may turn positive first export growth will likely turn positive again thanks to a stabilizing global economy and a halt to further increases or even possible rollback of us tariffs we expect china s exports to bottom out in the next few months and improve gradually throughout 2020 to about 5 percent growth by the end of the year global demand appears to be bottoming and it may show modest improvement in 2020 the global manufacturing purchasing managers index historically a good leading indicator for china s exports has rebounded over the

goods such as vehicles and cell phones the china us trade war despite often occupying news headlines is only a secondary factor in china s slowdown the main driver of the chinese economy is domestic

overreacted china s external flows have not deteriorated trade and current account surpluses have increased fdi inflows have continued and portfolio inflows have surged and we expect these trends to continue in 2020 this outlook is not without risks though a near term obstacle is the consumer producer price divergence if the gap persists between high consumer price index inflation and producer

it s been argued for a very long time that some knowledge of history is useful to the scientist the economist or the student of literature or philosophy on the grounds that no science or art is static this argument by strategic thinkers has its background on the premise that historical science begins with a reaction to the imagined happenings of the past history however is the reconstruction of the past by and for those who are living in the life of those who are dead it is a tool of all discipline and the key to wisdom people who ignore the lessons of history wonder in dilemma the usefulness of the above words of wisdom played out in august 1995 during an address by harvard political professor samuel huntington at taipei he was asked of his impression about prime minister lee kuan yew s effort to develop singapore and he scantly summed it up this way the honesty and efficiency senior minister lee has brought to singapore are likely to follow him to his grave however like faith which is a belief in things not seen coupled with the fact that ordinary calculation can be upturned by extra ordinary personalities not only did lee s efficiency survive him but history has since assisted in providing answers to the correctness or otherwise of professor samuel huntington declaration accordingly it s now on public domain that two years after the asymmetrical observation singapore a country with a gdp of 3billion in 1965 grew to 46billion in 1997 making it the 8th highest per capita gnp in the world according to the world bank ranking clearly a bracing account and unprecedented

literacy a growing middle class and political institution that support citizens with the favourable economic environment to survive this leads to another set of a sad narrative presently nigeria is a country that services its debt with 50 of its annual revenue we don t need to be economists to know that we have become a high risk borrower the country going by reports would be facing another round of fiscal headwinds this year with the mix of 83 billion debt rising recurrent expenditure increased cost of debt servicing sustained fall in revenue and about 22 billion debt plan waiting for legislative approval it may be worse if the anticipated shocks from the global economy like the brexit the united states china trade war and interest rate policy of the federal reserve bank go awry the nation s debt stock currently at 83billion comes with huge debt service provision in excess of n2 1 trillion in 2019 but set to rise in 2020 this challenge stems from the country s revenue crisis which has remained unabating in the last five years while the borrowings have persisted an indication that the economy has been primed for recurring tough outcomes the report concluded indeed the question may be asked why the country s revenue crisis remained unabated in the last five years within the context the answer lies in the fundamental recognition that there is a country reputed for crude oil dependence and laced with management system devoid of accountability transparency and accuracy and before a real solution can be proffered we need as a nation to find and understand the sources of the national problems without losing sight of the real and lasting meaning wrapped in the lesson as an illustration the nigeria extractive industries transparency initiative neiti few days ago told nigerians that the nation loses about 4 1 or n123billion annually due to poor crude oil production metering stating that unless government takes appropriate measures limitations in the metering of crude oil production will continue to pose serious threat to the nation s revenue target regrettably nigeria is the only oil producing country without adequate metering to ascertain the accurate quantity of crude oil produced at any given time the report concluded what the above tells us as a country is that there is more work to be done more reforms to be made that as a nation we are poor not because of our geographical location or due to the absence of mineral natural resources but because our leaders fail to take decisions that engineer prosperity and we cannot solve our socio economic challenges with the same thinking we used when we created it and this piece may not unfold completely the answers to these challenges but there are a few sectors that a nation desirous of development can start from and the first that comes to mind is the urgent need for diversification of the nation s revenue sources revenue diversification from what developments experts are saying will provide options for the nation to reduce financial risks and increase national economic stability as a decline in particular revenue sources might be offset by an increase in other revenue

washington jan 8 2020 global economic growth is forecast to edge up to 2 5 in 2020 as investment and trade gradually recover from last year s significant weakness but downward risks persist the world bank says in its january 2020 global economic prospects growth among advanced economies as a group is anticipated to slip to 1 4 in 2020 in part due to continued softness in manufacturing growth in emerging market and developing economies is expected to accelerate this year to 4 1 this rebound is not broad based instead it assumes improved performance of a small group of large economies some of which are emerging from a period of substantial weakness about a third of emerging market and developing economies are projected to decelerate this year due to weaker than expected exports and

san diego the mood among economic forecasters gathered for their annual meeting last weekend was dark they warned one another about president trump s trade war about government budget deficits and repeatedly about the inability of central banks to fully combat another recession should one sweep the globe anytime soon among the thousands of economists gathered for the profession s annual meeting there was little celebration of mr trump s economic policies even though unemployment is at a 50 year low wages are rising and the economy is experiencing its longest expansion on record underlying their sense of foreboding was a widespread sentiment that the current expansion is built on a potentially shaky combination of high deficits and low interest rates and when it ends as it is bound to do eventually it could do so painfully those concerns were echoed on wednesday by economists at the world bank who called the worldwide expansion fragile in their latest global economic prospects report the report forecasts a slight uptick in growth in 2020 after a sluggish year bogged down by trade tensions and weak investment but it said downside risks predominate including the potential escalation of trade fights sharp slowdowns in the united states and other wealthy countries and financial disruptions in emerging markets like china and india
how well will china s economy perform in 2020 the popular view appears to be that real gdp growth will continue its downward trend sliding below 6 percent contrary to the popular view that china s growth will slow further we at deutsche bank think the chinese economy will likely bottom out in 2020 and gdp growth will pick up modestly from the second quarter of this year we see three main drivers for an economic recovery in 2020 growth may turn positive first export growth will likely turn positive again thanks to a stabilizing global economy and a halt to further increases or even possible rollback of us tariffs we expect china s exports to bottom out in the next few months and improve gradually throughout 2020 to about 5 percent growth by the end of the year global demand appears to be bottoming and it may show modest improvement in 2020 the global manufacturing purchasing managers index historically a good leading indicator for china s exports has rebounded over the past few months exceeding 50 in november 2019 into 2020 sentiment appears to be forming a bottom on a global scale in the united states recession risks have reduced noticeably growth is expected to bottom out by the end of 2020 in europe manufacturing data are beginning to bottom particularly in germany and the risk of a disruptive no deal brexit has diminished japan s gdp growth is also expected to improve in 2020 after the consumption tax hike in the fourth quarter of 2019 domestic demand is main economic driver second consumer spending will likely increase especially on durable goods such as vehicles and cell phones the china us trade war despite often occupying news headlines is only a secondary factor in china s slowdown the main driver of the chinese economy is domestic demand including consumption and investment the 5g network which is planned to be introduced to most cities in 2020 will provide further incentives for consumers to upgrade their smartphones if the 5g rollout follows similar patterns as 3g and 4g 5g smartphone sales will likely accelerate in mid 2020 and reach a peak around 2022 overall car ownership is still low in china with the exception of a few megacities car ownership per 1 000 people in china is only about 150 passenger cars equivalent to japan s level in 1975 china s car ownership will likely continue to rise rapidly aside from this long term trend a new replacement cycle too is on the horizon consumption spending likely to increase our key non consensus assumption is a cyclical recovery of consumption spending after the housing boom in 2016 18 chinese households faced a higher debt service burden and tighter liquidity constraints which prompted them to reduce spending especially on durable goods we are starting to observe signs of improvement in household liquidity mortgage interest rates after rising sharply in 2017 18 declined in 2019 and growth of household liquid assets started to recover also household surveys indicate a pickup in urban household spending growth of late which in turn suggests the gap between household income and spending could be closing third fiscal expansion and monetary easing will likely support the economy through infrastructure investment and higher credit growth the prospects for manufacturing investment this year will crucially depend on the sino us trade war and producer price developments if as we expect trade tensions ease after the signing of the phase one deal and exports start to recover it will be good news for manufacturing investment infrastructure investment is on track for a good start in 2020 the government has redoubled its policy efforts for infrastructure investment this year and we expect infrastructure investment after an initial surge in the first half of this year to gradually moderate in the second half for the whole of 2020 we see infrastructure investment growth at 6 7 percent compared with 4 5 percent in 2019 fiscal policy may focus on spending with policy likely to remain supportive in 2020 we expect the augmented fiscal deficit to increase by another 1 percent of gdp after a major round of tax cuts fiscal policy will likely focus more on spending in 2020 including infrastructure investment and employment social benefits the people s bank of china the country s central bank will likely expedite the use of lending facilities to support credit to the real economy while constraining the use of required reserve ratio and medium term lending facility rate cuts this mix of growth and policy outlook will be overall positive news for the chinese currency we forecast the yuan will appreciate to 6 7 per us dollar by the end of this year because we believe the market overestimated the impact of the sino us trade war on china and overreacted china s external flows have not deteriorated trade and current account surpluses have increased fdi inflows have continued and portfolio inflows have surged and we expect these trends to continue in 2020 this outlook is not without risks though a near term obstacle is the consumer producer price divergence if the gap persists between high consumer price index inflation and producer price index deflation it will be difficult for policymakers to support growth and maintain price stability at the same time persistent tensions in sino us relations also weigh on the growth outlook a non negligible risk is that the us could scale up export controls and restrictions on china s technology companies the author is an economist at deutsche bank the views don t necessarily reflect those

outcomes the report concluded indeed the question may be asked why the country s revenue crisis remained unabated in the last five years advertisement within the context the answer lies in the fundamental recognition that here is a country reputed for crude oil dependence and laced with management system devoid of accountability transparency and accuracy and before a real solution can be proffered we need as a nation to find and understand the sources of the national problems without losing sight of the real and lasting meaning wrapped in the lesson as an illustration the nigeria extractive industries transparency initiative neiti few days ago told nigerians that the nation loses about 4 1 or n123billion annually due to poor crude oil production metering stating that unless government takes appropriate measures limitations in the metering of crude oil production will continue to pose serious threat to the nation s revenue target regrettably nigeria is the only oil producing country without adequate metering to ascertain the accurate quantity of crude oil produced at any given time the report concluded what the above tells us as a country is that there is more work to be done more reforms to be made that as a nation we are poor not because of our geographical location or due to absence of mineral natural resources but because our leaders fail to take decisions that engineer prosperity and we cannot solve our socio economic challenges with the same thinking we used when we created it advertisement and this piece may not unfold completely the answers to these challenges but there are a few sectors that a nation desirous of development can start from and the first that comes to mind is the urgent need for diversification of the nation s revenue sources revenue diversification from what developments experts are saying will provides options for the nation reduce financial risks and increase national economic stability as a decline in particular revenue source might be offset by increase in other revenue sources jerome mario utomi jeromeutomi yahoo com writes from lagos advertisement
san diego the mood among economic forecasters gathered for their annual meeting last weekend was dark they warned each other about president donald trump s trade war about government budget deficits and repeatedly about the inability of central banks to fully combat another recession should one sweep the globe anytime soon among the thousands of economists gathered for the profession s annual meeting there was little celebration of trump s economic policies even though unemployment is at a 50 year low wages are rising and the economy is experiencing its longest expansion on record underlying their sense of foreboding was a widespread sentiment that the current expansion is built on a potentially shaky combination of high deficits and low interest rates and when it ends as it is bound to do eventually it could do so painfully those concerns were echoed wednesday by economists at the world bank who called the worldwide expansion fragile in their latest global economic prospects report the report forecasts a slight uptick in growth in 2020 after a sluggish year bogged down by trade tensions and weak investment but it said downside risks predominate including the potential escalation of trade fights sharp slowdowns in the united states and other wealthy countries and financial disruptions in emerging markets like china and india the materialization of these risks would test the ability of policymakers to respond effectively to negative events the report by the bank which is led by david malpass a former trump administration official stated the bank s warnings echoed the fears expressed by many economists in san diego both in small research paper presentations and in ballroom discussions of the clouds on the global economic horizon trade tensions have cooled at least temporarily between the united states and china but they are escalating across the atlantic as european nations begin to impose new taxes on technology companies that are largely based in the united states trump has already threatened tariffs on french goods in retaliation for a tech tax and many analysts worry that separate trade talks between the united states and the european union could end in a tariff war manufacturing is mired in a global slowdown with the sector contracting in the united states at a packed room in san diego last week researchers presented estimates that tariffs imposed by the united states and china which remain in place despite the recent truce in trade talks have reduced wages for workers in both countries already the u s economy appears to have grown by a little more than 2 in 2019 though the statistics are not yet fully compiled that is likely to be the slowest rate of trump s presidency and well below the growth trump promised his economic and regulatory policies would produce the world bank estimates growth in the united states will slow to 1 8 this year and will slip to 1 7 next year that would be nearly the lowest annual rate since the last recession ended in mid 2009 the bank said the forecast reflects fading stimulus from trump s signature 2017 tax cuts and from government spending increases he has signed into law the cuts and to a lesser degree the additional spending have helped push the federal budget deficit to nearly 1 trillion a year even as unemployment lingers near a half century low fiscal deficits remain high in several other wealthy nations particularly given how far into an economic expansion those countries are interest rates have been dropping across advanced economies thanks to long running trends like population aging that leaves central banks which usually stoke growth by making borrowing cheaper with far less conventional power in a recession economists have been going through the stages of grief as they accept that such low rates are likely to prevail john c williams who leads the federal reserve bank of new york said at the weekend s gathering after the 2007 to 2009 recession economists speculated that the conditions that plagued developed nations low growth low inflation and low interest rates would be short lived scars were still healing after the worst downturn since the great depression they thought that view has slowly been replaced by a more pessimistic one as the field acknowledged that economic gains are likely to remain muted across advanced countries in 2019 the fed had to step back from plans to increase rates further and cut borrowing costs instead leaving their policy rate at less than half of its 2007 level and underlining just how diminished the new normal looks it s clear that more was and still is going on said janet l yellen the former federal reserve chairwoman speaking at the event although monetary policy has a meaningful role to play in addressing future downturns it is unlikely to be sufficient in years ahead for several reasons yellen emphasized that government spending would need to play a larger role in combating future downturns calling for stronger automatic stabilizers which increase government spending when the economy weakens and tax receipts fall there is no imminent sign that congress is ready to enact such policies but hope for government action was a constant refrain in san diego sluggish growth in worker productivity has held back the economy valerie a ramey an economist at the university of california san diego said she called on lawmakers to increase spending on infrastructure and research and development in order to spur a productivity acceleration yellen who assumed the presidency of the american economic association at the meeting oversaw its program of panels and presentations assembling a lineup that included several papers assessing damage from tariffs and the trade war she said she and her colleagues rejected four proposals for every five that were submitted choosing some that showed the benefits to advanced economies of attracting immigrants particularly highly skilled ones in stark contrast to trump s hard line on immigration few of the papers presented assessed trump s tax law and none of them argued as trump s advisers did at similar conferences in recent years that the tax cuts were supercharging investment in an interview saturday morning yellen said that she had a reason for picking the sessions she did calling low interest rates the macroeconomic issue of our times she said she shared other economists concerns about trade and economic policy in the current environment you do see a number of sessions in the program about this yellen said i organized the program and i think it s not an accident you re seeing it i think it s very important ben s bernanke who was fed chairman during the 2007 09 recession told the conference that a juiced up monetary policy arsenal should be enough to combat the next downturn but on one point we can be certain the old methods won t do he said the fed will need to use bond buying and other tricks to supplement rate cuts and even economists most hopeful takes had a gray lining bernanke s relative optimism hinged on the idea that interest rates would not continue to fall yellen s hope for the future turned on greater activism from politicians to fight recessions if those things do not happen the united states could look more like japan a nation where inflation has slipped much lower rates are rock bottom and the budget deficit much larger in good times said adam s posen president of the peterson institute for international economics that may not be the worst outcome in a recession though the nation s example may offer bad news in the years since the financial crisis japan has rolled out an extremely active economic policy both monetary and fiscal to move its inflation rate back up and it has succeeded only in averting outright price declines it is wise to be cautious and not assume that they will be as effective as we think posen said of monetary policies we need to think about different ways of doing fiscal monetary coordination and while some economists such as harvard s lawrence h summers extolled high fiscal deficits as a necessary weapon against slowdown or recession others such as harvard s n gregory mankiw and kenneth rogoff and stanford s michael j boskin presented research warning that high levels of government debt could crimp growth going forward those papers echoed warnings that those economists issued earlier in the expansion that did not come to pass but they argued that the large amounts of federal debt that has accumulated in the meantime poses a threat in other words the economists warned it is only a matter of time c 2020 the new york times company
how well will china s economy perform in 2020 the popular view appears to be that real gdp growth will continue its downward trend sliding below 6 percent contrary to the popular view that china s growth will slow further we at deutsche bank think the chinese economy will likely bottom out in 2020 and gdp growth will pick up modestly from the second quarter of this year we see three main drivers for an economic recovery in 2020 growth may turn positive first export growth will likely turn positive again thanks to a stabilizing global economy and a halt to further increases or even possible rollback of us tariffs we expect china s exports to bottom out in the next few months and improve gradually throughout 2020 to about 5 percent growth by the end of the year global demand appears to be bottoming and it may show modest improvement in 2020 the global manufacturing purchasing managers index historically a good leading indicator for china s exports has rebounded over the past few months exceeding 50 in november 2019 into 2020 sentiment appears to be forming a bottom on a global scale in the united states recession risks have reduced noticeably growth is expected to bottom out by the end of 2020 in europe manufacturing data are beginning to bottom particularly in germany and the risk of a disruptive no deal brexit has diminished japan s gdp growth is also expected to improve in 2020 after the consumption tax hike in the fourth quarter of 2019 domestic demand is main economic driver second consumer spending will likely increase especially on durable goods such as vehicles and cell phones the china us trade war despite often occupying news headlines is only a secondary factor in china s slowdown the main driver of the chinese economy is domestic demand including consumption and investment the 5g network which is planned to be introduced to most cities in 2020 will provide further incentives for consumers to upgrade their smartphones if the 5g rollout follows similar patterns as 3g and 4g 5g smartphone sales will likely accelerate in mid 2020 and reach a peak around 2022 overall car ownership is still low in china with the exception of a few megacities car ownership per 1 000 people in china is only about 150 passenger cars equivalent to japan s level in 1975 china s car ownership will likely continue to rise rapidly aside from this long term trend a new replacement cycle too is on the horizon consumption spending likely to increase our key non consensus assumption is a cyclical recovery of consumption spending after the housing boom in 2016 18 chinese households faced a higher debt service burden and tighter liquidity constraints which prompted them to reduce spending especially on durable goods we are starting to observe signs of improvement in household liquidity mortgage interest rates after rising sharply in 2017 18 declined in 2019 and growth of household liquid assets started to recover also household surveys indicate a pickup in urban household spending growth of late which in turn suggests the gap between household income and spending could be closing third fiscal expansion and monetary easing will likely support the economy through infrastructure investment and higher credit growth the prospects for manufacturing investment this year will crucially depend on the sino us trade war and producer price developments if as we expect trade tensions ease after the signing of the phase one deal and exports start to recover it will be good news for manufacturing investment infrastructure investment is on track for a good start in 2020 the government has redoubled its policy efforts for infrastructure investment this year and we expect infrastructure investment after an initial surge in the first half of this year to gradually moderate in the second half for the whole of 2020 we see infrastructure investment growth at 6 7 percent compared with 4 5 percent in 2019 fiscal policy may focus on spending with policy likely to remain supportive in 2020 we expect the augmented fiscal deficit to increase by another 1 percent of gdp after a major round of tax cuts fiscal policy will likely focus more on spending in 2020 including infrastructure investment and employment social benefits the people s bank of china the country s central bank will likely expedite the use of lending facilities to support credit to the real economy while constraining the use of required reserve ratio and medium term lending facility rate cuts this mix of growth and policy outlook will be overall positive news for the chinese currency we forecast the yuan will appreciate to 6 7 per us dollar by the end of this year because we believe the market overestimated the impact of the sino us trade war on china and overreacted china s external flows have not deteriorated trade and current account surpluses have increased fdi inflows have continued and portfolio inflows have surged and we expect these trends to continue in 2020 this outlook is not without risks though a near term obstacle is the consumer producer price divergence if the gap persists between high consumer price index inflation and producer price index deflation it will be difficult for policymakers to support growth and maintain price stability at the same time persistent tensions in sino us relations also weigh on the growth outlook a non negligible risk is that the us could scale up export controls and restrictions on china s technology companies the author is an economist at deutsche bank the views don t necessarily reflect those

statistics south africa said on thursday 9 january that the key manufacturing sector declined 3 6 on a year on year basis in november 2019 before the advent of stage 6 load shedding sa s economy has begun the year on a sour note with the world bank being the first financial institution to cut the country s economic growth outlook to below 1 for 2020 due to the return of load shedding underscoring the fragility of the economy statistics south africa stats sa said on thursday 9 january that the key manufacturing sector declined 3 6 on a year on year basis in november 2019 this was before the advent of stage 6 load shedding with nine of the 10 sub sectors reporting contractions worryingly this included the motor vehicle division seen as vital for employment and exports which shrank 10 the textile and clothing sector slid 13 3 only the food and beverages component saw growth of 1 3 which is hardly surprising as the population is growing and south africans like to drown their sorrows adding to the gloom the south african chamber of commerce and industry sacci business confidence index bci crept up in december to 93 1 from 92 7 in november the 2019 average was the lowest since 1985 when apartheid south africa was in the throes of sanctions and a state of emergency sacci economist richard downing told business maverick small wonder that the world bank revised its economic growth forecast lower and that may yet prove to be optimistic with load shedding already underway at this stage of the summer when factories mines and other business operations are starting again after the holiday season in its global economic prospects report which was released on 8 january the washington based lender now expects the economy to grow by 0 9 in 2020 compared with the 1 5 it proffered in june 2019 this is just the latest report showing the herculean task faced by president cyril ramaphosa to revive sluggish economic growth and make a dent in the unemployment rate of 29 which is more than 35 when including discouraged job seekers the world bank has blamed rolling power cuts for the downgrade of its 2020 economic growth forecast as eskom which supplies virtually all sa s power struggles to keep the lights on south africans have experienced intermittent stage 2 load shedding cutting up to 2 000mw from the electricity grid since 4 january and power cuts are set to continue until 10 january after eskom experienced a further loss of generation capacity resulting in emergency electricity reserves being used during the daytime eskom is in a dire financial position with insufficient revenue from electricity sales to service its r460 billion debt load and tariffs that do not allow it to recover all costs eskom is the biggest risk to sa s economy and the country s public finances the world bank said eskom has worsened the government s debt profile as on going bailouts of the power utility are expected to push the country s debt to gross domestic product to 70 in the next three years further weighing on investor sentiment the world bank s 0 9 economic growth forecast in 2020 is below population growth of 1 6 meaning south africans on average will get poorer in 2020 although statistics sa is yet to publish official economic growth figures for 2019 the world bank expects the economy to expand by 0 4 this means economic growth will be far below population growth for the fifth consecutive year since 2015 if the economy expands by 0 9 in 2020 as suggested by the world bank it will be the sixth consecutive year that population growth has outpaced economic growth the world bank s economic growth forecast for 2020 is lower than the growth projected by the national treasury 1 2 credit rating agencies moody s investors service standard poor s and fitch ratings which all expect the economy to expand by 1 over the same period see other economic growth forecasts here more of the same as 2020 economic growth outlook expected to flounder in addition to power supply constraints the world bank said sa s weak economic growth outlook is due to persistent policy uncertainty constrained fiscal space subdued business confidence and weakening external demand particularly from the euro area and china
nigeria s economy will grow by 2 1 per cent for three consecutive years covering 2020 2021 and 2023 the world bank has predicted the report which also showed that kenya would record six per cent growth during the same period puts global economic growth at 2 5 per cent the predictions are contained in world bank s january 2020 global economic prospects released on wednesday the report however described the country s macroeconomic framework as not conducive to confidence according to the bretton woods institution the macroeconomic framework i characterised by multiple exchange rates foreign exchange restrictions and persistent inflation for sub saharan africa regional growth is expected to peak at 2 9 per cent in 2020 assuming investor confidence improves in some large economies energy bottlenecks ease a pickup in oil production contributes to recovery in oil exporters and robust growth continues among agricultural commodity exporters the forecast is weaker than previously expected reflecting softer demand from key trading partners lower commodity prices and adverse domestic developments in several countries the bank pegged global economic growth at 2 5 per cent in 2020 as investment and trade gradually recover from last year s significant weakness but downward risks persist it said growth among advanced economies as a group is anticipated to slip to 1 4 per cent in 2020 in part due to continued softness in manufacturing while growth in emerging markets and developing economies is expected to accelerate this year to 4 1 per cent world bank group vice president for equitable growth finance and institutions ceyla pazarbasioglu advised that with growth in emerging and developing economies likely to remain slow policymakers should seize the opportunity to undertake structural reforms that boost broad based growth which is essential to poverty reduction steps to improve the business climate the rule of law debt management and productivity can help achieve sustained growth pazarbasioglu said world bank prospects group director ayhan kose said low global interest rates provide only a precarious protection against financial crises the history of past waves of debt accumulation shows that these waves tend to have unhappy endings in a fragile global environment policy improvements are critical to minimize the risks associated with the current debt wave kose added according to the report in south africa growth is expected to pick up to 0 9 per cent assuming the new administration s reform agenda gathers pace policy uncertainty wanes and investment gradually recovers growth in angola is anticipated to accelerate to 1 5 per cent assuming that ongoing reforms provide greater macroeconomic stability improve the business environment and bolster private investment in the west african economic and monetary union growth is expected to hold steady at 6 4 per cent in kenya growth is seen edging up to six per cent the report said economic recovery in sub saharan africa lost momentum with growth in 2019 estimated to have moderated to 2 4 per cent intensifying global headwinds such as decelerating activity in major trading partners elevated policy uncertainty and falling commodity prices have been compounded by domestic fragilities in several countries in angola nigeria and south africa the three largest economies in the region growth was subdued in 2019 remaining well below historical averages and contracting for a fifth consecutive year on a per capita basis it said regional growth is expected to pick up to 2 9 per cent in 2020 assuming investor confidence improves in some large economies energy bottlenecks ease a pickup in oil production contributes to recovery in oil exporters and robust growth continues among agricultural commodity exporters in the west african economic and monetary union growth is expected to hold steady at 6 4 per cent among the region s exporters of agricultural commodities sustained strong public infrastructure spending combined with increased private sector activity in madagascar rwanda uganda or continued reforms to raise the productivity and competitiveness of export oriented sectors such as in burkina faso and côte d ivoire will continue to support output in kenya growth is seen edging up to six per cent the world bank said a sharper than expected deceleration in major trading partners such as china the euro area or the united states would substantially lower export revenues and investment a faster than expected slowdown in china would cause a sharp fall in commodity prices and given sub saharan africa s heavy reliance on extractive sectors for export and fiscal revenues weigh heavily on regional activity a broad based rise in government debt has led to sharp increases in interest burdens crowding out non interest expenditure and raising concerns about debt sustainability insecurity conflicts and insurgencies particularly in the sahel would weigh on economic activity and food security in several economies
global economy on the road to recovery in 2020 global economy recovery should take hold in the first half of 2020 the preconditions for a recovery of the global economy in 2020 have significantly improved due to the following factors economic policy uncertainty has decreased the central banks of the largest economic areas have adopted noticeably easier monetary policies in 2019 leading indicators on the global level already pointed to an upswing in economic activity in the 4th quarter of 2019 in view of trade barriers remaining in place we initially expect just a slow gradual recovery of the global economy eurozone stable growth momentum expected in 2020 we are forecasting stable gdp growth of 1 2 for the eurozone in 2020 we expect that pressures from foreign trade and the reduction of inventories will ease we believe this will be offset somewhat by a decline in the pace of domestic demand growth particularly in investment spending which benefited in 2019 from significant non recurring effects related to ireland however given the backdrop of a brightening global economic outlook there are upside risks to our growth forecast eurozone inflation expected to increase moderately in 2020 headline inflation in the eurozone should rise moderately to 1 3 in 2020 this forecast is based on the assumption of a largely stable oil price and an increase in core inflation to 1 2 however the emerging global recovery could analogous to historical upswings trigger a rally in oil prices moreover persistent tensions in the middle east may support oil prices thus our inflation forecast for 2020 is subject to upside risks as well regardless of this the ecb will continue to focus on the trend in core inflation usa economy remains on growth path us economic growth has held up well despite a difficult environment we expect us economic growth to remain stable as we envisage at least no renewed intensification of the trade dispute with china no additional pressures should emanate from this front this year in our opinion there are no signs of imbalances the correction of which could trigger an economic downturn overall we expect economic growth of just below 2 this year global economy asia remains the growth engine of the global economy in the 2nd half of 2019 the global economic environment continued to be weighed down by the trade dispute as well as the structural problems of the automotive sector however thanks to the rapprochement in the trade dispute and the avoidance of a hard brexit political uncertainty decreased apart from this both the federal reserve and the ecb eased monetary policy noticeably this provided a boost to risk appetites in global financial markets as a result of which inter alia yields on long term government bonds in the large currency areas usd eur and jpy increased significantly since the end of august demand for safe haven currencies such as the swiss franc and the yen also declined in this environment which enabled the euro to gain a little ground against both currencies since the end of august however the trade dispute has done significant damage to global supply chains as well as investment confidence thus we initially expect only a slow gradual economic recovery at the global level in our opinion two sectors will be particularly in focus in 2020 after the severe slump of last year global automobile production should recover somewhat in 2020 following a strong decline in 2019 around 8 the global semiconductor market should also recover and resume its long term growth trajectory the imf expects global gdp growth to accelerate in 2020 mainly thanks to an acceleration of growth in emerging markets download the full cee market insights

institution the macroeconomic framework is characterised by multiple exchange rates foreign exchange restrictions and persistent inflation for sub saharan africa regional growth is expected to peak at 2 9 per cent in 2020 assuming investor confidence improves in some large economies energy bottlenecks ease a pickup in oil production contributes to recovery in oil exporters and robust growth continues among agricultural commodity exporters read also world bank warns of rise in poverty the forecast is weaker than previously expected reflecting softer demand from key trading partners lower commodity prices and adverse domestic developments in several countries the bank pegged global economic growth at 2 5 per cent in 2020 as investment and trade gradually recover from last year s significant weakness but downward risks persist it said growth among advanced economies as a group is anticipated to slip to 1 4 per cent in 2020 in part due to continued softness in manufacturing while growth in emerging markets and developing economies is expected to accelerate this year to 4 1 per cent world bank group vice president for equitable growth finance and institutions ceyla pazarbasioglu advised that with growth in emerging and developing economies likely to remain slow policymakers should seize the opportunity to undertake structural reforms that boost broad based growth which is essential to poverty reduction steps to improve the business climate the rule of law debt management and productivity can help achieve sustained growth pazarbasioglu said world bank prospects group director ayhan kose said low global interest rates provide only a precarious protection against financial crises the history of past waves of debt accumulation shows that these waves tend to have unhappy endings in a fragile global environment policy improvements are critical to minimize the risks associated with the current debt wave kose added according to the report in south africa growth is expected to pick up to 0 9 per cent assuming the new administration s reform agenda gathers pace policy uncertainty wanes and investment gradually recovers growth in angola is anticipated to accelerate to 1 5 per cent assuming that ongoing reforms provide greater macroeconomic stability improve the business environment and bolster private investment in the west african economic and monetary union growth is expected to hold steady at 6 4 per cent in kenya growth is seen edging up to six per cent the report said economic recovery in sub saharan africa lost momentum with growth in 2019 estimated to have moderated to 2 4 per cent intensifying global headwinds such as decelerating activity in major trading partners elevated policy uncertainty and falling commodity prices have been compounded by domestic fragilities in several countries in angola nigeria and south africa the three largest economies in the region growth was subdued in 2019 remaining well below historical averages and contracting for a fifth consecutive year on a per capita basis it said regional growth is expected to pick up to 2 9 per cent in 2020 assuming investor confidence improves in some large economies energy bottlenecks ease a pickup in oil production contributes to recovery in oil exporters and robust growth continues among agricultural commodity exporters in the west african economic and monetary union growth is expected to hold steady at 6 4 per cent among the region s exporters of agricultural commodities sustained strong public infrastructure spending combined with increased private sector activity in madagascar rwanda uganda or continued reforms to raise the productivity and competitiveness of export oriented sectors such as in burkina faso and côte d ivoire will continue to support output in kenya growth is seen edging up to six per cent the world bank said a sharper than expected deceleration in major trading partners such as china the euro area or the united states would substantially lower export revenues and investment a faster than expected slowdown in china would cause a sharp fall in commodity prices and given sub saharan africa s heavy reliance on extractive sectors for export and fiscal revenues weigh heavily on regional activity a broad based rise in government debt has led to sharp increases in interest burdens crowding out non interest expenditure and raising concerns about debt sustainability insecurity conflicts and insurgencies particularly in the sahel would weigh on economic activity and food security in several economies also extreme weather events are becoming more frequent as climate changes posing a significant downside risk to activity due to the disproportionate role played by agriculture in many economies in the region
this article is more than 4 years old argentina s great depression continues the world bank is forecasting a third year of economic contraction but they expect things to pick up next year if bond lords and the imf give this new government s debt plan its blessing 2016 bloomberg finance lp whatever you do don t try this at home the old and tired argentinean model of price fixing and capital controls is back as always it s helping to create an artificial balance of payments surplus out of thin air in hopes bondholders will deal with the new government of alberto fernandez to extend payments out at least another year argentina s economy today can be summed up nicely by a scene from the classic comedy the three amigos when martin short s hapless naive character asks a mexican bartender if tequila was like beer to which the barman says unsure of his own answer uhh it tastes like beer argentina s plan to restructure its debt might just work and here s why the international monetary fund has its credibility on the line they gave ex president mauricio macri 56 billion in a special lending facility making it the biggest ever imf aid package there is no way the imf ditches argentina now theoretically the central bank could accumulate more dollar reserves throughout the year to rebuild sufficient liquidity for deferred medium term debt payments of the local currency bonds in particular this is probably the most effective near term approach to solvency says siobhan morden head of fixed income latin america for amherst pierpont securities the medium term strategy will require close monitoring of foreign currency reserves and whether capital controls could be effective over a lengthy period morden says adding that it remains unknown if the fernandez administration will be able to withstand another zero growth high inflation year and pay its bills on time no one in the market seems to know what will come of the self imposed march deadline to restructure its debt with foreign lenders the imf seems to be key here as most of the money owed next year is to that fund money argentina will not have if it is paying private bondholders this year and still in recession to save argentina from a surefire default requires extraordinary flexibility by the imf to endorse extending loan payments in the imf s stand by accord into an extended fund facility arrangement instead or perhaps the imf agreement is a political one as opposed to a technical agreement the u s as biggest contributor to the imf could agree to extend maturities for a quid pro quo of more friendly diplomatic regional relations this is plausible too and it would be understood what those diplomatic relations mean to fernandez alberto fernandez argentina s new president i got this 2019 bloomberg finance lp fernandez started off his first few days as president elect cheering brazil ex president and ex con luiz inacio lula da silva s freedom from prison he is also one of the leaders supporting the puebla group a group of left wing policy advocates in latin america that also includes lula speaking of leaders with bad headline appeal fernandez has also thrown his support behind venezuelan president nicolas maduro a man the u s brazil and bolivia for example do not consider the country s constitutional leader if fernandez was doing that to agitate the u s and get them to agree to an imf payment plan shift in favor of standing down on his government s support of maduro in particular it may have been his best move as argentina s new leader such a political agreement with washington would allow for a faster track process for imf negotiations says morden it would be an important liquidity relief for bond investors though it wouldn t necessarily reassure anyone about medium term debt sustainability and the interest payments due this year christine lagarde approved of the imfs largest ever financial aid package to argentina during her tenure dpa picture alliance via getty images it s still not clear if bondholder talks are ahead of or coincide with imf talks this quarter the bondholder talks may be quicker and more efficient however if there is a broad reception to friendlier terms by the imf on wednesday the world bank forecast another year of economic contraction for the argentina economy the world bank is forecasting a 1 3 contraction in 2020 which is better than the 3 1 contraction in 2019 and the 2 5 contraction in 2018 the world bank is forecasting 1 4 growth in 2021 if all goes well with creditors but that is a 3 5 correction from their previous estimate suggesting they were offkey on that bet last june when they released their last global gdp forecast argentina will eventually crawl out of this mess the economy is almost fully dollarized with real estate all priced in dollars its commodities trade all dollars and its travel industry all dollarized the middle class and the rich like in venezuela have dollar bank accounts and dollars in safes at home one day the price caps on things like gasoline will fall away market forces will return to pricing maybe foreign investors will buy and invest seeing how profits will not be squandered by government intervention then when it all goes to hell again and it will the price caps will return and dollars will be limited once again whether or not argentina goes bust depends on foreign creditors and whether or not foreign creditors bail on argentina depends on the imf the imf can t give up on argentina or they would be considered if they are not already the biggest failures in latin america by the majority of people there who are not currency and bond traders

evening ladies and gentlemen happy new year and thank you for that warm welcome to my wife pam lieutenant governor fairfax attorney general herring justices of the supreme court newly elected members returning colleagues and my cabinet and staff thank you for your service to the commonwealth and good evening madam president and madam speaker the chamber looks pretty good from up here doesn t it it s a proud moment to look out and see a general assembly that reflects more than ever the virginia we see every day this is truly an historic night just one week ago we closed a decade that sometimes challenged our fundamental beliefs and even made us question what it means to live in a changing america so tonight let us recall some basic facts because we have a lot to be thankful for and countless reasons for pride hope and optimism today around the world scientific advances mean people live longer than ever before capitalism enables more people to live in prosperity than ever and democracy gives more people than ever before the opportunity to live in freedom and shape their future we should celebrate these amazing human achievements because today we live at the greatest moment in the greatest state in the greatest country in human history but if we re honest it doesn t always feel that way our country is divided people are angry left right center urban rural men women politics has grown too much about tearing each other down and too little about public service and eight days into 2020 we know we have a long and painful election year ahead we just closed out a decade that brought a lot of change the pace of change can be disorienting and it s only getting faster ten short years ago i had served in the senate just a couple of years i ve cherished the opportunity to serve and i m thinking about that a lot tonight but ten years ago most of you were not here especially in the house of delegates everyone has a new role today these new roles bring new responsibilities the changes in this general assembly reflect the changes in virginia virginia has grown by 600 000 people since then that s like adding a new richmond and a new virginia beach in just a decade ten short years ago our country still reeled from the global economic collapse brought on by wall street greed and nearly 1 of every 10 americans was out of work today more people are working than ever before statewide unemployment has dropped to record lows that s good and we need to keep this momentum going but wages haven t kept up too many people are under employed and we can t ignore that fact the stock market has soared over these ten years so have home prices that s good news if you re already doing well but not if you re trying to many parts of virginia have grown as opportunity expands others have shrunk as opportunity recedes the climate is changing and sea levels are rising just ask the navy the shipyard our friends on tangier island or anyone who lives or works in hampton roads virginia is changing these are simply facts in politics over these past ten years if you understood these facts and you embraced change then you advanced if not you fell behind i have been really excited about tonight what an amazing opportunity for everyone here and everyone at home to witness history tonight after 400 years the first women are leading this joint assembly let s all congratulate them we celebrate this milestone and we begin a new era we spell that e r a we serve the people and they have been clear they expect us to face virginia s modern challenges and to lead the way forward to make our shared home an even better place to live and work their expectations are really simple virginians want a well paying job and the chance to get ahead they want their children to have a world class education they want to be healthy they want to live in a clean environment they want to be treated fairly and to participate in our civic life they want to feel safe and they want an inclusive virginia embracing diversity no matter the color of your skin no matter what country you come from what religion you practice or who you love i hear it all the time this is the work they have sent us here to do and this is our job for the next 60 days and beyond and tonight it s my job to lay out where we should go and how we will get there as a doctor i swore an oath first to do no harm i ve learned that s a pretty good lesson for a public official too we start by protecting people s money this means building up financial reserves and preserving our aaa bond rating this is really important because it makes everything we do easier and less expensive so i ve sent you a budget that boosts our financial reserves to 1 9 billion dollars this is six times what we had in the bank when i came into office our savings were so low that a rating agency put us on credit watch we were at risk of a downgrade that would be bad it s just like your own credit if your score goes down it s harder to borrow money to buy a car or fix up your house and it costs more too a good credit rating is about saving money and that s why it s so important it s a critical tool to help us keep our economic momentum going our economic climate has brought virginia one of the country s lowest unemployment rates at 2 6 it s rarely been this low in the technology era and every region of virginia is experiencing a lower unemployment rate than a year ago our economic climate brought amazon to northern virginia and i ve taken them to southwest virginia to encourage investment there as well that project led to a plan to train 31 000 people in computer science all across virginia our economic climate brought morgan olsen to danville pittsylania county creating 700 manufacturing jobs it brought aerofarms there too to build the world s largest and most sophisticated vertical farm agriculture remains the largest sector of virginia s economy and it s changing fast too i spend a lot of time listening to entrepreneurs around the country and around the world they all tell me we want to do business in virginia we need businesses to keep saying that we also know that the race for talent is on low unemployment means competition for workers but just because you have a job doesn t always mean you can survive on it the people who are building our economy should benefit from it too the companies that recognize this will get ahead so let s work together to raise the minimum wage let s work together to help companies properly distinguish between contractors and employees this will help workers get the fair treatment and benefits they deserve and let s always remember that good conditions for workers depend on a strong economy and a strong business climate that s how healthy and prosperous states generate the revenue to invest in safe streets public education good transportation networks and more as you drove to richmond for this session you saw numerous road projects underway all over virginia improvements of i 81 i 64 95 395 to name just a few the hampton roads bridge tunnel is being expanded and we re moving forward on two new bridges across the potomac river one for cars trucks the other for trains this is a once in a generation opportunity to make our rail system work better for commuters and passengers across all of virginia throughout the southeast and along the entire east coast we re modernizing the port of virginia to make it the deepest on the atlantic coast so it can welcome the world s largest ships and export our goods to every corner of the globe i thank you for supporting investments in this important infrastructure because transit systems bridges and roads enable virginia to compete in a fast changing global economy we have to invest to remain competitive it s no secret that the current way we fund transportation is simply not sustainable states across the country are dealing with this clearly it s good that people are burning less gas driving cleaner and more efficient cars but that means revenues are dropping while transportation costs are rising we need to reform transportation funding this session and start to make new investments in transit to help commuters and low income people get to work we also need to invest in broadband because the changing economy is about much more than moving people and goods it s also about moving information broadband has become an economic necessity for business for education for healthcare and for everyday life so i ve sent you a budget that invests 35 million each year to get more communities connected i ask you to pass it a changing economy requires us to think about education in new ways in the past we thought of early childhood education merely as babysitting but today research shows that learning starts much earlier than we used to believe the experiences children have in their earliest years lead to lifelong results as a pediatric neurologist and a parent i know that learning needs to start earlier so i have sent you a comprehensive plan for early childhood education this plan will invest 95 million new dollars to help at risk three and four year olds start learning sooner this means training educators providing support and setting accountability standards i m grateful to the first lady for bringing together the early childhood community parents providers the business community and more they all know if we invest in little learners today we ll see great results for adults tomorrow other states have done this and it s time for virginia to get moving then we need to invest in our k 12 public schools with teacher raises more guidance counselors and extra funds for high need schools this budget increases the at risk add on for educationally at risk students by 140 million this is the largest single increase to this funding source in virginia s history and it s a critical investment in helping raise student achievement an investment in public schools is an investment in students and our economy that s why it s so important in fact education represents 38 of the new spending in this budget this is far and away the largest new investment we have proposed then after high school people need to get job skills there s lots of ways to do this from registered apprenticeship programs to virginia s community colleges they understand what employers need and everyone can get to them they re nimble and they re changing fast to meet the needs of employers a changing economy requires us to think about their students in new ways too in the past when people finished high school then got a job or started a family and then went back we called them non traditional students but today that describes a lot more students than ever and many of them face two big barriers to getting advanced education the cost and life itself here s an example at reynolds community college here in richmond a majority of students are people of color the college looked at retention rates who starts a degree program and then goes on to complete it they identified students who started one academic year and didn t come back the next they asked why didn t these students come back the answer is really important the facts showed it was not academics that kept them from coming back in fact these students usually had earned a 3 1 grade point average when they left school let that sink in for a minute these students enrolled in a degree program trying to get a skill so they can get a job and provide for the people they love they set a goal they worked hard they performed well but dropped out why they left because life got in the way the car broke down or the baby got sick or they lost their job just trying to get ahead and then life hits you if you re that person and life gets in the way you re out of luck that breaks my heart here s the good news reynolds found ways to help and now virginia needs to help too so i m sending you a proposal to help people get skilled get a job and give back we call it g 3 we ll make a deal with people trying to get ahead if you need help and if you choose to go into a high demand field like health care early childhood education it public safety or the skilled trades and if you commit to community service then virginia will cover your tuition fees and books and if pell grants already do that we ll give you a stipend 1 000 a semester to help with transportation child care the rent or even food to help with life that s a small amount for the commonwealth but it can build you a future you never thought possible in return we ll ask you to serve the community virginia will be one of the first states in the country to do this this program is about people but remember this this is an investment in our economy too because virginia is one of the few states that have record unemployment and lots of people who are under employed and hundreds of companies that need workers and too many places where too many people are stuck in poverty especially in urban and rural virginia i intend to keep the classroom to career pipeline open and to keep our economic momentum going so let s work together to help people get skilled get a job and give back that s just one way we are making it easier to go to college we are also increasing funding to make public colleges more affordable for students we are increasing the tuition assistance grants that make private colleges more affordable for virginia students we re making it easier for dreamers to attend college and get ahead with in state tuition we are increasing higher education grants for veterans and the national guard this is an important way to honor their service especially now as tensions rise in the middle east we re also increasing funding for virginia s two public historically black colleges and universities they play a critical role in training our workforce and these funds will help bring them more in line with other universities please welcome president abdullah of virginia state and president adams gaston of norfolk state who are with us in the gallery tonight i want us to also work together to make sure that people have a roof over their heads affordable housing helps attract jobs and build thriving communities but this basic necessity is out of reach for too many people especially in a strong economy so i m proposing to triple the virginia housing trust fund which works to increase affordable housing and keep people from experiencing homelessness we re also proposing a new program to help reduce evictions it changes everything when you have a safe place to come home to every night i saw that recently when i met ms karen harris in richmond she had been without a place to live for more than 20 years living on the streets she told me it feels like there s no hope that no one cares then three years ago she got a place to live a group called virginia supportive housing helped her find it they help people in lots of ways from managing their health needs to filling out paperwork it s a great program they demonstrate that the best way to make sure people have a roof over their head is to put a roof over their head and guess what happened when she got a safe place to live her physical health improved her mental health improved the fear is gone she s working she s learning new things and she s giving back her life has literally been transformed she told me i don t have to just exist in this world anymore now i have a chance to live you want to know why this affordable housing proposal is so important look up there and see the big smile on ms harris s face please help me welcome her to the gallery now let s turn to health care none of us wants to worry about it not even a physician we all want it to be more affordable and easier to understand for years folks tried to expand medicaid in virginia we got it done together today 375 000 more virginians now have access to care that s good news and now there is more to do i ask you to pass the healthcare equity budget i sent you last month it looks like this do you want to see new mothers get more home visits should new mothers get access to care for a year after their baby is born this budget does that do you want to find a way to cover doula programs in the community do you want to help reduce maternal mortality particularly among women of color do you want more sickle cell services and more health care workers in communities with high needs this budget does all that do you want more behavioral health care and community services do you want military service members and veterans to have better access to health care this budget does that too this is the first time virginia has invested in all this in a serious way this is the right thing to do for people as we shape a virginia that represents everyone this also has real economic outcomes when people are healthy they can work and contribute to our economy that s good for everyone i also ask you to take three more actions to make health care easier and more affordable first i am sending you legislation to create a state run marketplace this will help people who buy insurance on their own the federal government runs the current system and it isn t working virginia can do it better ourselves and save money too second i ask you to create a reinsurance program that helps insurers cover high need people it helps keep premiums low the federal system used to have one but it ran out so premiums went up we ll adjust the cigarette tax to pay for it let s be clear it will still be lower than every neighboring state but one and then it s time to end the laws that restrict a woman s right to direct her own health care virginia has put these in place over the past 20 years or so they re not about health care they are about injecting politics and the government into the relationship between a woman and her physician you don t have to be a doctor to know that s bad medicine no more will legislators in richmond most of whom are men be telling women what they should and should not be doing with their bodies it s time to overturn these laws another thing that s important for our future is investing in our natural environment i grew up on the chesapeake bay and i value stewardship of our natural resources this responsibility goes back to the earliest days when our creator charged us to care for the fish of the sea and the birds of the air i ve seen how fragile our natural resources can be i ve seen over and over again how a clean environment and a strong economy go hand in hand so we made this a priority from the beginning and we have accomplished a lot starting with combatting climate change i set a clear goal to have 3 000 megawatts of renewable energy solar and wind under way during my term and up to 2 500 megawatts from off shore wind soon after that s enough to power more than a million homes we aim to have 30 percent of virginia s electricity come from renewable sources in this next decade and to make it 100 percent carbon free by 2050 we re on track to achieve this clean energy goal and know this we ll get there sooner if technology advances faster and if we can keep rates affordable i m pushing the energy companies to do just that we re leading by example last fall we signed the country s largest contract to buy renewable energy to power state government we re finally joining the regional greenhouse gas initiative called rggi we re replacing old diesel school buses with new electric ones we dedicated 20 million from the volkswagen environmental settlement to super charge the effort in botetourt virginia s first on shore wind project is now moving forward and we have broken ground on the first off shore wind project about 30 miles off of virginia beach now it s time to super charge that too so i have sent you plans to create a new office of offshore wind i ask you to do this so virginia can lead in clean energy here s why this is so important that off shore wind project will be enormous the turbines are huge they are taller than the statue of liberty so you can t build them in some far off factory put the blades on a truck and drive them over they re just too big it s best to build them close by then send them out to sea here s what s so exciting this means thousands of advanced manufacturing jobs for hampton roads this will create an entire new clean energy industry here in virginia it will expand supply chain and logistics opportunities but we have to invest to make it happen so i ask you to approve up to 40 million to upgrade the portsmouth marine terminal to get it ready this is good for the environment and it s good for our economy too so if you believe in clean energy if you want to see american manufacturing jobs right here in virginia jobs that will supply parts for offshore wind up and down the east coast then i ask you to pass this budget clean energy is just one of many ways we aim to protect virginia s natural resources our budget protects open space by tripling our current investment in land preservation it includes major new clean water funding these investments will help local governments tackle stormwater pollution and upgrade wastewater treatment plants they will help farmers reduce runoff and implement best management practices in conservation they will help restore oyster reefs in the chesapeake bay because a single oyster can filter 50 gallons of water a day plus they re good to eat and good for you all together our investments in clean water total more than 400 million and they will put virginia on track to meet our obligation to clean the bay by the 2025 deadline we want other chesapeake bay states to look to virginia as the clean water leader let s get it done together soon after taking office i ordered the department of environmental quality to modernize outdated regulations strengthen enforcement identify reasons for delays in permitting and improve transparency these were the first steps in restoring a critical agency that had been cut by 30 percent over the past decade we need to keep making progress so this budget includes new funding to help deq better protect the environment a major portion is dedicated to community outreach and it s time to create a permanent environmental justice council this is about addressing community issues up front it s about transparency in decision making when projects might affect a neighborhood or historic lands it s the right thing to do and i ask you to support it in all of our work we strive to treat people fairly and to make it easier to participate in our civic life basic fairness and equity are the foundation of our legislative agenda for this session if we are going to move forward as a commonwealth we must take an honest look at our past we know that racial discrimination is rooted in many of the laws that have governed our commonwealth so we convened a commission to examine overtly discriminatory language that s still on our books these include laws banning school integration prohibiting black and white virginians from living in the same neighborhoods and prohibiting people from getting married unless they re the same race these words remain enshrined in law even as many of the acts have been overturned words matter they represent who we are and what we value actions matter too so it s time to remove these words from virginia s books then we will pass comprehensive protections in employment housing and public accommodations for lgbtq people these are important steps toward building a more equal just and inclusive state we need to make it easier for people to participate in their government there s no more fundamental way to do that than to vote but in recent years virginia has steadily added more restrictions on voting this infringes on our most basic civil right as americans we need to make it easier to vote not harder so we should do two things one no excuses required to vote absentee the government shouldn t have to okay your reason for needing to vote early and then we need to make election day a holiday we can do it by ending the lee jackson holiday that virginia holds a week from friday it commemorates a lost cause it s time to move on and while we re at it we need to let localities decide what to do with the confederate monuments in their community they know the right thing to do we also need to take an honest look at our criminal justice system to make sure we re treating people fairly and using taxpayer dollars wisely for lots of historical reasons our criminal justice system doesn t provide a second chance if you make a mistake at a young age and even if you pay your debt to society your punishment too often follows you throughout your life now make no mistake if you commit a crime there will be consequences that can t change and it won t but the punishment must fit the crime not every offense deserves a life sentence it s time to temper justice with mercy remember this is a bipartisan issue lots of republican led states have reformed their criminal justice systems it s time for virginia to do it too this means de criminalizing marijuana possession and clearing the records of people who ve gotten in trouble for it it means making permanent the temporary policy you passed last year the one that says no more suspended drivers licenses just because you owe court fines if you can t drive how can you get to work to earn the money to pay those fines this temporary policy is working let s make it permanent criminal justice reform includes reforming parole if offenders are older or terminally ill and they ve paid their debt to society and they re no longer a threat what s the benefit in keeping them from being eligible for parole our criminal justice reform package funds more public defenders including the first public defender office in prince william it provides support to returning citizens and funding to speed up reviews of requests for pardons this is about simple justice and fairness when you ve paid your debt we should welcome you back encourage you to participate in civil society and restore your right to vote the data show that and it s just the right thing to do lastly let s turn to gun safety i know this is a deeply emotional issue let s focus on facts you all know the issue and so do the voters because this is not new last summer after the terrible shooting in virginia beach i called the previous general assembly into special session to take immediate action i proposed eight common sense measures designed to keep firearms away from dangerous persons but there was no action the measures i proposed did not receive a hearing virginians watched they saw what happened and they were appalled so they changed the legislature and here we are this issue generates great emotion but the facts are the facts and i want virginians to know the facts gun violence takes the lives of more than one thousand virginians every year three people every day at that rate everyone on the floor of this chamber would be gone by march these are mothers fathers sons daughters friends and little children virginians have had enough of the vigils and the funerals enough of the mourning they made that clear at the ballot box so we are back with eight common sense measures to keep dangerous persons away from firearms if you have demonstrated extreme risk of violence or there s a protective order against you you shouldn t have a firearm this means universal background checks if there s nothing in your record you have nothing to worry about let s be clear this is all fully consistent with the second amendment every one of these proposals has passed constitutional muster other states have passed them into law they were drafted by your own attorneys at legislative services and teams of lawyers have reviewed them it s clear that a majority of virginians support these measures and so do a majority of you many of you ran on common sense gun safety on both sides of the aisle i know that thoughts and prayers are important and well intended after an act of violence but virginians spoke in november and they expect votes and laws to make virginia safer as this discussion begins let s have an honest conversation based on fact not fear we will engage in civil dialogue i ask all virginians to refrain from promoting fear and intimidation i want to reiterate this common sense legislation does not violate the second amendment no one is calling out the national guard no one is cutting off your electricity or turning off the internet no one is going door to door to confiscate guns these laws are intended to keep virginians safe period it s time to act on monday it will be two years since i stood on the steps of this capitol and swore an oath to uphold the constitution of the united states and the constitution of virginia i take this oath seriously every night when i go to bed i ask myself how well did i do today how well did i serve virginia and when i m down and yes i m human too i search for new ways to carry out my responsibilities believe me i ve found some over the past year a few things sometimes keep me up at night i worry that our country is too polarized and that we might not get past it i worry that too many people believe there s not a place for them in our democracy i worry that a child born a decade ago looks at our country s politics today and thinks this is normal i want that 10 year old to know how wrong that is i want her to know that we are bigger than this we all have a lot to do to change america s politics and this country once again looks to virginia for leadership it s easy to see why in virginia we protect the people s money we balance our budget washington hasn t done that in a generation in virginia we save money we put it in the bank for a rainy day in washington they ve run up the national debt above 23 trillion dollars one day that bill will come due and it s going to cost us all and in virginia we treat each other with respect we know that nasty tweets and name calling are wrong we would punish our children if they acted that way and we should be sick of it i think we all want to live in a country where we d be proud if our young child can look to our country s leaders and say i want to be like that person when i grow up we don t have that now but we can get it back and we must tonight to everyone who took the oath of office today i say congratulations and i ask you to remember we all represent everyone who lives in this great commonwealth family friend and foe alike whether we know them or whether we like them even if you never met them or visit the place where they live that s not easy it calls us to reach out of ourselves to be larger to be generous of heart to be forgiving and to treat each other as we would like to be treated i learned that lesson from my mother when i was a kid she taught children who were learning english as their second language how to read she worked in health care nursing sick people back to health on virginia s eastern shore she volunteered with the hospice comforting people in their final hours she taught me that no matter who we are or where we come from we are all equal in the beginning and in the end i ve thought of that many times since i ve had this job that lesson comforts me especially as i take on a great responsibility like the one that you and i begin together tonight tonight i ve presented an agenda that is different from every previous general assembly session it s a lot bolder and it s more forward looking than ever before i m here as your governor because i m a builder and i hope you will choose to build too let s build virginia s future together i know it will not be easy nothing that matters is i also know this our hardest days are behind us and our greatest days ahead in america we love a new beginning as i look around this room i see 140 people that i m eager to work with some i ve known for a long time others i m just getting to know everyone in a new role i know you love virginia and i do too i was born and raised here pam and i chose to raise our family here and we intend to live the rest of our lives here we ve got a lot to do for the people of virginia and when we do it right treating each other with respect and decency virginia will once again show the country how to lead i can t imagine a more noble mission or anyone i d rather take it on with i m grateful to the virginians who stand together and who encourage me every day on behalf of virginia thank you all for your willingness to serve and to your families for supporting what you do let s make virginia proud may god bless you may god bless virginia and may god bless the greatest country in the world delegate roxann l robinson r chesterfield and senator david r suetterlein r roanoke county delivered the republican response here is the full text of their remarks senator suetterlein good evening i m senator david suetterlein from roanoke county delegate robinson and i m delegate roxann robinson from chesterfield county we re here tonight to share the republican perspective on the state of our commonwealth and to share our views on this year s general assembly session earlier today republicans and democrats came together to officially begin the 2020 session of the virginia general assembly with a day of historic firsts for the first time in virginia s history a woman was elected speaker of the house of delegates and a woman will serve as majority leader of the house of delegates regardless of party today is a day all virginians can be proud of and while we republicans are disappointed to see our two decades in the majority come to an end we re proud of the commonwealth we leave to our democratic successors starting today they inherit a dynamic and growing economy with unparalleled opportunity for virginians of all walks of life thanks to more than two decades of republican governance our commonwealth has collected accolade after accolade virginia is the best state in the nation for business we have the fourth best schools in the nation the second safest schools in the nation the second lowest crime rate the lowest criminal recidivism rate virginia has a triple a bond rating one of only a handful in the nation and a rainy day fund of more than 1 billion a hedge against economic uncertainty and student tuition is frozen at all public universities in the commonwealth for the first time in decades for 20 years general assembly republicans have governed with common sense principles focusing on the over 8 million hard working people who make virginia what it is just last year republicans not only managed to balance our budget without raising taxes we did so while giving teachers a 5 percent raise cutting taxes by more than one billion dollars and making record investments in the priorities that virginians care about our commonwealth isn t perfect but thousands of people vote with their feet each year they move here start families here and find careers here we are blessed to live in a commonwealth of opportunity truly virginia is the best place in our country to live work and raise a family republicans are rightly proud of this legacy and we wish our democratic colleagues the best and hope that they will build upon rather than reverse this hard won success while we are hopeful we are deeply concerned at early signs that they may indeed reverse course bills have been filed that would undo more than 50 years of virginia labor law others would add onerous burdens to virginia businesses imposing crippling government mandates on the small businesses that drive our economy we will work with democrats where we can to preserve and improve every facet of life in virginia it is our sincere hope that democrats will continue the policies that have served virginia well for the past two decades senator suetterlein the voters of virginia have given democrats control of state government for the first time in over a quarter century we respect that result republicans are committed to working in the best interests of those who entrusted us to stand up for virginia values to defend innocent human life to protect the rights of all virginians and to ensure the continued prosperity of the commonwealth some of the proposals being advanced by governor northam and the democrat legislative majority will have a profoundly negative effect on virginia s working families if implemented the democrats agenda will place a substantial burden on working virginians specifically the democrats proposals will raise electric bills making it more expensive for you to live in your home raise fuel prices making your daily commute to work more expensive and raise taxes taking more of your hard earned money disappointingly the budget submitted by the governor has substantial spending increases yet doesn t include a pay increase for our hard working teachers this year even when the governor does propose a cost savings to virginians with his plan to have virginia join the 36 states that do not require mandatory car inspections the savings would be more than offset by his proposed substantial increase in fuel taxes this will disproportionately hurt working virginians the governor and democrats sweeping proposals to restrict the second amendment rights of law abiding virginians has led many localities to preemptively act to protect those rights republicans will continue to defend the constitutional rights of all law abiding virginians there are some areas where many republicans concur with governor northam s proposals republicans like me stand ready to work with the governor on criminal justice reforms like ending the suspension of drivers licenses because of unpaid court fees a practice that makes it difficult for people to go to work and more likely to be dependent on taxpayer supported social services but republicans will also stand with the victims of crimes and for truth in sentencing ensuring that virginia s jury findings are upheld virginia has been blessed with both natural resources and natural beauty from the cumberland gap to the chesapeake

warns of policy uncertainty confidence challenges the world bank group yesterday raised nigeria s growth expectations in 2020 to 2 1 per cent describing it as an edge up a development that confirms the country s continued stay in sluggish economic path for another calendar year it also warned that the macroeconomic framework is characterised by multiple exchange rates foreign exchange restrictions high persistent inflation and a central bank targeting manifold objectives that are not conducive to confidence meanwhile the global economic growth is also forecast to edge up to 2 5 per cent in 2020 as investment and trade gradually recover from last year s significant weakness but downward risks persist the world bank s january 2020 global economic prospects however noted that growth among advanced economies as a group is anticipated to slip to 1 4 per cent in 2020 in part due to continued softness in manufacturing on the other hand growth in emerging market and developing economies is expected to accelerate this year to 4 1 per cent though not broad based but improved performance of a small group of large economies some of which are emerging from a period of substantial weakness the global institution noted that in angola nigeria and south africa the three largest economies in the region growth was subdued in 2019 remaining well below historical averages and contracting for a fifth consecutive year on a per capita basis beyond the large economies growth also deteriorated in several industrial commodity exporters in 2019 as weaker prices and softer demand dampened activity in extractives sectors such as in the democratic republic of congo liberia and namibia the world bank group vice president for equitable growth finance and institutions ceyla pazarbasioglu said with growth in emerging and developing economies likely to remain slow policymakers should seize the opportunity to undertake structural reforms that boost broad based growth which is essential to poverty reduction steps to improve the business climate the rule of law debt management and productivity can help achieve sustained growth the bank s prospects group director ayhan kose added low global interest rates provide only a precarious protection against financial crises the history of past waves of debt accumulation shows that these waves tend to have unhappy endings in a fragile global environment policy improvements are critical to minimize the risks associated with the current debt wave regional growth is expected to pick up to 2 9 per cent in 2020 assuming investor confidence improves in some large economies energy bottlenecks ease a pickup in oil production contributes to recovery in oil exporters and robust growth continues among agricultural commodity exporters the forecast is weaker than previously expected reflecting softer demand from key trading partners lower commodity prices and adverse domestic developments in several countries a sharper than expected deceleration in major trading partners such as china the euro area or the united states would substantially lower export revenues and investment a faster than expected slowdown in china would cause a sharp fall in commodity prices and given sub saharan africa s heavy reliance on extractive sectors for export and fiscal revenues weigh heavily on regional activity a broad based rise in government debt has led to sharp increases in interest burdens crowding out noninterest expenditure and raising concerns about debt sustainability insecurity conflicts and insurgencies particularly in the sahel would weigh on economic activity and food security in several economies extreme weather events are becoming more frequent as the climate changes posing a significant downside risk to activity due to the disproportionate role played by agriculture in many economies in the region still about a third of emerging market and developing economies are projected to decelerate this year due to weaker than expected exports and investment u s growth is forecast to slow to 1 8 per cent this year reflecting the negative impact of earlier tariff increases and elevated uncertainty euro area growth is projected to slip to a downwardly revised 1 per cent in 2020 amid weak industrial activity downside risks to the global outlook predominate and their materialization could slow growth substantially these risks include a re escalation of trade tensions and trade policy uncertainty a sharper than expected downturn in major economies and financial turmoil in emerging market and developing economies even if the recovery in emerging and developing economy growth takes place as expected per capita growth would remain well below long term averages and well below levels necessary to achieve poverty alleviation goals

naira appreciates 18 per cent in 3 days currency speculators lose billions okey onyenweaku in what was like a daring scene from a wall street movie nigeria s central bank cbn last week took on the nation s leading currency mafia and sent them scurrying into hiding as many of them lost hundreds of millions of naira as the nation s chief currency regulator unexpectedly but strategically swamped the market with united states dollars the move which started with the hard hitting sale of usd 500million saw currency traders scuttling to sell off previously hoarded stacks of dollars which set the tone for a grand showdown between the cbn and speculators but not before the cbn went ahead with the further sale of an additional usd 100million an event that made currency hoarders squirm in pain in three intense days of currency trading the naira to dollar exchange rate shifted from n520 1 to n450 1 a 72 hour currency appreciation of 18 per cent at no other time in the nation s currency management history has speculation by currency traders become such a potent force for economic damage for the better part of the last quarter of 2016 the naira to dollar exchange rate rose as if it were on an escalator the naira lost 11 per cent of its value with a fortnight and currency traders continued to force the issue as they pushed the naira to dollar rate up regardless of rising crude oil prices growing external reserves and rising sales volume says tayo omosewa an investment banker and head corporate finance alterious capital currency traders had locked themselves into a one way trading bet in which they wagered against the naira everybody expected the naira to lose value against the dollar and therefore traders started hoarding dollars in moves that created self fulfilling prophecies but with the cbn s recent intervention that strategy has been burnt along with its attendant bubble the sudden reversal of the local currency the naira from a protracted weak position to a stronger one has brought some measure of relief to several economic segments an air of optimism has been restored and manufactures and importers alike have begun to heave sighs of relief traders and buyers of food and other services have also joined to celebrate the strengthening of the naira against other currencies especially the dollar british pound and euro interestingly the naira has been on a somersault since 2014 and has not stopped plunging from n197 1 to the recent n520 1 speculators money launderers have always fought the central bank of nigeria on currency stability this became aggravated since the price of crude plunged sharply in 2014 as many persons are taking flight to safety this has given the central bank of nigeria night mares as it grapples with the challenge without success however with the recent measure the apex bank appears to be getting a handle on the challenge money launderers and speculators have had their fingers burned by the sudden appreciation of the naira from n520 1 last week to n425 this week and the appreciation is expected to continue the central governor mr godwin emefiele who before now has been called names for the rapid depreciation of the naira is suddenly a hero of some sorts emefiele who had warned speculators in 2014 against getting their fingers burnt for engaging in parallel currency market trading and is now probably laughing contentedly saying i told you so cbn has tactically deployed increasingly effective measures to temper the extreme actions of currency traders nudging the local currency to a quick recovery in very quick succession emefiele has pumped green backs into the currency market to reduce foreign currency scarcity which has been the bane of the economy the naira s sudden appreciation has been attributed by the oversight bank to a number of fresh measures to cool speculators enthusiasm to play the market the cbn has done its intelligence work and we came to the realisation that much of what was driving the demand on the bdcs and the parallel market was speculation we reasoned that since there is a lot of pressure on the two segments from people seeking to buy foreign currencies for bta tuition and medical that if we successfully address that the pressure will come down also before now the level of our reserves was not enough to make us comfortable to really do the kind of intervention that is required we decided to do so now because we are a bit more comfortable with our level of reserve the acting director corporate communications of the cbn mr isaac okoroafor has said okoroafor noted that since the new forex policy the cbn has intervened with about 591m which had led to the naira gaining strength determined to sustain its defense of the local currency the cbn on thursday february 25 2017 sold 221 371 218 04 to banks in its second special wholesale intervention since the new foreign exchange fx policy actions were announced a week ago a breakdown of the amount sold by the cbn showed that it auctioned 162 850 000 to 10 banks in a transaction with 30 days tenor while six banks participated in a separate auction with 60 days tenor in which 58 521 217 04 was sold the central bank of nigeria on monday february 28 2017 increased the liquidity in the foreign exchange market again by releasing additional 180m for settlement of various transactions while the sum of 100m was released into the wholesale forwards segment of the market additional 80m was provided to banks specifically for the settlement of dollar demands for school fees medicals and personal travel allowance among others the signs that the cbn was going to try to boost the dollar supply in the economy and deal a bad blow on speculators was the it pegged the naira exchange rate for payment of school fees strictly universities abroad and personal travel allowance pta at n375 to the dollar since then the naira has been gaining strength and stability nevertheless the cbn has also vowed to defend the naira going forward emefiele had in november 2016 enthused that cbn interventions had saved the economy from collapse if policies like recapitalisation and the treasury single account had not been created you wouldn t have imagined what our banks would have become for instance prior to recapitulation the total number of commercial banks could not match the asset base of a single south african bank but this is not the case anymore as our banks are now robust the same goes for tsa which removed sharp practices in some banks as instances arose where you had banks using government money lodged with them to buy government bonds in other words government was buying bonds back with their own cash through these banks which basically gamed the system emefiele had stated news continues after this advertisement in fact jp morgan chase co and renaissance capital had noted the rally sparked by increased sales of foreign exchange forwards and looser capital controls is contingent on the central bank continuing to sell down its reserves and until it devalues or makes a clear switch to a free floating currency africa s most populous country will struggle to lure back foreign investors prior to recent development the fate of the naira had been beclouded by uncertainty as government cbn has grappled with various experimental policies to stem the tide this had resulted into multiple exchange rates as different categories of persons get the dollar at different rates for instance analysts note that the apex bank sells dollar to people going for pilgrimage at n197 while it sells at n285 to the petroleum agency pppra this contrasts with the forward 2017 budget average of n305 similarly the bdc s 380 travelex n345 special funds airlines n355 western union n375 and black market 500 however there is still significant discomfort in the horizon as to the sustainability of the stability of the naira these are the concerns of stakeholders in nigeria many analysts are not sure of how the naira which has lost over 60 per cent of its value since the central bank of nigeria cbn removed its n197 peg in june 2016 would fare against the dollar this year managing director cowry securities limited mr johnson chukwu told business hallmark in a telephone interview that anybody who deserves blame when things are wrong deserves praises when he has done well if people can blame emefiele they should also be able to praise him he said mr chukwu said the sustainability of the recent appreciation of the naira needed the support of the fiscal authorities he explained that the fiscal authorities must manage the stability in the niger delta to increase the inflow of foreign exchange into the country chukwu notes that comprehensive management of foreign exchange appears to be beyond the cbn the monetary authorities can only use high interest rate to attract investors but there is a limit to how well that strategy can work in nigeria sustainability of a stable foreign exchange depends on how these activities work together to keep substantial liquidity in the system he said mr godwin emefiele cbn governor last week reiterated government resolve to continue defending the naira saying it is not in a hurry to completely float the country s currency dr boniface chizea managing director bic consultancy services limited argued that it would be difficult to harmonize the country s forex market because of the structure of the nigerian economy it is not the best but sometimes you have to live with it all you have to do is to put in place a tracking procedure because if the gap is wide there is a temptation to round trip the economist posited however other analysts have expressed fear that though the current moves of the cbn may be yielding results but they have reservations over its sustainability this view has been hinged on the how the nigerian economy which is still in recession responds to the multiple challenges plaguing it so far the cbn has dipped into country s reserves which has just hit about n28billion to defend the naira the price of crude which is the major revenue earner of the nation is unstable therefore market analysts note that if the price of oil falls from about 55 per barrel as at thursday march 2 2017 to anything close to 42 5 per barrel the country s accrued revenues will drop and affect external reserves and the propensity to save this would suggest that the cbn may find it difficult to close the gap between interbank and parallel market rates for now but on the balance of evidence nigeria s financial regulator is generally moving policy in the right direction as governor emefiele has been generally acknowledged to have woken up from a perceived slumber news continues after this

how much is trump s unnecessary new war with iran going to cost us hardly anyone ever asks that about wars unlike the costs of social programs so let s look at how much money our government needs to fight an unnecessary and likely counterproductive war with iran let s look into first the likely costs then we will see where trump and the republicans think they can get the masses of money needed to prosecute another gratuitous middle east war the government s purse is short of tax dollars these days after the trump radical republican tax cuts and spending rise a new house budget committee report documents 50 growth in the budget deficit since trump took office spending is growing so much faster than tax revenue that trump co has forced us into trillion dollar annual deficits far into the future before ronald reagan i remember republicans called themselves the party of fiscal responsibility as they did back in the reagan years republicans today cut taxes on the wealthy and stick the rest of us with the bill either through stealth tax increases like trump s tariffs or by simply putting government operations on the federal credit card for you and your great great grandchildren to pay off no tax cut for you wait you thought you got a tax cut from trump silly you you gave steve mnuchin betsy devos wilbur ross and the other cabinet officer billionaires as well as fake billionaire trump fat tax hikes you may have gotten a small reduction in your income tax bill since 2018 but it is a mess of pottage next to the trillions in added debt uncle sam will incur under the borrow and spend radical republican trump tax cut in a few years just the interest on the new debt will exceed what you may have thought was your income tax savings keep in mind that wars incur both immediate costs as well as future obligations when today s newborns are in their 80s they will still be paying the costs of trump s folly this assumes of course that we go to war with iran and that trump does so without what our constitution requires a declaration of war by congress which has the sole power to declare war is mandatory one cost we can t estimate is how many of your sons and daughters or grandchildren will die for trump s vanity maybe we should pray that the fiercely pro life vice president mike pence will speak up about slaughtering our young to serve trump s vanity no not going to happen pence and his crowd only speak up for the unborn pence has already made clear he is all in for trump s war candidate trump said he would get us out of the middle east instead he has about the same number of troops there now as his predecessor barack obama did three years into his first term trump just ordered about 3 500 more marines there 1 million per soldier more than a decade ago the obama white house began using 1 million per soldier as its rule of thumb measure for middle east war costs that s 15 times the inflation adjusted annual cost of 67 000 to maintaining a battlefield soldier in world war ii costs are higher now not just because of inflation but also continued advances in expensive weaponry reliance on contractors and medical care for battlefield wounds the new gerald r ford aircraft carrier cost more than 13 billion before counting its armada of support surface ships and submarines that whole flotilla can be taken out with a single nuclear missile figure the cost of those newly deployed marines at about 1 5 million each over the next 12 months a total of 5 2 billion that s enough money to fund the national endowment for the arts for the next three decades or increase aid to public schools by 30 percent or increase the epa budget by 60 percent or more than double federal spending on renewable energy and energy efficiency or provide medicaid for 1 4 million poor americans but the real cost of a war with iran is likely to be way more than 5 2 billion lowballing the costs the george w bush administration estimated the cost of the iraq war at no more than 60 billion while actual costs will be 50 times that much according to a 2008 study by nobel prize winning economist joseph stiglitz and economist linda bilmes the ultimate cost of america s middle east wars will be around 4 6 trillion brown university s costs of war project estimated two years ago that s before tacking on the costs of a war against iran just medical care for iraq and afghanistan veterans approaches 1 trillion one study estimated from official government data the study understated the real costs because it excludes caring for veterans who live past age 67 when they can go onto medicare high medical costs are a result of a huge shift in the share of battlefield casualties that are fatal modern medicine keeps alive many soldiers who would have died in world war ii or vietnam but often with a need for intensive medical care for life in addition survivors collect disability income checks which frankly are much too modest for the pain and lost opportunities that surviving soldiers endured disclosure my dad was a disabled wwii vet not easy invading iraq was a piece of cake compared with taking on iran which has a much larger better trained and better motivated military occupying iran would make our 17 year occupation of iraq seem easy because the iranian people are not eager to oust their leaders however much we dislike them many iranians still harbor resentment from our imposing a shah on them in 1954 our fbi helped the shah create his murderous secret police the savak in 1957 iraq by the way may throw us out because we assassinated top general qassim suleimani of the elite iranian quds force and to think that not that long ago iraq and iran were engaged in a long war that killed millions on both sides oh how america has changed the middle east and not to the better from an american perspective expect that if the trump administration ever speaks of costs that it will lowball the numbers expect that the cult like republican response will be that whatever supreme leader and chosen one donald trump wants is not only good but beyond questioning and where will team trump get the money to prosecute a war that congress surely will not declare from the forgotten man ordinary americans who trump courted and at his inauguration called the forgotten man will pay the price sacrifice will be necessary and you can be sure it won t be sacrifice by those enjoying the increased federal subsidies for personal jets that trump and the republicans voted in as part of their so called tax cuts what to expect how will the forgotten man and woman be forced to sacrifice here are a few predictable examples recipients of food stamps now called snap benefits will be targeted new cuts will ensure that children the disabled and the elderly go hungry so trump can wage war on tehran people who breathe the air and drink the water downwind and downstream from electric power plants petrochemical plants and other polluting companies as more cuts are made in enforcing environmental laws students who will get less aid resulting in a less well educated america in the decades ahead that in turn will mean slower economic growth than the lackluster performance under trump so far soldiers and sailors will have to fight for medical care that the trump administration will do all it can to argue is not needed in this at least trump is only worse than the similar antagonism of previous administrations of both parties in keeping promises to the war wounded fees will go up freeing up tax dollars team trump may even revive the reagan era practice of calling adjustments that raises taxes and shifts costs onto feepayers as revenue enhancements rather than tax increases the unborn will pay too because absent a major change in policy the interest on the national debt now at 23 2 trillion will just keep rising when today s toddlers are wrinkled and grey they will pay the price for trump s folly and all this assumes trump can contain the dogs of war after he unleashes them and that we won t end up in world war iii

press release makes reference to certain non ifrs measures including certain retail industry metrics these measures are not recognized measures under ifrs do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by ifrs and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies rather these measures are provided as additional information to complement those ifrs measures by providing further understanding of our results of operations from management s perspective accordingly these measures should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of our financial information reported under ifrs we use non ifrs measures including ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted net income adjusted net income per diluted share and gross profit margin this press release also makes reference to comparable sales growth which is a commonly used operating metric in the retail industry but may be calculated differently compared to other retailers these non ifrs measures including retail industry metrics are used to provide investors with supplemental measures of our operating performance and thus highlight trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on ifrs measures we believe that securities analysts investors and other interested parties frequently use non ifrs measures including retail industry metrics in the evaluation of issuers our management also uses non ifrs measures including retail industry metrics in order to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period to prepare annual

still don t know who they support in this election elizabeth warren let s change that jessica pels yes so our goal with this interview series is to expose to our audience of millennial and gen z women which candidates prioritize young women and how they prioritize young women so i m just going to jump right in elizabeth warren sure jessica pels so this may come as a surprise but health care is actually the number one issue for our readers according to our latest polling even over climate change which considering what s happening in australia is significant that shows you how much they prioritize their health elizabeth warren that s right that s how personal it is jessica pels yes exactly and how financial elizabeth warren yes getty images jessica pels so increasingly the candidate field is divided between people like yourself and senator sanders who embrace medicare for all and those who say that getting rid of private insurance is politically or practically impossible for the 34 percent of our readers who have been swayed by that latter argument why do you still believe that medicare for all is the right thing elizabeth warren so last year 36 million americans didn t have a prescription filled because they couldn t pay for it think about that they were sick enough to go to the doctor and to have the doctor write out a prescription and to get to the pharmacy and say i just can t do this and think about people who did pay for it who then had to make the decision whether to pay the rent late or pay for your health insurance ruben chamorro and it s that way all the way through about not going to the doctor to have the lump checked out about not having the additional tests done that the doctor wants you to have we are the richest country in the history of the world health care is a basic human right and we need to find the best way to get health care to all of us that s what all other peer countries have done so here s how i think about this we need to bring the most help to the most people as quickly as possible so i start this by saying okay what can a president do oh and i love saying this all by herself and the answer is quite a lot actually so what will i do first thing i ll do as president starting day one defend the affordable care act the current administration has been knocking the legs out from underneath it that would knock a lot of young people who are 26 and younger and on their parents plans bingo you got no health insurance would permit a discrimination against people with preexisting conditions if the trump administration continues to go forward ruben chamorro and by the way keep in mind before the affordable care act passed insurance companies actually discriminated against a really important class women and charged women more because they didn t want to have to pay for health services for women so i ll defend the affordable care act and that s important you can do that through administrative channels second thing i ll do is i m coming after the drug companies the power has been there for a long time for a president to actually be able to bring down the costs of prescription drugs that are still under patent so i m going to use that power to bring down the cost of insulin the cost of epipens the cost of hiv aids drugs that s going to save american families hundreds of millions of dollars right off the bat so in other words i want to come right in and be practical let s pick some low hanging fruit and get some help to people then in the first hundred days what i want to get done is i want us to pass a bill that makes health care available to everyone and here s how this would work i have a plan that will let us do full health care coverage without raising taxes on middle class families by one dime it doesn t raise taxes on working people by one dime it s basically paid for by asking those at the top the top 1 percent to pay a little more asking giant corporations like amazon that paid nothing in taxes last year to pay and my personal favorite by cracking down on the big tax cheats at the top where we can pick up a lot of money to be able to do that ruben chamorro i then want to use that money and we can do this by the way i won t get too wonky but in budget reconciliation which means you can do it with 50 votes you don t have to get to 60 votes for this so in 50 votes we make we ve got the money we can offer health care to 135 million americans at no cost to them and we can offer full health care coverage to everyone else at a modest cost because i have a way to pay for it and we can subsidize that the idea is let people experience what health care is like when it s just you and your doctor or your nurse practitioner or your mental health professional or your physical therapist without some insurance company standing in between tens of millions of americans try it on try it on and then when lots of people have had a chance to do that then we ll vote on making a transition to a full medicare for all that s what we do in a democracy i feel confident people are going to like this it s paid for and it works for people all across this country but we can do this so people get a chance to try it out because health care really matters but ultimately where it s pulling us is we ve got to be in a place where everybody in this country gets health care coverage and nobody doesn t get a prescription filled or a lump checked out because they re worried they can t pay for it jessica pels so what do you say to the people who look at a country like canada look at the system that they have see how it works but also see the incredible delays that it can take to get an appointment in a system like that when everyone has access to health care do you have thoughts about how we would mitigate that kind of issue elizabeth warren so look it s like anything as you develop a system there are going to be some parts that move better faster and some that don t the questions about delays for certain kinds of treatments but not for others i get people i get notes from people all the time we see studies where some countries that are providing full health care coverage you can get the coverage you need faster you can get in to see a doctor they ve now gotten it organized better so you can see a nurse practitioner getty images i ll tell you something i want i ve been talking to pharmacists and the pharmacists i ve been talking with say you know what they d like to be able to do just two things they d like to be able to take or two additional things throat swabs for strep and cheek swabs or mouth swabs for the flu and then be able to prescribe based on your history of course be able to prescribe either the antibiotic you need penicillin the one of choice and tamiflu to be able to get people treatment right away they don t have to go sit in a doctor s office for hours and hours you know what it s faster and it s cheaper one of the things about moving away from a system where the insurance companies make their profits by building a delay by saying no think about that insurance companies i think the numbers are made about 17 billion in profits last year health insurance companies think how they made every dollar of that profit it was by taking in premiums and then when someone needed care saying no basically 17 billion times right and so the idea that you move that out of the system and instead try to find the most effective efficient ways for people to get the health care they need busy people people who want to get on with their lives to get the care they need specialized care for people with diabetes instead of having one person with diabetes getting care over here and another one over here does it make sense to help bring them together there s been some great experimentation around this and up the care level for people so that people are healthier and the costs go down so i think we just have great opportunities in this area but it starts by recognizing health care is not a great market and this is not where people should or companies should be trying to make billions of dollars in profits this is about our care and we need to get this right jessica pels so another system that could probably use some improving is the campaigning system i mean at this point you ve been campaigning for almost a year elizabeth warren yes in fact a little over a year jessica pels yes a year in your life so obviously you have deep insight into this and into the presidential election process which many people find flawed forty five percent of our readers think the debates are more harmful than they are helpful eighty percent ended up skipping most of the debates in 2019 sixty one percent of our readers think the primary cycle is way too long i m curious about what your particular pain points are and have been and i have to ask if you think that systemic sexism is one of them getty images elizabeth warren oh yeah for me though you asked where the pain point is the worst for me it s around money and the influence of money in the system i made the decision when i got into this presidential race i m not a lifetime politician i m a lifetime teacher i was a special education teacher i had 4 to 6 year olds i ended up going to law school with a baby and started teaching almost immediately in law school so i spent most of my life somewhere else not thinking about politics and when i decided to run for senate in 2012 i knew the fight the reason i was in this because i ve spent my life on what s happening to working families why is america s middle class being hollowed out why is it that people who work every bit as hard as my parents worked two generations ago that the next generation finds the path so much rockier and so much steeper and for people of color even rockier and even steeper and the reason behind this is very much the influence of money getty images a government that works great for giant drug companies a government that works great for giant insurance companies a government that works great for oil companies that want to drill everywhere just not a government that works for people trying to get a prescription filled or to get their health care or who are worried about climate change and the consequence is this system has been tilted over and over and over because of the influence of money so we now live in an america where whatever issue gets you up in the morning if there s a decision to be made in washington it s been influenced by money it s shaped by money ruben chamorro we ve watched this during the primary process during the general election so i decided right up front i m not going to do this i m going to fund my campaign entirely through grassroots donations i m not going to sell access to my time i m not going behind closed doors and i ve been truly blessed with the number of people who ve gotten in this fight i make i do call time i call people just a couple of days ago who give 10 20 i placed a call to a woman who d given 2 who d marked that she was unemployed but this fight is her fight too i believe it s the right way to fund a campaign and if you agree go to elizabethwarren com pitch in five bucks volunteer an hour do some phone banking knock on doors because it s about our democracy but here s the thing i m not the only one in this race kamala harris is a good friend of mine i ve known her for a very long time she has a very special voice she brought to our democratic primary her unique perspective and the day that she announced she was dropping out of the race because of money is the same day a billionaire bought his way onto the debate stage what worries me is where are we headed we ve got two billionaires in this race now and we ve got some candidates who spend a lot of time with billionaires and millionaires and corporate executives if that s what it takes to win the democratic primary and be our candidate for president then buckle up because this is going to be an america this could be a democracy that just works better and better for those who are already rich for those who have already made it and worse and worse for everyone else jessica pels a david and goliath kind of scenario that you find yourself in elizabeth warren it really is and it s this fight it s not just against the other candidates it s against a system that is truly crushing our democracy think about that you know i get it rich people they re going to own more shoes than everybody else they re going to own more jewelry than everybody else they may own more houses than everybody else but they re not supposed to own a bigger share of our democracy and when they do that s how we end up with an economy in which the stock market goes up gdp goes up corporate profits go up but 1980 to 2016 2017 all that new income growth do you know how much of it went to the bottom 90 percent four tenths of 1 percent that rounds to zero all of the wealth is flowing to the top and year by year by year those guys have got their lobbyists in washington ratcheting up to take a little more and take a little more and take a little more we just can t survive as a democracy if we don t fight back against that but you know i will say here s the good news 2020 it s not 2016 it s not 2008 2020 i always think of it this way when donald trump was sworn in the world changed january of 2017 and the very next day biggest protest rally in the history of the world the world changed again so many women are off the sidelines so many women say i care i get it the decisions made in this presidential election will touch my health care will touch my access to birth control and abortion will touch whether or not i can afford to start a family while i have childcare will touch whether or not i m paying off student loans for the next 20 years whether or not i can afford to buy a home it will touch all of those things that s why we just really have this amazing opportunity we can t blow it by handing the whole thing over to the billionaires and friends of billionaires we ve got to build this one ourselves that s what s going to make it work getty images jessica pels so speaking of women building a better world for women harvey weinstein s trial began monday more than 80 women have come forward with allegations against him as you well know many of these alleged attacks happened in a professional setting i m curious what your policy thoughts are on sexual harassment in the workplace elizabeth warren well i think that we have got to be really aggressive in enforcing the laws do remember that sexual harassment is illegal and if women and it is women typically are discriminated against but any vulnerable group that s a civil rights violation we should have federal muscle behind this it s not enough just to say ah terrible thing no i believe we need plans to attack it i have a plan for a department of justice that enforces the rights of everyone let s put some federal muscle behind that and i ll tell you one more we ll do it across the spectrum just equal pay for equal work want to talk about that one and it s for all women particularly for women of color who are paid at the very bottom of the pay scale think about it this way one in every 4 people who is employed in america today is working for a company that has federal contracts and those federal contracts for a lot of those companies are pretty lucrative those are taxpayer dollars now to be able to bid on these federal contracts the administration meaning the president all by herself decides basically what the terms are going to be and who gets to bid getty images so here s my plan we want to make a real difference on equal pay for equal work and not just stand up and announce it s equal pay day again and how far behind women are and how hey we re going to get it to equal by the year 2890 or something that this is going to happen now is to say to all of these companies you want to bid on federal contracts you ve got to do two things you ve got to produce the data on how women are treated in your company how people of color are treated in your company how people with disabilities are treated and then we re going to look at this data you can t just talk the talk about oh yeah we believe in equal pay you ve got to show that you re walking the walk you want access to american taxpayer dollars to do your business then by golly follow the law and do what s right jessica pels your friend kamala harris talked to us about transparency in pay and i think that s amazing she focused on the private sector but that s a great point that it would be good to see that kind of information we have a couple of questions from our brilliant editors for you getty images elizabeth warren terrific jessica pels going to throw it to jen ortiz elizabeth warren hi jen jen ortiz deputy editor hi so you ve called president trump s move to assassinate an iranian military leader reckless since then he has threatened to attack 52 iranian sites including potentially cultural sites which is of course a war crime as his own defense secretary said yesterday so if trump moves ahead with ordering this sort of attack would he be considered a war criminal and should we be worried about world war iii elizabeth warren let me start at the end yes we should be worried about war the principal job of the president of the united states is to keep america safe and ordering the killing of soleimani who was a bad guy but a high ranking iranian government official has not made america safer look where we are today we have halted the actions against isis that we were taking with our allies we have ordered american civilians out of the entire region because we are worried for their safety and as you said we have a president issuing threats to commit war crimes through his tweeting that doesn t make america safer as i walked in i was looking at the crawl on the tv screens talking about ratcheting up fear of an iranian response what does that mean the way i see this is that the president has failed in his principal duty he has failed to keep us safer and he has taken us directly to the edge of war americans don t want more war in the middle east we ve been there 20 years we want to end the war in the middle east and get out and as president that s what i commit to do jessica pels thank you jen patty patty camerota social media editor hi senator warren elizabeth warren hi patty patty camerota so i m a proud graduate of umass amherst elizabeth warren yes amherst where only the h is silent patty camerota yes it took me a while elizabeth warren yes patty camerota i came out of school with slightly over 50 000 in student loan debt you spoke of the cost of education at my 2017 commencement ceremony and it was an incredible speech by the way now you have a plan to help over 40 million students get rid of their current student loan debt but given the fact that the cost to attend public universities like umass amherst keeps rising will that be enough and how will you make sure that current and future graduates don t just end up in the same position elizabeth warren excellent questions so here s how it goes i m going to start in a different place but i promise i ll link this up it s time for a wealth tax in america this is a tax on the great fortunes in this country above 50 million in other words your first 50 million free and clear getty images jessica pels noted elizabeth warren but your fifty millionth and first dollar you got to pitch in two cents and two cents on every dollar after that if you hit a billion you got to pitch in a few more pennies the idea is the wealth not just income it s the wealth these giant fortunes that are growing all on their own 2 percent 4 percent 8 percent 10 percent a year and they keep growing they have their own accountants their own financial advisers is to say you got to pitch in two cents what can we do with two cents we can provide universal childcare for all our babies age 0 to 5 universal pre k for every 3 year old and 4 year old and we can stop exploiting the people largely women largely black and brown women who do this work and raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in america two cents in addition we can make an historic investment of new federal dollars into our public schools k through 12 800 billion that would let us quadruple the money for title 1 schools children who come from low income backgrounds and for special ed teachers you ll get this one fully fund idea so that every child with a disability gets the full range of educational help they need to be all they can we can do that for k to 12 getty images and then for post high school that two cents will as you said let us cancel student loan debt for about 43 million americans yes and more because the whole point is let s not get back in this hole it will permit us to have tuition free technical school two year college and four year college in other words the federal government picks up the tuition part of any public university and any historically black college and university and the state has to do maintenance of effort so the school is made whole but that s it young people who want to get an education are relieved of tuition burdens a couple of more pieces expand pell grants in both directions so they both go to a higher family income level and they are more money to cover a bigger part of the other educational expenses and it s time to level the playing field 50 billion into our historically black colleges and universities and minority serving institutions all of our hbcus can be tuition free and really have the money they have had to do so much with so little for so long i just want you to think about that for a minute two cents on the top one tenth of 1 percent and we can invest in an entire generation invest in opportunities for every single one of our kids and young people let s do this getty images jessica pels we have a few minutes left elizabeth warren sure jessica pels with two minutes i can ask you our famous rapid fire questions elizabeth warren okay i m ready jessica pels okay what is your new year s resolution elizabeth warren walk more more exercise i m trying to up

and he fights to make sure that people who ve been cut out of this process over and over and over actually get a chance to be part of our democracy if they can be part of our democracy then they ll have some power in the system and that means we ll write better laws that help support economic access that s why julián is in this fight i really admire the fact that he got in this presidential race he fought for what he believed in when he decided that there just wasn t a path for him this time he didn t just hang back and wait to see what happened he jumped right back in and said i want to do

it took just three days of 2020 for optimistic financial markets to run into harsh reality says the financial times equities had made impressive gains in 2019 with the us s p 500 index rising by more than a quarter and britain s ftse 100 climbing by 12 investors were looking forward to more but america s assassination of qasem soleimani a key iranian general prompted a reassessment of risk and sent investors scurrying into safe haven assets after iran s retaliatory strike on us airbases in iraq on wednesday there were growing fears that a series of tit for tat strikes could spin out of control ultimately causing a war between washington and tehran oil prices rose 4 following the us attack eclipsing 70 per barrel on monday before falling back a 1 5 bounce which also soon subsided followed iran s retaliation at 70 73 brent crude rose to its highest level since september when a drone attack on a major saudi oil facility at abqaiq temporarily knocked out 5 of global supply yet that spike proved short lived and prices are still below their 2019 high of 74 5 per barrel so what will happen this time will oil hit 150 a barrel middle eastern turbulence would endanger at least a quarter of the world s 100 million barrels per day of oil production says avi salzman in barron s saudi arabia and iraq the region s two biggest producers pump about 15 million barrels per day between

could see oil prices leap by 20 per barrel the doom mongers are right to worry says caroline bain of capital economics previous episodes of oil supply disruption which include the 1970s oil embargo the 1990 iraqi invasion of kuwait and the 2011 arab spring show that prices can quickly double or triple in response to serious geopolitical shocks prolonged tensions in the strait of hormuz could see the price of brent double leading it towards an eye watering 150 per barrel such a spike would wreak economic havoc the 1970s oil shock tipped the world into recession and triggered a bout of inflation that took nearly eight years to tame says russ mould of aj bell oil shocks act like a tax increase reducing purchasing power and choking off demand on six of the last eight occasions when oil prices have risen by more than 100 year on year the global economy has slowed or even shrunk if the iranians blockade the strait of hormuz then we are in trouble agrees jeremy warner in the sunday telegraph surging oil prices would tip the world economy into recession the oil market has changed the latest oil price surge looks like a rather 1970s reaction paul donovan of ubs global wealth management told the guardian s jill ambrose but it is perhaps not appropriate for 2020 given the weak global growth outlook and structural oversupply oil cartel opec used to produce half the world s oil but now makes less than a third of it alan gelder of wood mackenzie told nell mackenzie on the bbc during the 1990 gulf war oil came from two places opec states or expensive and risky fields in places such as the north sea yet the fracking revolution means that finding hydrocarbons and getting them out of the ground has never been easier particularly in north america when prices jump the frackers are happy to start pumping that keeps a lid on prices globally there is a glut of oil and so has the world economy greater energy efficiency also means that western economies are less dependent on fuel than in the past notes robin pagnamenta for the daily telegraph in the 1970s energy accounted for 8 of us household consumption today that figure is just 2 5 that should reduce the economic impact of petrol price spikes the post soleimani oil price surge was a knee jerk response conditioned by decades of headlines about middle eastern oil says spencer jakab in the wall street journal it is not a given that a regional conflagration would mean higher prices in 2020 iranian retaliation in the form of cyber or terror attacks could actually reduce energy demand by hitting the global travel industry sanctions on iranian oil exports also mean that tehran has little to gain from surging prices most importantly these days the us is a net exporter of crude oil leaving the world s indispensable economy less exposed to an oil price shock than in the past a combination of central bank monetary easing and calmer us china trade relations had convinced many traders that 2020 would be a good year yet the worsening us iran picture has pushed geopolitical risk back up the list of things to worry about in 2020 says michael pearce of capital economics the trump factor donald trump s decision not to respond to september s abqaiq attack meant that analysts thought they had the measure of the white house s middle east strategy says the ft his unexpected decision to kill soleimani is a reminder that the mercurial us president remains one of the biggest unknowns for investors the strike on the general calls for a serious increase of the geopolitical risk premium says olivier jakob of consultancy petromatrix clearer heads may yet prevail says tom holland of gavekal research for all the blood curdling rhetoric pouring out of washington and tehran the odds of an all out shooting war are still small fearful of becoming embroiled in another middle eastern quagmire the white house regards the assassination of soleimani as an extension of its existing strategy of squeezing iranian regional influence not a prelude to outright conflict for its part tehran knows that it would surely lose a full scale war with the us and its regional allies in short both sides have powerful incentives to avoid open conflict and minimise further escalation note that tehran s retaliation so far has been moderate in the context of the blood curdling threats we heard shortly after the us strike markets are right to price in an elevated risk premium in the wake of soleimani s death yet the magnitude and persistence of that premium is likely to prove limited expect oil prices to remain capped below 75 per barrel for the time being is russia a safe haven from the turmoil russia decried the killing of soleimani but moscow could prove a key winner from the fallout says robyn dixon in the washington post higher oil prices would be a boon for the country s energy sector russia is the world s second biggest oil exporter and the top exporter of natural gas bad news for oil consumers is good news for emerging market producers such as russia says lex in the financial times the country is already something of a comeback kid among emerging markets the stockmarket rose by 39 last year stocks in energy companies which make up over half of the market s capitalisation delivered double digit returns in 2019 but valuations remain cheap ubs is forecasting a hefty 14 dividend yield from energy firm lukoil that said concern about climate change is feeding a growing aversion to energy firms among portfolio managers that should continue to keep a lid on energy stock prices russia has agreed to curb its oil output by about 300 000 barrels per day from an october 2018 baseline as part of a joint effort with opec nations to prop up oil prices say dina khrennikova and jake rudnitsky on bloomberg yet the country overshot its quota in nine of the 12 months last year drawing complaints from allies indeed russian crude oil and condensate output actually hit a post soviet high last year if russia scraps the opec deal altogether it could unleash spare production capacity of as much as 500 000 barrels per day onto the market on a cyclically adjusted price earnings ratio of 7 8 the russian market is among the world s cheapest major indices but with good reason the country s poor record on property rights and the rule of law means that assets are at constant risk of expropriation if a company s management upsets the wrong people russia rarely looks like a safe haven as lex puts it but with us missiles streaking across middle eastern skies perhaps this is one of those times golden days for gold these are golden days for gold writes arthur sullivan for deutsche welle renewed global uncertainty helped the yellow metal to a seven year high this week in dollar terms with the price climbing to around 1 600 an ounce in sterling terms that is more than 1 195 per ounce gold gained 20 in dollar terms last year geopolitical risks make this traditional safe haven look appealing while macroeconomic factors also bode well for the yellow metal says elliot smith on cnbc persistently negative interest rates on major government bonds have reduced the opportunity cost of holding gold an asset that also pays no income the price is also likely to be supported by ongoing central bank purchases as the likes of turkey russia and china look to reduce their reliance on the us dollar by holding more of their reserves in gold those three countries bought almost 120 tonnes of the precious metal during the third quarter of last year alone reports sullivan gold is also a way to protect yourself against the risk that central banks get too eager to turn on the printing presses and lose control of inflation analyst john mauldin who predicts a great reset over the coming decade

portfolio in gold as a form of insurance consider topping up with the etfs physical gold exchange traded fund lse phau

will advance to a runoff election in november below is the transcript of our oct 14 2019 interview with james rudolph who is running to succeed barbara bry in a district that represents residents in carmel valley la jolla university city and other communities this interview was transcribed using the digital transcription service temi and checked for accuracy by a staffer to call any errors to our attention or to ask any questions about our interviews please email matthew hall sduniontribune com with the subject line election interviews union tribune alright thanks for coming in james tell us why run for district 1 james rudolph well that s kind of a two part answer um i was born and raised in district 1 uh i went to la jolla elementary went to stella maris all hallows muirlands middle school and la jolla high school and my parents moved to la jolla in the late 50s 1958 to be exact and opened harry s coffee shop in 1960 which has been there for coming up on 60 years now and i worked there we all worked there and i feel that i have these kind of deep rooted ties to the community a lot of personal connections and therefore a lot of personal obligations from my perspective to give back and the second part of the answer is i have national level experience and i ve worked in d c in two administrations partisan and nonpartisan positions and i would like to use that experience and knowledge to give back to the community which is also piggybacking on the first part of the answer i feel committed to the district and improving politics advertisement meet the other candidates for san diego city council district 1 below q what was your role what did you do in washington d c a so the first time i went there it was a political position a schedule c position with the clinton administration in the u s agency for international development focusing on development issues for example working on building rule of law in developing countries establishing an independent judiciary and most pertinent for you a free and independent press and this was kind of seen as a building block for and also a rule of law these were the kind of four areas that we focused on in all developing countries as a way of kind of embedding these principles as a way of getting new countries to develop q first term or second term with clinton a second term q so you weren t focusing on soviet bloc countries that were newly free advertisement a no i was actually focusing on india but we had all kinds of developing countries to focus on some countries accepted the help and others didn t mexico was one that wouldn t accept the help because there s a kind of national pride attached to having usaid come to your country and help because it s kind of a sign of a weakness i feel that i have these kind of deep rooted ties to the community a lot of personal connections and therefore a lot of personal obligations james rudolph q you went to college in dc a no i went to uc santa barbara and then moved to d c after my undergraduate degree which was in political science and international relations then i became a franklin fellow at the department of state that was a nonpartisan position obviously it was part of the obama administration and i was working for john kerry so there was a kind of democratic department of state at the time i was in the bureau of african affairs focusing on human rights issues so i have an llm a master s in law from the university of san diego school of law and human rights law and international law so my role was focusing on human rights violations in africa specifically in nigeria and west africa working on things like the trafficking in persons report and the child soldier prevention act report and working with ngos and trying to establish again embed these kind of democratic human rights principles and working with various militaries on human rights training q how does that kind of high level government work shape your council campaign or help you as a candidate and as a potential council person would you say a well we spent a lot of time in what s called the interagency process and it s kind of this process or rather an attempt to get the various departments out of their silos their respective silos and try to eliminate the turf wars that you have and i witnessed it i witnessed it firsthand and i thought it was a very productive process as a way of kind of getting around this kind of political partisan paralysis and i think i ve seen it succeed and i think i could bring that experience to the city council i think there s also some kind of paralysis and partisan roadblocks here in san diego as well advertisement file photo lionel bonaventure afp getty images q what do you see as the biggest problem or few problems at the city council level that you could help with a well certainly the short term vacation rentals issue is a big one i support barbara bry s position on that i think we need a kind of comprehensive regulatory scheme in place it s not there yet i think the climate action plan is another one it s in place but there s been kind of piecemeal progress and we re off track in a couple of areas in terms of meeting our goals for greenhouse gas emissions but interestingly the first one the short term vacation rental issue is one of these kind of overlapping issues where it ties into affordable housing and just housing in general and that issue of kind of locking up uh existing housing rather than just building a new supply of housing you have housing but it s locked up in many ways because there s no real regulations so there s confusion q do you support barbara bry when she says they re coming for our homes and opposes senate bill 35 a i like to think of myself as a moderate democrat i like to focus on market based solutions when they re right but i m also a democrat so i believe that the government does have a role to play in ensuring affordable housing and the availability of housing and the taxing of these short term vacation rentals for generating fees and all of that so there s a level playing field with the hotels and all that but i know a lot of people who use their homes as a source of income so it s um it s an important topic for them and i understand the sensitivity of the topic because many of them have now kind of transitioned to 100 of their income coming from their home q but senate bill 35 is not about that issue it s about whether or not city laws should be set aside in favor of a state law that says if you ve got a project that meets certain parameters you can build it that eliminates the ceqa and other rules that get in the way it was introduced by scott wiener and then died mysteriously in may without a vote after the appropriations committee and the chair and the senate killed it so that s what she was criticizing the idea that we should sharply free up zoning to encourage housing advertisement a well i think the zoning is in place one of the issues that i ve been tracking is the city attorney s position on this that many of the short term vacation rentals are not illegal q i m not talking about that i m talking about the proposal to change zoning a what are you asking exactly q she famously wrote a text message and sent it around saying they re coming for our homes she was opposing this bill in sacramento that would have allowed the state to require cities to accept certain kinds of housing the tweet was so incendiary that dan walters the dean of state columnists in california said she s the face of nimbyism now in california not for her position on vacation models but on her opposition to the idea that cities should be forced to allow housing within certain parameters a i think the city if it s a state level legislative enactment i think the city should be forced to do that a child stands at the entrance to the women s section of the city sanctioned homeless camp near balboa park golf course k c alfred san diego union tribune advertisement q what do you think of the homeless situation there are a lot of proposals on the table including one that the council was talking about today spending 2 billion to address this issue you got a plan is there a plan for that a well it s a complex issue and i think mayor faulconer is right when he says part of it is this so called service resistant issue that a lot of people don t talk about the root causes i think are varied and complex but i think there is consensus that there is substance abuse issues and mental health issues and many of those issues aren t being addressed adequately and i think the government i think city council should focus more on those issues certainly more shelters and all of that for the immediate short term crisis situations where people can t get into housing there s a domestic violence situation you re just out on the street so i support his role in building more shelters but long term i think we need to focus on some of those root cause issues um the mental health issue is a big one that s tied into what s happening in our jails the jails are becoming mental health institutions and they weren t designed for that in mind there s an over capacity problem so i support a longer term vision of addressing these root cause issues which would tie into the mental health issues obviously and some of that involves these issues of paranoia a lot of the homeless people have mental illness issues that involve kind of resistance to authority and other related complications and that s part of the problem as well they don t want to go into housing many times because they see it as a trap their possessions are going to be taken away there s a kind of resistance to authority so that s certainly part of the problem and many people refuse to address that i think we need to talk about that q you didn t say housing first which is kind of the nomenclature around city hall do you not support that a i support what s in place the so called inclusionary housing and if developers refuse to build it then there s a 10 fee that s attached and then that fee will go into subsidizing the development of additional housing i read some study i forget where but two thirds of the affordable housing that s being built in san diego is coming from these fees so if that s the case it seems to be working and i would support councilwoman gomez s position on that q you say it seems to be working but in 2004 the public policy institute of california put out a study that said affordable housing in california doesn t lay a glove on the problem it focuses on the process of having these projects go through and get approved giving politicians a chance to say look i m on the side of the people who can t afford housing but that it doesn t lay a glove on the problem which is a shortage of housing units and to me every time we see this focus shift to subsidized housing by the government that amount to lotteries that a handful of people win it s not a solution and yet democrats keep wanting to spend more and more and more on this non solution that creates the message i care but is not solving the problem advertisement a part of my undergraduate degree was economics and i tend to agree with the economists who are almost universally opposed to rent control i m almost certain that that s the right policy rent control is a price ceiling and landlords find ways to get around that they convert to condos or they start neglecting the apartment and things like that again most economists would say we need to increase supplies the supply and demand issues so what do you do you focus on supply let s build more housing as a way to bring down costs it s one way to do it it s kind of basic econ 101 solution and i support that kind of solution the devil is in the details where do you build it then you get opposition from other people and environmentalists you can t build it there because you have some environmental concerns and this and that so there s never going to be a perfect solution i like to think of myself as cosmopolitan and somebody who focuses on international solutions and best practices james rudolph q but what s maddening is that we never see people who use best practices like look at what other nations do in japan and tokyo and all the big cities that have dormitory style housing works great and uk and in japan a prefab housing is now like 15 to 20 of the market because it s so inexpensive and it s so much sturdier than it used to be and yet in california we stick to the same old thing subsidized housing every now and then let s try to figure out a way to increase housing well why not copy what s worked elsewhere a so i lived in the u k for over a year and as you know just several years ago they had that major fire there with the grenfell tower and the cladding and all that so this is another issue that you build this stuff and they do it and they go around the code and now you have a disaster where 72 people die so this is tying into your question about the national level international experience i have covered many of these issues i like to think of myself as cosmopolitan and somebody who focuses on international solutions and best practices as you said so that s my approach if it makes sense economically politically i think this the way i like to go if it s about housing if it s about building these towers if it s about subsidizing it then i say let s look at it i don t like to be typecast i am a democrat i m running as a democrat but i m also somebody who likes to focus on reasonable solutions policies that make sense economically and politically q how do you get housing more affordable then i know you said it s a complex issue but that s obviously the singular issue for a lot of people in this town a yeah your question was how do you do it advertisement q yeah best practices it s easy to say that in a vacuum but more specifically kind of drill down is it regulations is it granny flats a i think it s incentive based i think if you incentivize developers it s kind of a carrot and stick approach you ve increased that fee if they re not responding to that fee if they re just kind of building it into their cost of doing business where it s just not too painful for them to just pay the fee and avoid the affordable housing but i do believe that that s the solution is building more housing uh and getting developers on board either through incentive based solutions or the kind of top down regulatory approach q but you also said you supported georgette gomez s is housing policy which developers did not support and this board pointed that out and sided with the developers how do you kind of square those two positions a and mayor faulconer did as well well interestingly she changed her position as well she was more top down approach then there was almost universal opposition from the developers and so she modified her position to a certain extent and i d like to believe that she did so because she looked at the policies she looked at what the developers were saying that it s not feasible and so as a kind of short term solution she opted for this 10 fee but i think increasing that fee is still on the table as a way of forcing the issue it s certainly a major issue it s not going away california is getting more and more expensive public policy institute also mentioned even though the poverty rate has gone down it doesn t include the cost of housing in california so if you include that the poverty rate probably goes up two model homes under construction in february 2016 hayne palmour iv san diego union tribune q well we re number one in america the census bureau has an adjusted rate of poverty that s been publishing since 2011 that takes into factor the cost of housing and we ve been number one every year advertisement a yeah i think the official rate is something like 13 3 q it s 19 a there s no doubt it s higher than that but also that study pointed out that without the social safety net the poverty rate would be much higher and i agree with that i think the government has a role to play in this whether it s through building housing or through increasing that kind of social safety net for those who are simply priced out of any kind of affordable housing q i take you back to the climate action plan you said there are some points there where the city s already missing its targets that s obviously a legally binding document what would you do as a council member to seek to adjust some of those kind of inner workings to get that back on track or to move it along a just to be honest the tracking the environmental issue has not been one of my main issues it s important to me i don t know all the minutiae i do know that the one criticism of the council is that as you just said there s a legally binding document it was passed i believe in 2015 and that it s simply off track for the 2020 2035 goals of meeting these greenhouse reductions having said that i think my goal would be to get into if i m elected to review this and work with environmental groups to see how it can be changed if at all certainly the piecemeal approach isn t working right now and so it s an issue i need to study up on and i welcome input q do you support the city s proposal to have a community choice aggregation energy program in which it works with other cities and takes over everything but the distribution of power advertisement a broadly speaking yes normally you have this idea of a natural monopoly and it s almost always the case that public utilities become natural monopolies and that s because of the network it s very expensive to build a network and there s a high cost to enter but that focuses on the building of the network it doesn t focus on the generation of electricity and so i think you keep the natural monopoly in place vis a vis the network but you open up the generation of electricity to competition and market forces that doesn t get a whole lot of attention people just say it s a natural monopoly it s too expensive to let anybody else do it so this topic is off the table i think you can kind of juxtapose these two positions and say let s focus on this over here we can certainly have competition in the generation of electricity what that means in practice i don t know yet but i think we need to discuss it and be open to it q i used to be much more enthusiastic about it than i am the first criticism is that the idea that if you have cces they re more likely to buy clean power no state law has already laid out what you have to do can meet these things and the three large investor owned utilities in california are in fact years ahead of meeting their goals and so the idea that you have to have this as a stick to reach climate goals no and the second thing is this idea that it s just going to be easy to come up with the expertise to run this thing why would anyone look at local government in particular san diego and presume an expertise to do anything a well that s what i hope to change these are these are big issues and we need more attention on this i think a lot of people simply don t know enough about the issue they don t know enough about the splitting this idea of natural monopolies and all that that s because a lot of these industries have been promoting that idea that it s just untouchable that it s unworkable in practice but i d like to believe that it is workable in practice and hopefully i can bring that kind of approach to my campaign and if elected to city council but again i don t know q san diego gas electric said it wouldn t oppose this a year ago next month they they they dropped their opposition to this so they see it coming a that s good advertisement q but is it good i mean i look at the experience in marin county where they have the largest one and they have the first one and it s not clear to me the prices are lower a well as we all know other parts of the country have experimented with this and had great success but as we all know california experimented with this and it was pretty much a disaster this early experiment in generating income and deregulating that led to some pretty terrible results hopefully we ve learned from that and hopefully we can look at other states and cities and countries to see how they ve approached this problem q speaking of learning from mistakes what did you think of the rollout of the scooter policy and if you were on the council how would that have been different how would you have tried to tried to get ahead of this technology a i m in district 1 there s a lot of opposition to the scooters in district 1 i think there s just kind of universal opposition to them in the city not to the idea of them i think they play an important role this so called last mile problem that you have you get commuters to santa fe depot or you get them to the bus stop at ucsd campus and then they have six blocks 10 blocks to go and the scooter can solve that it can get you there quickly and efficiently and in an environmentally friendly way um the problem has been in the implementation the other problem is that technology is almost always ahead of the law and the technology companies know that they come in as kind of guerrilla tactics there s a loophole so they exploited it and they wait and ask for forgiveness i support barbara bry s position on more regulation on imposing fees if they re not abiding by the rules that are passed by the council a lot of people are opposed to it where the city is paying more now in lawsuits litigation you know for handicapped who can t access the sidewalks anymore the kind of visual pollution that you see stacked up around sidewalks everywhere so that s just a long way of saying i think they have an important role to play but the city council needs to be a little more aggressive with these uh companies in terms of setting the rules and regulations and impounding them finding them all of that q what more regulations would you impose because the regulations in place seem to be pretty good whether they were rolled out quickly enough is another issue but the regulations in place seem good i guess so what more would you do specifically and then do you support a moratorium as barbara has proposed a at this point i don t think the moratorium is necessary i think we ve had this kind of cooling off period uh we ve been able to catch our breath or collective breath and say okay this didn t work out well we ve had over a year now to play catch up i think the companies are cognizant of the opposition to the way they were rolled out i m not a proponent of just layering regulations upon regulations i think if we have something in place and it is effective then i think the next question is enforcement is it even being enforced and if it s not then that s what you do you don t just pass another law you enforce what is already in place and if the companies perceive that kind of weakness yeah it s on the books there but nobody s really enforcing it they ll just keep exploiting that loophole advertisement q do you think they are being enforced i m downtown every day and i see scooters bombing around on sidewalks illegally a man on a scooter passes a parked scooter along the mission beach boardwalk in san diego associated press a it s an interesting question because the speed limit in california is 65 does anybody go 65 anymore i drive down the i 5 every day to work and if i m going 70 i m the slow one so you would say okay is nobody s enforcing that is it still an effective law yes it is but people aren t following the rules so you need more enforcement there needs to be a cultural shift in terms of how riders use that technology and if it becomes accepted the ride on the sidewalks if it s accepted just dump them wherever you want then that s something that needs to change that s a slow process obviously but it s kind of idea that happened years ago with drunk driving it kind of was accepted many years ago you could just have a few and get in the car it was no social condemnation of that so i think at some point we can move in that direction and get more of that peer pressure hey that s not really cool to drop it off on the street there you know there are people who come by and get blocked in their wheelchairs so i think it s a combination of the regulatory approach but also that kind of the naming and shaming kind of approach to a problem q i used to know a real estate agent who said that everyone she knew in the la jolla still supports secession have you ever supported the people in la jolla who say we should secede a i grew up with melinda merriweather s son we were at la jolla high so i know melinda and i say that because um she has been a big proponent of that for many many years also i believe my brother was on the board with her at some point promoting the same idea certainly it is popular in certain groups the idea that la jolla is paying too much into the system and not getting enough back in services that the streets are crumbling and i agree some of the streets are just embarrassingly bad and not getting enough attention from the city the other idea is that hey all the police are in pacific beach enforcing all the dui laws and arresting people and drunks and fights and all that and they only come to la jolla when there s a problem there s nobody in la jolla that s the kind of joke that there are no cops in la jolla and so what do you do do you look to del mar and solana beach and say look they have the sheriff s department they have their own fire department and this is a little more control over the problem let s do that and it sounds good in theory but again who s going to pay for it then you have to have a citywide vote on this and will the rest of the city approve it i don t want to say it s pie in the sky stuff because it is an important issue for people and they and they do feel that they re being shortchanged in certain areas but i don t think it s really workable in the near term i don t think the issue will ever go away but i have never been on record supporting it but certainly i ve thought about it del mar and solana beach they seem to have a lot more control over what issues they get more they generate a lot and parking tickets and all that but what it speaks to as a bigger problem is that you have a growing city san diego is becoming a big city we re all grownup now and you have la jolla which is on the coast is different geographically it s separated from the rest of the city it s difficult to get there and you have a couple of roads in and out so there s a feeling of isolation and a feeling of being different from the city but at the same time i think the connection to the city brings a lot of benefits so i m open to discussing it i m not opposed to it but i ve never i ve never openly supported it q so if you have to make a decision that was a lot of waffling right there my friend advertisement a it sure was it s the art of saying everything without saying anything laughs q do you support secession a no i do not and i went on and on about that because i think i owe it to people who do support that issue and i know many of the people support it including my brother so i feel obligated to explain my reasoning and the rationale for it but ultimately no i do not support it q what do you think of the police chief in the job that he has done with the department a again i like to be full disclosure and just openness about some of these issues i haven t covered everything i m not an expert on everything i haven t really been tracking exactly what the police chief has been doing specifically and what his personnel policies are i know the former assistant chief of police lou scanlon so he and i sometimes discuss certain things about what s happening in san diego with the police department uh and then his role over in coronado compared to what happened here but the city of san diego is growing the san diego police department has a tough job i believe they are understaffed certain pockets of the city they certainly are understaffed advertisement q which pockets are you referring to a well i broached the topic just a few minutes ago certainly la jolla certainly other parts of maybe carmel valley del mar heights you don t seem to see the same kind of police presence up there but they re facing similar issues that we see across the country q but san diego has the lowest crime rate of any large city in america and it s got the lowest crime rate now and close to it in the city s history so we re living in the safest big city in the history of america so i m not a defender of police tactics or blanket defender of police but when i hear the level of grousing about police in san diego and i think we re the safest big city in the history of america seems to me like maybe that should be part of the discussion too a certainly i mean that s a great thing that you just quoted those statistics which are accurate and i think we re all blessed to be able to live in a city like this it s growing and there are problems but it s true there isn t a whole lot of violence that we see in san diego certainly they are the police officers are facing the same questions that you have across the country police violence and those are being addressed i think pretty adequately but as we grow we re going to have more big city problems and so i think we get ahead of the curve on that i think it s a good thing and i think part of that is going earlier in the training at the police academy and getting this kind of culture of restraint in terms of how they respond to problems and how the police themselves see what an adequate response is to a potentially violent situation q so then i ll take it from the opposite aspect the previous question was can be seen as pro police this one can be seen as anti police as you said san diego is grown up we re a big city now we re the eighth or ninth largest city in america 1 4 million people and yet we ve never done what other big cities do which is look for outside talent if you were running a big corporation that has 10 000 employees and you always hire from within you are sustaining the culture that led to the problem of many cops being arrested in eight or 10 years ago if we re a big mature city why don t we do other big mature cities doing look for outside talent and yet we don t even see attempts as far as i could tell a serious attempt to recruit nationally when we placed the police chief a well most people resist change because of two factors status quo bias and then risk aversion and i think that s part of any institution any organization has to wrestle with that you see at the state department where i work where you have the foreign service officers and there s almost always the promotion from within the ranks and there s a kind of opposition to seeing somebody from the outside coming in and running the state department if he or she is not a foreign service officer so part of it is changing that culture and accepting the idea that competition can be very good and that just starts earlier in the process and again kind of eliminating the silos and the turf wars that you have i think part of it is this managed competition idea where you can bring in a competition from the outside and get people to understand that competition is not all bad it can regenerate institutions certainly this is kind of a short term process that can be painful for many people but advertisement i don t like to be beholden to certain positions merely because of my democratic party and my affiliation james rudolph q isn t the problem particularly acute in the state department because of the president s habits of appointing hacks as ambassadors and it s tough to argue have a meritocracy q is that a city council question i don t know a oh i m happy to answer those i mean it takes me over to my strength yeah um and so what was the question about the state department q oh it s okay just seems like if you re appointing political hacks as ambassadors no wonder the rank and file officer is worried about people being imposed a yeah certainly but you know it s the president s prerogative he is the president and he s entitled to appoint it s in the constitution he appoints our ambassadors and the senate confirms and it s a majority vote in the senate is republicans so it seems pretty simple to see that where that s going um but uh my point was you have this culture where our foreign service officers are leery or suspicious of outsiders they just don t know our culture they can t possibly know what we ve gone through and they can t possibly understand the life of a foreign service officer and i see some parallels between that and the police department or any institution focusing on change and bringing in outsiders but i think that thinking is hampered in many ways by short term thinking but if you focus more on the long term thinking and about what it does for the city and whether it benefits the city as a whole and i think you should be open to that possibility advertisement q you brought up managed competitions and just so i m clear you are supporting managed competition because i know there s a history in the city obviously a broadly speaking i support the idea that if there s an open bidding process and it s fair and transparent and you get the best price then your n no 1 focus should be on the voters and the city of san diego and the residents and the citizens because these are taxpayer dollars and that should be your no 1 goal and not necessarily focusing on interest groups to the detriment of society as a whole oftentimes you get rent seeking and special interest groups promoting a narrow agenda but i like to focus on the wider agenda and what it means for san diego as a whole and if it means bringing in outside competition and we re getting the best for the money we re spending then yes i do support that q do you support return to defined benefit pensions for new city hires a again it s one of those issues i have not grappled with that enough i wouldn t want to just give you some kind of canned response i haven t memorized any of that so i wouldn t want to go on record as saying something that is coming from a place of ignorance i haven t tracked that issue enough to give you a thoughtful enough response it s certainly an important issue in san diego and i will certainly have to address it at some point q when you talked about how you re not going to be as eager to support special interests most of us would take that as code for union is that fair enough assumption a no i think they shouldn t be singled out there are many special interests i was just speaking generally broadly as somebody who likes to study economics you know unions have weakened in our country and i support the role that unions play in our society i think they do tend to increase wages and they do act as the kind of union rep can be a spokesman spokesperson for the workers and i think those two roles are important in our society i don t think it should be weakened further but i think we also need to keep in mind certain economic principles and what i just mentioned earlier the idea of benefiting the city not just a special interest advertisement q but the narrative of unions being weaker doesn t really hold up in california i ve lived here 29 years i m a former union member of the newspaper guild of hawaii and i m telling you that it doesn t hold up unions are more powerful than ever in sacramento right now we have policies passed that make it more difficult to see how your schools are doing they call that a reform so california democrats dominate the state california democrats are dominated by unions california public schools are not getting better and they re resisting the chance to make reforms that have worked very well in massachusetts texas florida and elsewhere and then you get to construction and housing cost california mandates the use of union labor in many many many many different ways to the point where it s difficult to get non union built housing in california so i just feel like we need a gorbachev of the california democratic party to introduce perestroika and point out that hey what we re doing to favor this one group isn t necessarily positive and yet i can t get any democrat to even approach that as a real problem with the power of unions in california what do you say about unions in california a you just got one i d be happy to approach that issue but i think it s incontrovertible that historically unions are down whether you take a long term approach if you go back to the 50s up to 2019 the numbers are down nationally q and in california but as far as political power they re not down i like to discuss the issues thoughtfully i like to consider both sides and i think having a discussion that is grounded in basic economics is a very important part of the process james rudolph a yeah there was a recent study maybe last week where the schools were graded slight improvement some of the teachers are sensitive when they see the reports they re working very hard and diligently to do this you have certain standards that are imposed on them but i think there is improvement i think it s slow it s certainly piecemeal and uh we d all like to see more again i think the issue is education and what you focus on in education but just to answer your question i m happy to address that issue and have that conversation as i said i don t like to be beholden to certain positions merely because of my democratic party and my affiliation i like to discuss the issues thoughtfully i like to consider both sides and i think having a discussion that is grounded in basic economics is a very important part of the process obviously there s a political process and you have policy and you have compromises and you have various constituencies that have to be taken into account but that s the kind of candidacy and role i d like to play on the city council is bringing together these groups and getting them to talk q you talk about having this kind of thematically an economic lens through that through a political lens through any lens you want what s your position on the convention center expansion that voters are gonna take up do you support that advertisement a yeah i support the expansion of the convention center i think it s important again the city is growing i think seeing certain institutions grow with the city and we need to accommodate more visitors and tourists and i think the hotels need to pay their fair share with that obviously the question becomes who pays for it um i think the hotels benefit from all the tourists they benefit from all the conventions and um conventions are a big part of our local economy they benefit us uh if you don t believe that go up to san francisco and look at the conventions that have been canceled up there because of the various issues they face up there with homelessness and other uh related societal ills um so i think we need to support expansion of the convention center um but it needs to be managed and um and various interests are benefiting from tourism and san diego s expansion they need to pay their fair share and part of that is obviously the hotel industry the san diego convention center k c alfred san diego union tribune q what do you think of san diego s future as a tech hub as a biotech hub as a place for business we had a candidate in earlier who said the outlook is actually pretty grim and then other cities are doing better at that a yeah maybe there was a study last year about this issue i think there s a ton of potential up there up in the utc ucsd area um but if you talk to uh some of these millennials about where they want to be um most of them are staying in san francisco or some other city and i think san diego doesn t do as well because of the downtown area the downtown area is developing and i think it s improving a lot but there s still the sense that they want to be they want to live in a condo or an apartment that s right downtown they want their work right here as well they want to walk to work or they want to take a scooter to work or ride a bike to work and we are moving in that direction down here but we re still not there not like san francisco not like washington d c not like new york city so in many ways san diego it s still a smaller city in that sense and many of these millennials have pointed to that problem i didn t go to san diego because it s not like san francisco in that sense it s not like palo alto it s not like d c so i think part of it is addressing that concern and just being honest about uh how you attract new talent to the city and what kind of housing you build to accommodate them q there s another measure come into the ballot stephen russell and the housing commission s i think it s 900 million towards affordable housing to build more are you supportive of that measure a i don t know all the details but you know broadly speaking as i said i am supporting the idea of expanding the supply of housing um so i would have to look at the details but if its goal is to expand the stock affordable housing um then yes i support that but i also support preserving the housing we already have in place and making sure that it s available to uh to families advertisement q even if the affordable housing being built is hundreds of thousands of dollars a unit kind of more than you might spend in some other fashion a well i mean if if the costs don t make sense then it s something that has to be addressed with the developers and ultimately with the voters to see what they say about that um but again if it doesn t make economic sense if the numbers aren t adding up then that s normally a tip off that something else is at play q who d you work for george galloway in the british parliament a no so i worked for a member of parliament uh who then became um a minister under gordon brown so he was a labor member of parliament his name is jim knight he s no longer a member of parliament he s no longer a minister but he is a lord he s the life peer he s a baron and uh he s a personal friend of mine i went to campaign for him in 2001 uh he was a parliamentary candidate in south dorset which is southwest england about three hours from london by train and uh i got the opportunity to work for him and work on the campaign and uh i got to meet tony blair gordon brown q cherie blair a i did not meet her no no tony blair was on the campaign trail she was in some other parts of the country campaigning but um yeah it was a great opportunity um and he s now he s now as i just mentioned a life peer but his real job uh is an education consultant because he was at one point the education minister in the uk so he s now a jetsetter going all around the world kind of uh advising companies and schools advertisement q did he shadow parliament for the next labor i mean shadow cabinet a i mean he is a life peer so he is in the house of lords um interestingly you have to show up to get paid so if you don t show up you don t get paid but you re you re certainly still there as somebody who can contribute his or her voice q is he going to be a campaign surrogate for you a hey i i would welcome that yeah i helped him i think maybe it s time for him to come and help me and you know his accent would certainly get me some votes right q one other question was curious who s your favorite um who do you think has been the best district 1 council member a well my knowledge of that doesn t go too far back i think sherri lightner did a good job um she had some challenges um i think barbara bry is doing a good job that s kind of um yeah you know um i don t know if i have a favorite to be honest i think i ve been tracking local politics for awhile but um i just haven t really had a favorite i think um i like to see competence i like to see people that actually get out there and talk to voters um i like retail politics that s going to be my approach so um i thought sherri lightner did a reasonably good job of getting out there and meeting people and she had some success advertisement q so i noticed you didn t mention scott peters our sitting congressman should that be taken as a vote of no confidence a no certainly that just slipped my mind because now i just think of him as a congressman i think he also did a good job he s been reelected several times so certainly the voters hold him in high regard he s done a good job i think he has a good approach he s reasonably balanced on most of the issues um and he and i used to take the same flight from san diego to dulles pretty much every monday morning he would be coming here to visit his family and his um constituents and i was my family was still in la jolla and i was working and coming home about once a month so i d get to talk to him and it was always great because he was accessible and very friendly and open to talking about his job q you re gonna knock on all the homes in the district including the romney home a i see romney i don t even need to go to his home i can just follow him to vons he goes to vons all the time he goes to cvs he does his own shopping he s out there with his own little cart and this little basket and i say hi to him whenever he s out there um so i ll just ask him for his vote yeah right there at vons but uh the one challenge for me is um carmel valley my children go to school in carmel valley but i have not spent a great deal of time up there so i really want to spend some time up there getting to know voters i think they have similar issues the way la jolla is it s kind of separate from the rest of the city it s way up there off the 56 and they really have no public transportation that s a major problem for carmel valley there s just no reasonable way to take a bus to carmel valley and they re just stuck up there so um you know will moore who s also running mentioned this a couple of weeks ago when they had the free ride day uh and he pointed out accurately i d love to take a free ride but there s no bus coming to carmel valley so that s a big part of our development and we need more public transportation um you know that ties into affordable housing wherever it s built it has to be connected by a bus or a trolley to get people to and from work and to various other activities i think that area has just been neglected and that needs to be addressed q i don t know the people in carmel valley been up in arms about it i mean is there a sense of taking the bus route to a place where nobody s going to take the bus advertisement a well um that i don t know i mean certainly there is some wealth in carmel valley and uh i don t know what the demand is exactly for public transportation at carmel valley uh i know personally that um i had a job opportunity up there at one point and i i ve always been a big proponent of taking public transportation um and i take the bus uh the 30 bus from la jolla to downtown uh almost every day um and i had an opportunity up there and i wanted to take the bus and there s just no opportunity to do it uh so i had to decline that job because it was up in the carmel valley del mar heights area the 101 bus the north county transit system bus which connects from ucsd and the va goes up there but it drops you off in del mar and you have to hike all the way up that hill and it takes about 45 minutes and if you re wearing anything like this you get to work uh sweating and um so it just wasn t viable so i would like to think that there are others in my position who have faced that same challenge uh so yeah i think that s one of those issues that i d like to address with voters up there q give us your closing statement a i was thinking about that and i was reminded of a quote by martin luther king and uh he said cowardice asks is it safe and expedience asks is it politic and vanity asks is it popular but conscience asks is it right and that s the kind of approach i d like to take uh it s the approach i take in my personal life it s the approach i like to take with all issues is it right with respect to the city council i think it means is it right for district 1 if i m running for district 1 but it also means is it right for the city of san diego is it right for california and is it the right policy and that s the approach i d like to take and that s um an important part of this kind of ethos that should be at city council is it right

the outgoing governor of the bank of england mark carney has added his voice to warnings that having reduced interest rates to record lows central banks may be running out of measures to deal with a recession in an interview with the financial times on tuesday carney said the global economy was heading towards a liquidity trap in which monetary policy loses its effectiveness in producing increased spending and reviving economic growth it s generally true that there s much less ammunition for all the major central banks than they previously had and i m of the opinion that this situation will persist for some time he said carney told the ft that if there were to be deeper downturn requiring more stimulus than a conventional recession then it s not clear that monetary policy would have sufficient space carney s comments came in the wake of the annual meeting of the american economic association aea held last weekend in san diego which focused on the issues confronting central banks according to bloomberg the central message of the meeting was that the us and euro area face daunting economic challenges in a world of low inflation and interest rates and central banks alone don t have the tools to cope in his address to the meeting the incoming president of the aea former chairman of the us federal reserve ben bernanke said the new environment posed challenges for central banks that had traditionally relied on lowering interest rates to stimulate economies in a blog post on which his speech was based bernanke said interest rates around the world had been trending downwards since the 1980s and generally low rates meant that in the face of an economic downturn or undesirably low inflation the room available for conventional rate cuts is much smaller than in the past bernanke wrote that the new tools developed by the fed and other central banks including asset purchases so called quantitative easing qe as well as forward guidance in effect assuring financial markets that interest rates would remain lower for longer could provide some stimulus he also foreshadowed further measures including negative interest rates as implemented by the european central bank the fed should maintain a constructive ambiguity on the future use of negative short term rates because ruling them out created an effective floor for long term rates as well and could limit the fed s ability to reduce longer term rates by qe or other measures but bernanke acknowledged that what he called his relatively upbeat conclusions about the effectiveness of the new monetary tools depended on the neutral rate of interest being in the range of 2 3 percent or above because all monetary strategies became much less effective when it was below 2 the neutral rate is the rate which leads neither to economic stimulus or a dampening of the economy but as bernanke acknowledged there is considerable uncertainty about the current and future levels of the nominal neutral rate other speakers at the meeting were more downbeat than bernanke speaking via a video link the former president of the ecb mario draghi said he believed that for the euro area there was some risk of japanification this refers to the situation where as in japan the central bank has to keep interest rates at near to zero and functions as the main purchaser in the bond market in order to try to prevent recession and inflation is close to zero or even negative draghi said the euro area could still avoid a deflationary malaise but time is not infinite former fed chair janet yellen said she agreed with former clinton treasury secretary lawrence summers that the us was in a state of secular stagnation a term first used in the 1930s where desired savings were higher than desired investment resulting in low interest rates she indicated this situation could prevail for some time as the conditions that gave rise to it including lower levels of productivity were apt to prove chronic by nature monetary policy had a role to play in future downturns but was unlikely to be sufficient in the years ahead she repeated her concerns about the risks to financial stability arising from a prolonged period of low interest rates as investors search for yield and take on leverage countries need strong tools to counter asset bubbles but this was lacking in the united states the inability of monetary policy to meet a downturn was also emphasised by other participants mary daly president of the san francisco fed said we have less room to manoeuvre in its report on the meeting the financial times noted that in the usually understated world of monetary policy these expressions of concern are notably explicit and cited remarks by raghuram rajan the former governor of the reserve bank of india rajan warned of the dangers of the easy money policy of the fed in 2005 in the build up to the 2008 crisis for which he was denounced by summers and many others they can t announce too loudly they have no tools left he said part of the magic of central banking is to pretend you have a bazooka behind your back there are already indications that further unconventional and emergency measures are not merely some future prospect but are already being enacted following mid september s spike in interest rates in the repo market where financial institutions borrow overnight to square off their books for the day the fed has been intervening aggressively to buy short term assets in order to ensure liquidity and keep interest rates down normally interest rates in this market track the fed s base rate now at between 1 5 and 1 75 percent but rose to as high as 10 percent the spike sounded alarm bells because the lack of liquidity in the repo market was one of the features of the 2008 crisis the fed has maintained its operations are merely aimed at countering technical problems in the operation of financial markets but nearly four months on from the mid september spike they are assuming a permanent character the wall street journal reported on tuesday that the new york fed had pumped nearly 100 billion in short term liquidity into financial markets that day following a 76 9 billion intervention on monday the fed has said repeatedly this is not quantitative easing in a new form but its own figures belie this assertion last thursday it reported that its holdings of assets had risen to 4 17 trillion as of the beginning of the year up from 3 8 trillion on september
with brent d griffiths the ticker investors set aside their jitters over the middle east tinderbox to send stocks to new highs but economists taking a long view see graver threats to growth both at home and abroad looming on the horizon the world bank in its latest forecast cut expectations for global growth this year by 2 percent to 2 5 percent citing fragile conditions brought on by ongoing trade uncertainty and a slowdown in investment that would amount to a tiny improvement over 2019 which saw the worldwide economy expand by 2 4 percent the slowest pace since the 2008 financial crisis the development bank left room for rosier outcomes but warned that downside risks predominate including the possibility of a re escalation of global trade tensions sharp downturns in major economies and disruptions in the developing world advertisement the outlook closer to home is gloomier the world bank sees u s growth stumbling from the unspectacular 2 3 percent growth it notched in 2019 to 1 8 percent this year on its way down to 1 7 percent in both 2021 and 2022 that would amount to a significant underperformance measured against president trump s promise to deliver at least 3 percent growth and the world bank s forecasters aren t alone economists gathered at the american economic association s annual meeting last week shared a dark mood according to the new york times s jim tankersley and jeanna smialek they warned one another about trade war about government budget deficits and repeatedly about the inability of central banks to fully combat another recession should one

bair writes in an op ed for the post i like buttigieg and would be happy to endorse him 20 years from now after he has proved himself today however he is not ready and i have a sickening fear that much of his impressive fundraising is driven by the moneyed interests who profit from the current system and think his lack of experience will lead to a preservation of the status quo democrats need

by fidelity mhlanga respected united states based stockbroking firm morgan co research has urged zimbabwean authorities to join the rand monetary union rmu to resolve the prevailing currency volatility and stabilise the southern african country s economy since government made a surprise announcement of the return of the zimbabwe dollar as the sole legal tender last year albeit with inadequate foreign currency and mineral backing the unit has been on a freefall with traders increasingly shunning the zimbabwe dollar especially the coins morgan co said this was enough indication that the local currency has failed to ignite confidence in the market our advice to the government of zimbabwe in 2020 is to undo statutory instrument 142 this policy has not helped businesses in any way as it does not solve the fundamental problem which is the lack of forex the timing of a return of an unbacked zimbabwe dollar was premature given the lack of confidence in the monetary system advertisement in our view a more practical way to boost confidence in the zimbabwe dollar while the new administration works on economic reforms would be joining the rand monetary union namibia swaziland and lesotho all use the south african rand alongside their own currencies the model has worked and has restored confidence in currencies such as the namibian dollar morgan co research said the stockbroking firm noted that the reintroduction of the zimbabwean dollar last year after it was scrapped in 2009 at the height of hyperinflation was ill timed and disastrous there is clear evidence on the ground that the zwl has failed as traders and merchants continue to charge in united states dollars despite the effects of statutory instrument 142 this trend is not only evident in urban areas but has become a norm in rural parts of zimbabwe morgan co said in its market intelligence report analysts see the benefits of adopting a dual currency especially taking into cognisance the fact that south africa is also zimbabwe s largest trading partner with more than 60 of imports coming from the neighbouring country economist kipson gundani pointed out that zimbabwe could use the rand without necessarily joining the rand union i think technically in terms of joining the rand union there are certain benchmarks that the south african government expects from us that is we need to have a certain budget deficit and this can be difficult to adhere to however we can adopt the rand by default without joining the rand union like what we did with the us dollar in 2009 government can pay civil servants in rand businesses can pay tax in rand but this will just provide a temporary relief to our problems we might have the rand us dollar in circulation but that will not wish away serious indiscipline corruption and appetite for spending the money we don t have gundani said apart from currency volatility the economy is ravaged by power shortages market confidence dearth looming drought and runaway inflation recorded at 430 last november like this like loading

respected united states based stockbroking firm morgan co research has urged zimbabwean authorities to join the rand monetary union rmu to resolve the prevailing currency volatility and stabilise the southern african country s economy by fidelity mhlanga respected united states based stockbroking firm morgan co research has urged zimbabwean authorities to join the rand monetary union rmu to resolve the prevailing currency volatility and stabilise the southern african country s economy since government made a surprise announcement of the return of the zimbabwe dollar as the sole legal tender last year albeit with inadequate foreign currency and mineral backing the unit has been on a freefall with traders increasingly shunning the zimbabwe dollar especially the coins morgan co said this was enough indication that the local currency has failed to ignite confidence in the market our advice to the government of zimbabwe in 2020 is to undo statutory instrument 142 this policy has not helped businesses in any way as it does not solve the fundamental problem which is the lack of forex the timing of a return of an unbacked zimbabwe dollar was premature given the lack of confidence in the monetary system in our view a more practical way to boost confidence in the zimbabwe dollar while the new administration works on economic reforms would be joining the rand monetary union namibia swaziland and lesotho all use the south african rand alongside their own currencies the model has worked and has restored confidence in currencies such as the namibian dollar morgan co research said the stockbroking firm noted that the reintroduction of the zimbabwean dollar last year after it was scrapped in 2009 at the height of hyperinflation was ill timed and disastrous there is clear evidence on the ground that the zwl has failed as traders and merchants continue to charge in united states dollars despite the effects of statutory instrument 142 this trend is not only evident in urban areas but has become a norm in rural parts of zimbabwe morgan co said in its market intelligence report analysts see the benefits of adopting a dual currency especially taking into cognisance the fact that south africa is also zimbabwe s largest trading partner with more than 60 of imports coming from the neighbouring country economist kipson gundani pointed out that zimbabwe could use the rand without necessarily joining the rand union i think technically in terms of joining the rand union there are certain benchmarks that the south african government expects from us that is we need to have a certain budget deficit and this can be difficult to adhere to however we can adopt the rand by default without joining the rand union like what we did with the us dollar in 2009 government can pay civil servants in rand businesses can pay tax in rand but this will just provide a temporary relief to our problems we might have the rand us dollar in circulation but that will not wish away serious indiscipline corruption and appetite for spending the money we don t have gundani said apart from currency volatility the economy is ravaged by power shortages market confidence dearth looming drought and runaway inflation recorded at 430 last november

south africa will have to keep its fingers crossed that the only rating agency that still has the country on investment grade ignores its below 1 growth forecast for 2020 say economists this comes after the world bank became the first key institution to cut its economic growth projection for sa to below 1 putting it at 0 9 for 2020 when it released its global economic prospects report on thursday the revised forecast is below the national treasury s last projection that sa s economy would grow by of 1 2 in 2020 or moody s which expected 1 but it is almost in line with the bank s own africa pulse report which projected 0 8 in october last year interruptions in electricity supply as eskom continues to roll out rotational load shedding was a key reason repeatedly highlighted by the bank for downgrading its initial growth forecast for south africa by 40 basis points in 2020 and 2021 it now expects sa s economy to grow by an average 1 4 in the two years to 2022 even then that growth rate will only be attained if government makes the necessary structural reforms and if policy certainty improves so that the environment can be conducive for private sector investments said the washington based lender increasingly binding infrastructure constraints notably in electricity supply are expected to inhibit domestic growth while export momentum will be hindered by weak external demand greater risk annabel bishop chief economist at investec said moody s is due to review sa s credit rating on march 27 after the budget speech government will need to show marked commitment to fiscal consolidation to avoid a downgrade including reducing public expenditure in order for the fiscal debt and deficit projections to moderate she added moody s expects sa s gdp at 1 0 to 1 5 avoiding a downgrade means the agency would need to come to terms with a likely weaker growth outcome for 2020 of potentially around 0 8 year on year she said bishop said the rating agency has previously expressed heightened concern over sa s weak economic growth and that lower growth forecasts for sa including the recent drop from the world bank adds to the risk of a downgrade dr azar jammine chief economist at econometrix said lower economic growth would take a toll on revenue collection heightening the risk of a ratings downgrade with less tax collections you have a likelihood of an even bigger budget deficit unless there are commensurate cuts in expenditure said jammine the eskom thorn jammine said given the levels unplanned breakdowns reached at eskom when the power utility implemented stage 6 load shedding in december the logical conclusion was that when everyone returned to work and business production returned to normal levels power interruptions could yield even worse economic growth than anticipated for 2020 the latest manufacturing data for november shows production was down 3 6 one of the worst we ve had in a long time we haven t even seen december figures breakdowns at eskom have remained elevated for most of december and january on thursday when the utility announced stage 2 load shedding it said over 14 000mw of generating capacity had broken down almost the same level as 14 200 mw that was reported when stage 6 load shedding was implemented in december bishop said persistent load shedding would support a further contraction of gdp in the first quarter of 2020 when there was already a 0 6 reduction in gdp in the third quarter of 2019 the fourth quarter gdp numbers are yet to be released but are expected to also show a contraction the first quarter of each calendar year has seen a contraction in gdp in the past four years and q1 20 is expected to be no different particularly with the negative impact of load shedding sa risks potential gdp continuing to drop to 0 and then below without drastic action to repair the productivity of public services and infrastructure including consistent electricity supply said bishop

employees work on the production line of high precision sheet aluminium at a factory of shandong weiqiao pioneering group company limited on november 23 2019 in zouping shandong province of china tang ke vcg via getty images the world bank has warned of the risk of a fresh global debt crisis urging governments and central banks to recognize that historically low interest rates may not be enough to offset another widespread financial meltdown in its biannual global economic prospects gep report published late wednesday the washington d c based group said there have been four waves of debt accumulation over the last 50 years the current wave which started in 2010 is thought to be the largest fastest and most broad based increase in global borrowing since the 1970s the world bank said that while low levels of interest rates which financial markets expect to be sustained over the medium term mitigate some of the risks associated with high debt levels the previous three waves of broad based debt accumulation all ended with financial crises in many developing and emerging economies watch now low global interest rates provide only a precarious protection against financial crises ayhan kose director of the world bank s prospects group said in the report the history of past waves of debt accumulation shows that these waves tend to have unhappy endings in a fragile global environment policy improvements are critical to minimize the risks associated with the current debt wave menu of policy options for world leaders in 2018 global debt climbed to a record high of about 230 of gross domestic product gdp the world bank said while total debt from emerging and developing economies reached an all time high of almost 170 of gdp that marked an increase of 54 percentage points of gdp since 2010 china accounted for the bulk of this build up partly due to its size but the world bank emphasized that the accumulation of borrowing has been broad based since 2010 watch now the so called fourth wave of global debt was found to bear many similarities to the previous three a changing global financial landscape mounting vulnerabilities and concerns about inefficient use of borrowed funds the first three waves of global debt accumulation were identified as running from 1970 1989 1990 2001 and 2002 2009 it listed a menu of four policy options for countries to reduce the likelihood of the current global debt wave ending in crises and if crises were to take place to alleviate their impact first the world bank said sound debt management and debt transparency should help to reduce borrowing costs and contain fiscal risks second strong monetary exchange rate and fiscal policy frameworks could safeguard developing and emerging economies in a fragile economic environment third robust financial sector regulation and supervision to recognize and tackle emerging risks and fourth effective public finance management and policies that promote good corporate governance can help ensure that debt is used productively global growth forecast the world bank strengthened its global economic growth forecast to 2 5 in 2020 in the report up from its previous projection of 2 4 but warned downward risks were likely to persist with growth in emerging and developing economies likely to remain slow policymakers should seize the opportunity to undertake structural reforms that boost broad based growth which is essential to poverty reduction ceyla pazarbasioglu vice president for equitable growth finance and institutions said in the report steps to improve the business climate the rule of law debt management and productivity can help achieve sustained growth

but it was the lack of casualties that gave the markets more confidence that the iranians had instigated little more than the intention to make a public show of force mainly to save face at home it seems tensions may have de escalated now that iran s retaliation so far turned out to be measured and caused no us casualties stocks came roaring back treasuries fully retraced the overnight rally while gold positions had a virtual meltdown that was until the serenity in the market was shattered on reports several rockets have hit the green zone in baghdad sending the algorithms back into overdrive but frankly unless iran was crazy enough to launch these attacks at iraqi civilians assets especially after influential iraqi shi ite cleric moqtada al sadr called for the militias to stand down the markets will likely quickly shrug this off as a lone wolf attack anti american sentiment will continue to run thick along iran s crescent of influence so we should expect more of the same in the days and weeks ahead for now anyway the us administration appears happy with the trade off as in their views cutting the head off the snake in exchange for some minor body blows makes good military sense advertisement reinforcing this view us president donald trump said on wednesday minimum damage was sustained from iranian missile strikes and that iran appears to be standing down he sounded calm relaxed and collected in his white house address which in turn removed any remnant defensiveness in the market seen earlier on wednesday as the critical risk sentiment indicator usdjpy started flashing green again and slicing through the significant 109 level hopefully this will allow me to get back to what i like to do analyze the market data for price discovery and divorce myself from the armchair quarterbacking nonsense what did yesterday tell us the brief risk off spike showed the current safe haven go to assets are yen franc gold and treasuries and that neither iran nor the us seems to have the appetite for escalating the current situation into a major war so with president trump delivering a benign whitehouse address and in the absence of any further iranian retaliation this geopolitical fracas could fade away like a pound of soap in a hard day s wash story continues asia markets should have a healthy session with oil prices moving lower as it removes an immediate and significant risk to the local economies given their heavy reliance on oil imports oil markets the sell off in oil following an initial spike after yesterday s iran retaliation should be a stark reminder that while it s wise to price at a higher level of geopolitical risk it s going to take an actual disruption to the global oil supply chain to sustain a break above brent 70 per barrel while president trump s address placated concerns around iran s fears oil fell further after suhail al mazrouei united arab emirates energy minister that opec is ready to respond to rising middle east tension and that the cartel would seek to ensure that ample energy supplies are available interestingly as more speculators are attracted to the oil markets more barrels are also drawn to the tumult still oil prices should find support from the more pedestrian views around the trade deal while the geopolitical risk premium should continue to underpin sentiment conditions remain ripe for a supply disruption from a terrorist attack given the anti us attitude that continues to run thick along iran s crescent of influence gold markets you could almost hear the algorithms laughing at gold shorts yesterday when the machines steamrolled over standing offers and triggering a wave of stop losses with it on the first iranian escalation headlines but that rarified air above 1600 oz was always unsustainable as it was highly unlikely with the us self sufficient on oil that yesterday s escalation would damage the outlook for the us economy and then pivot the fed dovish when it comes to gold s bullish ambitions in its purest pursuit it always boils back to real yields yesterday was an absolute recipe for disaster for the nouveau gold experts as gold prices virtually melted down on their trading screens unaware that gold sensitivity to geopolitical risks was momentously higher than any other defensive assets and that surges in geopolitical risk can by their nature be short lived and volatile freshly minted longs were mercilessly hammered now that we ve closed the gap from last friday s close at 1552 53 oz it should attract some buying interest around this level but with focus likely to shift to the us economic data and the ultimate risk on trigger the signing of the p1 trade deal on january 15 gold could struggle in this environment even more so if the global growth trade of 2020 picks up a head of steam currency markets the euro volumes in g10 fx markets have been pretty light so far this year as a major theme has yet to emerge the eurusd continues to grind lower and has sliced through decent bids this week amid relatively small vol and the stubbornly bid dollar environment persists no surprise really as the eu data continues to run wishy washy while us data remains good the australian dollar and the yuan if you were looking to get into the global growth for 2020 trade it could be worth looking at the divergence in cnh and aud as the aussie has been hammered over the past four days on bushfires and iran fears while the yuan has remained firm with the cnh likely to bounce after signing of the trade deal positively the aud shouldn t be that far behind and the correlation could play some significant catch up in the days ahead even more so with risk on lights flashing green the malaysian ringgit with regional risk sentiment improving and the us china trade deal still on course to be signed january 15 despite softer oil prices the ringgit will likely coattail the yuan positive skew into the p1 trade deal finally the broader asian currency

but it was the lack of casualties that gave the markets more confidence that the iranians had instigated little more than the intention to make a public show of force mainly to save face at home it seems tensions may have de escalated now that iran s retaliation so far turned out to be measured and caused no us casualties stocks came roaring back treasuries fully retraced the overnight rally while gold positions had a virtual meltdown that was until the serenity in the market was shattered on reports several rockets have hit the green zone in baghdad sending the algorithms back into overdrive but frankly unless iran was crazy enough to launch these attacks at iraqi civilians assets especially after influential iraqi shi ite cleric moqtada al sadr called for the militias to stand down the markets will likely quickly shrug this off as a lone wolf attack anti american sentiment will continue to run thick along iran s crescent of influence so we should expect more of the same in the days and weeks ahead for now anyway the us administration appears happy with the trade off as in their views cutting the head off the snake in exchange for some minor body blows makes good military sense advertisement advertisement reinforcing this view us president donald trump said on wednesday minimum damage was sustained from iranian missile strikes and that iran appears to be standing down he sounded calm relaxed and collected in his white house address which in turn removed any remnant defensiveness in the market seen earlier on wednesday as the critical risk sentiment indicator usdjpy started flashing green again and slicing through the significant 109 level hopefully this will allow me to get back to what i like to do analyze the market data for price discovery and divorce myself from the armchair quarterbacking nonsense what did yesterday tell us the brief risk off spike showed the current safe haven go to assets are yen franc gold and treasuries and that neither iran nor the us seems to have the appetite for escalating the current situation into a major war so with president trump delivering a benign whitehouse address and in the absence of any further iranian retaliation this geopolitical fracas could fade away like a pound of soap in a hard day s wash advertisement advertisement asia markets should have a healthy session with oil prices moving lower as it removes an immediate and significant risk to the local economies given their heavy reliance on oil imports oil markets the sell off in oil following an initial spike after yesterday s iran retaliation should be a stark reminder that while it s wise to price at a higher level of geopolitical risk it s going to take an actual disruption to the global oil supply chain to sustain a break above brent 70 per barrel story continues while president trump s address placated concerns around iran s fears oil fell further after suhail al mazrouei united arab emirates energy minister that opec is ready to respond to rising middle east tension and that the cartel would seek to ensure that ample energy supplies are available interestingly as more speculators are attracted to the oil markets more barrels are also drawn to the tumult still oil prices should find support from the more pedestrian views around the trade deal while the geopolitical risk premium should continue to underpin sentiment conditions remain ripe for a supply disruption from a terrorist attack given the anti us attitude that continues to run thick along iran s crescent of influence gold markets you could almost hear the algorithms laughing at gold shorts yesterday when the machines steamrolled over standing offers and triggering a wave of stop losses with it on the first iranian escalation headlines advertisement advertisement but that rarified air above 1600 oz was always unsustainable as it was highly unlikely with the us self sufficient on oil that yesterday s escalation would damage the outlook for the us economy and then pivot the fed dovish when it comes to gold s bullish ambitions in its purest pursuit it always boils back to real yields yesterday was an absolute recipe for disaster for the nouveau gold experts as gold prices virtually melted down on their trading screens unaware that gold sensitivity to geopolitical risks was momentously higher than any other defensive assets and that surges in geopolitical risk can by their nature be short lived and volatile freshly minted longs were mercilessly hammered now that we ve closed the gap from last friday s close at 1552 53 oz it should attract some buying interest around this level but with focus likely to shift to the us economic data and the ultimate risk on trigger the signing of the p1 trade deal on january 15 gold could struggle in this environment even more so if the global growth trade of 2020 picks up a head of steam currency markets the euro volumes in g10 fx markets have been pretty light so far this year as a major theme has yet to emerge the eurusd continues to grind lower and has sliced through decent bids this week amid relatively small vol and the stubbornly bid dollar environment persists no surprise really as the eu data continues to run wishy washy while us data remains good the australian dollar and the yuan if you were looking to get into the global growth for 2020 trade it could be worth looking at the divergence in cnh and aud as the aussie has been hammered over the past four days on bushfires and iran fears while the yuan has remained firm with the cnh likely to bounce after signing of the trade deal positively the aud shouldn t be that far behind and the correlation could play some significant catch up in the days ahead even more so with risk on lights flashing green the malaysian ringgit with regional risk sentiment improving and the us china trade deal still on course to be signed january 15 despite softer oil prices the ringgit will likely coattail the yuan positive skew into the p1 trade deal advertisement advertisement finally the broader asian currency markets can breathe again with oil prices trading considerably lower tune in if

sydney and kuala lumpur jan 7 2020 ips the latest november 2019 ubs pwc billionaires reportcounted 2 101 billionaires globally or 589 more than five years before earlier farhad manjoo had seriously recommended abolish billionaires presenting a moral case against the super rich as they have and get far far more than what they might reasonably claim to deserve manjoo also argues that unless billionaires economic and political power is cut and their legitimacy cast in doubt they will continue to abuse power to further augment their fortunes and influence in ways detrimental to the economic social and public good benign billionaires in defence of billionaires josef stadler head of ultra high net worth at ubs global wealth management argued that their wealth has also translated into their philanthropy as billionaires seek new ways to engineer far reaching environmental and social change philanthropic ethics expert chiara cordelli notes that philanthropy and donations have diverted social responsibility from governments and created other problems by bypassing democratic political processes and accountability the philanthropist should not get to decide in virtue of her or his disproportionate influence which world we should live in an ostensibly benign billionaire effect cannot offset the adverse impacts of billionaires wealth accumulation tax avoidance and abuse of power to corrupt political processes and policy making rather every billionaire should be regarded as a policy failure to create fairer societies we need to end extreme wealth concentration and its problematic consequences dubious sources robert reich has shown that a significant share of billionaires wealth is undeserved and does not bear any reasonable connection to their ability intelligence or contribution as expected in a society supposedly based on meritocracy and fair competition oxfam estimates that about a third of billionaire wealth is inherited there is no real economic case for inherited wealth as it undermines social mobility economic progress and meritocracy the main basis of legitimation in modern society other work finds that about 43 per cent of billionaire wealth comes from crony connections to governments and monopolies e g when billionaires use such connections and corruption to secure government concessions and contracts in developing countries this share was even higher 56 per cent according to a 2015 oxfam study the economist s crony capitalism index also suggests that corruption and crony connections to governments are behind much billionaire wealth another source of billionaire wealth is abuse of monopoly privileges granted by patent laws while intellectual property has been justified as necessary for innovation recent research summarized by the the economist disputes the supposed link between patent rights and innovation and deems the patent system a dysfunctional way to reward innovation or new ideas since the 1980s patent rights have been extended well beyond what may be considered necessary to incentivize innovation for richard posner a respected us judge such extensions offer almost no incentive for creating additional intellectual property insider trading taking advantage of privileged information not yet made public has been significantly abused for unfair advantage in markets the new york times has found some of the most prominent cases of illegal insider dealings have involved very wealthy people growing wealth concentration a large and growing share of the global economy is controlled by a few large transnational corporations tncs decades of mergers acquisitions and ineffectual anti trust legislation have seen market power concentrated despite claims to the contrary such tncs cartels other monopolies and oligopolies extract lucrative rents enabling them to secure super profits accelerating wealth accumulation and concentration at the expense of petty producers workers and consumers the way wealth is used by the super rich confirms their own social disutility they accumulate more quickly by paying as little tax as possible making good use of tax advisers and havens a study found that the super rich pay as much as 30 less tax than they should denying governments billions in lost tax revenue the extremely wealthy also get the best investment and tax evasion advice enabling billionaire wealth to increase by an average of 11 annually since 2009 far more than average investors and ordinary savers get dark money corrupts societies the secretive society of trust and estate practitioners step representing over 20 000 wealth managers has successfully lobbied many governments to reduce taxes on the richest step has spent billions to buy legal impunity politicians and the media to lower taxes on its clientele such lobbying has accelerated wealth concentration and accumulation such dark money is used to influence elections and public policy the world over an oxfam study has shown how politicians have been bought by latin america s super rich e g with substantial financial backing for ethno populist racist and religiously intolerant leaders over a century ago monopoly power was seen as a major threat to the us economy and society anti trust legislation and action especially by president theodore roosevelt broke up cartels and monopolies years later his cousin president franklin delano roosevelt warned government by organized money is just as dangerous as government by organised mob neoliberalism oversold however in recent decades neoliberal economists have taken a much more benign view of oligopolies and monopolies distinguishing them from classical liberal economists committed to market competition conversely insisting on competition in small developing economies has effectively prevented domestic firms from becoming internationally competitive by building on economies of scale and scope significantly even the international monetary fund which imposed neoliberal policies for nearly four decades as a condition for credit support now accepts that neoliberalism was oversold while the world bank acknowledges disappointing growth after neoliberal reform deregulation liberalization privatization and globalization have strengthened the market power of corporations reduced the progressivity of tax systems reduced public provisioning

economic inequality has burgeoned as income from capital has risen faster than growth time to change the owners of capital bo rothstein the economic system we used to call liberal market capitalism has changed dramatically since the early 1980s this socio economic model has engendered a huge increase in economic inequality this was not always so for a long period during the 20th century the economic gaps in western societies decreased but during the last three decades the opposite has been true the magnitude of this change is such that important international economic organisations which previously did not care much about the problem the world bank the oecd the world economic forum and the international monetary fund are now issuing strong warnings that the prevailing increase in inequality is incompatible with sound economic and social development moreover while almost all economists used to take for granted a trade off between economic growth and redistribution many leading economists now affirm the opposite namely that this new huge increase in inequality is bad also for growth there are many reasons to worry about this growing inequality trust between people in societies with high inequality is usually low leading to a low stock of social capital which in turn increases all sorts of transaction costs inequality is also both a cause and effect of different forms of corruption leading to spiralling vicious circles furthermore there are many indications that increasing inequality is a major cause of the successes of populist and often xenophobic political parties suggestions from those who do worry as to what should be done have so far mainly returned to the more extensive redistribution policies which characterised many western democracies before neoliberal austerity began increased taxes for better public services and higher benefits are the recipe suggested by thomas piketty for example i am definitely not opposed to this but we need to ask two questions first is the political situation in most western countries such that it will be possible to win a political majority for these polices secondly are these proposals sufficient to remedy the huge increase in inequality unfortunately the answer to both seems to be no become a social europe member support independent publishing and progressive ideas by becoming a social europe member for less than 5 euro per month your support makes all the difference click here to become a member wage earner funds is there any other way to go after much digging into the research i have reached the conclusion that if something enduring is going to be achieved wage earners must somehow also benefit from the return on capital in companies the most radical proposal for making this possible was the wage earner funds implemented in sweden by a social democratic government in 1983 but abolished by a conservative led administration in 1992 unlike most other large scale social reforms launched by the social democrats the funds were never popular even most blue collar workers were against them the implications for individual employees in the companies where these union controlled funds owned shares were never clear there was no connection with the individual wage earner s economic situation or her his possibility to have any influence the negative experience with the wage earner funds has unfortunately made economic democracy a no go area for nordic social democratic parties ever since yet as david ellerman has argued if in a market economy capital can employ that is hire manpower and the capital owners are entitled not only to manage the company but also to the return from its profits employees can equally rent that is borrow capital and then it is the employees who are entitled to the return and to manage the company esop model this is not a utopian claim in the united states for example there is a model that makes it easier for employees to become owners of their companies the esop employee stock ownership plan provides tax relief and functioning legislation to allow the employees of a company to buy it with the company s assets as collateral which means they do not have to take personal financial risks oddly it is in today s super capitalist usa that this form of economic democracy is most prevalent a recent study shows that just over a tenth of employees there work in the nearly 7 000 companies which have this model in more than 4 000 the employees are majority owners decades of studies have shown that these companies are as financially viable as conventional capital owned companies while employees have higher wages are more satisfied with their working conditions and not least in this context receive a substantial share of the profits on average such employees have assets often in the form of pension capital which far exceed those of workers in capital owned companies a cashier who has worked for a long time in the esop company publix a super market chain in the us with over 180 000 employees usually retires as a dollar millionaire in sweden one of the largest banks handelsbanken has had such a system since the 1970s when an employee of the bank retires after about 30 years the dividend is estimated to be between 1 5 and 2 million euro employee ownership thus usually delivers significant sums for the individual employee in the uk more than 200 000 employees work in employee owned businesses of which the john lewis group is the most well known while this model has been seen as a way to establish economic democracy and increase employees work satisfaction left out of the discussion has been what it can imply for increasing equality in the current situation those who care about this issue have good reasons to support systems and legislation that make it easier to establish employee owned businesses as a way to pursue what some economists now call inclusive growth very positive would the capitalists be strongly against such a system some will but many owners of small and medium sized companies heading for retirement seem very positive about selling their companies to their employees probably because their heirs are not interested in or suited for taking over the responsibility moreover much capital is now in the hands of mutual and pension funds and those who manage these funds are usually not interested in actually managing the companies in which they have invested and in the high tech sector owners are often interested in making employees co owners since they are so dependent on their commitment loyalty and knowledge this is not a perfect system there will be employee owned companies which are not profitable and cannot provide rents to their employees some will have to close because they are not viable those working in the public sector will not receive any similar dividends but those who demand a perfect system will have to wait forever for effective measures against the vastly increasing socially unsustainable and morally unacceptable increases in economic inequality which we have been suffering from for a long time now an earlier version of this article appeared in

fiscal 2019 sales amounted to 88 7 million a decrease of 3 6 million or 3 9 from the prior year the decrease for the quarter was primarily attributable to the shipment by the north american operations of a large complex chinese order in the third quarter of the prior fiscal year partially offset by an increase in shipments of large project orders in the company s italian operations due to a record backlog at the beginning of the year gross profit percentage increased by 50 basis points from 24 5 to 25 0 the increase in the gross profit percentage is mainly attributable to a stronger proportion of higher margin product sales and an increased sales volume in the company s italian operations which allowed the subsidiary to cover its fixed costs more efficiently this increase was partially offset by temporary factors such as a less efficient product mix in the company s north american operations including a lower volume of higher margin spare parts sales the company has realized an improvement in the gross profit percentage of its north american operations in comparison to the first and second quarters of the current fiscal year thanks to improved margins in its project manufacturing business net loss 1 amounted to 0 8 million or 0 04 per share compared to 0 2 million or 0 01 per share last year net loss 1 for the current quarter was significantly impacted by the 1 4 million spent on the company s restructuring and transformative initiative v20 which aims to improve its operational efficiency and optimize its manufacturing footprint in north america the company s current production is being reorganized from four north american plants to three more specialized plants that will be structured to better support the new business units market strategies the production of certain non project valves produced in north america as well as the less complex project valves are also being transferred to india restructuring and transformation costs include temporary project resources and their travel and lodging costs as well as the moving costs related to dismantling and transportation of machinery and equipment to reflect the optimized manufacturing footprint plan excluding this 1 4 million amount as well as the after tax impact of these restructuring and transformation costs incurred during the quarter the company would have presented net earnings 1 of 0 2 million compared to a net loss 1 of 0 2 million last year representing an improvement of 0 4 million in net loss 1 which is primarily attributable to lower administration costs partially offset by higher finance costs amounted to 0 8 million or 0 04 per share compared to 0 2 million or 0 01 per share last year net loss for the current quarter was significantly impacted by

earnings of 0 2 million compared to a net loss of 0 2 million last year representing an improvement of 0 4 million in net loss which is primarily attributable to lower administration costs partially offset by higher finance costs operating profit before restructuring and administration costs 2 amounted to 1 0 million compared to 0 2 million last year operating profit presents the profitability of a business before taking into account interest and taxes adjusted ebitda 2 amounted to 4 3 million or 0 20 per share compared to 3 4 million or 0 16 per share last year the increase in operating profit before restructuring and administration costs 2 and adjusted ebitda 2 is mainly attributable to lower administration costs and an improved gross profit percentage partially offset by a lower sales volume amounted to 1 0 million compared to 0 2 million last year operating profit presents the profitability of a business before taking into account interest and taxes adjusted ebitda amounted to 4 3 million or 0 20 per share compared to 3 4 million or 0 16 per share last year the increase in operating profit before restructuring and administration costs and adjusted ebitda is mainly attributable to lower administration costs and an improved gross profit percentage partially offset by a lower sales volume bookings amounted to 97 2 million a decrease of 3 6 million or 3 6 compared to last year this decrease is primarily attributable to lower order bookings by the company s italian operations which booked a record of large project orders in the prior year this decrease was partially offset by higher order bookings in the company s indian operations the company ended the period with net cash of 39 0 million an increase of 4 1 million or 11 7 since the beginning of the quarter this increase is primarily attributable to cash provided by operating activities partially offset by investments in property plant and equipment net cash was also negatively impacted by v20 related disbursements as well as the weakening of the euro spot rate against the u s dollar over the course of the current quarter first nine months fiscal 2020 unless otherwise noted all amounts are in u s dollars and all comparisons are to the first nine months of fiscal 2019 sales amounted to 258 0 million a decrease of 3 5 million or 1 3 from the prior year sales were negatively impacted by decreased shipments of certain large project orders in the company s north american and french operations due to various customer related issues and the timing of the delivery schedule for such orders partially offset by increased shipments from the company s italian operations which continued to deliver the record backlog at the beginning of the year the decrease of sales in the company s french operations is due to the timing of the deliveries of certain of its large project orders which have been delivered in part in this quarter and are expected to ship in the last quarter of this fiscal year gross profit percentage increased by 50 basis points from 22 8 to 23 3 this improvement is due to a higher sales volume and a stronger proportion of higher margin product sales in the company s italian operations partially offset by a lower sales volume and a less efficient product mix in the company s north american operations overall the company is still delivering its backlog built during the last fiscal year which means that the margins do not yet reflect the impact of the margin improvement measures launched in the last quarters under the company s v20 transformation plan the combined effect of these measures is expected to gradually take effect in the last quarter of this fiscal year and next year but the greater impact of the company s restructuring and transformative v20 initiatives is only expected late in fiscal year 2021 when the task of reorganizing and reducing the company s north american footprint is planned to be completed net loss 1 amounted to 5 3 million or 0 24 per share compared to 6 4 million or 0 30 per share last year net loss 1 for the current nine month period was significantly impacted by the 2 5 million spent on the company s restructuring and transformative initiative v20 restructuring and transformation costs include temporary project resources and their travel and lodging costs as well as the moving costs related to dismantling and transportation of machinery and equipment to reflect the optimized manufacturing footprint plan excluding this 2 5 million amount as well as the after tax impact of these restructuring and transformation costs incurred during the nine month period the company s net loss 1 would have been 3 5 million compared to 6 4 million last year representing an improvement of 2 9 million net loss 1 which is primarily attributable to lower administration costs and an improved gross margin despite the lower sales volume amounted to 5 3 million or 0 24 per share compared to 6 4 million or 0 30 per share last year net loss for the current nine month period was significantly impacted by the 2 5 million spent on the company s restructuring and transformative initiative v20 restructuring and

the optimized manufacturing footprint plan excluding this 2 5 million amount as well as the after tax impact of these restructuring and transformation costs incurred during the nine month period the company s net loss would have been 3 5 million compared to 6 4 million last year representing an improvement of 2 9 million net loss which is primarily attributable to lower administration costs and an improved gross margin despite the lower sales volume operating loss before restructuring and transformation costs 2 amounted to 3 3 million compared to 6 3 million last year adjusted ebitda 2 amounted to 6 2 million or 0 29 per share compared to 3 3 million or 0 15 per share last year the improvement in operating loss before restructuring and transformation costs 2 and adjusted ebitda 2 is primarily attributable to lowered administration and an increase in gross profit percentage amounted to 3 3 million compared to 6 3 million last year adjusted ebitda amounted to 6 2 million or 0 29 per share compared to 3 3 million or 0 15 per share last year the improvement in operating loss before restructuring and transformation costs and adjusted ebitda is primarily attributable to lowered administration and an increase in gross profit percentage bookings amounted to 252 1 million a decrease of 38 3 million or 13 2 compared to last year this decrease is due primarily to lower order bookings by the company s north american operations which had seen an unusually high surge of non project valve re stocking orders from its distributors in the first quarter of the prior fiscal year mro distributor orders this fiscal year are expected to reflect a more normalized stock replenishment cycle the decrease is also due to lower large project orders booked by the company s italian operations which booked a record of large project orders in the prior year the company s project quotation activity has notably increased this year in sectors where margins are healthy and concurrently decreased in other sectors where the company experiences the most aggressive competition and where margins are much tighter the shift is the result of deliberate screening that is expected to take effect gradually as the company replaces its existing backlog with higher margin orders the net decrease in bookings experienced in the last nine months which the company s plan aims to reverse must be understood in this context the company ended the period with a backlog of 432 1 million a decrease of 17 6 million or 3 9 since the beginning of the current fiscal year the decrease in backlog is primarily attributable to a lower book to bill ratio of 0 98 and the weakening of the euro spot rate against the u s dollar over the course of the current fiscal year administration costs amounted to 63 7 million a decrease of 2 5 million or 3 8 compared to last year the decrease in administration costs was achieved despite the recording of a 0 9 million provision regarding the settlement of a product claim that was filed against the company in a prior fiscal year as well as an increase in the costs recognized in connection with the company s ongoing asbestos litigation the fluctuation in asbestos costs for the period is due more to the timing of settlements in these two periods rather than to changes in long term trends the reduction in administration costs is mainly attributable to lower sales commissions as well as the higher freight charges that were incurred in the prior fiscal year in order to air freight a large delayed order the company ended the period with net cash of 39 0 million a decrease of 1 9 million or 4 6 since the beginning of the year this decrease which occurred mainly in the first half of the fiscal year is primarily attributable to investments in property plant and equipment land restoration costs related to a property long term debt and lease liabilities repayments as well as distributions to shareholders via dividends partially offset by cash provided by operating activities and an increase in long term debt net cash was also negatively impacted by v20 related disbursements as well as the weakening of the euro spot rate against the u s dollar over the course of the current year foreign currency impacts based on average exchange rates the euro weakened 5 1 against the u s dollar when compared to the same period last year this resulted in the company s net profits and bookings from its european subsidiaries being reported as lower u s dollar amounts in the current period based on average exchange rates the canadian dollar weakened 2 1 against the u s dollar when compared to the same period last year this resulted in the company s canadian dollar expenses being reported as lower u s dollar amounts in the current period the net impact of the above currency swings was generally unfavourable on the company s results during the third quarter we continued to see the gradual improvement of various operational ratios such as gross margin and sg a as a percent of sales our v20 transformation initiative costs are well underway and we are now disclosing these separately said john ball cfo of velan inc in spite of these costs we managed as a group to conserve cash during the quarter we also note that following the approval of our normal course issuer bid in october we recommenced the repurchase of our subordinate voting shares on the open market at market prices significantly below their net book value yves leduc ceo of velan inc said we have made good progress this quarter in carrying out our v20 strategy solidly on track with our planned schedule we were able to extend three labour agreements in montreal granby and williston following tough and prolonged negotiations as a result we are accelerating the consolidation and specialization of our north american plants with the cooperation of all employees bruno carbonaro our new president has quickly assumed leadership of the business units market plans and operations adding tremendous competence and guidance to our transformation effort our european subsidiaries particularly italy are having a very strong year while our indian plant is gradually expanding its production of non project valves currently being transferred from canada meanwhile our margins are improving in our north american operations thanks to a greater focus on costs and profitable project manufacturing opportunities our investments in erp and processes are bearing fruits for example through our new velan project management system now fully deployed our customers are benefitting from notable and sustained improvements in our delivery performance there is progress on many fronts but we need to bring all the key elements together to accelerate the company s return to profitable growth remembering that the most significant impact of the company s restructuring and transformative v20 initiatives is only expected late next fiscal

iran s missile attack on us army bases in iraq sent gold blasting above us1600 nz2400 an ounce boosted the japanese yen by almost 1 percent and oil by us3 a barrel photo afp but it took just hours for that safe haven dash to fade and for world equities to resume their climb it was the second volte face in under a week following a similar pattern of events after the us killing of top iranian commander qassem soleimani on friday and that mirrored a super fast roundtrip on markets after iran backed rebels attacked saudi oil facilities in september welcome to the brave new world where it appears that little short of full fledged world war between nuclear armed powers would be required to have a durable impact on financial markets and even then some begin to wonder by the european close on wednesday brent crude oil prices had returned back below levels seen before soleimani s death on friday and wall street s s p500 equity index rallied to new record highs at its most basic level investors appear to believe that tehran and washington will avert a broader conflagration regionally contained military blowups and bursts of conflict have proven in recent years not to have a durable impact on either oil supplies and prices nor global economic activity even september s attacks on saudi oil installations had no lasting effect on crude prices and beyond the gulf years of north korean nuclear tests and missile launches have not yet escalated nor affected international investment patterns for any significant length of time so traders and investors are betting as much on repeated patterns of behaviour rather than on amateur geopolitical reasoning the market has taken a view based on a decade s worth of experience that this is not going to escalate out of control said societe generale strategist kit juckes it s the same with the economy we ve had an economic cycle with mini cycles since 2008 but no recession we ve had trade wars that haven t really turned into real trade wars but keep getting postponed and investors who stuck with equities and looked past euro debt crises north korean missile tests arab spring revolts trade wars middle east turmoil and unconventional economic policies have reaped rich returns world stocks have added more than us25 trillion in value since 2010 a geopolitical risk index compiled by u s federal reserve board researchers dario caldara and matteo iacoviello rates the saudi attacks at a relatively high 185 points but well below the 2003 us invasion of iraq that scored 545 points oil clout for decades the energy price impact has been the main transmission mechanism from major conflicts particularly in the gulf to the wider economy and world markets the threat of oil supply disruption has been a shadow on the global economy ever since a quadrupling of oil prices during the 1973 opec oil embargo and a 30 percent jump in 1990 but oil spikes these days tend to be briefer that partly reflects the changing nature of energy usage and geographical sources of supplies u s shale oil producers can now step up to offset price spikes stemming from gulf supply disruptions regardless of local politics or opec action while the rise of renewable energy sources amid fears of climate change is happening at a rapid pace paul donovan of ubs wealth notes that technology developments mean far less oil is needed to produce a dollar of global gdp today donovan also highlighted that back in 1973 energy producing countries squirrelled away extra oil earnings as savings causing a net shock to global economic demand as that money drained from oil buyers pockets in 2020 oil sellers spend that money with abandon and so a higher oil price does not mean a big drop or potentially any sort of drop in economic demand learning from the past of course wars and invasions have driven big market shifts in the past causing mini panics and safe asset buying on fears for business confidence trade and energy prices but the experience over recent decades has been that all things equal markets tend to recover quickly and portfolio managers with the stomach to see through short term lurches do well even without expensive hedging a recent schroders report identified the 1990 gulf war the 2001 9 11 attacks on new york and the 2003 iraq invasion as the most monumental geopolitical risk events of the past 30 years in 2003 yields on german government bonds among the world s most trustworthy assets tumbled almost 70 basis points between march and june they fell a similar amount in 1990 when you look at the last few decades of history whenever a prolonged war is the more likely outcome that s when the rush to government bonds takes place said rabbani wahhab senior portfolio manager at london and capital schroders noted that during periods of extreme risk a portfolio of safe assets comprising bonds and gold usually outperformed riskier equities however it also found that in all these instances shares recovered within months suggesting that if investors are willing or able to ignore volatility then investing in the risky portfolio represents a better strategy than a safe portfolio all change in markets the market context itself has also changed over the decades most prominently by years of near zero interest rates and central bank money printing that have inflated prices of high quality bonds reduced benchmark borrowing costs and cut what s available to investors shares meanwhile have been pumped up by buybacks and abundant private funding that have steadily reduced equity supply over the years with jpmorgan predicting equity supply to decline by a further 200 billion this year many investors have come to view selloffs as a buying opportunity the demand supply nature of markets has completely changed said salman ahmed chief investment strategist at lombard odier central banks have reduced the supply of safe assets and that s rippled out to risky assets it s a very powerful force reuters
the 2020 democratic policy platforms could be the most progressive in the party s history democrats have gone through a massive ideological shift just since 2016 previously fringe ideas like the 15 minimum wage which bernie sanders forced onto the scene four years ago have become part of nearly every candidate s platform other once verboten topics like single payer health care and a carbon free economy have gotten serious consideration and reshaped the national discourse but on the question of raising taxes and for whom most democratic candidates have hedged toward an all too familiar position like hillary clinton in 2016 and barack obama in 2012 they ve asserted their opposition to tax increases on anyone but the very rich even if those tax hikes are offset by household savings on priorities like child care health care and college education joe biden and pete buttigieg for example have attacked medicare for all by saying it will raise middle class taxes progressive stalwart elizabeth warren countered with a gimmick in her medicare for all financing plan that she claims consistently and repeatedly will fix our health care system without increasing middle class taxes one penny tom steyer cory booker and michael bennet have gone further making big low and middle income tax cuts a centerpiece of their agendas a no new middle class taxes pledge may help fend off misleading questions from reporters and disingenuous attacks from primary opponents but it is seriously misguided middle class taxes are a necessary and desirable part of a comprehensive progressive policy framework that benefits low and middle income people most when redistributed through universal programs like medicare for all or free child care free college paid family leave etc broad taxes provide stable funding and a sizable return on investment democratic presidential candidates should make the case for middle class taxes not run from them we need them to pay for the things we want government to do here is a basic fact the united states is a low tax country in 2018 the most recent year for which data is available the united states ranked fourth lowest in the organization for economic cooperation and development a consortium of 36 economically developed countries in terms of tax revenue collected as a percentage of the economy behind nations like germany israel latvia and canada the gap between u s and average oecd revenue has widened over time from 1 3 percentage points of gross domestic product in 1965 to 10 percentage points more recently that s nearly 2 trillion per year in forgone revenue from lower tax rates tax cuts from both parties have driven this decline of the 12 significant pieces of federal tax legislation enacted between 1997 and 2013 11 of them reduced revenue president donald trump s recent tax cut for the rich promises to exacerbate the problem but the decadeslong assault on taxation has not been confined to high earners in 1979 the year before ronald reagan was elected president the average household in the middle quintile of the income distribution paid 19 1 of its income in federal taxes according to data from the congressional budget office by 2016 that rate had dropped 5 2 percentage points more than a quarter to 13 9 the story is similar for the second and fourth quintiles which saw their rates decline by 5 6 and 3 8 percentage points respectively over the same period these cuts reflect an ill advised political bargain in 2016 middle quintile families paid 3 800 less in taxes than they would have at 1979 rates modest savings compared with the cost of health care child care college education and numerous other public goods and services that have gone underfunded as a result of our low tax low investment economy low middle class taxes in the u s stand in stark contrast to the approach in other developed countries which raise more revenue from the middle class through some combination of taxes on goods and services payroll taxes and income taxes these taxes fund key benefits including universal health care generous paid time off and significantly more affordable college tuition more cheaply and efficiently than is possible through private markets of course middle class tax increases are not the only means of providing these public goods trillions of dollars can be raised through various taxes on the rich that warren has joined sanders in championing redirecting much of our wasteful military spending to more productive uses is another valuable approach and funding public investments with government debt which modern monetary theory s adherents recommend is a far better approach than requiring every program to have a designated payfor the government is uniquely positioned to borrow money and we shouldn t let unsubstantiated theoretical concerns about debt levels prevent us from addressing the concrete and urgent needs of today but even with these options writing off middle class tax increases is a mistake for one thing raising revenue is not the sole purpose of taxing the extremely wealthy another goal is to make them not so extremely wealthy anymore relying primarily on taxes on accumulated wealth and top incomes to fund government spending would mean that if these policies succeed in reducing inequality they would also shrink revenue and constrain public investment over time running deficits though not cause for alarm and sometimes prudent can also carry a real cost in 2019 net interest payments to service our national debt approached 9 of the federal budget and 60 of nondefense discretionary spending for a total of 400 billion on our current path that figure is expected to reach 3 of gdp by 2029 eating up a larger and larger share of the budget the most sustainable approach would be to raise revenue roughly in line with our spending needs even if we want to simply maintain the policy status quo those needs will still grow because of an aging population and decades of neglected infrastructure at the national state and local levels policies to guarantee health care combat climate change and dramatically reduce poverty which the public strongly supports would require even more revenue getting at least some of it from middle class taxes is good policy it s also far from the political nonstarter many think research by brookings institution tax expert vanessa s williamson shows that americans are less tax averse than most democratic candidates seem to believe about half of state level ballot initiatives seeking to increase taxes have passed in the past decade up from 20 in the 1970s and 1980s these measures not only targeted tax hikes on the rich they often enacted sales taxes and other policies that pull substantially from the middle class a year ago for example california voted to protect a 12 cent per gallon gas tax hike that is projected to raise 5 billion in annual infrastructure spending and victories have not been confined to states with democratic majorities arizona and south dakota raised cigarette taxes in 2006 and north dakota defended its property taxes from repeal in 2012 preserving more than 1 billion in state revenue so while tax increases may not be a political slam dunk they re definitely viable voters are sophisticated enough to understand the simple clear explanation sanders has given when discussing medicare for all when you pay 100 extra in taxes but save 500 in health care costs you come out 400 ahead social security and medicare are funded by broad taxes and both are routinely ranked among our most popular programs a recent proposal to use middle class taxes to fund paid family leave is receiving similarly positive reactions if new middle class taxes are part of a package that provides a clear public benefit the american people will probably support them for too long the democratic party has failed to fight for broad based progressive taxation in response republicans have only intensified their anti tax fury decades of shrinking budgets underfunded priorities and distrust in government have been the predictable results it s long past time to reverse this trend by
